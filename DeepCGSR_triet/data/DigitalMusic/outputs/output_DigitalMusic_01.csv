,B000WOT9K6,1,1,4,This song you can or cannot dance to and okay. It is a sing along song. Or you can hum it.
,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,"This is exactly the type of song I expected from Tom Petty. A very unique style  but, one that I really like."
,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,Chartering a Cat in the BVI and wanted to develop a play list with tunes that have words we can understand and that take us back to our Youth (or is it back to middle-age - all 4 couples are 70+). Now I just have to figure out how to create a play-list and down-load it into my Sansa Fuse MP3 player.
,B000WOUTKA,1,1,4,The iconic Tom Petty song.
,B000WOUTKA,-1,-1,3,not sure why I pay for each song
,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,Great!

,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,Great
,B000WOUTKA,1,1,4,this is one of my favorite songs of the past few decades. I was happy to get it into my Amazon library
,B000WOUTKA,-1,1,4,had to but it

,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,very cool song..
,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,Good memories!
,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,My daughter first heard this on the movie BARNYARD.  I finally got her to listen to Tom Petty! Now it's her anthem.
,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,"Great song love this remake, one of my favorite song put it on all my play list.
A must have."
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,Love this song I was glad to have found it at such a great price. Clear sound and instant delivery
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,This song was an easy download.  The cloud player/downloader makes it very easy to purchase Mp3 songs from Amazon.  I also love the deals that are available via the music store.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,"...to the house parties of the 70s and 80s. Slow music, slow dancing, red light in the basement, a fine dude kissing your neck....sorry...I got carried away. If you want to remember those good ol' times, buy this song."
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,great band love their music
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,Like!!
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,Great track!!
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,This is a good song from this group.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,LOVE IT!
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,One of the best song's of the 80's I miss this group. Real music back then.
,B000WOWPZM,1,-1,3,"The quality of the song is a little crackly. I heard this song on the radio the other night, and I wanted to have it on my MP3 player. It is a good song. If you find a version with a better quality, go for that version instead."
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,"Have you ever just been driving in your car and you hear those first few notes and all of a sudden you are overcome with emotion.  You begin driving with one hand, the other is now a microphone or a very vivid gesturer of your feelings.  Your voice begins without you realizing, singing along with all of the memories of past best friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, and imaginary friends swimming in front of your eyes.  Then you realize that you are crying as you sing at the loudest your emotion allows. Two hands on the wheel now, clinging while you say whoa-oa-oa. Then your hand returns, holding up a hush finger to your memory, ""Don't speak!"" you wail.  The words all come to you and for about five minutes you are overcome.  Wherever you are, red light, freeway, parking lot, side streets, or waiting for the song to end before you leave your car because you are at your destination, you sing.
This song deserves more than just that karaoke rendition in your car. It deserves to be heard more.  It deserves to be owned.
Buy this song.  Sing this song."
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,4,I remember hearing this song when I was in college.  I had to download it for my Ipod just for old times sake.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,"See this is considered GOOD MUSIC. This song has a positive vibe about it, that will make you feel good whatever you are going through."
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,"What can I say about this Excellent Group that would do them justice other than how GREAT they are.  I have loved this group from the first time I heard him until this day!  They are a family that has some of the greatest voices in the music bussiness.  Their harmonies will make you sing along with them and if you love music like I do you'll be singing their tunes in your head too.

My whole family loves this group and one of its members brothers gave my sister a kiss on the cheek when she got her album autographed.  They were very nice and continue to this day to make fabulous music.  I miss them creating new sounds although some of them still perform like El Debarg one of the brothers.  If you and your special sweetie want to hear some mellow danceable jams, Get This One!"
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,Love finding classic songs that take me back to my childhood and remind me of family car trips and vacations.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,This song is a good one. This is the song you would love to sing and hum. And you can listen to this song.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,I remember when this song came out in the 80's . Oh my word this  song  bring back a lot of good memories. And tells you how a man should make a woman feel.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,I certainly enjoyed this item.  I would definitely recommend it to any and everyone who is interested in this item!
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,Awesome song
,B000WOWPZM,-1,1,5,okay
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,FABULOUS FEMALE ARTIST AND ARRANGEMENT
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,4,Liked it
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,A great song.
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,4,classic
,B000WOWPZM,-1,1,4,Why would anybody dump this woman?
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,Great song.
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,Love it
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,Fell in love with this song when I heard the Spanish guitar playing in it. And who can't relate to this song as we have all been broken hearted at least once in our life by someone. Never get tired of this song.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,Great classic song with a good beat.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,"There are the songs that really made the the 60's and 70's and this is one of them. This is not a one hot wonder band, listen and you will find most of their songs are what your parents and older siblings were listening to. Thats how I first was introduced to these vibes, from my older brothers. Not my generation but it's good for the soul"
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,4,Great band
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,here we go again. My band. Man these guys really know how to harmonize.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,Love
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,"Roots rock song from the 1950s - great lyrics - True as still today, as then."
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,Great song from back in the day.  Lot's of humor in the song and very original. Love to listen to this t ok brighten up my mood.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,Sounds just like it did when it was famous.  Love the group and this song is a favorite. I recommend it.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,4,"Good music: good song good artist. Hope this music flows down to the next generation of artists at some point...I'm a little worried at the direction the music is going, but we always got these classics to listen to"
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,4,"While trying for many years to upgrade my music system to include songs that were important to me, I found this song done by Three Dog Night that I enjoyed very much when it first came out. I decided that I should buy this song and include it my system, and am very glad that I did."
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,I grew up with classic rock that my Dad introduced me to.  He made sure that I knew what good music was no matter what the genre!
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,3 dog night was a staple rock band. The very idea of anyone reviewing songs from the 70's without mentioning them is wrong in every way. Mama Told Me is the center of their rocking.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,"I rate this band a 5 star because they sound great. Yes, its an older band but still sound just as good listeing to them now as they did back then. A must hear kind of song."
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,I already owned Three Dog Night's Joy To The World Greatest Hits collection -- and this song was not included.  A great single purchase finish the 3DK collection.
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,I bought this tune just as a trip down memory lane and it did send me back to the 70s. It is a somewhat cheesy tune with vocal with lots of affectation which has some comic value. The recording doesn't really hold up and needs to be remastered. But if like me you need a brief escape to the70s this might do the trick.
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,These songs helped us get through the difficult times cause it spoke about the feelings we had that we could not put into words..
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,Three dog night is an awesome group. I love their songs and this one is a great song.
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,Great
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,This is classic music and I love this group and this song particularly. I listen to this all the time in my Ipod
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,I grew up with classic rock that my Dad introduced me to.  He made sure that I knew what good music was no matter what the genre!
,B000WQ6XK8,1,-1,3,...the best songs Three Dog Night did.  But it's okay.  Downloaded it because it brought back memories of losing my first real love...
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,I bought this song as a gift for my dad although I myself have been listening to it very often.
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,"Sounds great, downloaded without errors and meets expectations.  Amazon offers a great selection of music and they're are my preferred download site."
,B000WQNGCG,1,1,5,Good song
,B000WQNGCG,1,1,5,love the song
,B000WQNGCG,1,1,5,"This song has such a good beat.  If you love 90s music, this song will fit right in to your playlist."
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,music is great
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,"I gave this five stars for my Wife. I bought this version for her. She loves it. Me, I love the Aerosmith version. I'm not too crazy about this one. To me it's a little slower timing than the original. But speaking for my Wife, It's the greatest."
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,Love their music
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,Good song
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,Great Stuff
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,Man this base really quakes things. I live in a major city NY and always thought this music was like having a party loud enough to keep down the noise of the subway tracks out the window.
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,"Aerosmith and RUN-DMC duo great for any music collection, really sets it back to good times with the family and in laws."
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,How can you not listen to this song & not love it??? It's just a fun song that everyone can listen to and enjoy themselves
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,"I remember when this song came out, and I was only in middle school back in the 80s. The song and it's beat stands the test of time."
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,"You want to talk about when Rock and Roll and Rap first combined; this has to be the first song you think about. Forget all that Limp Bizkrap stuff.  This was truly the best blending of two different genera's, ASIDE from Symphony and Metallica."
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,It was just what I was looking for. I love Run DMC and absolutely love Aerosmith so this was great.
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,4,"...of his classic song ""Layla"".  It's pretty good.  Worth adding to any Eric Clapton and Cream collection.  Well, with Eric Clapton, there was what? six or seven different bands?  Blind Faith, etc, etc..."
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,"This song was great when it came out in the 70's but the unplugged version is just as great. It's the same song but each version is unique. Eric is a very talented song writer, singer & accomplish quitar player. Eric is the man....If you do not know who Eric Clapton is I suggest you get on board & buy his records. Even his older stuff as well. There are no words that can express the great talent of this musician. Plugged or Unplugged."
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,hes still got it!
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,Who doesn't love Eric Clapton?  I love Amazon Prime!
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,Great Music!
,B000WSWEOA,-1,-1,2,"Too slow, I didn't like it."
,B000WSWEOA,-1,1,4,I didn't realize that there were various versions of the song. This one is not the one on You Tube but is close and doesn't have the instrumental for the second half.
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,love this song
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,Slowhand magic!
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,4,"This is the greatest, other version, of the Layla song.  Unplugged shows the great guitar work that Eric is capable of and this one is acoustic!"
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,This is great and timeless music that triggers some great memories. This is the sound from the past that still has appeal and invariably provokes an attempt to sing along.
,B000WSWEOA,-1,1,4,I'm a lover of this type of music. I get the MP3 downloads which hasn't been the best with Amazon's Downloading device this past 4 months which is why I knocked a star off.
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,"Very hot and sultry version of Clapton's classic Layla.  LOVE it!  Even if you have the plugged version, you should have this one, too!"
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,"Layla is my all time favorite song, sung and played by my all time favorite artist and this version, a live recording, is very, very nice, indeed!  There is nobody like Clapton, simply an original!"
,B000WSWEOA,1,1,5,"Layle, one of the best songs made. Eric Clapton really had something here when he did Layle. A must havve"
,B000WSWEOA,-1,1,4,This is a great song from my teen-age years that provides a little different version from the usual Derek and the Dominos version.  It would be nice if this version eliminated the introductive talking portion.
,B000WSV1AS,-1,1,4,"Great song, beautiful tune, and the lyrics caused me 2 do some research. There was a radio station in the South that was allegedly either bombed or burned down for playing this song!  Janis had the insight to write this song at age 13!  I would give this song 5 stars except that the girl cops out at the end. However, the song played in 1965 or 1967, so the taboo of the times still has to be considered.  For the most part,  society's children are still ""sticking to their own kind"", and though  unspoken and a bit weaker, the social dating rules still exist."
,B000WSV1AS,1,1,5,Brings back memories & social commentary about prejudice in the 1970's. Her voice was soft and the lyrics meaningful and touching.
,B000WSV1AS,1,1,5,This a classic!  I haven't heard it in years and was so happy to find it available to download on my MP3!
,B000WSV1AS,-1,1,5,"This song wouldn't be a big deal today (well, maybe I am wrong); back then it really ticked some people off.  I like the words and the sound.  I guess it was an early protest song."
,B000WT5CAW,1,1,5,"My granddaddy would always sing this to me when I was growing up, and there are many versions done by many different artists, but I love Johnny Cash, so I went with his version.  Love this song.. it is very sweet, and brings back a lot of memories for me!"
,B000WT5CAW,-1,1,5,I'm not quite sure what I am supposed to say. I downloaded the song and it is what it is.
,B000WT5CAW,1,1,5,"This song was a part of my childhood - I remember my mother singing it to me.  Hearing Johnny Cash sing it without a lot of ""bells and whistles"" is a pleasure.  I am so pleased to have it in my music collection."
,B000WT5CAW,1,1,5,"You Are My Sunshine by Johnny Cash.  This is by far one of my most favorite country music songs ever.

This is just one of those songs that I had to have in my library of songs. I like a variety of music depending on what I feel like listening to and when. This is just one of those songs that had to be added to my collection."
,B000WT5CAW,1,1,5,"The Johnny Cash version of ""You Are My Sunshine"" is the BEST!!!!"
,B000WT5CAW,-1,1,4,Its okay but I like other things by Johnny Cash better
,B000WT5CAW,1,1,5,so soulful
,B000WT62UQ,1,-1,3,Played during Monday nights The Black List.  Fit perfectly with the storyline thought it would be nice to hear the hole song.
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,"Downloading went great as usual with Amazon music.  If you only want a particular song this is the way to go.  I still $1.25 per song is too high, but that's what the public is paying"
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,always wanted this tune.........was happy to find it. i was not aware amazon mp3 would have it. it's nice to know you can find music.
,B000WT5JAU,1,1,5,"A very classic hard rock song that just gets better with age. A great rock and roll anthem song that makes you feel good, so crank it up."
,B000WT62UQ,-1,1,5,A
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,great song
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,my Johnny..man in black
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,great song
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,Great song by a legendary singer.
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,4,Good song.
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,one of my favorites
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,"A  heart-felt, soul-searching swan song from one of the best ever. I miss the man in black, and songs like this are the reason."
,B000WT62UQ,-1,1,5,A++
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,Love it  !!!!!!!
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,"This song is great. I have always enjoyed Johnny, He is a man of the people. He's had a hard life and you can hear it in his songs. I love this song and the price was great."
,B000WT62UQ,1,1,5,He never lets you down. He can just make you think of the words as he sings. Great music and a great song.
,B000WTUV7Q,1,1,5,"""One Day at a Time"" is one of my favorite classic country songs because Ms. Lane has such a lovely voice that is both relaxing and inspirational. This is a very unique song because it has an extremely powerful message that everyone will enjoy. It's also a unique song about religion and Jesus' comfort and support which is one of the only songs of its kind to become a crossover top-10 pop hit. I especially enjoy how Ms. Lane picks up her pitch as she sings the chorus. Although the song is almost 30 years old, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys country, pop or inspirational music."
,B000WTUV7Q,1,1,5,great
,B000WTUV7Q,1,1,5,"One Day At A Time by Cristy Lane is a True classic! Such a True and inspiring song! This song is the perfect prayer in song form that is so beautifully done and all inspiring to me (one who needs to focus on TODAY, not next week or next month etc). This song I play often as it keeps me focused on today. In fact the song has helped me so much, I went to lyricstime.com and downloaded the words to this song. This song I have now in my special playlist and play it often.

Highly recommend this song!"
,B000WTUV7Q,1,1,5,I enjoy the heartfelt rendition of this beautiful song.  This has always been one of my all time favorites.  The lyrics really touch my heart.
,B000WTUV7Q,1,1,5,This song was purchased to add to my collection and it was what I expected. The cost was great and will be used..
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,"This is a very nice song. The melody and how every thing comes together was done very well. Nelly's voice is crystal clear. This song should have been longer with some sort of instrumental solo in the middle and at the end fading away slowly in conjunction with the other instruments. None the less I like this type of song from Nelly. I've been a fan off Nelly since she started in the late 90's. I was in high school and normally listened to rock music like Guns N' Roses, Metalica, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd etc. I hated when she changed to more ""dirty"" type music. But she had to grow up and wish she would make more of this types of songs. This is more classy Nelly and I like a well orchestrate song with melodies. U need to listen very carefully to the song with your headphones to appreciate not just the lyrics, but the instruments and how they were tied together. GOOD MUSIC!"
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,yes
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,4,Good song!
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,THIS SONG IS AWESOME!!!!
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,Love it.
,B000WTUYM8,-1,1,5,Nelly Furtado's range in music is so under-appreciated.  love her.
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,I am not necessarily a Nelly Furtado fan but this song rocks! I am also very pleased with Amazon's music downloads.....no more iTunes!
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,4,"I just like it for the usual reason(s) ... good beat, nice voice, catchy meanings ... cool to listen to ... MoonBee"
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,I am a big fan of this song and it's a great club song. I really like it a lot
,B000WTUYM8,1,-1,3,"Nelly has an extremely great voice.  This song is probably one of her best.  I have not heard too much about her, but she should sing more of these types of songs.  I heard Promiscuous and it was cute, but I wouldn't buy it though."
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,I like listening to this on my new Monster Clarity with Bluetooth from my Droid Razr Maxx. I just crank it up!
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,This is a song that makes you want to get up and dance. It's a feel good song! I love this song.
,B000WTUYM8,1,1,5,Awesome music for a reasonable price without buying the whole album... what else can I say. Something to say about the digital age.
,B000WTWXYK,1,1,5,Don't Stand So Close to Me by The Police is one of my favorite songs. I was very pleased to make this purchase.
,B000WTWXYK,1,1,4,"You don't have to.....Put on that Red Dress
The Police are great  - You just can't beat the feeling of getting up and moving
Puts me in a good mood.
I like that I don't have to wait to listen to any music that I want."
,B000WXOAEC,1,1,5,I love this song. I fell over laughing the first time I heard it. And the video is awesome as well!
,B000WXOAEC,1,1,5,I think this is the first song I ever heard by Luke Bryan and it's still as funny now as it was then. It's also extremely catchy and it gets stuck in your head rather easily. Easily one of my favorite Luke Bryan songs and I definitely recommend checking out the music video as well.
,B000WXOAEC,1,1,5,Excellent
,B000WXOAEC,1,1,5,"Luke Bryan does an awesome job on this country music song, he has some great music out also, thank you amazon!"
,B000WXOAEC,1,1,5,This product was exactly as promised and met my needs as soon as I received it.  The product works flawlessly!
,B000WXOAEC,1,1,5,True lyrics I am sure. fun song to sing to and listen to. love Luke Bryan and his music and would recommend him and his songs
,B000WXQ5JU,1,1,5,This song is great to sing to and makes you want to dance and jump around!
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,I downloaded this song because I have 2 daughters who love to dance with me.  It is a favorite song for dancing to.
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,"love, love, love this song."
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Beautiful song. Like good solid Christian music.
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,I love this song. I have 2 granddaughters who just had their dance recital. I made a smilebox (photo slideshow to send to the girls) and played this song . My granddaughters loved it. It was perfect!
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Great
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Love this song!!!
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Great song
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,This song makes me cry...every...time.....and it makes me want to send my husband and daughter out for more bonding time. Great song about how important a daddy is to his little girl and the time just speeds by so quickly that you have to make every moment count.
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Beautiful.  Love this song.
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Nicely done!
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,I have regrets for the way my relationship with my daughter has played out in the past. Listening to the message in this song gives me hope that one day there will be some healing between us...
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,"This song is so powerful!  Enjoy every moment with your kids, they grow up way too fast!"
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,"It is a very beautiful song , It tells a story from the begging of a daughters life all the way to when they grow up and get married."
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Great
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Nice song. As a DJ have used it at several weddings for father daughter dance.
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,love it
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,LOVE this song!!! Steven Curtis Chapman has another hit!!!
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,Beautiful song. Tender...
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,4,"Well ok, i have 3 daughters......none are hard workers.....but they're still my little cinderella's......and this song speaks of a dad and his daughter growing up to meet her prince."
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,I did a video to honor my wife's father at his passing.  He gave away 5 daughters and I used this song for that portion of the video.
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,"Love this song!  When ever I heard it on the radio, I always thought I should buy it.  Finally did - and love it!"
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,"My little girl begged me to download this bittersweet song. She's hopelessly devoted to her daddy, who has to be gone for long periods of time due to his job. This is a lovely reminder to make the most of the time with your loved ones because it will be past us in a blink of an eye."
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,This sone will remind us how precious our children are and that we should stop to take time with them.
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,"Beautiful, poignant song.  Such a sweet message of a father's love for a daughter.  Would be a perfect father/daughter dance song for a wedding."
,B000WY7WLY,1,1,5,"I first heard this song when a father sang it to his daughter.  I loved it, and immediately bought the song.  Quite a wonderful song, even if you are a girl!  Just a note: if a person needs a song for a father/daughter to dance at a daughter's wedding, this is the perfect song!  Enjoy!"
,B000WYD8R6,1,1,5,"Love this song. Everythime I listen to it, it encourages me.
 What I don't like is Amazon needing to have you write a certain amount of words to say this. They need to take a hint from Ebay when it comes to this part"
,B000WY9COY,1,1,5,The words are beautiful and set to a even more beautiful tune (Findlandia)  I would like for everyone to have access to this beauty.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"This is a great song, and I love the version that Gary Jules has recorded!"
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,4,"Need to cry your eyes out? Listen to this song while reading the news. It's a bad, sad, mad world. I was astounded to learn that this was a cover, and who did it originally... this, this seems so much more fitting."
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,4,Kind of forgot this song until it was featured on Sense8.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,love it
,B000WZWW7M,-1,1,5,Speaks volumes.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Great quality
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Loved!
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Love it!!!
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Love this song!  Such a great rendition!
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,this is an instant classic
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Thank you.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Love this haunting music
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,great version of a great composition
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,I just love this song.
,B000WZWW7M,-1,1,5,"I first heard this on a YouTube video for Final Fastasy The Spirits Within, except...it was never in that movie or soundtrack.  Run I heard it on a FF VII video, except was not in that either.  Tracked it down to Tears For Fears, years ago, remake by Jules and used n Donny Darko movie.  My wofe says it's dark,Mi just think it is a solid A, moving, touching, mindful, haunting."
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Love the song. Had the song on my ipod player  but gave it to my son at college.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Love it.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Totally forgot about this piece and how nice it was.  Was reminded in watching a re-run of CSI: Las Vegas.  Had a very nice re-introduction.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"Depressingly satisfying, yet.........depressing. Definitely five stars! Thank you, that is all."
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,First heard this on Gears of War. Great song.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"I love this very dark tune, and I'm not sure why."
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,great song
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Great Song!!
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,4,Exactly what I was looking for. I found this song because of a book but it was just what I would want to hear again and again.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Good !
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,4,Very good song.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Satisfied
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"You can't know ""Donnie Darko"" without knowing this version of the song ""Mad World"" by Gary Jules.  I think I bought it once before but couldn't find it in my I-tunes so I bought it again."
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,I have always loved this version of this song.  He sounds like he may have just flipped his goulash and is locked up in a padded room while wearing a straight jacket.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"This is a beautiful piece - but definitely not for everyone. The music is haunting but the message is pathos, grief and depression. To quote a Blues great; ""If you have to ask, don't mess with it."""
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Heard this song and just I fell in love with it. I would definitely recommend this song to a friend.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"great song
great price
hard to find
now on mp3
great item that was on charts at its prime and still is good today"
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"I love this version of Mad World.  It is such a haunting melody and the words are simply poetic.  Also, check out their video on You Tube if you get a chance...also well done!"
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"While I liked this song back when ""Tears for Fears"" did it, the tempo was too upbeat for the song.  I absolutely love what Gary Jules did with the song.  It is so heartfelt, you can almost feel his pain.  LOVE IT!!"
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,This song brings on the memories and feelings of an earlier time. His and the bands history speak for themselves.
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,Love this song; I had completely forgotten that it was a remake of a Tears for Fears song from back in the 80's.  I like this version way better!
,B000WZWW7M,1,1,5,"Great music - both moving and memorable. Forget the original synth-pop version by Tears for Fears. This song, in this form, reminds me of Michael Stipe's best songs. The sound quality of the single I downloaded was perfect."
,B000X0ESSC,1,1,5,Ebla is a really great song. It gets me pumped up and excited. The only thing I can say is beware because it's quite long :)
,B000X06GHI,1,1,5,"I love, love, love this tune.  Whenever I recorded Cold Case, I would keep rewinding the beginning, just to hear the opening theme tune over and over.  I had no idea where this tune came from, and was in a roundabout way lead to it through Pandora.  I am so glad I found it and am able to listen to it whenever I want to now.  On a side note, I wish Cold Case had not gotten cancelled when it did.  It was one of my favorite shows to watch, theme tune aside."
,B000X06GHI,1,1,5,Glad to be able to get this song! And I love that it is available through cloud to put on any device.
,B000X06GHI,1,1,5,I absolutely adore this song! I plan on buying more of their music. Keep it coming! I am always looking for new music at Amazon.com. You have never let me down! Thanks.
,B000X0ER60,1,1,5,It's a wonderful cd! The music is just beautiful! I often listen to it when I am studying or just relaxing!
,B000X1HU68,-1,-1,1,"This album is horrid.  When we have lyrics like ""life can be just like a game boy, full of frustration and joy, pressing A or B make a choice....Game over game over..."". Yeah no kidding GAME OVER. That portly written song also has the best opening riff sadly.  Once again the songs are so poorly written is ruins the whole thing and not a decent riff here or there can save this."
,B000X1HU68,1,1,5,"it is hard to believe that Anvil has been around for 30 plus years and still has the cojones to rock. I first heard this band in 1999 when I purchased their album ""Plugged In Permanent"" on Metal Blade/Hypnotic Records. 11 years later, I am listening to ""This Is Thirteen"" on VH1 Classic Records. evidently, Anvil is more concerned about having fun than making money. also, they have had basically the same image on their albums with the exception of one album. it should also be noted that they are obsessed with the number 3, as all their albums have 3 word titles. Anvil is a quirky and underrated band and they are a classic band as well."
,B000X1HU68,1,1,4,"I am an Anvil fan from the early 80's and as many Anvil fans from back then I always wondered why they never really made it big.  Metal On Metal, Hard 'N' Heavy..... I mean come on.  Both of those tapes were consistently plugged into my car's deck back then.  I have since been able to obtain that early Anvil stuff on CD and I still love it.

So I picked this new one up partly because that documentary The Story of Anvil was awesome!  And I have to say I am impressed with Thirteen as well.  I agree with everything Lips was pitching when they were shopping this record around in the movie, it is great stuff.  The CD cover is blah, but the music is what matters.  I am not going to be overly critical of the music like some people have been because bottom line this is rock 'n roll, it has passion, and some great riffing, and it is Anvil and they are BACK.  I love it.  I actually think a few of these songs are some of the best Anvil has ever done.  Let's stay in the game now guys."
,B000X1HU68,1,1,5,"Anvil's newest release ""This is Thirteen"" is another great album, from a horribly underrated band. Highlights included the title track, Bomb's Away, American Refugee, & Thumb Hang, just to name a few. Overall really solid album, great playing from the whole band, diffently worth the purchase."
,B000X1HU68,1,1,5,"any band lasting 25 years with virtually no support and independent labels gets 2 thumbs up in my book. everyone needs to watch the movie ANVIL-THE STORY OF ANVIL and every fan of MEGADETH,METALLICA, ANTHRAX,AND SLAYER needs to listen to this cd."
,B000X6PYVG,1,1,5,"I love this song, it reminds me that God is in control. I would definitely recommend this song to others."
,B000X6PYVG,1,1,5,"Again, dittos as above. I hope they keep making this good music. I play it on LOUD. All the singers have made some beautiful, soul-savings music."
,B000X6PYVG,1,1,5,"this is a great song, and the first time i heard it i knew i had to get it!"
,B000X6NXZ0,1,1,4,I purchased this to add to my IPOD collections so I can listen while napping before a long day at work.
,B000X6NXZ0,1,1,4,"Love the amazon music downloads for my MP3 player it is easy and great music sound, price is great also."
,B000X6NXZ0,-1,1,5,Heard my brother play this song and really liked it. The lyrics caught my ear. plus any song stated sorry has to be good
,B000X6NXZ0,1,1,4,"This song pretty much rules rock radio right now. Which is kind of sad, because if this is the best they have, they're in trouble. The song itself doesn't break any ground, and while its melody and overall musical structure may be fine, albeit a little radio-friendly, I think what really draws people into the song is the vocals. They're kind of different, and they grab your attention. They're not stunning in the least bit, but it's different. And some might consider the song a nice change. However, wiser heads would look at the song and say, yeah, it's alright.

Overall, the song doesn't break much ground, and seems in the mold of a thousand before. However, the vocals grab you, and pull you into the song. In the end, Buckcherry may be a one-hit wonder. But then again, the song could just be a stepping stone for us to see what the group is really made of."
,B000X6NXZ0,1,1,5,A good song from Buckcherry
,B000X6NXZ0,-1,1,4,it is ok as a story
,B000X6NXZ0,-1,1,5,It was okay but I've heard better from Buckcherry
,B000X6NXZ0,1,1,5,I really like this song. The sound quality is good. The song starts where it should and ends where it should. Doesn't have an awkward cut off. No complaints.
,B000X6NXZ0,1,1,5,I love their music and live shows they do a great job. I am glad I could get this album.
,B000X6NXZ0,1,1,5,good song good quality.am very pleased with this selection of music 9 more words why cant i just say i liked it
,B000X6TUGQ,-1,1,5,"I do not like to reveiw music purchases, movie purchases and I certainly don't like to review downloads. If you didn't like the song in the first place why would you bother downloading it."
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,"This is a very fun and lust-filled song about a man admitting that he thinks a particular person is insane, but enjoys the good sex he gets from her.  He mentions about dreaming about doing his desire all night, and how he wants the scratches down his back to go with the rough sex. Yes, he mentions about wanting his sexual conquest to go down on him (with the lyrics ""to be a star you have to go down""). This song is meant to be an enjoyable and sexually unhibited type of musical tune. This is a very good rock song that is both wild and catchy."
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,"I like things that sometimes contradict themselves or make no sense at all.  This song is crass, but it's rock and sometimes rock isn't pretty.  The girlfriend is really skilled in the bedroom, but she's otherwise crazy, he kept her around or keeps her around because she's wicked good and brings out his animal nature.  It's rude, it's demeaning, it's crazy in and of itself, but that's what I like about it.  Is it art - who cares - its lusty rock and I'm sure there are real guys out there who similiarily stay with a woman only because she fulfills a need and there are women who do the same thing."
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,GREAT SONG!
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,Love it!
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,good

,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,O you dirty girl!
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,Good

,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,Great song by a great group
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,cant get enough of the music play it all the time with my kids and we all dance to it.
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,4,Good 1980's Rock but don't let the wife catch you listening :-)  Kind of guilty pleasure best enjoyed using ear buds or alone in the car. One listen and you'll understand.
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,"I dig this song it's the only one I own of Buck Cherry. I like the message I get from it, it makes you feel sexy."
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,"How did they know my name? No, seriously, I think this song is fun to scream along to, since I get to cuss and be filthy-minded."
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,"I don't know what the word count is for this box, but I like the song.  I would not have bought it if I didn't.  The process is very streamlined."
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,I really like this song. The sound quality is good. The song starts where it should and ends where it should. Doesn't have an awkward cut off. No complaints.
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,i think this song was written about me seriously I'm kimda nuts and the other I'm right on no kidding LOL
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,"Music plays great, no problems at all!! I highly recommend this tune download for people into this type of music. Love this tune!!"
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,"One of my favorite songs ..... sound quality is good and of course it's very convenient to have it available on my pc, iphone and kindle fire!"
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,"I have the CD & I've used it for a ringtone for certain people who resemble the title.!
I just like the song. Sheryl"
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,5,it has bad words but tells about someone i can put the words to lol. not for young listenrs. is funny and True of some.
,B000X6TUGQ,1,1,4,we downloaded this to add to our long playlist of music on the go to keep us entertained when the moment called for it :)
,B000X6UB46,1,1,4,"This was certainly a surprise to me. I have heard the name Sister Hazel, but I have never really listened to any of their music. Imagine my shock when there was no Sister or even a woman in the group!!! Nevertheless, I enjoyed the song. Great harmony and very mellow. I would like to hear some of the other songs on the album and yes, I would recommend this song."
,B000X6UB46,-1,-1,2,"Has that garage/grunge band sound.  Just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s I have collected, and forgettable.  Nice cover though."
,B000X6UB46,-1,-1,3,A great freebie from our friends at Amazon.  I look forward to their music freebies every year at Christmas time.
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,"A great take on this traditional song and is done in True sister hazel fashion, recommend to anyone and everyone"
,B000X6UB46,1,1,4,great song by a great singer! I love Christmas music and am always trying to add unique songs to my collection!
,B000X6UB46,-1,1,5,"Awesome music! Must buy more, must buy more, must use up 9 more words .... blah blah blah blah blah"
,B000X6UB46,1,1,4,Very nice. I do not regret purchasing this product. I definitely got my money's worth. Everyone will enjoy it immensely.
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,I love this version of this song even more than the classic. The laid back arrangement is peaceful and retrospective.
,B000X6UB46,-1,1,5,"Very nice song to mix in with the Christmas tunes.  And since this has to be a certain length to be submitted, I guess the other songs are going to go without reviews."
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,"I love Christmas music, and I love FREE things! So who could (would) pass up the opportunity to get FREE Christmas music!!"
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,"With stores piping in Christmas music even before Halloween, I look for traditional songs in non-traditional flavors. Love Sister Hazel and like this alt rock rendition. Great harmonies with just guitar."
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas  Sister Hazel
Love this song.  Made Christmas a wonderful time for all of us."
,B000X6UB46,-1,-1,3,"I thought it would be agood piece for the younger crowd, but it got a little carried away in their rendition."
,B000X6UB46,-1,-1,2,"Love the old traditional Christmas carols!  This one wasn't as good as I was hoping for.  I do enjoy the band, but thought they could have done better."
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,This song is well worth getting. A traditional arrangement with acoustic guitar and harmonizing vocals. I like it a lot.
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,"Nice twist to a old classic, liked the range and tone of the arrangement.  A must for newer listeners to enjoy."
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,"it the traditional song with just a little spice, Have yourself a merry littleChristmas has been redone my many greats and this version will one day be considered a great"
,B000X6UB46,1,1,5,I love Sister Hazel!  They really did a great job on this song!  I have been playing it no stop at work since I have gotten it and everyone here really likes it.
,B000X6XH9M,1,1,4,"Lewis Black's third album, Rules of Enragement, is his first release where his material really became more political. Keeping with tradition, Lewis starts out his show by busting on the city he's performing in. This time around he busts on Minnesota and his bit on their cold weather is hysterical. As usual, he's spot on when it comes to tackling issues like greed in big business and society's obsession with health. In particular, his commentary on milk and water are very funny. However, the end of the album is dominated by his views on Iraq. While his commentary is accurate, it does tend to drag at times. All told, Rules of Enragement is a very good album even if it tends to be too political near the end."
,B000X6XH9M,1,1,4,"This is an excellent CD, the only issue I have with it is that most of the material here can be heard and seen on his DVD Black on Broadway.  It's always better to actually watch a comic because then you can see the expressions on their faces, and that actually adds to joke just enough to make it funnier.  My favorite part has to be where he rants on about Enron where he comes up with a law should exist.  ""If you have a company, and it can't explain in one sentence what it does, it's illegal.""  There are a few parts not found on the DVD, but overall you are better just sticking with the DVD.  Pick this up if you are really big Lewis Black fan, otherwise just get the DVD."
,B000X6ZBCS,1,-1,3,"This is a earlier, much more foul-mouthed Gaffigan. His current style is still present, but there is definitely a little bit more edge to the delivery of his jokes. Parents, be warned about the expletives that are going to ensue.

Jim talks a lot about his recessive genes causing his absolute paleness, his Midwest upbringing, and his hatred of reading. But the most famous of his jokes is present here, the famed Hot Pocket joke. How much can one man talk about the destructive nature of this lovely frozen food item? You will be surprised.

The best part of this release is the included DVD with several of classic Gaffigan stand ups originally on Comedy Central. He sure looked really skinny and pale back then!

It is solid, but no where as strong as his subsequent releases, King Baby and Mr. Universe. It is worth it if you are a Jim Gaffigan fan."
,B000X6ZBCS,1,-1,3,"It is funny, but I should have read the information more carefully, as many of the bits are contained in some of this other albums."
,B000X6ZBCS,1,1,5,"JG has definitely got it all going on here. The material is crisp, his delivery and timing are perfect, and his ""little voice of confused audience member"" thing is a genius idea that he uses to full effect. His wry accents and pregnant pauses are unbeatably tight.

I love all of his dvds and cds, but DMT may be his funniest. [I will say, however, that I've never seen a comedian milk the same bits over and over on so many different cds. Nearly every bit he's ever done is on at least two and sometimes three or four different cds, providing less value than one might want. In that light, I'd recommend this, King Baby and Beyond The Pale, as they have almost every bit from his first four or so collections as well as new material.]

No other American comic seems as adept at pointing out our endless national foibles yet making them seem so endearingly moronic. Hot Pockets is pricelessly funny; I almost fall over laughing every time I hear it. In fact, to avoid that today I woke up and decide to start the week off right by laying in bed five minutes longer and listening to Hot Pockets on headphones. As usual I cracked up time and again, but was fortunately unable to fall over. I did roll over a few times though. Any comedian who can make me crack up time and again at the same bit is clearly doing something right. Bill Hicks and Carlin and Chris Rock can, and a very few others. Jim's in that small group, no doubt.

Great comedy is a combination of smart material, timing, and that x factor that separates the good from the great. Gaffigan's defintiely got them all going on."
,B000X6ZBCS,1,1,5,"This was a plesent suprise a couple of years ago when I caught part of his act on Comedy Central, then I heard the CD at a local CD store, and happend to hear the Hot Pocket Skit, and I bought the CD on the spot.  I have been guitly of the Hot Pocket purchase.  Always sound like a great Idea for a quick snack/lunch, but can be exactly as described by Jim Gaffigan.  His newer CD, Beyond the Pale, has The Hot Pocket skit on there as well, but this is the longer edition and original. Also, this is a set with CD and DVD.  Both CD's Are great and have new different material on each, but If you have to buy one, this one would be the first one to pick up.  Definitely will keep everybody laughing."
,B000X6ZBCS,1,1,5,"Jim should be the most popular comedian in America right now, he's definately the funniest at the moment in my opinion. His material on being lazy and hot pockets is classic and this came with a bonus dvd so it's a hell of a deal. Check out Beyond The Pale it's even funnier!"
,B000X6ZBCS,1,1,5,"Comedy CDs are an iffy recommendation.  What's funny today might bore you tomorrow.  Some jokes are only funny the first time.  Jim Gaffigan's CD, ""Doin' My Time,"" scores high on the replay factor.  Perhaps it's his delivery (dry self-deprecation with a twist of smug).  Perhaps it's his avant-garde style of humor (he spends about a quarter of the time pretending to be a critical female member of his own show, weaving ""her"" comments with his).  Perhaps it's just his voice, which has a malleable whine to it that never gets annoying and which makes his self-mockery seem humorously authentic instead of just patronizing or pathetic.

Part of it is definitely the humor itself.  Whether his jokes make bizarre 180's (""I used to smoke.  Yeah.  Smoking's real addictive.  But you know what's REALLY addictive?  Heroin.""), or whether their humor lies in their dead ends; whether they take the ""didja ever notice?"" concept and snap it in half (his ""Hot Pocket"" and bottled water/Mexican food bits are a good example of this), or whether they're just plain crude, grouchy, silly and dumpy, they all stand up to repeated listenings.  There are a few times where you get the impression that the joke -- such as his bit on glasses -- would work a lot better if you could see the man (and, in fact, most of them are like that; Jim is almost as much fun to watch as he is to listen to), but none of them fail to be laugh-worthy because of it.  Pasty, flabby, and grumpy, though he may be, Jim Gaffigan is also a funny, funny man, and this is a funny, funny CD.

(NOTE: This product comes with a short DVD of his Comedy Central appearance, which is much cleaner than the act to be found on the CD.)"
,B000X6ZBCS,1,1,4,"I can't count the stand-up routines I hear or see and hardly crack a smile. Not so with Jim Gaffigan. Even after repeat listenings, I still laugh out loud many times it's so funny. The jokes and observations are excellent, and his delivery makes it even better. He definitely has his own thing going on. I also own and love his ""Last Supper"" disc, but this one is kind of a best of Jim, and comes with a DVD as well, so it's a no-brainer. Another hysterical combo is the last disc from Mitch Hedberg. Now that Mitch has past on, Jim is the best comic going from what I've heard. ""Doin' My Time"" is even better when enjoying a tasty Hot Pocket."

,B000X6U6IM,1,1,5,This is a song that I enjoy in my worship list on cloud player.  Aaron does a great job with it.

,B000X6U6IM,1,1,5,This song reminds me that God is MINE and His sacrifice is for ME. It makes worship very personal and heartfelt for me.
,B000X6U6IM,1,1,5,This song is great! Songs like these allow you to worship our Lord the way He should be worshipped.  Thank you.
,B000X6U6IM,1,1,5,I love this CD Arron definitely have a gift from God in his voice. I will buy all the Cd's he put out.
,B000X6U6IM,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite Christian worship songs. I heard it alot and did not know who sang it. So soon as I found who sang it I purchased it immediately.
,B000X6U6IM,-1,1,5,"I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.
See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours, for like EVER. :D
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:"

,B000X7WA2Q,1,1,5,I always liked this song.  I just remembered I can download it from Amazon.  I enjoy being able to download the song I want instead of buying the album which usually has only one or maybe two songs that I like.  I like Gary Allan's voice.
,B000X7WA2Q,1,1,4,My husband and I really enjoy Gary Allan and this is one of those lazy day but oh so good songs to just put on and relax to!
,B000X7WA2Q,1,1,5,Ordered mp3 version ... arrived fine. Have other Gary Allan CD's.  I really like his music.  Will be seeing him in concert this summer.
,B000X7WA2Q,1,1,5,I love this song!  It was very easy to order through Amazon.  The price was decent however with all the apps out there I won't need it in the future :)
,B000X7WA2Q,1,1,5,Without a doubt this is Gary Allen's greatest song. A must add to your MP3 rotation.  This really is Gary at his best without a doubt at all

This song is truly a masterpiece and one you'll be glad you have in your collection."
,B000X964EY,-1,1,5,"Monolithic Baby! is the sixth full-length Monster Magnet studio album, it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time.

The album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.

The aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.

The fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.

Regardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'

Most Monster Magnet fans are fond of Dave's Vocals and lyrics, which are up to their usual high standard on this record, and most fans will be more than happy with this album, the songwriting is of a very high caliber and there are so many rocking songs that this is one of the most direct, focused and in your face records the band have made.

Of course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments. If that describes your feelings in similar situations then maybe give Monolithic Baby! a miss, elsewise do not hesitate to pick up a copy, it really is a very enjoyable record."
,B000X964EY,1,1,5,"If you've never heard of Monster Magnet, then I pity you. This band rocks HARD, and their music is beyond awesome. Monolithic Baby is just one of the albums that showcase their talents. The songs here have a tendency to make you want to play some air guitar (that's not what I do, personally). Either that, or make you want to buy the album straight away. Songs like ""Radiation Day,"" ""Hotel Baby,"" ""The Right Stuff,"" and ""Too Bad"" are surefire winners of ultimate stoner rock. ""Monolithic"" is just craves for your attention (and that's a good thing), while ""Master of Light,"" my personal favorite on the album, can be best described as nothing short of amazing. ""There's No Way Out of Here"" and ""Ultimate Everything"" should go down in history as two of the most underrated rock songs of the 2000's.

I'm just getting into Monster Magnet's other albums, and I don't think I'll stop because their music is never boring or dull. Next up: Powertrip!

,B000X9KKO4,-1,1,5,Finally Paramount listensed and put out a complete version. There were so many left out sequences on the older version. The USS Grisom and the destruction of the Enterprise are only a small sample of what was left out.

Another thrilling work by James Horner containing one of the best cues ever written for Star Trek, the 8-minute ""Stealing the Enterprise"" sequence. The rest of the soundtrack is largely melancholy and somber, befitting the tone of the film. There's also a ten-minute sequence of source muzak for the completist.

Like the Star Trek II release, this one comes with extensive illustrated liner notes. Unlike the previous release, the original soundtrack is included on a second disc. I don't see the need, but it isn't a great deal of extra money, and this is another classic film score that anyone interested enough to read a review of should have."
,B000X9KKO4,1,1,5,"James Horner's score for Star Trek III is a bit personal for me.  It was the first soundrack I can ever remember wanting to own, and once my father finally did get me the cassette, my 8 year old ears must have listened to it about 1000 times over. Now that it's nearly 20 years later, that number is probably closer to 10,000, but never like this.

Film Score Monthly has made possible what I thought was impossible.  I had given up hope that the Star Trek franchise would never get the expanded music treatment that the Star Wars movies and the Lord of the Rings movies got.  Finally getting to hear recordings of the Self-Destruct sequence...finally getting to hear the spectacular music behind the Genesis Armageddon.  It's more that I ever thought we'd ever get.

,B000XXZ31K,1,1,5,love this album. its got to be my favorite album of AVA's. the only song i don't really enjoy is the jumping rooftops interlude. seems pretty pointless. but overall the songs are awesome. a little bit of autotune is easily heard in Heaven to me. but oh well its not that big of a deal. love the cd. worth checking out for sure.
,B000XXZ31K,1,1,4,"Angels & Airwaves continues forward with their 80s-tinged blending of punk vocals, anthemic and chest-beating U2 choruses, and the guitar shadings and conceptual nature of classic Pink Floyd. All in all, some of my favorite musical touchstones that have been part of the soundtrack to my life.

""Call To Arms"" opens in classic AvA style, widescreen and epic, beautiful chiming guitars and pulsing keyboards building up into a huge song with big choruses and gorgeous Hammond organ.

""Everything's Magic"" has become sort've ""our song"" between my girlfriend and I. I heard it for the first time just days before we met, and it was played quite a bit in the car during our first few months. Everytime we hear it come on in a department store or the mall, we give eachother this look and a smile that is priceless. There's a nice pop-punk quality to it (which is different from anything on their first album), although the chorus is a pure adrenaline rush reminescent of early Asia.

""Love Like Rockets"" is another ""classic AvA"" song, with those trademark sequenced keyboards and drums. The intro is perfectly epic, utilising sound samples of President Eisenhower, astronauts, and various radio chatter and feedback that brings to mind the Space Race of the 50's and 60's. Tom seems to be making a parallel between the giddy rush of new love, and launching on a rocket into an unknown frontier.

""Breathe"" is sort've a ballad with nice soft keyboards. ""Sirens"" is fast-paced and frenetic and the chorus reminds me of The Proclaimers. ""Secret Crowds"" has a huge chorus, although I love the music and words during the verses a bit more. ""Star of Bethlehem/True Love"" was originally recorded for a compilation CD in late 2006, and is mixed a little differently on I-Empire. Another mini-epic, with trancey sequencers and Edge-like guitar effects. ""Lifeline"" has a keyboard sound that immediately brought me fresh memories of 1985, considering that it sounded exactly like the intro to Reading Rainbow.

""Jumping Rooftops"" is a cut-and-pasted percussion and keyboard interlude that leads into ""Rite of Spring"", which is another relatively experimental song, sounding more raw and punky as Tom reflects on his teenage life. (He said that he wanted to write a song that would sound like a garage band's first tune, written in high school.) The album ends with ""Heaven"", reprising musical and lyrical themes from ""Valkyrie Missile"", the opening track on We Don't Need To Whisper, effectively ending the two-album concept and bringing things full circle.

The lyrics continue in the same vein of We Don't Need To Whisper, and are positively infectious in their optimistic spiritual outlook, topics of reformation and reinvention, living your dreams, and never giving up. This is a message that I wish more Top 40 bands would preach, and is vastly needed during the hard times we live in. Being a grounded but optimistic person myself (as well as having a love for the 80's, Sci-Fi, and prog-rock), this band is perfect blend of my favorite things.

Overall, I-Empire sounds quite a bit like their last album, although has a couple of curveballs and is a little more organic sounding. New bassist Matt Wachter (formerly of 30 Seconds To Mars) and guitarist David Kennedy don't stand out too much (being buried behind layers of effects and keyboards, not to mention Tom's own playing), but drummer Atom Willard continues with greatness previously seen before, with a fiery, explosive energy, awesome fills, and a rhythmic groove that very nearly puts him in the ""virtuoso"" category. Check out his electronic/acoustic percussion showcase throughout the first few minutes of ""Star of Bethlehem/True Love"" (notably performed just as perfect in a live setting when I caught the band live in early 2008.)

The album artwork is a departure from the last one, instead featuring a painted montage (by Drew Struzan, famous movie poster artist of Lucas and Spielberg) of the band over a sunset horizon. Yet another reference to a positive 80's childhood.

If AvA fans can't get enough of this type of sound, I'd strongly recommend some other prog-rock bands such as Pendragon (Believe or Pure), 30 Seconds To Mars, It Bites (The Tall Ships or The Big Lad In The Windmill), Rush (Grace Under Pressure or Power Windows), dredg, Coheed & Cambria and Asia."
,B000XXZ31K,-1,-1,3,"A lot of sources seem to point the finger at Tom DeLonge for the breakup of blink-182. Whether you believe it or not, the evidence does seem to point in that direction because not only did he form&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Box-Car-Racer/dp/B000066F6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Box Car Racer</a>&nbsp;while blink was still around, he formed his new band, Angels & Airwaves, only months after blink broke up.

I also wonder if Tom's heart is really in this material considering it was released only a year after their first album. Anyway, maybe a better title would be I am Stuck in My OLD Empire because although I know Tom is too old to still be singing emo, he has the kind of voice that just isn't suitable for anything BUT that. Remember how on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/blink-s-untitled-album/dp/B0000DZDTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">blink's untitled album</a>, Mark was singing lower? Well, Tom's register didn't change at all. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but, well, serious songs and that kind of voice just don't gel like they should. This is especially evidenced when the band shoots for romantic tunes like ""Love Like Rockets"" and ""Breathe"" (""True Love"" works out pretty well, though).

While none of the songs are bad, the songs that stand out the most are the final two tracks: ""Rite of Spring"" and ""Heaven"". The opening track ""Call to Arms"" is pretty good too, as are the instrumentals ""Jumping Rooftops"" and ""Star of Bethlehem"". I-Empire is still satisfying enough for rock fans, but there's really nothing extraordinary here either. B.I.F.

Anthony Rupert"
,B000XXZ31K,1,-1,3,"The Good
""Call to Arms"" is no doubt the band's anthem for this album. A major difference you notice right away is that this album is a lot brighter and hopeful as compared to their 2006 album We Don't Need to Whisper. ""Everything's Magic"" adds a hint of keyboards and lots of progressive effects that complement Tom Delonge's (ex-Blink 182) melodic, high-pitched vocals. ""Breathe"" is not your typical radio ballad, but more like a sci-fi movie love song. Driving guitars mixed with melodic vocal breaks make up the track ""Secret Crowds."" Drummer Atom Willard (Offspring) experiments with some unique drum beats on this one. ""True Love"" employs electronic drum beats, unique guitar licks, and uplifting vocals.

The Bad
Despite the different effects and drum beats used, the album tends to sound like one long, drawn-out song.

The Verdict
The brighter more optimistic Angles and Airwaves are far more enjoyable than their darker and hopeless debut. However, lack of diversity keeps this album from returning to my CD player."
,B000XXZ31K,1,1,4,"Being a fan of the first effort,I knew I had to get this one and it was well worth it. Just filled with real good,spacy sound musical rides. Call To Arms,Everything's Magic,Sirens,Secret Crowds and Lifeline are my standout faves. Check it out for yourself and feel the energy. A solid 4.5 stars for a real cool,more grown up sound. A/A you rock!!!!!!!!!!!"
,B000XXZ31K,1,1,4,"Angels and Airwaves was a band that was created by former Blink 182 singer/guitarist Tom Delonge and his ambition to create something truly different was very admirable. The band's debut CD, We Don't Need to Whisper, was a very good CD that unfortunately suffered from a bit of a slow pace and some weak lyrics. But still, it was a great start and I was very interested to see the band's follow up CD, I-Empire. I-Empire (called by Tom ""the ""part 2"" to We Don't Need to Whisper) is a much faster CD that's a lot more accessible and easier to like. The music on here is really uplifting, and it's perfect music for playing VERY loud, especially on a nice sound system or while driving fast in a car. It's definitely a much better CD than the 1st effort. That said, though, it still suffers from some of the flaws of We Don't Need to Whisper; the lyrics have not improved; in fact, they've gotten even a bit worse. I think Tom needs a new approach to his lyric writing for this band; I thought it was weird during their first CD that the music is this futuristic, very ""epic and different"" in style, and presented itself as a grandoise and epic masterpiece...yet the songs were about ""your best friend is not your girlfriend"" ...it didn't work. I-Empire's faster music fits its lyrics a lot better, but unfortunately, the lyrics on here are often extremely corny, and almost every single song's a love song. I really wish Tom would try to sing about something else, as his ""I love you, you make me feel alive"" lyrics really started to get old for me on this CD. Blink 182's self-titled final CD featured some excellent lyrics and the songs showed real variety in their subject matter; Angels and Airwaves is about love, that's it. Only a couple tracks on this CD seem to deviate from that. That aside, though, this CD shows much more variety in the songs and much more exciting music and it easily makes it a more fun listen.

Call to Arms; 8/10. A very cool start to the CD. Some nice lyrics and a catchy chorus. A good song.

Everything's Magic; 7/10. Another good song, a very fast-paced and fun song; the lead single. Features great music that sounds a bit like Blink 182's Anthem Part 2. The chorus isn't too great, though.

Breathe; 8/10; A very nice song musically. The first slow song on the CD yet it's not unbearably slow. It's a little repetative lyrically, (he says ""I love you"" over 16 times in it,) but it's a really nice and ambient song. Well-done.

Love Like Rockets; 7/10; Although the subject matter of the song's a little stupid when you think about it, it's a cool-sounding and ""different"" song with a pretty cool chorus. The song's got a cool space-like theme to it. The ""imagine"" line's pretty cool. Overall, it works. Has a cool, powerful ending, too.

Sirens; 7/10; Took me a while to get used to this song, (the ""dadadadada"" lyrics got on my nerves at first,) but now it's actually pretty good. The whole song's very catchy and the verses are sung very well. Good lyrics, actually.

Secret Crowds; 6/10; This is more of a ""rock song,"" that sounds like it'd be perfectly played in a football stadium. It's not too bad lyrically, (providing the theme for the CD; ""If I had my own world, I'd build you an empire,"")and the verses are pretty nice, but there's unfortunately no hook here; the big refrain of the song doesn't have any sort of tune, it just features Tom singing slower and louder. It needed more of a tune or a hook. The band obviously disagrees, though, since this is currently the planned 2nd single.

Star of Bethlehem; 7/10; When Angels and Airwaves first played this song live, it was an epic, 6-minute plus song with a very long instrumental at the beginning with the lyrics eventually kicking in at about the 3-minute mark. For the CD, the song was wisely split up; most of the long instrumental takes place in this song, while the rest of the song kicks in on the next track, True Love. This is a pretty cool instrumental, both atmospheric and fast, as well as very memorable. Goes very well with the next song.

True Love; 8/10; Another great song, with a very fast chorus and featuring the continuing instrumental from the previous song. Lyrics are pretty cool. Another song that's definitely got more of a ""rock"" sound to it. Well-done.

Lifeline; 3/10; Really irritating song, the only bad one on the CD. Tom's vocals on this song are horrible; he REALLY strains on it and it just sounds very forced and corny. Really bad lyrics, too. Easily the worst song on the 2 CD's. Musically it's pretty weak, too. The verses have a good tune but unfortunately Tom's strained vocals end up making the song pretty intolerable.

Jumping Rooftops; NA/10; a cool little techno intermission as we transition into the powerful final tracks on the CD.

Rite of Spring; 8/10; It's hard for me to give this an 8/10 because the lyrics are really horrible; it's too bad because it's actually very good subject matter; Tom talking about his life, with a really cool chorus and verses; overall a very catchy and really impressive song musically, but the lyrics are pretty awful. Tom tries to rhyme to really bad results, and we end up with a song that tries to rhyme ""pass"" with ""cash"" and lines like ""it took about an hour to start a punk rock band, to offset my ****** up family land."" Had he not tried to rhyme I think we would have ended up with a MUCH better song lyrically, but still, it's a great song and one of the most memorable on the CD.

Heaven; 10/10; An excellent end to I-Empire with the best lyrics on the CD. It starts by sampling distorted clips from past Angels and Airwaves songs, then speeds up. Very great musically, very good lyrically. Serves almost as a part 2 to the apocalyptic Valkyrie Missile from We Don't Need to Whisper and it's overall a cool closing to the story told on the band's first 2 CD's.

Angels and Airwaves have greated a great ""part 2"" to their first CD that's both faster and more fun. Now that they've finished this story, though, I hope their next CD's something completely different entirely, especially in the lyrical department. I'd like to see this band sing about some different subjects at some point. Easily recommended for anyone who'se ever been a fan of Tom's work in the past of if you like this ""stadium rock"" genre.

That said, I have to end this review on a negative note. After listening to the recently released ""In Defense of the Genre"" CD by rock band Say Anything, I've gotta say that THIS is a band whose lyrics are real, whose lyrics are True to life and whose lyrics are layered and very deep, and whose lyrics really mean something to the band. Tom Delonge's lyrics for Angels and Airwaves, on the other hand, are so far removed from any type of reality and are so formulaic and so cliche'd that it gives his songs the depth of a shallow pool...it's like listening to the boy bands of the 1990's again....yeesh. He just seems unwilling (or unable) to stretch himself at all in this category and it was such a step down on this CD from Whisper, which was itself a step down from where Blink left off from on their excellent final CD. The lack of emotional weight on these songs and True hooks ended up making the CD fairly forgettable. I liked Rite of Spring a lot because despite its horrible lyrics, it was nice to hear Tom finally sing about something that was obviously real life. Despite these complaints, this gets a 4-star rating. It's a good CD and fans of Angels and Airwaves fans SHOULD definitely check it out. But don't expect it to remain in your CD players for long....It's more exciting than Whisper, but just not nearly as memorable. Here's hoping the band switches gears with their next CD."
,B000XXZ31K,-1,1,5,"I already reviewed this but Amazon killed the review for an unknown reason.

In any case, this album is as good as the last, which is to say it's spectacular.

The only problem with it is that Rite of Spring is utter garbage; amateurish lyrics and simple, garage, my-first-punk-song from the musical standpoint. It's always skipped and the album should not have it.

The rest ranges from pretty good to really good. Very much a relief that A&A didn't screw things up after their first one, and it was not a fluke!"
,B000XXZ31K,1,1,5,"the guys do it for a 2nd time.  A&A make another high quality, energy filled yet important cd with a message.  Its done while having fun and going through different moods from tracks like ""Everything's Magic"" its fun and irressitible song for them to ""Star of Bethlehem"" a two minute interlude...unlike other interludes on other albums this one actually warrants listening to.

I was a fan from their first cd ""We Don't Need To Whisper"" with ""I-Empire"" the guys have firmly established themselves in this music industry and can/will only go up from here.  As this cd is one that can't be ignored by folks at all.  Loving the cd from beginning to end it flows from one track to the next with an ease that you seldom experience.

First one was all that...2nd one is all that and so much more!!

5/5 overall"
,B000XXZ31K,1,1,5,"Already, I-Empire is one of the best albums of the year (if not THE best).  Of all the CD's I've listened to this year, this one, by far, is very optimistic and uplifting, to say the least.  The anthemic, 80's synth-pop, stadium-rock sound works very well here.  And if it does sound formulaic, so be it!  Very heartfelt and inspirational too!  Tom DeLonge has definitely come a long way from his Blink-182 days, and I'm all the more glad for it!  Instead of the usual bratty, toilet humor, we get mature, ""reach for the sky"" sentiments, that is, keep going, no matter what happens to you in life.  Honestly, I think that's what we need more nowadays.  By the way, forget about that Rolling Stone critic who gave this fine CD only 2 1/2 stars.  According to the review, ""Blink-182 guitarist is all grown up and synth-poppy.  But is that a good thing?""  I certainly think so!

** ADDENDUM **
Angels & Airwaves' new album, LOVE, is already available as a FREE download.  Just head over to the band's web site now!"

,B000Y076EO,1,1,5,You can't wrong with a Keith Urban song
,B000Y076EO,1,1,4,This is another good song by Keith Urban that is on the same album.  I like this song too very much
,B000Y076EO,1,1,5,This is the one and only Keith Urban song that I have ever downloaded.  It's just catchy and I like the sound of it.  Makes me want to sing along to it.  Big step for me because I don't usually go for country music.
,B000Y076EO,-1,1,5,"When it's over, it's over or is it.? I really had to do some searching with a few lyrics to Google who this Artist was due to the fact that I would never known it was Keith Urban, a Country Western Artist, not my usual selection. Most definately I could not have enjoyed it more."
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,"great song from a great movie, even if it was a chick flick, the transitions are so amazing, do more like this"
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,"Every time I play this song, I feel happy.  It is very upbeat and uplifting. He has a great voice!"
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,"beautiful song, and words"
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,Love it.
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,Love the song
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,It's Keith Urban!  What else can you say
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,"Keith Urban is a great musician. After listening to this song, I  became a fan. Worth listening to"
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,Liked song
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,Met or exceeded my expectations. What is shown is what I received. I down loaded this and expect to listen to it often.
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,"Love the entire CD, this is so upbeat and leaves you feeling good. I love songs you can sing with and this one makes you belt it out! Such a beautiful voice!"
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,"I've always enjoyed this song, even though I don't like most country. But, Keith Urban's guitarist skills combined with his voice is always refreshing to hear. The tune is fun to hear."
,B000Y0BH08,1,1,5,"Being a guitarist myself for 50 years, I hold people like Keith to a higher standard. He doesn't disappoint with this one. His mix of country and rock roots shine in this piece!"
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,Im an old used to be hippy so I love Judy Collins. I also have always loved this song. This rendition has all of the verses so I chose to mp3 it.
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,I like this song and wanted it for my Kindle
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,4,One of the best religious songs ever written and she sings it with all her heart and soul
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,great voice
,B000Y2QEAE,-1,1,5,Everyone needs to have this version in their library.
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,amazing
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,"This Lady sings this song so beautifully
haven't heard any one that does it half as beautiful as she

To me she made this song unforgettable. Beautiful Song Beautiful Lady"
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,"I have a lot of versions of ""Amazing Grace"". Ms. Collins version is number one so far. A perfect voice for this song. A simple piano accompaniment.  No background razzmatazz to mess it up.."
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,4,I like it.
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,One couldn't find a more beautiful rendition.
,B000Y2QEAE,-1,1,4,as it should be
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,awesome
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,beautiful
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,best version of this song ever in my opinion
,B000Y2QEAE,-1,1,5,5 stars.
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,Great
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,Heard this version on the radio and had to have it.  It is wonderful.
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,This is the best rendition of the song
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,Truly beautiful version of a truly beautiful song.
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,Absolutely beautiful rendition of this hymn!
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,I've loved her voice for years. So individualistic.
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,Great!
,B000Y2QEAE,1,1,5,Judy Collins was 15 years old when I first met her. She used to sing to us kids and we loved her for it. I lost track of her only one day to see an article on a new folk singer....it was Judy she had made it to the big time. This recording shows the fantastic range of her voice. It's one of my favorites.
,B000Y2ORPI,1,1,5,These selections and the orchestrations are wonderful and I recommend this cd to all.
,B000Y2ORPI,1,1,5,Excellent
,B000YBH2UG,-1,-1,3,idk why this gets recognized as being anywhere close to 1997.  not even remotely close
,B000YBH2UG,1,1,5,"Up until now my favorite Daft Punk album has been the amazing Discovery, but this album is so good it gives it a run for its money. While most convert albums suffer a bit from the ""noise"" of the crowd's cheers, in this case they actually add to the experience rather than distracting.

Discovery was a sweet box of evolving melodies, but this is a driving, thrumming, buzzing beat box of awesome! I always loved how the melodies of Discovery melded into each other, making you want to listen to the entire album. This is a series of Daft Punk's best songs mixed together perfectly with enough wonderous glorious bass to benchmark any speaker system.

If I have a single complaint, it's the that the Close Encounters of the Third Kind opening is missing from the audio recording, and should be included. Other than that, listen to this and enjoy. It's awesome music for just listening, but it's REALLY great for exercise, doing chores, or (obviously) having a dance party. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.

Final note: If you have a record player the complete Alive Boxed Set is totally worth it as it includes a backstage pass, stickers, bonus tracks, a turntable pad, and a gorgeous art book."
,B000YBH2UG,1,1,5,"Daft punk is not my fav group out there in this area of music, but i will say this, it is the best when it comes to House music. If you give them a chance you will love this soon to be classic Alive LIVE SHOW Cd / or MP3. Daft punk has mixed or remixed you might say their best songs ever into a mastery of delight, it feels like your fav firework show of music coming together with the greatest House Band in history. What was once over looked to be just another someone, now was proven that this is not the case when they won awards on tv, many have said they went mainstream an that this was wrong but i think it doesn't matter, it just makes them have to work that much better on their work i hope. Anyways check this out if you can, i would totally buy this it sounds great an it is worth the money to buy it an not just download it from any website for free, trust me guys."
,B000YBH2UG,1,1,5,"Daft Punk is the undisputed master of electronic music, but their more artistic and ambient tracks can be more suited to background listening.  Alive 2007 reworks them as a focal point of a musical events and makes them more relevant as music to listen to for its own sake."
,B000YBH2UG,1,1,5,Alive is really in sink with the rest of the Daft Punk classics. You can make this your theme album and have dance parties every weekend.
,B000YBH2UG,1,1,5,"One of the best live albums I've ever owned/heard!  The music is sharp, clear, and amazing, and if it wasn't for the audience noise (which never overbears, muffles, or ruins any of it), you may be lead to believe it was recorded in a studio.  If you like DP, then you'll love this; the mixes are great and when you heard the individual songs after the fact, don't be surprised if you end up with echoes of these mixes in your head, too."
,B000YC41WC,1,1,5,Great song
,B000YC41WC,1,1,5,Downloading this song was so easy it's great
,B000YC41WC,1,1,5,"Beautiful 80's power ballad! Nice vocals and a very good mix between piano and guitars typical of what Sheriff was all about. If you were a fan of the hair bands, this is one you should own!"
,B000YC41WC,1,1,5,"I remember listening to this song on the radio when I was about 12 years old in '89, and being amazed at that note at the end of the song.  It still impresses me.

This is a really great power ballad from the '80s, with catchy/memorable music, and touching lyrics about finding your True love/soul mate, without being sappy.  I don't like overly romantic or mushy love songs, and this one manages to be lovely without crossing into embarrassing territory (at least for me).  I always thought it would be a good wedding song.  I haven't found anyone I feel that way about, or feels that way about me, but the song still sounds great to me.  One of my favorite '80s songs."
,B000YC41WC,1,1,5,I love this song and have for years. The lead singer in this group (which unfortunately broke up soon after their one and only album) has an absolutely amazing voice and classical training. The note he holds at the end is unbelievable!
,B000YC41WC,1,1,4,"Good quality recording, one of my wifes faves."
,B000YC41WC,1,1,5,Cool Song...Hit the charts TWICE in the 80s...several years apart
,B000YC41WC,1,1,5,Love it
,B000YC41WC,1,1,5,"I think this is one of the best power ballads ever.  Sing it to your girl and she will love you like a love song, baby."
,B000YKEMZ0,-1,-1,3,"The original version of ""Apologize"" starts off with violins, and a soft piano, with a slow clapping in the background. The only thing really different between this and the remix is Timbaland. I personally don't care for this version, reminding me more of Fort Minor's ""Remember the Name,"" without the rap. This version is also somewhat less emotional, as it seems pretty straight-up. I can see why the song is liked by most, but this version, for me, just isn't as good as the remix. Although it still is a nice listen."
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Just what I wanted
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,4,Love this song!
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Love it!
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,This is a great song to add to your collection.  I loved it so buy it
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Excellent song from a band I just discovered in the past year or so and I'm really glad I did. Good stuff!
,B000YKEMZ0,-1,1,5,OneRepublic rocks!
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Love
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,very nice
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,love this song
,B000YKEMZ0,1,-1,3,Good Music!
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Great Song. Love the beat.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Great song.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,great song
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,4,It is one of those unforgettable songs...
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Great song.
,B000YKEMZ0,-1,1,4,"I actually dismissed this song when it was new. It didn't really grab me. After hearing their later releases, though, I went back and liked it better. Weird huh?"
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,sounds good. It is a song.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,I love this song!  OneRepublic will be around for awhile - super band.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,great song!!! love it!!!
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,good music
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Any relationship can become fragile and this song says it well. Too late to apologize. What a beautiful voice and the music is matches the voice.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Great quality & what a beautiful song.. however it is very sad.. :( but I love ALL of One Republics songs. I especially like their Counting Stars song. but the entirety of every album is wonderful. Highly recommended.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,I love this song. It aways says what you can't say in a crumbling relationship.  Nice song can't wait to see what's next for these talented men.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,Another great song from a great band. I am a fan of OneRepublic and recommend this song among others as definitely worth being purchased.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,4,"When I first heard the song Apologize on the radio, I knew that I want to download this song. Apologize is a sincere, good song."
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,"I downloaded 4 of ""One Republic"" songs from Amazon Cloud. This one is great. It's great that you can listen to some of the song before you download it so this was one of the really good ones."
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,One Republic is awesome. I have found that it is worth it to buy the whole album when it comes to this group. This song is one of my favorites too. I love it.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,The original is a good song. I prefer the remixed as far as the flow of the song and the beat go. But I still have nothing bad to say about this song. Worth it.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,4,This is a soulful song with heart. The guys can hit the notes too. It has a catchy tune that is infectious and memorable. I would recommend the song to anyone who likes pop music.
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,"I can't fully describe how much I love this song! OneRepublic does a fantastic job with this song, that you can't not want to listen to it! They have a great sound with this song, so of course it is added to my iPod!"
,B000YKEMZ0,-1,1,4,"Hooked. Lined. Sinkered. Not sure that last one is a word, but that is how I felt the first time I heard this tune, as I am sure did everyone else who knows this song from One Republic. Not sure why it took me so long to finally download it."
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,5,"This track is quite alright with me. The music is great, piano-driven pop with hand claps to boot. The lyrics are definitely deep enough to get you thinking if you actually know what he's talking about. My favorite lyric is when Tedder says, ""I loved you with a fire red now it's turning blue"".

I appreciate the version without Timbaland more. It's produced better. Softer.

4.5 stars."
,B000YKEMZ0,1,1,4,"Great orchestra music.  This song just makes you feel better.  ""I need you like a heart needs a beat.""  It is 'help with the heartache' music. I love that is it NOT explicit!!!"
,B000YKEMX2,1,1,5,"I heard this song when some girl made it through to Hollywood on this season of American Idol, and I wanted to know what it was called so I can download it. I found it and it's a very good track from this band. 5/5"
,B000YKEMX2,1,1,5,"OneRepublic's current phenomenon, ""Stop and Stare"" which seems like it's fixin' to crack the top 10 of the carts, and for good reason. The song has a very nice structure, starting off slow, before building up to, and taking off at the chorus in an unexpectedly amazing effort, that could be the highlight of their CD. The song also works surprisingly great in a totally acoustic form, as well as its original modern/alt rock form.

So overall, a great song from a great band, and certainly one of their, if not their best song. Now support the band, and bring this song to the top of the charts!"
,B000YKEMX2,1,1,5,Great tune.  Very catchy...in a good way.  I'll keep it on my playlist.
,B000YKEMX2,1,1,5,"Very enjoyable song and great band a lot of talent. Lyrics really hit home. Worth buying and listening too at your pace
."
,B000YKEMX2,1,1,5,"A perfect rock rendition with a soulful, compelling message.  Worth hearing over and over again.  Vocals and instruments in outstanding harmony."
,B000YKEMX2,1,1,5,I love OneRepublic's songs. They are fresh and have a sound all their own. I could listen to them all day.
,B000YL4IOY,1,1,5,Easy Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fast Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No Problems what so ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,B000YL4IOY,1,1,5,I remember this from when videos were first shown on TV after school.  My Dad would sit and watch this one with us.
,B000YL4IOY,-1,-1,3,"This band goes in the ""they should have been bigger"" category. I guess if they would have been cuter they would have been a multi-platinum act."
,B000YN35QE,1,1,5,"This was a purchase that was done because I needed something to listen to, good Music. It was able fulfill my needs."
,B000YN35QE,-1,-1,3,I really enjoy Band of Horses and this is one of the best ones. Just stay away from the Ce-Lo cover of it.
,B000YN35QE,1,1,5,"A premier indie love song, ""No One's Gonna Love You"" tries to make you think otherwise in the title, but make no mistake about it, this is one of the better written and produced love songs I've heard, and I've either heard it as the background for emotional moments on either Psych or Chuck, so a few others must have felt the same as I.

The full line would be ""No one's gonna love you more than I do."" It comes off so nicely, it completes just about emotional moment. Add to that the music, and you've got the complete package with this song. Buy it for a date, or to tell that special someone how they feel. Surely enough, you'll score many a point, and they'll get the message. Perfect for Valentine's Day mixtapes."
,B000YN09AE,1,1,5,"Thank you Scandal for introducing me to this beautiful, beautiful song.  I can't even describe it with words.  This song is one of my favorites that I can listen to on repeat for hours without even doing anything else...just listening."
,B000YN09AE,1,1,4,I am a huge Scandal fan and heard this on one of the episodes and fell instantly. I'm not a huge instrumental music kind of gal but this song is so soothing and heartbreaking (you have to watch the show to know what I mean) at the same time. Great music!
,B000YN32BM,1,1,4,A pretty good album through out. Detlef Schremp iis a very good song.
,B000YN32BM,1,1,5,Amazing Album!!!!
,B000YN32BM,1,1,5,"One of my favorite all time albums from a great rock band.  Seriously one of my top ten, love every song."
,B000YN32BM,1,1,4,"Fronted by the otherworldly voice of Ben Bridwell, Band Of Horses make dreamy folk music ala Fleet Foxes and My Morning Jacket. Alternating between cushiony pop, unabashed folk and guitar rock, ""Cease To Begin"" cuts a wide swath musically. Sometimes the jumps can be jarring, like when the bashing guitars of ""Cigarettes Wedding Bands"" slips into the country ballad ""Window Blues,"" complete with a banjo. There's a great opener in ""Is There A Ghost"" that mixes both the dream-pop with an eventual cascade of guitsr, combing the band's strength in the best offering here. What ties this all together is Bridwell's voice and an uncanny sense of melody; even his brashest songs have underlying hooks. Add some really gorgeous harmonies (""Window Blues"" again), you get one of those indie bands earning their cred the hard way, by working outside the system. ""Cease To Begin"" is a relaxed and understated album."
,B000YN32BM,-1,-1,3,"3 1/2

Effective sophomore continues expanding their countrified rock sonic's but is too short to afford the few underwhelming tracks I detected."
,B000YN32BM,1,1,4,"I at first dismissed BoH as a weak knock off of other bands, but I have to say that they proved me wrong.  This is a strong album that is fun to listen to.  And I now admit going back to their first album, it is much better than I initially thought.  Their songs and albums are short, but they are tight and melodic.  I actually like that this album, and their previous one, is strong throughout, without weaker songs added simply to extend the length.  They do write much more ""pop"" songs than other ""indie"" bands, and I expect BoH has much more mainstream appeal because of this, but that's not always a bad thing."
,B000YN32BM,1,1,4,"The opening track (Is There a Ghost) is absolutely sublime.  The rest of the album never quite hits this peak, yet maintains a nice, mellow vibe, with good songwriting, strong guitars, and haunting vocals.  As other reviewers have pointed out, there are echoes of other indy rock bands but this really didn't bother me---Band of Horses clearly has their own identity.  This is easily in my top 10 favorite albums of 2007."
,B000YN32BM,1,1,5,"This is hands down, one of the best albums of the year. I still haven;t taken this out of my car's CD player since it went in a month ago. The vocals are brilliant. They really stand tall among the other indie rock bands."
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,Good song
,B000YN07XI,-1,1,5,"Beautiful music, lousy words.  Should be re-written."
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,great song
,B000YN07XI,-1,1,5,As another reviewer said - appreciate this for the music and not the lyrics - good god they're awful!  It's too bad - ugh!  I was able to find a cover site and remove all of the vocals and keep everything else as is.  Aaaah - now it sounds better.  :)
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,"Again, used this for a Firefighter video background music to the photo's of live scenes the non-profit community based organization for the community to see first hand what they did to protect and save lives and property.  No video was sold, just used as PR."
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,"I've always loved the group: 'Iron and Wine' and this song has been my favorite of all time. Thanks to Amazon.com to have had it.

Denise Fontaine"
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,"I dig this song so very much!!! The lyrics make me scratch my head though...lol. The melody, the vocals, the instruments, all work together so well. A very ( lovely?) song. Love it!!"
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,Downloaded multiple songs to upload to my phone. This has become a stress reliever for me at work to plug in my headphones and escape from the madness. I recommend this song to anyone looking for an escape.
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,this is the best rendition of this song to date. Of course it helps being features in Twilight movies. Was a great backgrounf to the wedding.
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,When I watch my favorite movie and I got it in my head ....I play it over and over . I really love it
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,I first heard this beautiful melody in the movie Twilight. It was remixed for the wedding scene in the movie Breaking Dawn - Part 1. A romantic masterpiece.
,B000YN07XI,1,1,5,"This is a great song, lyrically beautiful and matched well with the music.  It is a shame when people use it for other maneuvers to make money."
,B000YN32BM,1,1,4,"Last year, Band of Horses released a truly impressive debut album ""Everything All the time"", containing several instantly classic songs like ""The Funeral"" and ""The Great Salt Lake"". Despite pretty much non-stop touring since them the guys are back already with a new album.

""Cease to Begin"" (10 tracks, 35 min.) is an equally impressive album. The opener ""Is There A Ghost"" starts off very BoH-like, only to crash into electric guitars and very up-tempo about 1 minute into the song, bringing the message that these guys have expanded their musical pallet. ""Ode to Lag"" follows, with equally strong music. The good tracks keep coing: ""No One's Gonna Love You"" is a great pensive tune, as is ""Detlef Schrempf"" (yes, he the German former NBA basketball player), and ""The General Specific"" closes the first half of the album, an exuberrant tune. After a short instrumental, the second half kicks off with a rousing ""Islands On the Coast"", followed by a great, somber ""Marry Song"", with superb underlying keyboards. Yet the best is still to come! ""Cigarettes Wedding Bands"" is THE stand-out track of the album, sure proof how much BoH has matured musically in just a year's time. The closer ""Window Blues"" is too twangy/country for my liking, and the least interesting track on the album.

""Cease to Begin"" is an outstanding album, and equal, if not better, than ""Everything All the Time"". They have not so much abandoned their early-My Morning Jacket-soundalike style, but expanded on it, to great effect. I've had the good fortune of seeing Band of Horses last year during the ""Everything All the Time"" tour, and if you have a chance to see these guys in concert, don't miss them, you will be blown away. Meanwhile ""Cease to Begin"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,I think that this music is used in all of the Bourne movies- how did I miss it?  It's a great tune! Enjoying it very much.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,"I fell in love with this piece of music during the end credits of Bourne Legacy.  I didn't think about it again until I was browsing for something else.  For me, it brings to mind the emotional connection of the male and female leads of the movie."
,B000YNK6DO,1,1,5,"I have loved this song since I first heard as the first episode of ""Enterprise"" began."
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,"I love this version.  It's sounds so much more intense than the earliest one, which is appropriate since ""Jason Bourne"" is more intense than ""The Bourne Identity"".  Definitely recommend this one."
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Love this song
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,I love it.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Great movie and song.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,great sound for a great series of movies.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Awesome from the movie.  Cool song
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Moby is a genius. I hope I run into him someday so I can tell him.
,B000YNNTWY,1,-1,3,"one tune that's all you get
there must be 6 versions of this out now"
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Awesome movie song.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,good
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,"This is one cool song by Moby. I like some of Moby's music and this one is the best song from him since I heard his music from Play. It has a cool Rhythm to it, it sounds like a song from today's James Bond movie's. A tune that is tough, and makes you feel like you are apart of the Borne Legacy. Listen to the MP3 sample, you will love it."
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,"I like this song, but I like the movies also."
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Its a calming song.
,B000YNNTWY,-1,1,4,"This was for my aerobics on MP3, and the 5th star is missing only because I'm an old geezer from the Sixties. But, this version for Legacy is less harsh in the vocals than the original first films, and lacks nothing for envisioning that beach run from Supremacy, and that's where it takes my vision and motivation. If you have seen those films, even without Legacy, (and maybe especially without it), this one should keep pace. Good Works to you, where ever you turn it on. ~ww"
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Great tune.  I want the instrumental
,B000YNNTWY,-1,1,4,I like it a lot.  Still trying to buy the instrumental version.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,The Bourne Legacy was taylor for this song or the song was taylor for the movie...love the remixes
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Awesome song........for an Awesome Movie......z
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,Even the latest one without Damon was impressive. They are all great action flicks and nice to enjoy once a year or so.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,A very good song and I encountered no issues downloading this song and the sound quality was as expected. Recommended
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,4,I heard the song when I watched the film and wanted to have it in my driving music mix. You pretty much know if you like it. :)
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,I like the movie and at the end of the movie the song I like comes on and I like the actor as we'll.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,This is a faster beat song. I'm sure you will like it too! Try listening to some song samples on Amazon.com to hear what great music Moby has.
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,I love this song.  It is prefect not only for the movie  but you can just dance to it too
,B000YNNTWY,-1,-1,3,Loved the movie and just had to have the movie score. I would have preferred Matt but still loved the concept. Can't say much more about it sorry. I was just an ok movie for me. Sorry
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,4,"Would had given it 5 stars except I though the price was too high.  I understand artist have to
make a living but come on!"
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,"Exactly like the soundtrack! Really enjoyed this one. Would recommend this to all ""Bourne"" enthusiatics.. Downside: still cannot understand some of the words."
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,"Heard this song again the other night while watching the Bourne Legacy and was reminded of how much I like it.  So I had to have it.  It will also make a great driving or excercise !  I plan to get the instrumental version too.  Moby is a unique artist!  I love the fact that Amazone has any song I can think of and my musical tastes are quite diverse.  There's nothing typical about it even if I do say so myself.  Also love that all my music is safe on Amazon's cloud.  Had a computer virus in April, my first ever, and I would hate to think of the songs and money I would have lost when my computer had to be reeset to it's factory default. boy was that a nightmare.  Check out the song!"
,B000YNNTWY,1,1,5,"This track provides the trademark sound that is associated with the Bourne movie franchise...usually at the end.  I decided to download this track after I watched Bourne Legacy.  It's got a riveting sound, and the distinctive violin intro is fantastic.  This track gives the impression of impending danger, triumph, and the unlikelihood of beating unbeatable odds.

5 stars"
,B000YOIQEY,1,1,5,"I've been listening to this album on and off for over a year now, and I just keep coming back to it. It's one of the best recordings of choral music I know. This is quite a remarkable achievement since a pairing up of Mozart and Gabriel Faur&eacute; really shouldn't work. But it does work, and work wonderfully.

Mozart's Vesperae Solennes blends into Faur&eacute;'s Requiem so seamlessly that the first few times I listened to the album, I had to check the track listing to make sure whether the Mozart had ended and the Faur&eacute; begun yet.

They do sound different, don't get me wrong, with over a hundred years between them. But both works, performed beautifully by The Sixteen (the choir) and the Academy of St-Martin-in-the-Fields, radiate a warm tranquility, and this mood carries over seamlessly from one to the other, across a century.

A really great disc, highly recommended."
,B000YOXQXK,1,1,5,Chuckii can get anyone in the mood to dance.  This is a clean R&B song that will live on and on and on...
,B000YQ3XQI,1,1,5,Awesome track! Great sound and definitely brings back memories. Classic and fun song makes me think of the video from the 90`s.
,B000YQUOGU,1,1,5,"SUFFER is a AMAZING HARDCORE album!!!!! All the songs are totally RAW, FAST with brilliant lyrics and a REAL PUNK ATTITUDE!!!!!!!!!! Maybe my favourite from the legendary BAD RELIGION.......TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
,B000YQUOGU,1,1,5,"This is the first MASTERPIECE by BAD RELIGION!!!! SUFFER is a brilliant moment in the fast punk music history...All the songs are raw and brilliant, the lyrics are angry and genious with the total classics DO WHAT YOU WANT, BEST FOR YOU and SUFFER!!!!!PERFECT! BRILLIANT!!!"
,B000YQUOGU,1,1,5,"This is a terrific album, there's a lot of energy and Bad Religion never sounded so aggressive and melodic at the same time. One of the essential BR albums."
,B000YQUOGU,1,1,5,"It is amazing how much melody and tunefulness Bad Reluigion can induce into these breakneck-speed punk classics. Every song is catchy enough to play in your head afterwards. Greg Graffin's lyrics are intelligent and reasonable without trying to be too clever or witty. There are absolutely no fillers on this album. This mixature of melodic punk and hardcore is highly recommended for any punk rock fans. Also, although I haven't heard the original, the remastering seems to work wonder, because this ROCKS."
,B000YQUOGU,1,1,5,....but I'm start thinking that bad religion is the greatest punk band on earth....they rule dude....maybe their sound changes in lil' bits but is great....this album deserves everything......just you're(govt...) deserves everything.....so buy it sucka!....
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,GREAT
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,"Think everyone knows this song by now, pretty much their quintessential hit"
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,Was exactly the track I was looking for.
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,"Amazon is the place to get music, TV show and movies"
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,Good
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,great song
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,love the tune to it lyrics are ok.
,B000YQZQUY,1,-1,3,no review
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,Great song
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,great
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,4,"I love this song. However, I can't listen to all of their music because it mostly sounds the same to me. Two songs, and I'm maxed out. Great workout tune though!"
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,4,"With it's use in movies like ""The Departed"" and in commercials for Samuel Adams beers, this track has become something of an unofficial anthem for the city of Boston. It's Irish influences are front and center and there's a hard rocking feel to it that always gets me pumped up. The only slight distraction is that the words aren't so much sung as screamed. I don't mind a bit of yelling in a song when it feels right, but personally I prefer if it's reserved for only key parts of the song rather than every point at which there are lyrics. So it's not a song you can sing along to, but you can certainly drunkly scream along to it."
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,4,The only complaint I have is that the song is not long enough.  It is my ringtone for my sister who lives in Boston.
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,4,"Good, strong Irish rock. Perfect for getting you moving.

This song has a lot of energy to it and is what I use to get myself going when I have a day of work in front of me that I don't feel up to doing. It makes you want to get up, move, and conquer the world.

Good song. Should be on everyone's playlist."
,B000YQZQUY,-1,1,5,Really like this song....makes me want a beer! Some of the other tracks on album are not to my liking.
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,Great song and great band.  The ability to download music quickly and reasonable is great. Love their music and will definitely get more.
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,This like many other songs speak to me.  Great artist and song.  What more can I say about this music?
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,I love the Irish kick to this song; it makes you want to move to the music! An interesting and original type of music.
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,"Fast upbeat Party tune. Fid myself playing it alot when Boston Play's the Rays. Go Ray's :) Good Tune.
-=-  GodisaDJ.com -=-"
,B000YQZQUY,1,1,5,"Maybe it's overdone, but this is my favorite Dropkick Murphys song. It's got such a lively beat and an Irish feel."
,B000YR7DOK,1,1,5,Serious jam.
,B000YR7DOK,1,1,4,good song.
,B000YR7DOK,1,1,5,Diggin it! Don't know how I missed this when it came out.
,B000YR7DOK,1,1,5,awesome song
,B000YR7DOK,1,1,5,I loved this song the first time I heard it on How I Met Your Mother.
,B000YR7DOK,1,1,5,"Great tune! As always, music preference is just that, one person's preference. Suffice it to say, I enjoy the calming effect this song has on my soul."
,B000YSUPVW,1,1,5,"Marie Osmond's voice is pure and fresh, so reminiscent of Karen Carpenter. I'd recommend this one for anyone who loves the Osmonds."
,B000YSUPVW,1,1,4,"I have never been a fan of the Osmonds and over the years have never bought any albums by any of the Osmonds.
Marie has put together a good album. As one review stated she has something for just about any listener. I don't care for the harmony. I have never liked the type of harmony the Osmonds are fameous for doing.
Marie however has a great voice and this CD will get you into the Christmas mood.
Marie has released a new updated version of this album with four new songs.
I have bought it and recommend it to you as well............"
,B000YSUPVW,-1,-1,2,"I am a big Marie fan (since 1976!) but this christmas album is just plain BAD. She scoops the notes all over the place and well, YUK. She's never sounded more like Kathie Lee Gifford than on this CD. I want my $ back because I'll never listen to this again."
,B000YUHZBI,1,1,4,Classic bridal music
,B000YUHZBI,1,1,5,This is an extremely well done recording.  I was looking for an MP3 recording of Pachebel's canon and this was exactly what I wanted to hear.
,B000YUHZBI,1,-1,3,It is a classical that evokes emotion. excellent.
,B000YUHZBI,1,1,4,You know the song.  We had it played at our wedding.  It's nice to have a recording.
,B000YUHZBI,1,1,5,"So famous and wonderful is this piece, all living creatures with ears might enjoy hearing it in their own way. My dog did."
,B000YUHZBI,1,1,5,"Everyone loves this simple tune of exquisite beauty. I will never tire of hearing it, and this is an excellent recording."
,B000YUHZBI,1,1,5,What's not to love about such a beautiful classic piece of music.  We're playing it at my daughter's wedding and this is a lovely rendition.
,B000YUNNUU,1,1,5,I downloaded this because my girlfriend wanted this as her ringtone for her phone.  She loves it and it was easy to do.
,B000YUNNUU,1,1,5,"What can I say?  Every time it came on the XM radio, I would turn the speakers up and enjoy every second of it.  So much so that I finally decided I needed an MP3 of it."
,B000YZSG1Q,1,1,4,"Currently Emilie Autumn's image/music tends towards... well, the best description I can come up with is Tim Burtonesque, industrial-goth-doll. But her debut album had a vastly different flavor -- while it has the same dark edges and spatterings of industrial rock here and there, ""Enchant"" is a more romantic, Victorian/medieval album.

It opens with an ethereal, twinkly expanse of sound, and Autumn intoning the first four lines from Shakespeare's 53rd sonnet. Then she launches into a starry rendition of her own poetry: ""Across the sky/I will come for you/If you ask me to/Demystify/Your uncommon dreams/Stranger things have come True...""

That opening song may give you the impression that Autumn is a sort of Delerium/Enigma artist, but she quickly proves that it's not the case. Instead, she dabbles in a little of everything: hard-rock in ""Chambermaid"" and the blaring ""Heard It All,"" some spacey jazz in ""Second Hand Faith,"" rambling piano ballads in ""Castle Down"" and ""Ever,""  dramatic string-soaked ballads in ""If You Feel Better"" and ""Save You."" It ends with the satiny ""Epilogue: What If,"" which just reinforces that Autumn is not someone you can pin easy labels on: ""What if I'm a snowstorm burning/What if I'm a world unturning/What if I'm an ocean, far too shallow, much too deep?""

Among the best songs are a trio of pop songs  which have a sort of medieval/fairy-tale flavor: ""Rapunzel"" is a bittersweet song about... well, Rapunze; and ""Juliet"" is an exquisite, glittering swirl about... well, Juliet. And ""Rose Red"" swings between a spiky pop sound (""Tell me no stories and I'll tell you no lies/No one wants to hurt me/but everybody tries!"") and a luscious ye-olde one (""Rose Rose Rose Red/Will I ever see thee wed?/Only if you can capture me"").

I probably could have guessed that ""Enchant"" was Autumn's first album without even checking wikipedia -- it sounds like she was experimenting with different styles and trying to figure out which one fit her best. You can hear some romantic goth, classical, hard-rock, jazz and a bit of Regina Spektor's anti-pop here. But ""Enchant's"" different styles flow easily into one another.

This is mainly because of Autumn's classical musical skills -- she winds silken strings of piano and violin around almost every song, along with some shimmering keyboard and the occasional blasts of electric guitar. The entire album has a sort of rock'n'roll Victorian-romantic flavor, and quite frankly that combination is something I wish there was more of.

Her voice is also very lovely and versatile: she can sound punky, angelic, or low and powerful. And her lyrics and poems are very evocative and atmospheric (""But would you tear my castle down/Stone by stone/And let the wind run through my windows/'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose""), and tinged with a sense of bittersweet romance.

While it explores various musical styles, ""Enchant"" has a distinctive flavor that shows off Emilie Autumn's talents -- and leaves you wanting to see whatever else she's produced."
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"I want this song played at my wake.if you come be ready to rock out,we are gonna party big time.lol"
,B000Z1GR9C,-1,1,5,"Actually released in 1969 his one-hit wonder is familiar from films, ads and TV shows.  A nice encomium for the 60s."

,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,Great album I would highly recommend it.
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,LOVE this song. Can't stop listening to it.

,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,Spirit in the sky!
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,good song
,B000Z1GR9C,-1,1,5,"Great tune!  I like being able to download MP3s on Amazon but I'm disappointed that some songs play fine and others the volume is much too quiet, or in the rare case, too loud. I miss the fact most of the songs used to be $0.99 and now they are mostly $1.29 too."
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,good music
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"good upbeat song one of my fav,s"
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,love this song
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,A great song for any era with catchy lyrics and funky guitar work that makes you sit up and take notice.
,B000Z1GR9C,-1,-1,3,Like it but can only stand it a few times before leaving it for 6 months then coming back
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"As music goes, the download was smooth, the quality of the conversion was flawless to the novice ears, and when played on multiple devices, to include an mp3 disc where I had over 200 songs made no differencethe quality was spot on.  Amazon has delivered yet another fine conversion and I love the fact that the songs I have purchased are backed up on their cloud.  What a great throwback, I love it, and I enjoy the massive selection offered by Amazon!

The services offered via Amazon are great and their music selections are massive and I love how easily I can choose while operating multiple or from any device!"
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,great
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,AS GOOG AS EVER.
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,Classic
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,Great music love amzon it so nice to order from
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs.
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"Love this song brings me way back to my youth, could listen all day, come on for crying out loud"
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,Spirit is what this song is all about.  I never know if it's being mocking at religion or sincere.  But I don't care as it is infectious and makes me smile and want to dance.  It's as fun for me today as ever.
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,Top ten in the late 60's early 70's. This young man had a vision of what was coming and voiced his concern. May his soul rest in peace.
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,4,"A classic rock and roll single that you don't hear too often on the radio. I heard it the other day on a 're-run of the TV show ""Supernatural"" and couldn't get it out of my head. Now I don't have to hunt it down."
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,Good song from the seventies that mixes good rock and roll with a touch of gospel. Will have you singing in in your head for days lol.
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"Fantastic, back to the 70's, what more than fantastic can I say.............buy it you will love it. I have it in my car an I rock to it daily."
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"This is an old favorite from my youth.  It was one of those ""one hit wonders"" and the singer just seemed to fade away.  A friend of mine saw him at a party recently and was telling me about how he sounds as good as he did then.  So, I ordered it as a blast from the past and I really enjoy hearing it again."
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"Boy, talk about one hit wonders. (As far as I know) This was one of those songs I never got tired of and I still don't. From the guitar to those awesome female vocals this is truly a classic in every sense of the word."
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"There are just some songs that make you want to move.  To get up and dance even.  This is one of those songs.

I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own."
,B000Z1GR9C,1,-1,3,The song is awesome but it wasn't cleanly transferred to an mp3.  I am still happy that I purchased it.
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B000Z1GR9C,1,1,5,"How many tunes carry over from the 70's era and are still relevant?
This one is a notch in time that sets the bar in-place, not many make it this far with so many accolades as does Spirit In The Sky, thanks Norman. If you haven't heard it I suggest you try it, that is if you can handle the 70's era music, I can and I like it too."
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,Great song
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,"THis song is so beautiful! Sent it to my step daughter who is 17 waiting patiently to be 18 so she can move in with her boyfriend and start a family.
I added pictures of her from a baby to an adolescent. She loved it, but it didn't slow her down any."
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,"Perfect sound, excellent quality"
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,"Great artist, love his music."
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,Great
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,Great for our party playlist...
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,good song great  artist
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,Also a great song for Preschool parents to listen to as they watch an end of year slide of their preschoolers during the school year.
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,I enjoy the album
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,"Now that I am a Grandpa this song has a lot of meaning for me.
The melody and the lyrics are wonderful, and the way trace sings it - transporting!"
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,Wisdom should be heard from our elders and Trace has some meaningful lyrics in this track. I hope it encourages everyone not to take this time for granted.
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,This is just a great country.  It really gives one (particularly those of us who are parents) a glimpse at time and changes.
,B000Z0HZP8,-1,1,4,its a song
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,"The message in the lyrics is so True...I could just hear an older person saying this to someone younger all the time.  When we're young we don't realize how much we'll miss the times we had.  We're so quick to move on and move ahead....but the time flies, and we do end up missing it.  I appreciated also how the songwriter has different ones telling the other that they're going to Miss the times they have - -  a mother to a daughter, a father to a young bride, a plumber to an anxious mother.  The way Trace Adkins sings the song is magnificent.  I want to keep playing it over and over, I enjoy it so much."
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,how do you relate to writing about a song you buy you buy it because you want the song sometimes this stuff is silly but whatever
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,This came in very handy for a movie I was making. I loved it and would recommend to others good listening
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,I am using this song as a closing tune for my daughter's end-of-year high school basketball banquet slide show.  I am combining this song with pictures of her and her senior teammates as a wrap of their basketball careers.
,B000Z0HZP8,-1,1,5,"Besides that beautiful low voice the songs words mean so much. No Truer words can be spoken. Life goes by too quickly and every little thing you think ""drives you crazy"" or you can't wait for the next step.... only leaves a memory that makes you say how bad you miss how it used to be."
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,I chose this song for my son's high school graduation slide show.  We love the words.  It worked out great!
,B000Z0HZP8,1,1,5,"This song is truly one of the best by Trace Adkins. It's about family and how quickly time goes by.  As a mom myself to teens, I do appreciate this song very much. 'Time flies' is not just an expression and this song reminds us of that.  I must admit when I first heard it literally stopped me in my tracks. It's a reminder to 'just slow down' and  to appreciate the people and time that we have. Thanks again Trace, it's a great song and once again it touched me. As I said ""you're gonna love this"" mark my words!"
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Got this amazing album from an excellent solid band, none other than Type O Negative. Last album to release this record in it's entirety holds a special place to all and any type o fans. Turned my best friend Josh onto this group, he was taken back by the quality of this album, extremely heartfelt in it's own none more negative manner, a real great Christmas gift! Cd came with fast/secure shipping and a great early xmas gift. Highly recommend this seller to anyone that loves Type O!"
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,4,Pretty good like earlier stuff better.

,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"I've been a fan of Type O ever since I first heard ""Blood & Fire"" on my Mortal Kombat soundtrack cassette when I was 10. When Peter Steele died, I felt like I had just lost an uncle. But enough with the biography, let's get on to the review...

I picked this album up when it first came out, and I honestly wasn't very impressed. I liked the fact that they had gone back to the long, complex song structures, but other than that, I really wasn't feeling it.

Recently, I started throwing this album in more often and found myself loving it more and more. At this point, I would have to say that it's my favorite next to Slow Deep and Hard, and Bloody Kisses. Musically, this album is a complete success. Their maturity really shows, and the gothic Beatles-esque melodies that were absent from Life is Killing Me have returned.

I would go so far to label these songs as ""beautiful"". With the exception of Halloween in Heaven (it's waaaay too cheesey), I would give these songs 9 and 10/10 each. My absolute favorites are: September Sun, These Three Things, She Burned Me Down, and Hail and Farewell to Britain. I may even have to say this album is tied for 2nd place with Bloody Kisses only because this album flows better where BK was kind of all over the place stylistically.

All in all, this is a great swansong to Peter Steele's amazingly unique career. Buy this. Set aside an hour or so and listen to this album as a whole. Loudly, I might add. It will not disappoint."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,4,"i can say that i like this album but in no way that i love it. Its not another October rust or Blood kisses . Its just a typical nice album by type o negative. It takes some listening s to like this album, but it worth's the time."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"All of Type O Negative's usual elements are still firmly in place on their seventh full-length. For example, really memorable, Sabbath-inspired guitar riffing, good solos, prominent, grumbling bass lines, Peter Steele's masculine yet limpid vocals (including a baritone that is so deep, it almost matches his bass sound), both humorous and depressing lyrics, creepy keyboards, well-written melodies, bullying grooves, gothic overtones, occasional psychedelic sounds, and solid drumming are all definitely very much apart of the band's famous arsenal.

But there is also an intangible something and feeling of greatness present on 2007's ""Dead Again,"" making it easily their finest release since 1996's iconic ""October Rust."" For one, there should be absolutely no question as to if Type O are just phoning it in and/or recycling old material (which was something that some fans believed to be the case on 1999's ""World Coming Down"" and 2003's ""Life Is Killing Me""), because they now sound as inspired, energetic, and all-around strong as ever! Plus, they can't be said to exactly reinvent the genre here, but thanks to the rather broad and sophisticated songwriting on display here, these 10 songs do possess a fairly refreshing  and unpredictable quality. The album shuffles back and forth between several different moods and genres, including really heavy doom metal, sludge, thrash (thus showing-off Steele's roots in the genre, as a founding member of Carnivore), goth metal, industrial, and progressive and traditional rock. It is viscerally heavy and frequently quite fast, yet (in True T.O.N. style), it also retains a certain level of control and tunefulness throughout. Suffice it to say, this is one very rewarding, well-rounded, and epically epic piece of music. In addition, at 77 minutes in length (!), it should be more than long enough to satiate all fans' appetites for the foreseeable future.

The terrifically ominous and choir-abetted intro of the title track begins thins on a creepy note. It then segues into propulsive speed metal territory -- a rollicking groove, strong bass work throughout, and a sing-song-y chorus to add catchiness. ""Tripping A Blind Man"" works similarly: An old-school Black Sabbath-meets-Eighties thrash (i.e., say, Megadeth) piece with a neat gothic keyboard beginning before suddenly becoming almost crushing and breakneck when blazing tempos, fast guitar leads, and an exceptional solo (near the end) slam onto the scene. ""The Profits Of Doom"" falls somewhere between My Dying Bride, Crowbar, Acid Bath, Deep Purple, and Alice In Chains. It is a slow and extremely progressive, slow-burning, brooding, and trance-inducing epic which nears the eleven minute mark and has thunderous, trudging power chords that weigh a ton, a beefy bottom-end completed by noteworthy, and dirty, grungy-sounding bass lines, and vocals that trade-off between growling, eerie spoken-words, and impressive, proper singing.

On the flip side, ""September Sun"" is a very pretty, somber, textured, tranquil, and emotionally-moving Alice Cooper-esque ballad that is peppered with cool piano keys, melodic strings, and warm and powerful crooning. The lyrics are also worth mentioning here, because they are so sad and dark that it wouldn't be surprising if they leave a lump in the listener's throat. Next up, ""Halloween In Heaven"" is much catchier and more accessible than usual. Here, a memorable, driving, stoner metal-ish main riff is accented nicely by soaring, clean backing female vocals. At fourteen and-a-half-minutes long, song number six, ""These Three Things,"" takes the cake for being the set's pinnacle and is possibly the biggest highlight to be found here. It is an extremely dark, goth-y, and stormy piece based primarily on droning guitars and muscular bass work, but it also makes sure to include numerous different facets, and lots of nice subtleties, atmosphere, and mood-enhancers.

Taking a break from their more experimental side, ""She Burned Me Down"" is more proof that, when they want to, Type O Negative can always kick out pure doom metal with the best of them, and is highlighted by excellent, mesmerizing riffage, emotional vocals, and a fiery and winding guitar solo. ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" again takes things into an up-tempo pace; in fact, one could argue it sounds kind of like a Motorhead tune. It is centered around storming (and sometimes almost punk-y) drumming (including a few bass kicks), call-and-response choruses, and a steadfastly meaty and sludgy bass bottom. The curiously entitled ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" boasts a leather-clad rock `n' roll vibe, tasty, crunchy, lumbering guitars, and Ozzy Osbourne-inspired singing. Finally, the closing ""Hail And Farewell To Britain"" once again downshifts into depressive doom territory, with a bass-heavy mix, big, fat, chugging guitar riffs, lock-step-unison rhythms, and a great keyboard solo.

Cutting to the chase, ""Dead Again"" is, quite simply, one very amazing album, and an essential listen. And it is the sound of a band that is easily firing on all cylinders; hence, contrary to its misleading title, it is also proof that this band has never sounded more alive/lively. However, in an oh-so-cruel twist-of-fate, Peter Steele passed away from heart failure in April 2010, at the age of 48. But even if we are faced with the sad truth that we will now never again hear anything new from T.O.N., at least fans can take solace in the fact that the frontman lead a remarkable career, and unquestionably went out on the absolute top.

R.I.P. Peter, you will be missed."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"I reviewed the green-version CD when it came out.  I'm saddened beyond words at the untimely loss of Peter Steele just last week.  I'm convinced he had a lot of great music ahead of him.  That said, it's my opinion that he went out absolutely on top with ""Dead Again"".  When this disc came out, I listened to it nearly continuously for two years--no lie.  I've never had such a strong reaction to any Type O Negative CD, not even ""Bloody Kisses"" and ""October Rust"", my two other favorites.  While there may be some Type O fans who might disagree with me, ""Dead Again"" is so phenomenal that it's practically beyond criticism.  The ""highs"" have never been higher, and the overall level of quality is tremendous, with the exception of ""She Burned Me Down"" which seems to go on a bit pointlessly.  Standout tracks include ""Dead Again,"" ""Tripping A Blind Man,"" ""Profits of Doom,"" ""September Sun,"" ""These Three Things,"" ""An Ode To Locksmiths,"" and ""All Hail And Farewell To Britain.""

I could be barking up the wrong tree, but I've long thought that Peter Steele has to have had significant exposure to classical music.  This isn't a new opinion for me, but his development as a songwriter suggests to me he was drawing on an awareness of symphonic masters.  Two tracks in particular bear this out.

""September Sun"" is an astonishing song that became something of an obsession.  The very first time I heard track four, I literally groaned and said to myself, ""they can't be serious!""  ""September Sun"" starts like a ""hair band"" power ballad, with a simple nice piano intro--totally not Type O. And then it occurred to me, knowing that this is Peter Steele, this has to be a joke and it's going to get turned inside out and trashed. And actually something very different happens.  Steele does something profoundly Brucknerian with ""September Sun""--he takes a very simple basic theme, expands upon it, puts it through a metamorphosis, and it ends up becoming something far more imposing, grander, astonishing, and even menacing, than you can have even been lead to believe it would become, by the time the song is over nearly 10 minutes later, and really takes you somewhere. ""September Sun"" has to be heard in its astonishing entirety, and for me it is an especially imposing, threatening, beautiful, and entirely unnerving piece of music. It haunts me while still blowing me away.

""These Three Things"" is also a musical standout (I usually don't pay attention to the words, and listening to Peter Steele rant against abortion is more humorous than anything else--and it was not intended as a joke).  At just under 15 minutes, it's the longest song that Type O ever recorded.  And unlike some of their lengthier songs which are really just a collection of several smaller songs strung together, ""These Three Things"" takes musical ideas and works them out over the length of the song, transforming them by the end.  Beyond the drone introduction, the initial section of the song is musically one of the most brutal things that Type O has ever done--relentless, overpowering, and raw.  And then the music takes a 180, introduces a new musical theme, and then transforms it over the remainder of the song.  I wasn't overwhelmed by ""These Three Things"" initially, but almost more than any other song on this CD, it grew on me to the point of becoming one of the very highlights.

I've long had the opinion that ""Dead Again"" is Type O Negative's finest work--which is not to diminish ""Bloody Kisses"" or ""October Rust"" in any way, as great as they are.  In ""Dead Again,"" Type O pushed themselves hard, not settling to re-do what they have already done, and I think they made real breakthroughs and succeeded on every level.

To Peter Steele, let me say this:  THANK YOU, Peter, for giving us such outstanding music.  Words will never express how grateful I am.  I also feel very fortunate to have seen Type O play live numerous times.  You didn't do it by yourself, Type O clearly was a band, not a man with three backup players, but you were the creative force, the vision, and the voice.  I will be listening to your music likely for the rest of my life, and I have no doubt it will stand the test of time.  Many musicians have made a name for themselves, but few have had the capacity for such an original vision, and the talent to achieve it.  You did, and I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart.  At the end of several of a number of Type O's concerts, you would say right before leaving, while grasping your heart, ""Thank you, for without you, we are nothing,"" and it never came across as anything but heartfelt.  Hearing more about you after your passing, about your truly humble nature, I am more sure than ever that those words were your truth.  But my truth is, it was not you in our debt, but the other way around.  We are lucky to have had you sharing your gift with us.  Thank you, Peter.  If there is an ""other side"" (and I have a hard time believing there is), I hope you had a good journey and are at peace.  You deserve it.  Peace, Green Man."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Type O Negative definitely sped up their music a notch. their early work, up to October Rust, was slow and heavy, but they have gotten heavier over time. to me, it sounds like they mixed a little Danzig into their music. somewhere, it was said that they were influenced by Sisters of Mercy and Bauhaus. evidently, they are also influenced by Black Sabbath and Danzig as well, the 1st and second songs are faster than previous works, and Peter Steele's baritone voice is replaced by the band's melodic singing. on song no. 3, Peter adapts a hardcore voice at first, and then his signature baritone voice is on and off. he must have been reading the Bible, because the song is about the Apocalypse. one minor complaint is that the lyrics are hard to read, but they make up for it with excellent musicianship. this album is hour and 17 minutes long and the third song alone is 10 minutes long. this is an interesting listen."
,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,4,"Type O Negative's most recent album, ""Dead Again"" gets re-released and repackaged with a bonus DVD.  For those who have already picked up ""Dead Again"", this new edition is only worth picking up for die hard fans of the band.  The bonus DVD includes the live Wacken performances of fan favorites ""Kill You Tonight"", ""Love You to Death"", ""Anesthesia"", and ""Christian Woman"", along with the videos for ""The Profits of Doom"" and ""September Sun"".  An interview with the band is included as well, but it's nothing special, even though it concludes with Josh Silver touring Coney Island, which is actually pretty funny.  As for the album itself, you can check my old review for a more detailed take on it, but other than the DVD and new red colored cover, this is the same ""Dead Again"" that you picked up last year.  That's not a bad thing for more casual or new fans to the band who haven't picked up ""Dead Again"" yet, of which by all means this is the edition to pick up.  Other than that though, unless you are a die hard fan who needs to own everything Type O Negative, or you don't own ""Dead Again"" at all, this re-release isn't all that worth picking up."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,4,"Type O is one of my favorite bands, and their album ""October Rust"" is my all-time favorite album. For a band with such a self-deprecating sense of humor and such a choppy musical history, Type O Negative creates powerful, emotional music that transcends the goth stereotypes it wallows in (and helped create). And Peter Steele's dark vocals, once sort of a gimmick, have become integral to their brooding sound.

Anyway, like I said, ""October Rust"" is the best album ever. But the follow-up, ""World Coming Down"", was rather disappointing. I was losing hope for the band when their last album, ""Life Is Killing Me"", turned out to be a significant improvement. While not as uniformly brilliant as ""Rust"", it had some excellent songs and brought back their sense of humor. So I had high hopes for the newest release, ""Dead Again"".

The album is surprising in a lot of ways. First of all, many of the songs are much faster than previous Type O material. Peter doesn't sing quite so deep and gloomy this time around, and guitarist Kenny Hickey does much more singing than before. A few songs break the ten-minute mark, something they haven't really done since their first record. And while much of their sound remains typically Type O, many of the lyrics deal with new themes and ideas.

According to recent interviews, Peter Steele has returned to his Catholic upbringing, and so much of the album deals with Christianity and religion. ""The Profit of Doom"" uses an asteroid striking the Earth as a metaphor for the Apocalypse. ""These Three Things"" deals with abortion and the Jewish state of Israel. ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" offers a rather twisted version of Genesis. ""Halloween in Heaven"" is a bit lighter in tone, dealing with all the dead great musicians playing a concert in Heaven. And as usual, some of the songs are simply about Peter Steele himself and his personal problems. The title track ""Dead Again"" is about drug addiction, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" deals with his anger management issues.

Thankfully, their sense of humor has not disappeared or been overwhelmed by the serious subject matter. I laughed out loud at some of the song titles, such as ""Tripping A Blind Man"" and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow,"" and several songs have some hilarious lines. Among my favorites:

""I had no pulse last time I checked / I'd trade my life for self-respect"" (from ""Dead Again"")

""Elvis ain't dead, so he isn't here"" (from ""Halloween in Heaven"")

""If only I'd known how cool death is / I'd have killed myself sooner"" (from ""Halloween in Heaven"")

And let's not forget their album liner notes. The band photo from Life Is Killing Me featured four sets of feet with toe tags on them. Not to be outdone, Dead Again shows a picture of four mangled chalk outlines opposite photos of skeletons inside coffins. And in the section for equipment used, it says ""Type O Negative has yet to learn how to use the following equipment."" I always get a kick out of that sort of thing.

Even though I think ""Life Is Killing Me"" had some better individual songs than ""Dead Again"", I think ""Dead Again"" is a better album as a whole.  The whole tone of the album sounds more concise and uniform.  But that's just me.  It is a bit on the long side, but that's my only real complaint.

As a whole, fans of Type O should be happy with this release. The band they know and love has clearly matured over the years, but their style is undeniably intact. However, some people might be put off by the religious content of many of the songs. People bravely hoping for a return to ""October Rust"" territory will surely be disappointed as well. That era is gone, folks."
,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,4,"Musically, ""Dead Again"" features some of the most ambitious, memorable songs in Type O's career.  The formula hasn't exactly changed, but these songs for the most part match up to past classics.  However, lyrically, this is easily Peter Steele's worst work ever, and oftentimes the inane lyrics detract from the emotional power the arrangements inherently have.

There are several reasons this might be the case.  For instance, it's quite possible that all Peter knew how to write about were the typical Type O topics: death, romance, wolves, fire, etc... The lyrics on this release instead attempt to make real inspirational/thoughtful and moral statements.  That in itself is not the problem, nor is the fact that apparently now Catholic Steele preaches his newfound faith through several of these songs.  The problem is that the lyrics are usually either simple and literal (""I'm a drug addict, always will be"", ""there's no excuse for drug abuse"", ""A child is torn from the womb unbaptized, there's no question it's infanticide"") or pun-filled attempts at humor (""Turn your cheek, gets ripped off, that's why we're given four"").  The song ""Ode to Locksmiths"" actually has the line ""Now I know why girls hate boys,'cuz Eve was in fact raped"".  It seems painfully obvious that Steele's faith is hardly sincere (more out of fear of death than anything) and that he's only preaching because he feels he should, not because he really believes in what he says, judging by the tired and sometimes ridiculous points he tries to make.  Steele himself even said in an interview that he had a hard time finding lyrical inspiration for this album.  A few of the tracks have decent lyrics, such as ""September Sun"" but most, being long songs, have their fair share of good and bad parts.  Only 2 become unlistenable, ""She Burned Me Down"" and ""Halloween in Heaven"".

Other than that, this is a much more energetic and punky Type O than we've had in a while.  Nearly all of the songs have some sort of throw back to their early days, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" is fast throughout.  Many of the songs are quite positive, also... this may be the least depressing album in their career.  Even the World Coming Down-esque ""These Three Things"" has a triumphant finale.  There's no question to me that the drama in their songwriting has improved... all of the epics on this album truly build energy and go somewhere.  Kenny's guitar work seems more Sabbath-inspired than ever before, and although the guitar tone has lost the signature, thick, flanged tone, the combination of Steele's vocal melodies and Silver's organ textures still creates the signature Type O sound.  The songs are full of tempo changes just like the Type O epics of old (""Black No. 1"") but there seems to be a logic and flow present in these songs that just wasn't there in those days.  The album is incredibly consistent, and has no filler and is easy to listen to all the way through despite its length.

In conclusion, ""Profits of Doom"", ""These Three Things"", ""Ode to Locksmiths"" and the haunting closer ""All Hail and Farewell to Britain"" with its excellent ambient outro all contain some of my favorite Type O moments.  I'd recommend ""Dead Again"" to any Type O fan who doesn't put too much importance in the lyrics."
,B000Z7S78U,-1,-1,1,"I was very disappointed with this release.  The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band.  The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.

The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'.  I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie ""Wedding Singer"". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like.  I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.

Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better.  Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses.  I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.

The Dream really is dead."
,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,5,"It's been a long time since Type O Negative have been on the scene. Too long, as a matter of fact. 2003 saw the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Is-Killing-Me/dp/B00009PJPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Is Killing Me</a>&nbsp;and the band seemed to all but vaporize since. Rest assured, however, the boys from Brooklyn are back, and frontman Peter Steele has gone through enough of a personal Hell to inspire one of the best albums of their career. ""Dead Again,"" Type O's seventh studio album sounds just as fresh as the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloody-Kisses/dp/B000000H6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloody Kisses</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/October-Rust/dp/B000000H57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">October Rust</a>, leaving no fan disappointed in it's wake.

At the risk of sounding like a fanboy, I must say that this album totally blew my mind. Listening to it, I get the same feelings I did when I took my first listen of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloody-Kisses/dp/B000000H6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloody Kisses</a>&nbsp;oh so many years ago. It's hard to believe how long these guys have been at it, and that they have yet to get stale or boring. Whether it's the triumphant opening title track, or the gloomy ballad, ""September Sun,"" Type O Negative touch on all their previous material here, while still keeping it relevant. Others like ""Tripping A Blind Man,"" ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" and ""She Burned Me Down"" are the cream of the crop, with their punch-in-the-gut riffs that bring back old school Black Sabbath (something that Type O are the best at). Even a song like ""These Three Things,"" which clocks in at over fourteen minutes, is impossible not to enjoy. And if I'm not mistaken, I can hear a bit of confidence in Steele's voice like never before. For the first time, he truly sounds like he is releasing his demons through his music.

""Dead Again"" is quite possibly the most accessible Type O Negative record available. Granted, you're not going to be hearing this stuff on the radio much, but if you were ever a Type O Negative fan, there is surely something here for you. They are one of the few bands that can create an album that matches their earlier work without it sounding like a shameless rehash. This is easily the most inspired Type O have been in ten years. Everyone who cares for this band owes it to themselves to own a copy of ""Dead Again."""
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Few would have guessed that Type O Negative would still be developing and improving after all these years. Sure, this album may not contain any obvious classics, and some longtime fans may complain that distinctness and variety are missing from the band's most recent work. But at the level of an entire album, Dead Again is the most consistent and accomplished release of Type O Negative's career. The band's wild-and-wooly past achievements, not to mention Peter Steele's darkly odd sense of humor, are still represented here in ""Dead Again,"" ""Halloween in Heaven,"" and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow."" But otherwise, many of the songs on this album show great strides in the Type O game plan, and as an overall statement this album is a punishing display of sonic architecture and mood manipulation. The playing is better than ever before, with guitarist Kenny Hickey and drummer Johnny Kelly toughening up their attacks considerably. Kenny's throat-shredder vocals are also utilized with great success, offering effective counterpoints to Peter's always grave-rattling lower baritone. There is some intrigue in the songwriting department as well, including the dramatic quasi-ballad ""September Sun,"" which includes a surprisingly romantic piano intro from Josh Silver.

Meanwhile, Type O's songs are getting longer and longer overall, and here the lengthy compositions offer the band room for True musical exploration, rather than just repetition. This album's pinnacle is surely the sinister epic ""The Profit of Doom,"" while the 14-minute apocalypse ""These Three Things"" actually manages to stay musically fascinating throughout its entire length (though it tends toward Tool-ness in places). One source of static here may be the lyrics, as Peter's eccentric manic-depressive humor has been largely replaced by esoteric neo-Catholic theology, particularly in ""An Ode to Locksmiths"" and the aforementioned ""These Three Things."" Also, many reviewers seem to be picking out one song that doesn't quite work, and I would nominate the sluggish ""She Burned Me Down,"" which isn't quite the epic slow-burner that it thinks it is. But overall, Type O Negative have nearly two decades of crushing and subversive goth-metal under their belts, and this album shows that they're not even close to slowing down yet. [~doomsdayer520~]"
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,4,"Type O Negative marks a new beginning with ""Dead Again"", their first release since their final album for Roadrunner Records with ""Life is Killing Me"".  ""Dead Again"" finds Pete Steele and co. treading familiar waters, but that's quite alright considering this is what fans have been waiting to hear.  The opening title track provides the quicker paced, rocking opener that kickstarts the album, while ""Tripping a Blind Man"" showcases the band displaying how utterly murky they can sound.  ""The Profit of Doom"", ""She Burned Me Down"", and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" are all great as well; providing just about everything that longtime Type O Negative fans want to hear.  That being said, there's not really anything here that sets itself apart from past material, and when it comes to past albums like ""Slow, Deep, and Hard"", ""Bloody Kisses"", and ""October Rust""; ""Dead Again"" just can't compare.  Despite that though, there's nothing bad about this disc one bit, and between Pete Steele's downtrodden voice and Josh Silver's superb keyboard skills, ""Dead Again"" provides the meat and potatoes that Type O fans have desired."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"TON returns to inject a major dose of truly exceptional musick into the basilar membrane which is both empowering and contemplative, considering the Rasputin theme and aestheics as well. The lyrical theme is entirely seperate to the aesthetic, which makes them both distinct unto themselves:

Musick

Track List: 1. Dead Again 2. Tripping A Blind Man 3. The Profits Of Doom 4. September Sun 5. Halloween in Heaven 6. These Three Things 7. She Burned Me Down 8. Some Stupid Tomorrow 9. An Ode To Locksmiths 10. Hail And Farewell To Britain

Dead Again preserves their evocatively best style, with rhythmically crunching and echoing guitars, haunting cathedral keyboards, the darkly erotic inunciations and deep reverberations from Peter Steele, and the hypnotic beat of the drums all combine to create another Goth-Metal masterpiece akin to Bloody Kisses. As is typical TON, each song takes its time, coursing and describing the emotions, while stimulating a sense of sweet euphoria.

Of note, The Profit of Doom, dealing with The Antichrist Beast of Revelation complete with references to the six triumverate; Halloween In Heaven, a jaunty tune featuring a female voice {Tara VanFlower of Lycia} complimenting Steele's well with a pleasing contrast. September Sun, & These Three Things combine ponderous ballad moments with sudden bursts of energy creating a perfect mix of melancholy and rage.

Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find an additional disc contained inside with a Live recording featuring tracks from Bloody Kisses {Christian Woman, Love You To Death, Black No. 1}, October Rust {Everything Dies / My Girlfriend's Girlfriend}, Slow Deep & Hard, {Gravitational Constant}, and Origin of The [...]{Are You Afraid}, all of which sounds extraordinary.

Overall, Dead Again contains a mutiplicity of content from the art {even the thorny vines on the CD itself is a very nice touch} to the quantity of music, which hearkens to Bloody Kisses and October Rust while standing upon its own merit. Highly recommended.

Aesthetics

The cover art features Grigori Efimovich Rasputin, Mystic, so called ""Holy Devil"" and ""Mad Monk"", deriving from The Khlysty, a sect who practiced self-flagellation, although he disagreed with their masochistic methods and basically became a renegade monk with a penchant for carnal indulgence - from imbibing in copious libations, passionate dance {it was rumored that he even celebrated a phallic cavort with the legendary ample appendage} , to sensual pleasures with many of the local women who admired his extraordinary abilities, as well as his libertine lifestyle, in which he revelled, and was more than willing and able to satisfy on a frequent basis.

His influence pervaded the Russian Aristocracy, wherein he had the Czar and Czarina transfixed. Briefly, extremely fortunate for them, he attained the power to heal, and used that ability to cure the Czar's son Alex, which gained their unyielding loyalty. From the beginning, there were those who resented him, claiming he was in league with The Devil. Through treachorous subterfuge, he was tricked and betrayed, and eventually excarnated after displaying apparent invincibility, to the fear and trepidation of his detractors.

He lived his life to the fullest, attained a passionate joie de vivre, employing lesser magic principles to charm and confound when it served his purposes, and excelled in his chosen endeavors, all of which designates him a de-facto Satanist, in My estimation.

The back cover features the images of Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and Alex, the unfortunate royal children who were assassinated {with the exception of Maria, who would later write a book entitled ""Rasputin: The Man Behind The Myth""} in Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) on 16th July 1918, by the filthy hands of stuporstitious peasants wanting to rid the kingdom of anything to do with Rasputin. The ignorant frightened cowards.

The green font used on the entire album can be a bit distracting, which is something of a Russian version of the English alphabet, with several reversed letters. Also mentionable, the booklet is a fold-out cross design containing full lyrics and liner notes."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Wow.  A stunning release from Type O Negative.  Type O's music in general, and this CD in particular, have moments so astonishing that it just obliterates memories of all the crap music that is around.  This CD reminds me why great music matters so much.  ""September Sun"" is epic grandeur, and along with ""Profit of Doom"", are two particularly exceptional cuts on an overall exceptional disc."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Nothing much to say,but awesome!!!!! ""Bloody Kisses"" and ""October Rust"" stand as my faves.""Life Is Killing Me"" was not bad,but back with a vengeance with ""Dead Again"".Gloom and doom are back!!!! I would have to say ""Halloween In Heaven"" is my fave from the album. But Like ""An Ode To Locksmiths"",""September Sun"",""The Profit of Doom"" and ""Dead Again"".The whole album is real good,but those are my standouts. Pick it up now!!!!!!"
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"This is the long awaited follow up to ""life is killing me"", and it was well worth it.  This is on their new lable SPV, who did a masterful packageing deal with their lyrics being layed out in a cross fold out booklet.  Enough about the exterior, this album dredges up sounds reminiscnet of Slow Deep and Hard and Bloody Kisses Smashed together and angrier than ever. The album has 10 tracks and clocks in at a dredging 77 minutes of Highs and Lows.  Personal favorite tracks are ""Tripping A Blind Man"", ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"", and the best track for me ""Ode To Locksmiths""  a fast and swinging ditty that even dredges memories of Carnivore.  There are two tracks that move in at 10 plus minutes (Profit of Doom, and These Three Things).  These tracks have about 3-4 tempo changes each and would make for great live tracks.  Halloween in Heaven, Dead Again, and Some Stupid Tomorrow will likely be good candidates for singles to push radio play of the group, being the shorter tracks on the album.  Finally, the track September Sun is a close second for my favorite track, a slow burner that is ballad like in only a haunting type o negative way.  The album is mixed brilliantly, just a great venture for these guys.  Buy this album, good intro to the band, and a must for fans.

FYI: for those of you curious about the 5 live tracks available at a large retail store, The CD clocks in at around 44 minutes, and has the tracks Everything Dies/ My Girlfriends Girlfriend, Are you Afraid/Gravitational Constant, Christian Women, Love you to Death, and Black Number One.  This is just a really cool addition. Collectors, run out and grab it!!!!"
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"This Album is a great comeback adter a 4 year lapse from their last release. September Sun is nothing short of brilliant yet beautiful. The whole album speaks what many ( if not all ) feel on day to day basis. I TOTALLY recommend this album if you are a TRUE Type O Negative Fan. The song ""Profits of Doom"" is basically about the end of the world and wether you believe or not. As a previous comment by someone i will not shame, They did not see the relevence of the lyrics at the beginning of the song and what they had to do with the faster half. Obviously someone knows nothing of biblical history or they would. ""These 3 Things"" Is my favorite song on the entire album. This is 1 of their greatest albums yet. Keep up the good work my friends and if you read other reviews they rank this CD low then they are definitely NOT A TRUE TYPE O NEGATIVE FAN! Judge for yourself."
,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Not since October Rust has Type O Negative sounded this fresh and vibrant. Free of the personal demons that created the themes for World Coming Down and Life Is Killing Me(Great albums), Peter Steele and company deliver 77 mins of slow, dirgy sabbath-like metal, with a LOT of punk thrown in this time around(Dead Again, Halloween In Heaven). Kenny does a lot of screaming on this album too...like a lot. It also has its mellow points as well with September Sun. She Burned Me Down is almost like a sequel to Burnt Flowers Fallen, a great track. As a whole, the album will stand the test of time just like their other releases. Great metal record. Without a doubt, if you even consider yourself a fan then you will want this album. TYPE O NEGATIVE DEAD AGAIN

Get it and be happy."
,B000Z7XSRA,1,1,4,"Was searching one day trying to find this song... Compared iTunes to Amazon and on the day of my search Amazon was cheaper, so a no-brainer.  Downolad was easy, the Amazon Cloud Player is cool and the Amazon download merges perfectly into your iTunes library.  It isn't a song I listen to everyday, but it strikes a chord when you feeling the emotion for it."
,B000Z7XSRA,1,1,5,"This song starts with some melancholy piano into which male and female vocal harmonies enter. The male part tends to dominate with the chorus and some strings enter. It makes for a simple but stirring musical statement. The male voice has an untrained quality that has a lot of soul to it.  Toward the middle of the song the orchestra takes a more active role as the song builds to a slow, subtle climax. Mellow piano dominates but with strong orchestral accents."
,B000Z7XSRA,-1,1,5,"I liked this song by the frames, so when I heard this version that is more on the
acoustic side, ithought sounds O.K.! so I downloaded it, the main part of some is still
in tact, the main difference is the girl and piano!!!!"
,B000Z7S7HQ,1,1,5,"I lived through that era and I never heard.  Best song of ""Guardian of the Galaxies'"" Awesome Mix #2.  Check out the write up on it on Wikipedia.  It wasn't named after the drug  (LSD), if anything the drug was named after the Lake Shore Drive experience."
,B000Z7S7HQ,1,1,5,very nice
,B000Z7S7HQ,-1,1,5,KSHE 95fm was only station in St Louis that I know of that ever played this song.
,B000Z7S7HQ,1,1,5,"Worked in Chicago several years ago. The job was difficult bit visiting the city was always a respite for me. The song reminds me of my travels through the city, and yes, ""north on Lake Shore Drive""."
,B000Z7S7HQ,1,1,5,Downloaded this classic song for my phone.  Made this into a ring tone.  Also good to listen to while you're cruising down LSD
,B000Z7S7HQ,1,1,5,"Every once in awhile, when the spirit moves me, I download a classic like Lake Shore Drive. The selections I make rarely disappoint. LSD is no exception!"
,B000Z97UMM,1,1,5,Few people can bring this song to us like Judy Jacobs. It is a wonderful song and I love to hear it over and over.
,B000Z97UMM,1,1,5,When I first heard this song at church I was blown away. As I sat there I said I must have this song. I came home and bought it from Amazon and it is more powerful than when I first heard it
,B000Z97UMM,1,1,5,love the song!
,B000Z97UMM,1,1,5,I love this song and I love the way Judy Jacobs sings it and delivers it.  I praise God for her and this song.
,B000Z97UMM,1,1,5,Beautiful music and uplifting! The words are a blessing to the future of our lives and souls! Truly uplifting and it gets you to sing along with the song!
,B000Z97UMM,1,1,5,Judy Jacobs is a truly gifted singer and I cannot think of another artist who could perform this song with the power thatJudy can. The song is inspirational and uplifting.
,B000Z97UMM,1,1,5,"Pastor Judy sings this song better than anyone else I have heard. My wife was on Hospice and while pastor judy was preaching she removed the oxygen from her nose, jumped out of her wheelchair and ran down the isle.  Thank You Jesus."
,B000Z967IK,1,1,5,"Written from real life experience, I'm told. If so, it shows in the lyrics. Very well done. Clever job with the lyrics, and a strong melody, too."
,B000Z967IK,1,1,5,"Like most people, I discovered this song while watching the show Code Monkeys. After I'd seen that whole show, I got a little interested in the song, and looked it up. Even though I loved the show, I can tell you that Jonathan Coulton's song has now become the much more important to me.

I love it for a couple of reasons. First, it is a tremendously catchy song. It's well played and sung, with a great pop-rock chorus.

Second, it's actually sort of a meaningful song, at least to me. I'm not literally a code monkey, but there's not doubt that I'm a nerd, the proverbial nice-guy who comes in last and can't get the pretty receptionist to pay any attention to me, who works hard in a job that's boring and unappreciated. Goodness, I even like to drink Tab and eat Fritos. I'm not the only person like this. So, I just love it for being a good song acknowledging my experience of the world, while being funny and hopeful, too. It's a great song that I've found myself passing along to my nerd friends who love it, too."

,B000Z9PY0M,1,1,5,"I love this artist. Smooth sounds, makes you enjoy music.  This song was downloaded to my phone . It still sounds very nice."
,B000Z9PY0M,1,1,5,I have always loved this song.  It's been a song instilled in my heart for years.  I will always cherish it
,B000Z9PY0M,1,1,5,I love this song and haven't heard it in awhile and it was nice to just order it on my device and now have it all the time.
,B000Z9PY0M,-1,1,5,"In the midst of our trials and tribulations, we have to stand firm and just tell the storm to move on to somewhere else."
,B000Z9PY0M,1,1,5,I love this song.. when im goin through this song helps me deal with the issues. im glad i have it on my kindle
,B000Z9PY0M,1,1,5,This a powerful and very moving sound. When you listen to the words they minister a very powerful message about and the struggles that comes with living life and letting you know no matter what the circumstances you can overcome what life sends your way.
,B000ZDONOG,1,-1,3,"sound is great I just don't think I like the singer as much as I used to lol. oh well its like that sometimes.. its dumb that you have to write 20 words or more to describe how much you like or dislike something,, lol hope amazon reads these lol."
,B000ZDONOG,1,1,4,You can't beat some timeless classics.  I simply love this song.  Great song to dance to with your loved one.
,B000ZDONOG,1,1,5,"This is and has been, a piece of music that sends a message of compassion to everyone who takes the time to really listen to this song. Beautiful"
,B000ZDONOG,1,1,5,"To my husband Larry for guiding me, helping me and loving me for nearly the last 20 years. Without you I would still be lost in this world. You saw something in me that I am not sure what, but I love you with all my heart no matter where I live. I needed you more. Thanks for holding me when I need it most of the time, handing me a box of kleenex with your shoulder to cry on. My Beliefs: If someone loves you they should never hurt you. Much love your wife."
,B000ZDONOG,1,1,5,Great Nice Song
,B000ZDONOG,1,1,5,Awesome song!
,B000ZDONOG,1,1,5,A wonderful recording. ..one that is timeless. ..listen to it and it is with you all day. ..a real treasure. ..
,B000ZDONOG,1,1,5,"Classic by Anne Murray, words of the song make your heart cry,beautiful voice, enjoy it very much as much as when I first purchased many years ago"
,B000ZDONOG,1,1,5,"As always, Anne Murray sounds great. And I am so proud that Amazon sells so many wonderful CDs to choose from."
,B000ZDONPU,-1,-1,2,Not my style but that's okay.  M-I-L loves Anne Murray.
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Great!
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Good song
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,"Murray is one of a kind, great singer"
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Super!
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Still dancing with the girl I married.
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,No problems.  Thanks!
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Loved it.
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Nice
,B000ZDONPU,-1,1,5,takes you back
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,I'm  a fan.
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Excellent
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,4,"Anne Murray is amazing, and this song really drives that point home.  I know you've heard it. Everyone has heard it. It's one of those songs that just sticks with you, no matter what.

This copy is a great one, enhanced and clean sounding.  You can't beat it for quality (unless you go Vinyl)."
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,This song is perfect for wedding receptions when the bride and groom have their first  dance.  The song asks if the singer and her partner could have this dance last for the rest of their lives.  How perfect for wedding receptions or any other important dance in a person's life!  I am sure other Anne Murray fans have used this  upbeat and positive song for that very purpose.  Others who like her and songs that are easier on the ears will surely enjoy it as well.  This Canadian songbird has a good voice and expression of emotion when she sings.
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Awesome song!
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Great!
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,"Think I have given a review  before, but I love Anne Murray!!!  She has always been a favorite of mine."
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,"I would not buy a song I didn't like well enough to give it 5 stars so writing a review is somewhat pointless. And any Anne Murray fan does not care why I like this song. Sometimes you like a song just because you like it. And to listen to it over and over, I have to like it a lot. Back in the early '80s, we were wearing western style clothes even though we did not favor that look before or since. At that time, I listened to a lot of Anne Murray and this is my favorite of hers."
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Anne Murray has to be one of the all time greats.  This may be her finest and she's a quite a few greats.
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,We purchased this to play at the funeral home during my Dad's viewing in honor of his love and support for his beautiful wife Josie.
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,"Amazon is the place to go when you are looking for your favorite CD. This one by Anne Murray is wonderful to me. It is so nice to know that when I'm looking for any kind of music that I might hear and want a CD copy of it, all I have to do is go to my computer, click on Amazon and soon I'll have it in my hands. Now you can not beat that."
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,This song is so romantic.  I think its greatest appeal is that it's applicable to new romances and romances at every stage.  Anne Murray has such a beautiful voice and this song is so beautiful that it's absolutely timeless.
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,"This is Anne Murray doing what she does best. Not only is she beautiful in her singing, but in her living. Success made her an even greater human being; quite unlike the animals that the celebrity media pander on us. God bless Anne for her example of living life to its fullest despite personal tragedies. She is a True model for our youth today."
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,I love this song it is so great and i am so happy it was able to be downloaded so that i can listen to it when i am swiming. Thanks
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,Just What I Was Looking For! Needed a couple of tunes from this cd to complete a compilation of tracks. Download process super easy. Transaction went smooth!
,B000ZDONPU,1,1,5,We were putting together our own wedding CD and my fiance loves this song. It will be played at our wedding. My mom and a neighbor of ours played this song as their wedding song too and they both will be there.
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,4,"Anne Murray's voice can't be beaten by many. And this song is a wonderful nostalgic song from the past. For me, it's a Christmas song and fit right into my annual mix of Christmas music i make every year"
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs I could listen to it over and over again. The arrangement is so good. Its one of the classics from generation
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,I used to listen to this song whenever I needed to get away from it all. It made me feel like I was floating away from whatever I was doing... at least for a while! A great addition to my iPod.
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,As I've gotten older I've come to appreciate a wider variety of music. I like the melodic tone and it made my vocal playlist.
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,4,I love this little song.
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,Like it.
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,Nice
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,"Anne Murray is love, is life. She has good vocals and a wide range. Good song."
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,no complaints
,B000ZDTP4O,1,-1,3,It is a good song
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,Lovely vocals. Brings back great memories.
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs of the 70s.  Anne Murray has one of those voices that you never forget.
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,Awesome song!
,B000ZDTP4O,1,1,5,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.
,B000ZFTP9C,1,1,5,"This is a neat song, never heard of them before. First heard them on Pandora and just had to have it downloaded. No problems with the download."
,B000ZFTP9C,1,1,5,"This is another song I heard on The Vampire Diaries, but in my defense it was the same episode that I heard the other song that I liked from that show!  Wonderful song.  I hadn't heard of Ron Pope & The District but I am open to more from them if it is like this song.  It is sad and I looove sad music."
,B000ZFTP9C,1,1,4,A friend wanted to know what I thought about this for her wedding song. Downloaded this version to hear the lyrics better. I love this group!
,B000ZFTP9C,1,1,5,LOVE IT!!!!!! This is a fantastic song! I listen to it all the time. Thanks to a friend for suggesting it!
,B000ZJ7KX6,1,1,5,"This set is mostly from the first 4 albums, but their rendition of Zep's ""Good Times Bad Times"" is unbelievably accurate from a baritone (Sully Erna) doing the lead vocal of a tenor (Robert Plant) without transposing the key."
,B000ZJ7KX6,1,1,5,Just another must have collection of Godsmack. When looking at Amazon music please note that many times the CD is cheaper than the MP3 version and most often times the purchase of the CD also gets you an MP3 rip of the music. Best of both worlds!
,B000ZJ7KX6,-1,1,5,all the radio hits?
,B000ZJ7KX6,1,1,5,"Godsmack, yeah!!"
,B000ZJ7KX6,1,1,5,They do this song justice !!
,B000ZJ7KX6,1,1,5,"Great album ,plays great no problems. NoT bad on price either"
,B000ZJ7KX6,1,1,5,awesome if you enjoy rock
,B000ZJ7KX6,1,1,5,"Great collection with lots of my all time favorite songs!  Well worth it unless you want the DVD too, in which case I would recommend purchasing the 2 disk combo for only a few dollars more"
,B000ZJ7KX6,1,1,5,"I luv Godsmack,Excellent cd"
,B000ZJ8NTQ,1,1,5,"I have loved this song since the 1st time I heard it. I think it hits a little deeper in my heart due to the fact that my husband's older brother, who helped raise him, was killed in Vietnam & I never got to meet him."
,B000ZJ8NTQ,1,1,5,A very moving song. I really enjoy songs that have meaning and heart in them. This is one such song. It is an excellent song.

,B000ZJ8NTQ,1,1,5,Gave five stars because I love David Ball's music---he sounds really great.  He needs to do more songs--his voice is really special.  Love him and his music!!!
,B000ZHXER4,1,1,4,"This song was made for fans of the zombie pandemic, it's a hilarious song that just puts elements of your favorite zombie classics into music."

,B000ZK7YKO,1,1,5,"I am not saying anything the others haven't Coulton is awesome. He has something for everyone. My 6 year old son and I love ""princess who saved herself"" and ""re: your brains"". This cover of a cover of his original cover is a great.... cover.... and all the proceeds are going to worthy causes! Coulton is King!"

,B000ZMUV2K,-1,1,5,It's about the only song of Tupac that I've ever listened too. The song has a nice beat to it perfect for club dancing. It's too bad that he died in such a young age who knows what he could have accomplished if he had live.
,B000ZMUV2K,1,1,5,Purchased this track for a friend of mine to make her a CD. Great Success. She loved it. I have stored it for future use.

,B000ZMZCTM,1,1,5,"DAVID SOUL'S SOOTHING VOICE AND LYRICS MAKES ONE FEEL SO GOOD AND COZY INSIDE. A GREAT SONG TO HEAR WITH A GLASS OF WINE, ON YOUR RECLINER. TAKES ME BACK TO FEEL GOOD TIMES OF THE 70'S."
,B000ZMZCTM,1,1,4,"I had to have this song, I loved it as a teenager and I still love it now.  The song is wonderfully done and it brings back great memories"
,B000ZMZCTM,1,1,5,"David Soul is a wonderful singer and ""Don't Give Up On Us Baby"" seems timeless. It's hard to believe it's from the 70's as it sounds very current. It's a beautiful song and this man can sing! If you're a fan of David Soul and/or ""Starsky and Hutch"" you'll love it! A 5 star purchase MP3 song!! Thanks again David for your songs my family and I appreciate them! Now seriously if he and Paul Michael Glaser  would sing together (as both are good singers) we would truly be thrilled. Had to throw that in.*g*"
,B000ZN1ZPG,1,1,5,loved it!
,B000ZN1ZPG,1,1,5,PEACE & LOVE.
,B000ZN1ZPG,1,1,5,I LIKE THIS SONG BECAUSE IT CONTAINS A SAMPLE OF SLEDGEHAMMER BY PETER GABRIEL AND REALLY MAKES THE WHOLE SONG NEAT TO LISTEN TO ALTOGETHER.
,B000ZN1ZPG,1,1,5,2Pac left this world too early. He is still one of the greats. I bought this song as a ringtone to a friend who is a big 2Pac fan.

,B000ZUM2KQ,1,1,4,"Ed Bruce is new to me, but I enjoyed this new album very much. Ed Bruce has been around for a while but I just recently found him and his music and he has been a joy to listen to."
,B000ZUM2KQ,1,1,5,"Since the USA Armed Forces withdrew their radio stations from Europe
we lost the possibility to listen to Country Music. That's why we
also lost track on many artists we knew then. One example is Ed Bruce
a rockabilly singer who was popular in the late 50's and a SUN artist
together with all the great legends like Elvis, Jerry Lee, Roy Orbison,
Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins etc. He was nicknamed ""Jerry Lee Lewis' brother""
He then suddenly ""disappeared"" until I saw him on a DVD Country Family
Show from Nasville; an old grey man with a grey mustache was announced
by Bill Anderson, the host, as Ed Bruce. I couln't believe it! After 43
years this rockabilly star from the heydays of Rock & Roll sat there
and sang a wonderful country song called ""My first taste of Texas"".
I immediately consulted all Billboard books and found out that he
turned to country in 1967 and had built up quite a carreer until 1987.
The next step was to look at Amazon's music chapter and there were
several CD's available being this one the chosen one because of the
previous mentioned ""My first taste of Texas"". Many of the rest of the
songs are great as well. His beautiful deep baritone voice is quite
different from other songs I have from the 50's. A wonderful CD!"

,B00108H3OM,1,1,5,This song brings back memories for me growing up in the 60's. It's a great song. One of those songs that if you were to hear it on the radio you had to stop and sing along. Well worth a buck.
,B00108H3OM,1,1,4,I ordered it because I like it. Just my personal taste
,B00108H3OM,1,1,5,Glad I could find the song I was looking for here.
,B00108H3OM,1,1,5,"This brings back memories of times and places that live only in my imagination. It takes me into a gypsy camp, all dressed up in a long, flowing, colorful skirt, with a peasant blouse, dangly earrings, and bold, gold and silver jewelry. I'm dancing, twirling, laughing, and totally carefree.

But it's also sad, as if saying goodbye to times long past.

I love music that takes me into that gypsy place. It's a powerful place for me, as if in some past life I was there and only remember the happy times.

A kindred song is Boat on the River by Styx, the same Styx that did Grand Illusion and Come Sail Away."

,B0010S8HRO,1,1,4,"Martha Wainwright~ Martha Wainwright is a very pleasant surprise indeed. I borrowed this album from my local library and to be honest I had never heard of this singer/musician before. Ms Wainwright is an accomplished vocalist and a very good lyricist. However, her lyrics can become a bit meandering at times and she seems to happy singing about subjects that just go on and on. At times I have really no idea what she is singing about at all but it sure sounds beautiful. The production value on this album is outstanding and the sound is crisp. The book-let is a mixed bag and the photo on the cover is terrible and looks like it has been taken by some high-school kid or shot with a cheap instant camera. The font is easy on the eye and the lyrics are therefore easy to read. This is a very good album that could use text editing but apart from this I give it four out five stars."
,B0010S8HRO,1,1,5,"Most of the time when I buy a CD, I listen to it a few times and then put it back on the shelf for weeks or months at a time before I give it another listen. There are occasions, however, when I buy a CD and it really grabs a hold of me. On these rare occasions, I become engrossed, almost addicted to the album. Martha Wainwright's self-titled debut has been one of these occasions.

Because of who her family is, it would be easy to immediately dismiss her as ""the sister of Rufas,"" or ""the daughter of Louden and Kate McGarrigle."" This would be a mistake, because Martha Wainwright's music is distinctly unique and she is a huge talent in her own right.

Her voice is gorgeous, but not in a traditional sense. Her voice has a soulful, high-pitched, eerie beauty, like nothing I've ever heard before. In her delivery, there is a real sense of emotion and feeling that really connects with the listener. With most albums, when you are done listening, you are done. When you are finished with Martha Wainwright's album, you feel as though you had just been visited by a presence, and that feeling stays with you, long after the CD has ended.

From the opening ""Far Away"", the listener is immediately swept into the CD. This song is subtle, building up ever so slightly, and is slightly underwhelming, which gives the song the perfect effect. The hauntingly beautiful background vocals add a nice touch. The more upbeat ""G.P.T."" has an infectious, singsong verse before going into its' soulful chorus. The bluesy morose ""Factory"" shows a more vulnerable side to Martha Wainwright. ""These Flowers"" has a kind-of a dream-like lullaby atmosphere. ""Ball and Chain,"" (not a cover of the classic Janis Joplin song) sounds somewhat Janis-Joplin like. It is here that Wainwright lets down all restraints and finally lets all that had been building up inside her explode. ""Why does this always happen?"" she yells, demanding an answer, yet knowing none will come. The album comes back to earth with the beautiful ""Don't forget"" a song about lost love. These types of songs are so clich,' but Wainwright sounds so sincere, and this song feels so lived in, that it's impossible not to be moved. The tongue-in-cheek ""This Life,"" tries to answer the question of whether the monotony of life in general is worth living. The light percussion over the subtle strumming of the acoustic strings creates the perfect backdrop for the song. Although it is asked whether or not suicide is the answer, this seemingly heavy-handed topic does not emotionally drain the listener the way an Alice In Chains song might. It's as though these suicidal ideas are just passing thoughts, not to be taken seriously. The catchy mid-paced ""When the day is Short,"" keeps the momentum going. The brutally honest ""Bloody Mother F***ing A** Hole"" is one of the album's centerpieces. You'd expect a song with a title like that to sound like Hole or Babes In Toyland, but that's not the case at all. This acoustic song starts out very subtle, building up angst as it rolls along, as though the hurt and resentment inside had been building up a long time and now is being vented out. But when Wainwright delivers the main lines ""you bloody mother f***ing A** hole,"" she sounds more hurt than angry. ""I will not pretend, I will not put on a smile, I will not say I'm alight for you, for you, whoever you are."" In other words, she is taking a stand, against anyone who would try to supress her, or not let her be herself. The explicit content sounds especially powerful because it comes out of left field. It's really unexpected. It's not like an Eminem album where every-other word is f*** this and f*** that. The bluesy easy-going ""TV Show"" has an engrossing stream-like lyrical flow. There's an array of strings in the background that are effective, yet subtle. The singsong ""Maker"" is enchanting, especially when the lush array of background vocals in the chorus kick in. The somber stripped-down acoustic ""Who was I kidding"" is heavyhearted, yet not overdone. The elegant piano balled ""Whiter I Must Wander"" is the perfect way to close out the album, ending on a whisper.

Martha Wainwright's debut is a truly wonderful listen, through and through. It's brutally honest, yet not melodramatic, confident, yet never cocky. Martha Wainwright is an amazing and very promising talent. One of the best CDs of 2005."
,B0010S8HRO,1,1,4,"Being the daughter of Katie McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III and the sister of Rufus Wainwright, Martha had better posses some form of musical aptitude. On this belated debut, Martha delivers a strikingly autobiographical effort with sharp imagery and folk-based strumming. From gleaming songs like ""The Maker"" and ""TV Show"" to brash lyrics on the lead single ""Bloody Mother F***ing A**hole"" to the deep somber of ""Whither I Must Wander,"" the album is full of texture.

Other victories include ""This Life"" and ""G.P.T."" Although the album's resilience is that of a purely melodic and lyrical sense, Martha Wainwright is without palpable singles.  Nonetheless, this coffee shop favorite is not set to whither away, with both her parent's fan base and her brother's loyal followers to aid her.

The code, here, is not hard to crack, however, it takes time for Wainwright's vocal stretching and folkie approach to latch on, much like her bother's latest Want Two."
,B0010S8HRO,1,1,4,"On the cover of this, her debut album, Martha Wainwright wears a look of resolve and determination as if to say ""whatever it takes, my music will be heard... but only on my terms"". Upon listening it becomes clear very quickly she has not only the voice but also the songs to back up this confidence.

If I didn't know any better, I'd have just as easily guessed this was from 1978 than 2005, sharing as it does a real kinship in sound to (then) emerging singers like Chrissie Hynde, Debbie Harry and in particular Kate Bush. Like Bush's debut 'The Kick Inside', arrangements here swoon and soar, choruses surprise and there's an almost frightening level of intensity at times, which makes for riveting listening throughout. It's also an album that's unafraid to tackle difficult subject matter, though for me, much of it is simply about attempting to transcend life's limitations.

After all that verbosity, all you really need to know is this is a beautiful collection of songs by a striking new artist - and if you like her brother Rufus, then odds are you'll like Martha Wainwright too."
,B0010S8HRO,-1,1,4,"I figured coming from such creative stock that Martha Wainwright's album would be 5+ star worthy.  It's good, but it's not great.  Like her brother Rufus, I like the idea of her, more than I actually like her.

I have heard her sing with her father (Loudon Wainwright III) and she came across much more bluesy than she does on this effort (check out ""You Never Call"" on his live disk). Her voice on this disk hits some qualities of Marianne Faithful (great) to some more alt. generic female lead singer(not so great).

The good thing (for me) is that she kind of defies a certain style.  It's not that she's all over the place, just that the music doesn't fit nicely into one genre.

Wainwright's writing is pretty good for her initial effort. I think that's where all her family's strentgh lies anyway...which is not a knock to their performing abilities.

But like most disks there are some outstanding tracks: ""When the Day is Short"", ""Wither I Must Wander"" and the oft mentioned ode (?)to her father, ""BMFA"".

It's at least worth a check-out, if not a purchase."
,B0010UX41G,1,1,5,"Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson and Ricky Skaggs team up on what has to be as good as bluegrass music gets. You will play this one again and again. This hauntingly beautiful CD reminded me once again that most of the so-called music coming out of Nashville today masquerading as ""country"" and/or ""bluegrass"" is pure (junk). No tight jeans and cowboy hats here. Just first class music.
The pickers play a lot of older songs: ""What Would You Give In Exchange For Your Soul,"" ""Who Will Sing For Me,"" ""Soldier's Joy,"" ""The Storms Are On The Ocean,"" ""Foggy Mountain Top,"" ""Roll In My Sweet Baby's Arms."" These men are as good as pickers get. Having Alison Krauss join them on some of the cuts only makes this CD better.
Difficult as it is to pick a favorite, I would probably vote for ""Down In The Valley To Pray."" Doc Watson begins this hymn, as simple and pure as your grandmother's pound cake, and is then joined by the voices of Skaggs and Scruggs, along with Krauss, in an a capella arrangement that will send chills down your spine. You are immediately carried back to a one-room church 50 or 60 years ago. The songleader began a hymn and then one by one, the congregation joined in while mothers fanned their babies with funeral home fans. Even though it never was, we thought life was much simpler then."
,B0010UX41G,1,1,5,some wonderful music
,B0010UX41G,1,1,5,Great live album from three legends and a couple of  surprise guests on some tracks
,B0010UX41G,1,1,5,"Doc Watson, Earl Scruggs and Randy Skaggs -- got together for a concert in NC, and created magic. Amazing picking, energy, and history played well. Randy played, at age 7, on Earl's radio show. Doc, is of course Doc. The three work together with music, comments, and mutual adoration. To really appreciate this historic CD, buy the DVD of the concert. We did this and it was terrific viewing. If you like vintage bluegrass, this must be in your collection."
,B0010UX41G,1,1,5,"About a year ago, I bought three albums --the latest album by the Blind Boys of Alabama (wonderful), R. L. Burnside's A Troubled Mind (one of the two best I bought from Fat Possum records --the other was Robert Balfour), and this album.  In other words, I bought three outstanding albums, all at the same time.

So which one do I listen to most often? The Three Pickers.

I've been a fan of Earl Scruggs for a long time. His albums with Lester Flatt are incomparable. They're the only blue grass albums that compare to jazz in my opinion, like listening to early Louis Armstrong.

I like Ricky Skraggs, mostly for his background work on the Evangeline album, by Emmy Lou Harris. (I don't greatly like the one album I bought by Ricky with his own group.)

I know that Doc Watson is a giant and I love his voice and manner but I've never spent time listening to him, principally because C&W and folk aren't my first thing. I've spent fifty-five years listening to jazz first and classical music second. It's not that easy changing gears.

I bought this album first because Earl Scruggs was on it, second because Ricky and Doc are premiere players, and lastly because it looked pure and unadulterated, just world class performers playing together for fun.

That's what it is. All three pickers are in good form. They are having fun. It's clear they like being together. All of the songs they play are good, some wondrous.

I like the cuts with Ricky Scraggs' group least, those with the three of the pickers and with Doc and his son most. Doc Watson has a beautiful tenor-baritone voice; he plays fine guitar both in background and solo. Earl Scruggs still plays with the fire and passion he had thirty-five years ago. What technical control he has! Ricky Scraggs is a first rate instrumentalist and very good in ensemble singing, but less successful as a solo vocalist. I wish I liked Ricky's group better --it's good but the cuts with the other groups are better. Alison Krause is on some cuts but doesn't have much to do.

I usually don't like chatter on a music record but here it fits. The love --for the music they are playing and among the three men themselves -- is transparent.  It adds a warm glow to an exceptional record.

,B0010V54UO,1,1,4,"I like Ashes Remain's second album better, but this is a great rock debut.  It shows the potential of this band and also where they could go from here.  This album is impossible to find for a reasonable price so purchase it via MP3 on Amazon.  It is the cheapest way to get it."
,B0010VBOF8,1,1,5,"My kids grew up on Raffi, and now my granddaughter is doing the same.
I have downloaded most of his songs that I know that she would love."
,B0010VBOF8,1,1,4,we downloaded this to add to our long playlist of music on the go to keep us entertained when the moment called for it :)
,B0010VBOF8,1,1,5,"I had this song a loooong time ago and needed it the other day because I was put in charge of entertaining 20 kids (aged 2-10) for an hour.  Before story time I played this song and all of the kids (of all ages) and even some of their parents jumped in to ""shake [their] sillies out.""  After this they (well, most of them) were able to sit still throughout story time and the craft event we had for them.

The song is pretty upbeat and fun and the kids just love it!!!"
,B0010WLQXW,-1,-1,2,"How I expected this double cd!!! but I should have known that tributes  these days are three a penny and very rarely they seem to convince. It  seems that many famous people were invited to this party and when they came  not really dressed as they should and not really in the mood nobody could  tell them to leave. Such is the cover of Springsteen, almost to make you  weep. A bizarre reggae song by Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt (Did Seeger  write that?) and many etcetera. Not all is lost, Greg Brown, John Gorka and  Anni difranco give some good songs, but even these songs would be  considered fillers in any of their albums. Before you buy this cd try to  listen to it at a friends. I consider it the disappointement of the year."
,B0010WLQXW,1,1,5,VERY GOOD
,B0010WLQXW,1,1,5,"This is a supurb collection of Folk Music. It was released in 1998,but is really Folk Music of the 60's ,all of it written by the person who was the central figure of the Folk Music scene at the height of its popularity. It was the music that represented the thoughts,experiences,hopes,fears,dreams,heartbreaks,protests and just about everything that the music scene portrayed during the sixties. However,anyone familiar with this music is in for a big surprise and treat when they listen to this album. While everything ,all 39 recordings,are from Seeger,all but one,""And Still I'm Searching"" are other artist's interpreting Seeger's songs. It will be a great surprise for you,as it certainly was for me, to hear these artists singing Seeger's songs. Also,you will find many songs in this collection that will probably be totally new ,or at least somewhat forgotten.
 There are songs that have become so familiar to long time Folkies as well as mainstream listeners, that when done by others will ,to use an old expression,""knock your socks off"".
 Just to captivate your curiosity,can you imagine:
  Jackson Browne & Bonnie Raitt singing ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine""
  Bruce Cockburn singing ""Turn,Turn,Turn""
  Nanci Griffith and Friends singing ""If I Had A Hammer""
  Bruce Springsteen singing ""We Shall Overcome""
  Studs Terkel doing ""Blessed Be The Nation"" or ""Oh,Sacred World""
  And what would a Folk Music collection be without
Peter,Paul & Mary,The Weavers and ""Wimoweh"",Odetta and ""One Grain Of Sand""
 Then to wrap it all up,Pete tells us what his long journey in Folk Music has been all about with ""And Still I'm Searching.
 If you are a Folk Music fan, or a fan of American Music heritage;you'll treasure this collection. The inserts that are included with these two CD's are excellent and will give you a much greater insight into what was on Seeger's mind at the time and how he came about to compose these songs."
,B0010WLQXW,1,1,5,"You'll hear your favorites on this album, and you'll hear songs new to you  that will blow you away.

Besides being a collection of songs honoring  Seeger, these are wonderful on their own. Re-release these as singles, and  they will be hits in the folk-music circles, and could hold their own on  some more popular stations (like Chicago's WXRT).

For me, I loved Studs  Terkel reading ""Blessed Be the Nation,"" Jackson Browne/Bonnie  Raitt singing, ""Kisses Sweeter than Wine,"" and the deeply  haunting ""My Father's Mansion"" as sung by Billy Bragg and Eliza  Carthy in a celtic flavor.

Hearing Donovan's version of ""My Rainbow  Race"" was refreshing, and Dick Gaughan's dramatic rendering of  ""Waist Deep in the Big Muddy"" knocked my socks off. Surprising me  was Tim Robbins' ""All My Children of the Sun."" So he can sing,  too? Amazing.

Listen to Greg Brown singing ""Sailing Down My Golden  River."" He has a Johnny Cash thing going on when he sings it, don't  you think? Check it out. Very cool.

There are others, some 39 songs in  all, and each I honestly liked. No duds, no ""why did they put that on  the album"" songs.

I fully recommend this album.

,B0010YEG6O,1,1,5,The 16th Avenue referred to in this piece refers to what used to be 16th Avenue in Nashville (it is now called something else). It is also where most of the songwriting houses used to be located in Nashville.  The song is both an allegory and a salute to all the songwriters who came to Nashville in order to get published.  Ms. Dalton's performance is superb.
,B0010YEG6O,1,1,5,"I have always liked this song. It speaks of how the songs we love get written by people who are not overnight sensations. It takes skill and experience to write songs that touch us , teach us, make us think and make us happy. The song speaks to the dedication of the songwriters."

,B0010ZCO9O,-1,-1,3,"This is not a bad song for relaxing, but I will say that they allow the volume levels to change too drastically to be completely relaxing.  I found that I have to turn the volume way down so I have periods where I can barely tell anything is playing in order to keep it from getting too loud and disturbing.  So far I have had great difficulty finding music that lasts longer (at least 30 minutes) where they actually kept it on an even keel so as to allow complete relaxation."
,B0010ZCO9O,1,1,5,I enjoy anything that captures my spirit and nourishes my mind and heart with peacefulness. This is a lovely sound to use prior to worship time or sleep.
,B0010ZCMC8,1,1,5,Tally's Lullaby pulls me back to a time (perhaps not in this life) that was quiet and perhaps sylvan and related to the highlands of Scotland.
,B00110JDUQ,-1,1,4,"After listening to this disc for the first time, all I could say is, ""Wow, not bad!""  These home recordings, in my opinion, give insight into the creative songwriting process of Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer of Weezer.  If these songs were the demos (or prototypes if you will), think of what they would've sounded like if they were refined and produced in the studio!  Someone actually complained of how these songs were, among other things, out of tune and unpolished.  Well, what did you think they were?  That's why they're called HOME RECORDINGS!  Think of them as first drafts to potential songs.  In fact, I think ""Home Recordings"" is far more enjoyable than the Green Album and Maldroit combined!  ""Home Recordings"" is definitely worth buying, in my opinion.  And not just for the hardcore fan mind you!"
,B00110JDUQ,1,1,4,"I initially bought the mp3 of the track ""Superfriend"" on the day this album was released. I had pre-ordered the CD but it didn't arrive until Christmas Eve. Now that I have the CD and have listened to all of the tracks, I can say that there are some really good ones on here. My favorites are ""Blast Off"", ""Who You Callin' Bitch"", ""Superfriend"", ""Longtime Sunshine"", and ""I Was Made For You""."
,B00110JDUQ,-1,1,4,"I can't really be upset with this realease because it is what it states, only a demo with botched lyrics. Not sure why they didn't take the skip out of sunshine. Overall I have a lot of weezer bootleg songs much better in quality and songmanship. Overall, though it is what it states, a demo so I can't give it less then four stars. What else are we to expect?"
,B00110JDUQ,1,1,5,"I was totally sure what I was going to get when I bought this album, but I have to say that it is amazing. If you are a Weezer fan, than this is a must own. I can't think of a song on this record that I didn't like."
,B00110JDUQ,1,1,4,"This is a great album, the more and more I listen to it, the more I fall in love with each and every song.  If your like me and are a die hard fan of the WEEZ, then you want go wrong with this album.  All tho this is not a ""Weezer"" produced cd, it still rocks."
,B00110JDUQ,1,1,4,"I have been waiting for years to hear ""Superfriend"" and it was worth it. This is closest any Weezer fan will get to ""Songs from the Black Hole"" (unreleased 2nd Weezer album), as 4 of the tracks on this album are from that project.

This is a must have for anyone that is a Weezer fan, and well worth the money."

,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"As with millions of other people, I first became acquainted with Mary J Bliges music through her Real Love and Happy songs during the 1990s (Mary J Bliges music was popular on one of the local radio stations in the area I attended grade school, middle school, and high school). Growing Pains by Mary J Blige highlights her musical growth with such emotion and conviction songs such as Just Fine and Work That."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"This CD is awesome! I'm actually mad at myself for not getting it sooner! I actually thought I had it, and discovered that I did not. In my most honest opinion, it's a great CD that offers a variety of music. You have everything from  danceable tracks, to some funky almost takes me back a bit, to MJB connecting us to her soul, and some easy listening! I'm very happy with my CD and love that MJB can still bring it ""Full Throttle!"""

,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Awsome CD,arrived in time,arrived in excellent condition,the sound is great. Mary J, must buy all her music ,her beat and voice is the greatest."
,B00110DT4C,1,-1,3,"Mary J Blige speaks for the downtrodden and encourages women to be strong and keep believing.  ""Growing Pains"" continues in that vein. Danceable grooves and thought provoking positive lyrics mark Growing Pains as another star on MJB's walk to fame.  If you don't feel good after ""just Fine"" check your pulse."
,B00110DT4C,1,-1,3,Quality album from MJB. Like all of her work the CD is filled with raw emotional songs. Mixed in with upbeat tracks that make you wanna jam.
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"This album is hot.  I didn't realize I didn't have this one in my CD collection but I was too excited when I found it in vinyl format!  The album cover is great and the album themselves plays beautifully!  I was tempted to purchase the Amazon offering but I've learn from previous purchases, the Amazon offering comes in a generic black jacket with a sticker of the original artwork, so buyers beware if you are serious about your album's artwork.  This jacket is awesome!"
,B00110DT4C,1,-1,2,"I got this album last year because I used to like Mary J. Blige in the early 90's when she was at the height of her popularity.  Her albums from the early 90's a lot better than her most recent albums.  The only album by her I somewhat liked from recent years is ""No More Drama"" and even still it wasn't a perfect album.  Mary's first three albums are her best and her best being ""What's The 411?""  For long time Mary J. Blige fans you may be disappointed.  If I were you I would just stick to her earlier albums."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I got this cd when it first came out and I STILL have it in my music player! Its hard to rate this entire cd because I love every song on it. Each song has a real, True, and honest message like all Mary J. Blige songs. This Cd and ""My Life"" are her best! Thank You Mary for another uplifting album and not putting out trash like most ""musicians"" of today's society."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Mary J Blige is always kind of hit or miss for me. She's sometimes really good, but at other times is also very very boring! I remember there was alot of buzz about this album because Mary J hadn't came out with anything in a while. They talked about her throwing umbrella away basically handing rihanna a superstar career. And the media tried to start a rift,but lets be honest if mary j sang umbrealla it wouldn't have been as cool,catchy. And propably wouldn't have been a hit anyways! As for this cd it's got great looks,great hooks, and excellent singing. Grown Woman is my favorite track by far. It's so umtempo but has a great urban feel to it at the same time. i also really liked work that. I thought that was an excellent song as well. Just Fine was pretty cool. I loved the fact that she tried to stay current and keep up with the kids. I think did an excellent job. One of my favorite releases of the year!"
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Mary J. Blige - Growing Pains (Geffen, 2007)

Whenever you release a big album (be it classic, certified platinum or both), expectations are always gonna be high for your follow-up. How do you exactly follow an album like Mary J. Blige's 2005 hit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>? Well, she must not have worried about it, as Growing Pains is another great album.

Although her first single, ""Just Fine"", wasn't exactly the smash that ""Be Without You"" was, it showed her on a more fun and upbeat track than usual. But for everyone who says that she sounds best on tracks about drama, ""Hurt Again"" and ""Talk to Me"" are right up your alley. The only problem is that after 16 years of albums, some of these topics can start to sound redundant. That's why that tracks like the NE-YO/StarGate-produced ""Fade Away"" and ""Come to Me (Peace)"" are a nice change of pace. Even the duet with Usher, ""Shake Down"", while only a fair song, adds a little bit of love into the mix.

You can still rely on Mary J. Blige to deliver that great R&B in a time where R&B is losing the battle with hip-hop and country music as the leading genres. The only question is how Mary will follow up this album. -EJR"
,B00110DT4C,-1,-1,3,"O.k. so I am a Mary Fan since What's the 411. Share My World was the gospel but this album barely makes it. The first three tracks, I skip automatically and the rest just kind of repeats the same story and emotion. Are you a Mary fan,  then cop this one but only because you are a fan. Everyone else will be disappointed!"
,B00110DT4C,-1,-1,3,"I'm a huge fan of Mary J. Blige. I've been a fan more or less from the moment&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-the-411/dp/B000002OME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's the 411?</a>&nbsp;dropped back in '92. I've bought every single album she released since, including the live and remix albums but excluding 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Life/dp/B0000AQS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Life</a>, right up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>.

But I seem to be the only one on the planet who just can't get into this one. I simply don't get it. Mary has been selling millions of albums across the world for 16 years now and that could explain why, to these ears, she's beginning to sound a bit weary. She's been telling us all how she's incredibly happy now, how her life is exactly where she wants it to be and how, whilst going through all the pain in her recent past, one thing she's always strived to do is keep things real with her fans. This might all well be True but I'm yet to see Mary actually LOOKING happy in an interview or a video. (Jill Scott always looks happy for instance, even these days - and she's just been through a divorce!).

But maybe that's just Mary's way. Maybe it's the 'street' or 'ghetto fabulous' thing to; to never smile even if feeling blissful. Her continuous banging on about said bliss is starting to grate on the nerves a tad though. She's a strong woman, no doubt, and a trooper. She does ""keep on going"", as one reviewer said but at what cost? Like I said, the poor woman is probably just really tired.

When she burst onto the scene back in 1992 with songs like ""Real Love"", ""Reminisce"" and ""Love No Limit"", she showed energy, versatility and raw emotion that have long since dissipated. The bittersweet ""Be Happy"" and the poignant ""I'm Goin' Down from her sophomore album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life/dp/B000002OU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life</a>&nbsp;proved she was no one-hit wonder. And let's not forget her star turns on hip-hop classics like ""Can't Knock The Hustle"" with Jay-Z (1996) and ""I'll Be There For You/You're All I Need To Get By"" with Method Man (1995). I for one thought the title ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"" was absolutely well deserved.

But every subsequent album has been less satisfying, and more geared towards what was playing on the radio than the one that preceded it. By the time ""The Breakthrough"" came out, I was starting to lose interest. It was clear to any objective listener that Mary was just treading water and I've barely played the CD three times since I got it. This one I simply couldn't bear and had to take right back to the store and ask for something else.

As soon as I saw the video to her single ""Just Fine"", I had my doubts. The Michael Jackson homage-paying intro (and the video itself) was probably well intentioned but to me, they just fell flat. It just doesn't sound or look like she really means it. She's singing about being uplifted but she sounds (and looks) anything but. Jackson looked ecstatic in the video to ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" but to me, Mary looks like she'd rather be somewhere else, doing something else. It's not so much in her moves, it's in her eyes and her facial expressions.

The female empowerment of ""Grown Woman"" and ""Feel Like A Woman"" sound like the kind of thing that would play well to Oprah's studio audience but this listener just couldn't find the groove - and I'm no chauvinist. It would take too long to list the female empowerment tunes I've grooved to in my time.

Pharrell's multi-tempoed ""'Til The Morning"" and Ne-Yo's interestingly winding ""Smoke"" are probably the only two songs on here that break away from the made-for-radio formula that dominates the album and Mary is probably singing the best she's ever sung - much more control, much less excess - but somehow for me, that just makes her less interesting to listen to. A perfect example of what I mean is the solemn ""Fade Away"". Forget all the almost spiritual wailing and chest beating of the good old days, Mary sounds like she's barely breaking a sweat.

Maybe that's how music is now in the 21st century and I need to either get with the program or leave it alone. Or maybe, just maybe, as listeners, we've allowed our standards to drop to basement level and as a result, anything even slightly passable is lauded as the next best thing. Mary is undoubtedly one of the legends of our time and I'll never even try to take that away from her but I do wonder if the way many of us fans are almost deifying the woman these days, is blinding us to the fact that her music is simply not as good as it used to be. I realise that we're living in an age where creativity and individuality are not rewarded and where studio executives and radio programmers are now telling artistes what kind of music to make so it's entirely possible that Mary's heart isn't really in the music she's putting out, despite all her talk of the contrary. Whatever. In the end, we'll only get the quality of music that we as consumers demand.

Maybe Mary's new life is indeed the happy and peaceful one she says it is. All I know is that while it must be a good thing (especially for her) that all the pain is behind her and all the angst gone, her supposedly newly-found joy is not coming through in the music quite yet. To me, singing songs of empowerment and bliss while looking and sounding utterly miserable just makes Mary painful to watch - and to listen to.

The album will probably still sell truckloads and earn her all kinds of awards, so I know my view is the minority one. I also know that my review is very likely to be unpopular here but I had to say my piece. I didn't want to post the review but a good Amazon buddy of mine (who will remain nameless) encouraged me to do so, so here it is. Let the hissing, booing and clicking on the ""no"" button begin."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,This really is a great collection of songs.  MJB has done it once again.  Please feel good about buying this effort.  I have had it since the release date and still listen to it regularly esp tracks 4/5
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"I must confess straight away, I love MJB, she is bar none the most fun to dance to and I think this CD flows with her fibe.  I loved, Just Fine, by far the best song on here and the video is pure MJB, she dances her hot bod off.  The rest of CD is good as well, but this song is her, Be Without You, on this CD.  I look forward to seeing how it gets mixed at the clubs, I didn't think they could improve Be Without You, but the Blanco version would wake up the dead, so im hoping he does a mix of this as well.  Ms. Blige puts so much of herself into her music, you feel her power and the feeling that yeah, I may be rich now, but i didn't forget where I came from, and im still a work in progress; I love that about her, she is no sale out.  If you love MJB or you just like to groove then I cant imagine you not being jazzed by this album...Mary, you make this tan white boy soar on the dance floor."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"As a life-long Mary fan, I had no preconceived notion about how this album would sound.  After so many years it's just nice to still have Mary in the ""game"" putting out good music.

Overall I love this album and have already put quite a few songs on repeat.  I love the album cover & rear cover art with Mary lounging on a classic vinyl collection and I love how each song melds into the next one.

I got the copy with the bonus dvd and while I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the disc included with her LOVE & LIFE cd, I still enjoyed hearing Mary speak about the album's concept and what each track meant to her during the recording of the album.

My favorite tracks are:  JUST FINE - great lead off single, it got me hyped about the album's release

IF U LOVE ME? - produced by Bryan Michael Cox and although his songs are becoming easily identifiable with the pretty piano riffs, this is still a uniquely ""Mary joint""

FEEL LIKE A WOMAN, STAY DOWN, HURT AGAIN, SHAKE DOWN (great duet with Usher), SMOKE, COME TO ME (PEACE), TILL THE MORNING (love the beats & musical production) & FADE AWAY - very moving song, the lyrics made me cry & Mary sounds terrific!

Overall, this is a strong collection of songs, Mary sounds great and I'd recommend it to any any fan whether you're a Mary-newbie or a long-timer."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I LOVE THIS ALBUM. ITS THE BEST SHES DONE! This album represents accepting that there is pain that goes along with growing and change. We can hear Mary's own happiness and strength all through this album. This album gives us straight up Mary letting the public share her world, and delivering a message that says, Love yourself. Believe in yourself and kick negativity to the curb. Throughout this album, we can hear Mary pushing herself in ways she never has: especially vocally. There are jazzy inflections, girl group coquettishness, nuanced phrasing: a full range of tones and textures. She also continues to mature in the studio: taking control of the total recording and creative process and doing so with confidence and chops. This album is going to go MULTI-PLATINUM."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Mary J. Blige returns with her eighth studio album, ""Growing pains"". I've been a fan of hers ever since she burst onto the scene singing about ""Real love"". Sixteen years later, she's still as strong as ever; ""Growing pains"" became her fourth US chart topping album and has sold over a million so far. It's the latest instalment in a musical journey, which intentionally or not has chronicled the state of her life at the time of each release.

This is no different. Very much in love (with her husband and with herself), the songs reflect this. From lead-off single, the upbeat joyous hand-clap filled ""Just fine"" where she states she's just that, thank you (from the same team that gave Rihanna her chart ""raining"" hit ""Umbrella""), opening cut ""Work that"" (a song of female self belief/assertion no matter what you look like, lovely song), the more sparse guitar driven ""Grown woman"" (with Ludacris), There is a bit to dance to. ""Roses"" is an angry mid tempo song with unsettling beats (where you wouldn't want to mess with her; she's having one of them days), and closing cut ""Come to me (peace)"" is a lovely song with a hypnotic throbbing bassline and a pop feel (Love it!).

For ballads, we have just about everything else, with lyrics dealing with unabashed love,  or vulnerability; ""Shake down"" (a duet with Usher), ""Feel like a woman"", ""Stay down"", ""Hurt again"" (lovely harmonies), the string swathed ""What love is"", ""Work in progress (growing pains)"" (with autobiographical lyrics, the title says it all), ""Talk to me"" (where she's trying to rekindle conversation in the relationship), the piano sprinkled ""If you love me"", and the pseudo jazz feel of ""Smoke"" (with a slightly off kilter beat).

My favourite cut is her song about wanting to get away from it all when things get tough; ""Fade away"", a dreamy plodding mid-tempo number (a bit like ""Everything"" from ""Share my world"") with soothing harmonies. It's like sailing on a calm sea. Outstanding!

Mary has been on an upward tangent ever since the day she appeared on the scene, a tangent that shows no sign of dipping any day soon."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"You got to give it to Mary on this one, the maturity is evident and the delivery so smooth and flows effortlessly.  And the duo with Usher really demonstrates how well they both have mastered their craft.  I truly enjoyed this even much more than the Breakthrough which I felt was more experimental taking many directions, probably in an effort to gain universal appeal but I thought it was just a tad too complex,but  not Growing Pains sets one mood & vibe and does not deviate.  Each track simply builds upon the other. The title is befitting as well, especially the reference to Growing.  She has definately Grown and she has I as she has stated she has experienced some Pain.  Much love to Mary and her dedication to her music.  And Yea Mary, tell them ......YOU SUCK IT UP!"
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Mary J. Blige is absolutely ADORED by many of my friends.  They love and appreciate her because she never tried to be ""Hollywood.""  She has been that same girl from New York that she was when she made her debut in 1992 and for that, we love her!  She was never surreptitious about her ordeals with drugs, abusive relationships and family drama.  The pain that she has endured is felt all throughout her music, which is something else her supporters appreciate.  She is definitely one of the most sincere and real people in the industry of entertainment; there's no arguing that point.  Her album, ""Growing Pains"" is a great offering.  It doesn't have any songs that are quite as memorable as, say, ""I'm Goin' Down"", ""Sweet Thing"", ""Love No Limit"", ""Be Happy"", or ""Not Gon Cry"" (I could go on for days, she has a slew of sensational songs!!!), but it is a good listen and worth purchasing.

 Mary Jane Blige has this unique way of delivering songs; that is, to me, what makes her music so listenable and memorable.  It is not easy to explain, but once you listen to her best songs, you'll understand.  With this album, her delivery is still as it has always been.  ""Talk to Me"" is a prime example of my previous explanation.  She does a nice job executing this track.  She extends her voice quite a bit here, and I enjoyed listening.  Even her faster tracks are heartfelt, for example, ""Just Fine.""  This song was released to radio, and though it took a few listens to lure me in, I was eventually taken in by this track.  The beat and hook are infectious.  It's one of the best moments on ""Growing Pains.""  In short, this song is about a woman who is truly confident with being herself and is not about to change because she's ""fine."" (I suppose that could mean ""fine"" as in mood and/or physical appearance, take it how you want.)  Someone strongly suggested that I listen to ""Stay Down"" and I am so happy I listened to him!  I listen to that song a lot because, lyrically, it is beautiful.  This song is about staying with your mate through the bad times because good times are sure to come and overpower those harder times.  Those who hear this song are sure to gain something from it.  This album is a bit flawed in a few places.  ""Smoke"" is the weakest moment on the album.  The production is not good, the lyrics are just alright; collectively, it's just not a good track.  Usher shows up for ""Shake Down"" and does a good job, but this track doesn't stand out.  Everything about this track sits on the average mark.

 R&B lovers, Mary lovers, and lovers of music, what are you waiting for?  Go get it!  This woman is a True artist and she exhibits that on this album.

Mikeisha's Top 5

1. ""Stay Down""
2. ""Just Fine""
3. ""Work in Progress (Growing Pains)""
4. ""Til the Morning""
5. ""Come to Me (Peace)"""
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Mary J. Blige continues to bring it on practically every album she releases these days. And Growing Pains is no different. She busts out with the highly energetic and super sassy ""Work That"" to lead off the album. Then, like a well-produced mixtape, it seamlessly segues to the equally groove-happy ""Grown Woman"" featuring a decent rap from Ludacris. We are then delighted with the first single ""Just Fine,"" a simple ditty with a happy-go-lucky Mary expressing herself like only she can. ""Feel Like A Woman"" is a slower cut that basically tells men to treat her like a lady. ""Stay Down"" is a more serious track about pushing on through the tough times and not giving up so easily. Those same sentiments are reverberated on the songs ""Talk To Me"" and ""If You Love Me."" ""Hurt Again"" is a smooth track that discusses the inner battle between being in love and not setting yourself up for a broken heart...yet again. Usher has the album's only other cameo appearance for the straightforward ""Shake Down."" ""Till The Morning"" has an old school bounce to it, with lyrics from Mary to match. ""Roses"" is one of Mary's most powerful songs of recent memory, essentially saying that it takes more than just the little things to make a relationship work. ""Fade Away"" speaks about losing a love and having trouble facing the world again and moving on with all the heartache consuming your spirit. ""What Love Is"" is a very deep and analytical song about the different emotions and moods that truthfully depends on your current status with love. ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"" is a self-explanatory track about Mary still being just as imperfect as the next person. Mary gets a little abstract with the simple yet cryptic track ""Smoke,"" leaving room for the listener to draw their own conclusions on what she's really talking about. The subdued power ballad ""Come To Me (Peace)"" closes out the album on a positive note. Growing Pains is definitely closer to her classic material even though it doesn't quite reach those heights on it's own. Nevertheless, MJB brings us another solid effort to enjoy until the next album comes out. And with a formula that is obviously working, Mary J. Blige will certainly bring it once again."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"I instantly became a fan of Mary J. Blige once I heard the song ""You Remind Me"".  Her debut CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-the-411/dp/B000002OME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's the 411?</a>&nbsp;was an instant favorite of mine because of the way that Mary mixed r&b songs with hip hop samples.  Obviously, the direction of the production had something to do with that but since I am also a rap music fan, I was able to appreciate Mary J. Blige even more.  My favorite tracks ended up being ""Love No Limit"", ""Reminisce"", ""I Don't Want To Do Anything"" w/K-Ci, ""My Love"", ""Real Love"" and Mary's remake of the Rufus & Chaka Khan classic ""Sweet Thing"".  In 1994, Mary J. Blige released her 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life/dp/B000002OU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life</a>.  This is clearly my favorite r&b CD of all time.  Mary not only surpassed my expectations after her debut CD, but she definitely had gained a fan for life as she did her best to chronicle the good times, the pain and everything inbetween to put together a fantastic CD.  My favorite track was ""I Never Wanna Live Without You"" but I could play the CD in its entirety.  My other personal favorites include ""Mary's Joint"", ""I'm The Only Woman"", ""Be Happy"", ""Mary Jane"" and ""Be With You"".  The alternate versions of the tracks were phenominal as well.  I am sure everyone remembers Smif N Wessun on ""I Love You"", LL Cool J on ""Mary Jane"", and the late Notorious BIG (Biggie) ripping the ""I'm Goin' Down"" (Remix)) which used the beat for the track ""The What"" that was featured on Biggie's ""Ready To Die"" that also included Method Man.  Mary J had plenty of other releases:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Share-My-World/dp/B000002P64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Share My World</a>&nbsp;(1997)
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary/dp/B00000JWQH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary</a>&nbsp;(1999)

From these 4 releases you had my personal favorites such as ""Seven Days"", ""All That I Can Say"", ""The Love I Never Had"", ""Special Part Of Me"", ""Ooh!"", ""Everything"" and ""Share My World"".  Mary J. returned in 2005 with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>.  She enjoyed tremendous success with her 1st single ""Be Without You"".  ""Darkchild"" blessed her with my favorite track, ""Enough Cryin'"" and my other favorites included ""I Found My Everything"", ""Take Me As I Am"", ""No One Will Do"" and ""Father In You"".  Mary's record company got a little greedy with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reflections-A-Retrospective/dp/B000JU8HHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reflections - A Retrospective</a>.  The CD started off with 4 new tracks which included the single ""We Ride"", the title track and ""King & Queen"" w/John Legend.  Then Geffen tried to conduct a greatest hits CD with the rest of the CD which was a mere 11 tracks, with 2 of the tracks being songs that were never on her CDs but were quality collaborations with the remix to Method Man's ""All I Need"", that was featured on ""Tical"" and ""911"" w/Wyclef Jean.

""Growing Pains"" was released on December 18th, 2007.  The CD starts off with the uptempo ""Work That"".  Mary makes an uplifting anthem for the ladies that tells them to be happy with themselves and not to live everyday trying to please other people.  Do your best to work with the best attributes that you have.  Ludacris appears on ""Grown Woman"" to return the favor for Mary J. appearing on the track ""Runaway Love"" that was featured on Ludacris' last release ""Release Therapy"".  In my opinion, ""Grown Woman"" is basically a continuation of ""Work That"".  You have to come to a point in your life where you are happy with yourself as a woman, mentally and physically.  Mary J. has struggled with that fact for many years in her life and she is trying to be a positive example for ladies, young and old around the world.  Luda does a decent job with his verse but he is trying to talk about some things that could be done with this woman instead of adding to the positivity that Mary is trying to bring to the track, with a touch of attitude.  ""Just Fine"" is basically Growing Pains' ""Family Affair"".  It doesn't matter how the week at work was or what trials and tribulations that you went through during the course of the week, it's Friday night and this beat comes on, go out and have a good time or just do the infamous 2 step like I do.  ""Just Fine"" is a nice, uptempo feel good jam.  ""Feel Like A Woman""  has Mary talking to her man about making her feel appreciated as a woman.  Whether it's a shopping trip, making love to her through the night or just making a nice gesture, tonight she just wants to feel like a woman.  The slow jam man, Bryan Michael Cox shows up to produce ""Stay Down"", which is a thoughtful slow jam.  In every relationship, you are going to have ups and downs.  No relationship is perfect.  The relationship is enduring one of those down times and Mary is asking her man to try to keep putting up with these down times so that they can receive the greater award at the end.  ""Hurt Again"" has Mary describing a situation where she is starting to have feelings for someone but she is hesitant in letting him know that because of all the times that she has been hurt in the past.  ""Shake Down"" is tolerable but when you see Usher and Mary J. Blige on a track, you have huge expectations.  Just like when you saw Usher and Alicia Keys on the track ""My Boo"", you expect the artists to make the collaboration memorable.  On ""Shake Down"", it's decent but nothing that you would expect when you have Mary and Usher on the same track.  Pharrell does his best to try to take you back to the 80s on ""Til The Morning"", but for the most part, unless you want to grab some old fashioned roller skates and go to the skating rink, this song won't work for most Mary J. Blige fans.  On ""Roses"", Mary has to get a point across to her man that she is fed up with all of the confrontations with her man and today she is not having it for any reason.  I can definitely relate to this track.  Men:  You're in a no win situation when this day comes so let her vent and this type of day will go by faster and be much easier for you to handle...lol

Clearly, my favorite track on ""Growing Pains"" is ""Fade Away"".  Stargate, who has produced multilple Ne-Yo songs, Joe's ""It's Me"", Chris Brown's ""With You"", Rihanna & Ne-Yo's ""Hate That I Love You"", Trey Songz' ""Can't Help But Wait"" and most importantly to some people, Beyonce's ""Irreplaceable"", produce this memorable Mary J. track in ""Fade Away"".  Ne-Yo co-produces and writes the track as well.  Mary finds herself at times, because of all of her troubles not even wanting to be here on Earth.  That's how bad times have gotten for her in the past.  Although, her life is definitely much better than those times, she may still have moments where she feels like she did before irregardless of her success because of her past transgressions.  Ne-Yo does an excellent job of reaching back so to speak in times in Mary's past to capture these moments.  Here's the bridge: ""Couldn't look myself in the mirror, asking myself how dumb could you be.""  ""Maybe everything would be much clearer, if no one could see me"".  Mary's times in the past were so bad she didn't even want to me amongst the living at times.  There were times when she just want to take herself out of this world and not even be here anymore.  That's where I feel the ""....invinsibility would be great"" part comes from on the track.  ""What Love Is"" is another memorable Mary, Stargate and Ne-Yo collaboration as Mary writes her rendition of what she feels the four letter word means just like Alicia Keys did on ""The Thing About Love"" from her ""As I Am"" CD.  The effects at the end of the track add to the track as well.  ""Work In Progress"" (Growing Pains) is also written by Ne-Yo as Mary walks you through how she is getting through life day by day the best she can.  She is clearly trying her best, but she also wants to let women in the world know that she is just as human as they are despite her success.  ""Talk To Me"" deals with Mary wanting to receive better communication from her man and the benefits of effective communication in a relationship.  ""If You Love Me"" is a decent track but it sounds too much like ""Be Without You"" Part 2 to me.  ""Smoke"" is clearly unlike any Mary J. Blige track that I have ever heard.  This track seems to be a part of Mary J.'s musical maturity. You never would have heard Mary on a track like this in the What's The 411 and My Life days.  As a matter of fact, she would have had a profanity laced tirade ready for Puffy if he even tried to bring her a track like this.  In the end, it clearly works for me and it's nice to see Mary trying different things.  ""Come To Me (Peace)"" ends ""Growing Pains"" on a good note as she is trying to win over the affection of a lost love from the past.

Overall, ""Growing Pains"" may not be Mary J. Blige's best CD, but if you look at her career since 1992's ""What's The 411"" to now, you see alot of progression in her music and lyrics in 2007.  Not only do you see a growth process with Mary as a 37 year old woman but you also hear the growth process through her lyrics and her production.  If you are a fan of the majority of Mary J's releases, then you should also add ""Growing Pains"" to your collection.

,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I've been a fan of Mary's since 1992, so my review is slanted in her favor. The first single, ""Just Fine"" is a dance hit in heavy rotation on urban radio.  ""Till The Morning"" produce by Pharrell is a strong 5 star song.  ""Roses"" is a Mary Anthem, dedicated to ladies in tough relationships.  ""Fade Away"" produced by Ne-yo is a song about painful change, and ending a bad relationship.  Notice the theme.......Mary brings real emotions in her music, and that's why after 16 years, she's still on top."
,B00110DT4C,-1,1,4,"Before I said this CD was about average. It's not. It's just different. There is a bit of hip-hip mixed with R&B here but once you get past the good tracks and to the second half of the album it's full of excellent songs that are mid-tempos and beautiful ballads. Some of the highlights of the slower songs are ""That's What Love Is"" (my favorite song), ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"",  ""Talk To Me"", ""If You Love Me"" (which sounds like it could have fit right in on her previous huge hit of a CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>) and even ""Come To Me (Peace)"" which ends the album on a slightly more upbeat and inspiring note. I think out of all of Mary's albums this is one of the most misunderstood. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Life/dp/B0000AQS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Life</a>&nbsp;some people just weren't digging this one. Honestly, L&L is one of my favorites by Mary. It was very downbeat for the most part and I think that's what people didn't like. Same thing happened here. More than half the album is slower and full of meaning and songs about relationship/self-esteem up's and down's. The production on a few of the tracks is a little more Pop/R&B than a lot of her earlier material too.

So even with certain differences I must admit that after listening again (just like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Life/dp/B0000AQS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Life</a>&nbsp;album) I find that this is a great (and once again) underrated effort by Mary J. Blige. To me it's more even than her next outing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stronger-with-Each-Tear/dp/B002UZ5G7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stronger with Each Tear</a>&nbsp;(although that album was solid and upbeat) and is pretty much as great as her previous effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>&nbsp;believe it or not. It's just more of a grower in my opinion. To me though some of these tracks are just amazing. I guess the ballads/mid-tempos actually makes this one of my favorite recent MJB efforts. I'm now not ashamed to say that. Beautiful effort.

4.4 stars.

,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I am not a REAL MJB fan, but she has really matured and I love this CD. My husband and daughter age 9 really likes her, she has experienced life and does not mind singing about it, for it helps others.

I LOVE  #1 record it is the new BLACK WOMENS ANTHEM AND #2 W/ LUDACRIS AND ***** H U R T  A G A I N *****, SHE JUSTS SINGS W/ SUCH EMOTION AND FEELINGS AND STRENGH AND I CAN' STOP PLAY THIS.

GREAT WORK MARY !!!!  I LOVE YOUR PERFORMANCES YOU GOT A NEW FAN !!!!"
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I think the biggest improvement Mary J. has made during her last 2 albums is she has remained consistant.  You can now listen to her latest cds without skipping over tracks that interrupt the flow.  Aside from ""What's the 411"" and ""My Life"", her albums were littered with junk that were just plain unlistenable.  Of course every mary J. Blige album has at least a couple of good songs on it, but ""Breakthru"" and ""Growing Pains"" are a complete journey you can play from start to finish.  I don't really like the title of the album though, ""Growing Pains"" reminds me too much of the old 80's tv show and it sounds too harsh like ""groin pains"".  I love the cover of the cd.  I love Mary's pose, it looks retro and Egyptian and she's also laying on a bunch of records which is great for me becuz I used to dj. You go with the shout out to vinyl, Mary. As for the songs on the cd, I love ""Work That"", I could listen to this song a million times, ""Just Fine"", ""Roses"", and ""Til The Mornin'"" are other standouts for me.  ""What Love Is"" and ""Fade Away"" are some of my all time faves from Mary J. ""Fade Away"" sounds a little alternative like Depeche Mode sounding, the background music is moody and deep. Towards the end of the cd, some of the songs go in that direction which is strange considering her R and B roots.  It's unique and groundbreaking, giving her music a fresh sound while remaining innovative.  The only song which doesn't do it for me is ""Grown Woman"".  It's not exactly groundbreaking material, the rap thing is so dated and played out at this point. My favourite lyric on the album where Mary really hits you with it is on ""Roses"". ""Sometimes I need a hug!""  Who doesn't.  Thanks for breaking it down Mary."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,i like this cd. it's upbeat and real. it gets me motivated about ME. i think women around mary's age will appreciate the lyrics and the realness. i love her photos on the cd cover. mary seems to be living well and it's reflected in her work.
,B00110DT4C,-1,1,4,"This is a decent album; I personally was expecting more soul into it. What I actually got was a mixture like Geffen is trying to turn Mary J. Blige into a black Carole King. This became apparent in songs ""Smoke"" and ""Fade Away"". I did listen to the record three times consecutively on my recent trip and the first half was pretty good, what I was looking for was for Mary to hit me with something heavy like she has on all of her recent efforts (i.e. PMS, I'm Not Lookin', Changes I've Been Going Through, Not Gon' Cry) and then I heard ""Roses and personally, I'm split with the song. It's Mary but it's didn't grab me like Whoa!.
I did appreciate ""Just Fine"" a little more than when I did initially. ""Grown Woman"" I love and ""Work that"" picked up where the hidden track from her last album left off. The beat is nice, the lyrics are little B-rate. After ""Just Fine"" things start to run together and sound a bit same, then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little. Her duet with Usher ""Shake down"" is cute but a bit odd vocally. Usher is nice but I would've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary's (i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight). This album is a hit and miss with me, where only a good 3 songs are my favorites and they aren't the best of Mary."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"This is an excellent disc by Mary.  She is the undisputed queen of R and B music.  My favorite track is the duet ""Shake Down"" with Usher.  This song is about two people who love each other.  ""Talk To Me"" is about the importance of communication and trust in a relationship.  ""Grown Woman"" is another strong track on here.  This is a good song about the strength of a grown woman.  ""Work In Progress"" is my other favorite track.  This track reminds me that everyone is a work in progress. No one is perfect.  This track makes me feel good every time I listen to it.  ""Just Fine"" is an great track to dance and move to.  ""Come To Me"" and ""Hurt Again"" are two relaxing tracks.  They are very soothing to me.  ""Fade Away"" is a groovy track.  I love the variety of sounds on this disc very much.  Every track is a winner on this album."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Most popular singers can attest to that one album that is considered by fans and critics alike as being their apex.  Michael Jackson had ""Thriller,"" Prince had ""Purple Rain,"" and Mary J. had the multi-Grammy-winning ""The Breakthrough.""  It is unfair to the singers to always compare each successive release with its predecessor for the artists may have different directions and concepts that they wish to pursue.

Mary J, though traveling some of the same roads as her previous works, branches out somewhat with ""Growing Pains"" with an album that is possibly more pop-oriented than anything that she has previously done, including ""The Breakthrough.""

""Growing Pains"" is a bit of everything that will, no doubt, increase her already large fan base.  Riding high on the strength of the first single ""Just Fine"" and its eye-popping video, the album is a well-crafted blend of R & B, funk, pop, and female angst and strength that can only be done by Miss Mary.

EVERY single song is a winner and each makes a seamless segue to its successor.

Besides that, she looks MIGHTY FINE on every photo in the liner notes!

We all should grow so well!"
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Most people love ""What's The 411"" and ""My Life"" and they think they are totally classic, and then there's ""The Breakthrough"" which is a 5 star effort in itself - but here Mary J. Blige surpasses everything she has done - the cut SHAKE DOWN with Usher is so commercial it's sickening which is GREAT it's like the sweetest candy you could ever want - but don't think for a minute she's sold out. NO NO NO - this CD is so deep, so heartfelt, so BLACK, so True, so much full of emotion.  Mary J. Blige I think this is her ""THRILLER"" - this CD is phenomenal from start to finish.  Even if you've never heard of her before - you will be infected with these songs - they stay in your mind, soul and heart.  This CD is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING - her best effort yet, and how do you surpass ""My Life"" - she has done it - you will be TOTALLY REWARDED WITH THIS PURCHASE - look out for Mary in 2008 and 2009 - SHE TRULY IS THE UNDISPUTED ""QUEEN OF HIP-HOP SOUL"" Girl you GO GO GO GO GO!!!  Man O Man, Mariah you know you're my heart, and Rickie Lee you are my favorite - but she even revamps some old Emotions samples - THIS CD IS BEYOND BEYOND.  Just listen, GUARANTEED!!!  Thank you ET for my favorite gift this Christmas.  God is alive - Listen to Mary - you'll be a witness!!!  It's THAT UNBELIEVABLE - miraculous.  Anyone who rated this CD less than 5 stars has not listened to it more than twice, this CD rewards the listener with repeated listens and you see how brilliant this CD is.  It's really A NON STOP PARTY.  Keep playing this at your Christmas or New Years Party's - you'll see - this grows on your without ANY PAIN.  MARY J BLIGE - much respect.  This is one of the best CD's I've ever heard - period.  Trust me, listen to it a few times - you'll start becoming infected with her ""Growing Pains"".  THIS IS A SLAMMER - all respect to the TRUE QUEEN OF HIP HOP SOUL.  God is my witness!!  If Mariah is ""the voice"" - and Rickie Lee is ""my heart"" - then NO QUESTION Mary J. Blige is QUEEN OF MY SOUL.  This CD is too good.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOU BOUGHT THIS CD EVER."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Back in 2003, someone apparently thought it was a good idea to bring the powers that were Mary J. Blige and P. Diddy back together, in hopes of re-creating the magic of their earlier works. Well, they were wrong. By no means was the result, Love & Life, a terrible album; however, almost any fan will agree that it's Mary's--for the lack of a better term--worst work to date. Yes, there were some great moments, but most of it was uninspired with some pretty lazy production, courtesy of Diddy. The disc barely went platinum, making it her lowest selling studio album by far. The ever-consistent woman who seemingly could do no wrong made a slight misstep. That's what made 2005's excellent release, The Breakthrough, such a pleasant surprise. With the huge success of ""Be Without You,"" the album's triple platinum status, its record-breaking first-week sales, and its eight Grammy nominations, it proved that Blige was on top once again and wasn't going anywhere. Two years later, she is back with Growing Pains.

From the photos, to the lyrics, to the themes and overall sound, Mary J. is definitely getting her grown woman on. Now a wife, she speaks with brutal honesty and maturity on serious relationships. They involve work, conflicts, disagreements, dependency, compromise, pain, passion, effort, and love, of course. Although it is a beautiful thing and brings much joy to people, to quote her, ""it ain't all roses."" I have read numerous reviews, from proffesionals nonetheless, that simply dismiss some of the lyrics as ""preachy,"" but I would have to disagree. Mary is a woman who has clearly been through many trials and tribulations in her life, and she just wants to share her wisdom and knowledge of the world to her large fanbase, who could most likely benefit from her viewpoints. (If these reviewers really can't hear these True-to-life statements without cringing, then it's probably time they put themselves in check!) The pictures in the album's booklet show Mary keeping it classier than ever.

The stunning back cover shows Mary sitting atop a cabinet of old vinyls. The only vinyl cover that you are able to decipher is Diana Ross' 1981 album, Why Do Fools Fall In Love. It is most likely just a plain coincidence, but it speaks volumes of Growing Pains. This album has the major crossover appeal that Ross possessed back in the day. While Pains will not alienate her solid fanbase that was built upon her original hip-hop/soul (which is still very present), each track, especially ""Come To Me (Peace),"" contains a slight change in sound that could let them be comfortable on almost any radio format, not just simply R&B. This could be due to some fresh producers and songwriters that have shown much promise recently, such as Ne-Yo, Tricky, The Dream, Jazze Pha, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, and the Neptunes, among others.

""Work That,"" as heard in the iTunes commercials, is a great choice for the second single. It is upbeat, inspirational, and infectious. The production by newcomer, Theron Otis Feemster, is simple and melodic, but it suits the song perfectly. On this, and a few other select tracks, Mary has a new swagger in her delivery that almost makes her sound like an MC. ""Grown Woman"" is another example of this. Over the hard-hitting and grungy hip-hop beat, she exudes confidence and pride in her womanhood. ""Stay Down"" speaks on marriage and how ""sometimes when we fight/ it don't seem like God's desgin/ but... I promised I would stand by you."" My favorite line appears in the chorus, when she begs her man to ""stay down/ we're almost to the very best part."" The production, by ingenious Bryan-Michael Cox, complements the emotion and triumph in Mary's strong vocals. ""Roses"" finds her nowhere near being preahcy; it's about those days when you want to be left alone and quite frankly, your lover just fans the fire. In between verses, she speaks, venting her emotions. On ""Talk To Me,"" she urges her man to communicate his feelings over an Emotions horn sample, casuing the track to have a very nostalgic, old school soul feel.

While this album is excellent, it is not flawless. Ludacris' guest appearance irritates me and almost ruins the great ""Grown Woman"" for me. His verse, while not terrible, is a bit vulgar, putting him and his supposed grown woman's bedroom business all out there. Lines like ""we some Stairmasters/ I make her get her exercise"" seem to contradict the classiness that Mary maintains throughout the rest of the track. ""Shake Down"" sounds a bit too much like something Mariah Carey would record. (I love Mariah, I just think that it's not like something Mary would do.) It's not a bad track, though. ""Just Fine,"" oddly chosen as the lead-off single, is a song I can take or leave depending on the day and my mood. ""Till the Morning,"" however, is my least favorite track. The Neptunes' production and writing has become very bland, stale, and predictable to me by this point in time. The song sounds like Kelis-lite during her Kaleidoscope era. The bridge is good, but that's pretty much all I enjoy of the track. ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"" is a musically very good, but the whole I'm-just-like-you-even-though-I'm-a-celebrity thing is getting pretty tired. ""What Love Is"" is also exceptional, but lyrics like ""it feels like joy/ it feels like pain/ it feels like sunshine/ it feels like rain"" are undeniably clich&eacute;.

The bottom line: It is not perfect, but Growing Pains is still a darn good album. Her vocals are on point, the production and songwriting is top notch, and the lyrics are mature and real. Growing Pains has a slightly new sound that will most likely lead to an even bigger crossover than The Breakthrough caused. Still, even her fans from the beginning will feel satisfied. How does she do it? It's a mystery. Mary J. Blige is a truly special and talented grown woman.

Key tracks: Grown Woman, Stay Down, Roses, Fade Away, Talk to Me, Work That."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"MJB is a force to be reckoned with. She comes out with amazing CD after amazing CD. How does she do it?!?!  She knows what her audience likes and why fix something that is not broken. She delivers and does it with 110% on `Growing Pains'.
As with everything thing May J. Blige does she puts every ounce of emotion and rawness into every song on this set.  Every song on here is a stand out that it's hard to single out any song. There is everything from classic slow Mary jams to the upbeat dance tracks to songs with a rock twinge fused into them.

My favorites on here include:
""Work That"" which has a great beat to it and promotes a good motto - to be yourself!
""Roses"" is THE cut!!  WOW!  Great melody, great lyrics and amazing vocals!
""Work In Progress (Growing Pains"" is a song that we can all relate to. Very good

I think the biggest appeal of MJB is that she is very relatable. She sings from the heart and it feels like every song was written for us; the listeners. She is your neighbor, your friend, your sister. Mary deserves every bit of success she gets and this CD is living proof of that! Amazing!!

,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Let me preface this review by saying that no True Mary J. Blige fan expected Blige to return with an album that was as classic as 2005's brilliant THE BREAKTHROUGH. Blige even commented that she wasn't concerned about outdoing the success of that milestone in her career. While the exceptional GROWING PAINS doesn't trump THE BREAKTHROUGH, it is another solid album in MJB's career.  With that said, Blige does experiment more on GROWING PAINS that she has on previous albums which gives all fans a taste of what the future may hold for Blige. It is a well balanced mixed of adult contemporary styled R&B, hip-hop, and urban contemporary music.

The album starts off on the right foot with ""Work That"", which is honestly the best of the two singles released from GROWING PAINS as of yet.  The production isn't far removed from NO MORE DRAMA's ""Family Affair"" and proves to be a welcome addition to Mary's collection.  ""Grown Woman"" is one of the big surprises of GROWING PAINS in which Blige channels her hip-hop soul roots for a banger that will surely crossover to R&B purists as well as hip-hop savvy listeners.  Ludacris's guest verse is sound here, but Mary J. Blige makes sure that all eyes are on her as she shed's through this albums ""Enough Cryin'"".  The difference? Harder drums and a more spunky vocal performance from MJB.

""Just Fine"" follows and keeps the momentum moving forward.  When I first heard this track, I was actually a bit disappointed.  It took time for it to grow on me and when it did, it was hott!!! Again, ""Work That"" is still the best.  ""Feel Like a Woman"", ""Stay Down"", and ""Hurt Now""  are all strong.  ""Shakedown"" features Usher and while it isn't Usher's best collaboration (that would be ""Same Girl""), it is enjoyable.  ""Til Morning"" is this albums ""Gonna Breakthrough"" or ""You Can't Hide From Luv""  - it's nearly perfect.  ""Roses"" and ""Fade Away"" are solid, but not as exciting as the earlier tracks or the phenomenal ""What Love Is"", ""Work in Progress (Growing Pains)"", or neo-soul inflected ""Talk To Me"" with its six feel groove.  ""If You Love Me"", ""Smoke"", and ""Come To Me (Peace)"" are solid, though they aren't the best of the best of GROWING PAINS. Notably, ""Come To Me"" does features innovative production work combining the best of the adult-alternative pop with R&B/Hip-hop synths.

All quibbles aside, GROWING PAINS is destined to be another critical and commercial hit for MJB.  It may not match THE BREAKTHROUGH, but who cares.  Mary has been representing since circa 1990 and each and every album has been incredibly consistent - she can sing her butt off! Even LOVE & LIFE, weaker than her other efforts, was a shining moment because MJB can make bad material sound better than what it is and that is a gift. 4 stars Mary - Keep working that!!!"
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I love this CD. Mary definately put it down!! The lyrics, beats, and vocal execution are superb. Once again Mary gave us a peak into her life. The realness of her lyrics and her strong conviction while singing, make this CD such a pleasure to listen to. I can not get enough. You know how you get a new CD and you listen one time and say ""this is okay""; well with this CD I keep thinking, ""this joint is bumping"". I kepp palying it over and over.
Mary did her thing. I am proud of her, her strength as a mature ""Grown Woman"" shines throughout. Even if you are not a Mary J. fan, you'll love the CD."
,B00110DT4C,1,-1,3,"the thing with Mary J.Blige is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her albums that i can get with such as Just fine. that song is cool and compliments her. vocally she sounds good on this set.  overall though and I gotta compare she isn't anywhere near her first two albums which just stand out like that. but she is able to keep on going and put out some cuts that are cool. her theme is played out and worn out,but the formula works because she still can make a cut or two that sticks. Production is cool and the arrangements are cool. songwriting is hit and miss overall to me."
,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Mary J. Blige follows ""The Breakthrough"" with ""Growing Pains"" which to me was an even stronger effort that claims the title of being one of her best, if not the best, albums of her career. She found her footing with ""The Breakthrough"" and any fears that she'd return with a cd that wasn't as strong should be put aside. ""Growing Pains"" has something for all of her fans and new ones, a sound that mirrors old R&B but also goes into territory that music seems afraid to venture into. After listening to the entire album, I found myself saying this was True quality. There isn't really a track to skip here; each song adds something to the mix and covers everything from a dance-vibe to a laid-back groove about love and loss.

Some of the standout tracks are ""Work That"" which is one of the upbeat songs, ""Grown Woman"" that could be this albums ""Enough Crying"" with Mary dishing out her good qualities and what makes her stand out at this point in her life. ""Feel Like A Woman"" is a new kind of song for Blige where she puts aside her reservations about being with someone and shows her most vulnerable of traits in this ballad-like track. ""Stay Down"" stands as my favorite, another turn for Mary J. Blige as she's asking her man to stay through the troubles and paints a picture of better days in their relationship that are to come. ""Roses"" is another track, more hard in sound, with Blige proclaiming she's all right and doesn't need people telling her what's wrong with her. ""Fade Away"" and ""What Love Is"" both are tracks that stand out for their production and the feeling she evokes. In what's perhaps one of her best closing tracks, ""Come To Me (Peace)"", is a big R&B/80s type of song that's a no-holds-barge explosion of sound and is moving and leaves you wanting more.

In all, ""Growing Pains"" is an absolute must own. Where most artist hit their peak at some point and become predictable, Mary J. Blige seems to be getting better with each year. The songs on this cd are fresh, original and yet sound different and a bit experimental for Blige as she matures into her new sound and comfort zone as an artist. Buy this cd, you will not be disappointed."

,B00113SLBA,-1,-1,3,"The quest to acquire all of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's music continues... and brings me to his fourth studio album and one of the admitted ""low points"" of Al's career.  After the phenomenal success of his first three albums, it must have been a shock for Al's fans (as well as himself) for his fourth album to be a flop in comparison.  In fact, many critics and even Al himself believed ""Polka Party"" would be his swan song and mark the end of his career.  Nearly thirty years later, of course, we know that's not True, but all the same, this album is often highlighted as a ""valley"" in his career, and most of its songs have been largely forgotten (with at least one outrageous exception).

After listening to this album, I'm inclined to agree with the critics -- while still fun, it's not Al's best, and while I enjoy a few of the songs, others are largely forgettable.

Al is best known for his parodies, and they make up about half of this album.  Of said parodies, my favorite would have to be ""Addicted to Spuds,"" his parody of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love.""  Food songs are practically a tradition for him by now, and this number takes Palmer's energetic original and turns it into an ode to the tuber.  ""Living With a Hernia,"" a parody of James Brown's ""Living In America,"" isn't quite as fun in my opinion, but it's a nice tribute to the original and shows that Al's capable of taking on a wide variety of musical styles.  The other parodies include ""Here's Johnny"" (El DeBarge's ""Who's Johnny""), a tribute to Ed McMahon of the Johnny Carson Show; ""Toothless People"" (Mick Jagger's ""Ruthless People""), which sounds curiously uninspired and without much effort put into the lyrics; and his by-now-customary polka mix in the titular ""Polka Party,"" which includes samples from various hits such as ""Harlem Shuffle,"" ""Venus,"" ""Sussidio,"" ""Rock Me Amadeus,"" and ""Papa Don't Preach.""

The originals are a mixed bag as well.  I didn't particularly care for ""Dog Eat Dog"" or ""Don't Wear Those Shoes,"" but I enjoyed the twangy country-western style of ""Good Enough For Now,"" as well as its hilarious lyrics that pay tribute to a ""just about average"" love interest.  ""One Of Those Days"" would have to be my favorite of the originals, as Al gripes about the various minor and major accidents and disasters that have befallen him today, ranging from losing a sock in the dryer to angry mobs burning crosses on his lawn -- and yes, it's the juxtaposition of the ridiculously major and hilariously minor disasters that make this song funny.

The most infamous number from this album would have to be ""Christmas At Ground Zero,"" the result of his record label requesting that he write a Christmas song -- you would really think that they would have learned their lesson about telling Al what to do from ""Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch.""  A merry and jingly tune carries some of the most disturbing lyrics of all time, detailing a Christmas celebrated after the nuclear bombs drop and reduce the world to a radioactive wasteland... and to top it off, the song ends with an air raid siren.  Even before 9/11 gave the term ""Ground Zero"" its far more tragic second meaning, it's a disturbing song... and yet weirdly hilarious at the same time.  Al may be goofy, but he also excels at black comedy.

Definitely not Al's best album, though a few hits do keep it from being a total wash.  If you're an Al completionist, go ahead and buy the album, but if you just want his best songs, I recommend you simply buy downloads of ""Addicted To Spuds"" and ""One Of Those Days,"" and maybe ""Christmas At Ground Zero"" if you don't mind some morbid humor.  Otherwise, save a full album purchase for ""Dare To Be Stupid"" or ""Mandatory Fun."""

,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,3,"I tried to give Rick the benefit of the doubt here, but his selection of covers needed more consideration. I mean, most of the songs are ballads, and he does not improve upon the originals. I liked this album, but that's about it. I do not understand why Rick chose to remake songs almost identical to their originals. I really did not enjoy his version of The Dream Academy's ""Life In A Northern Town"" or Foreigner's ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"". I did not understand why he got Richard Page of Mr. Mister to redo ""Broken Wings"". I mean, why get the vocalist of the song to do the song again? His version of Human League's ""Human"" also failed. However, there was something likeable about his version of The Church's ""Under The Milky Way"" and John Lennon's ""Imagine"". The only original song, ""Cry"", cannot hold a candle to the other classics on the disc. Why is that Rick would do an album of covers not even two years after releasing his first album of original material in five years? All I can say is that I am glad he got this out of the way so he can move on to better things."
,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,3,"I agree with the reviewer who says he buys every release Rick does... I am the same way, as are most diehard Rick fans.  That said, just because I am a diehard doesnt mean I will like everything Rick does (not saying all diehards blindly love everything he does, but MANY do).  Rick is one of my all time favorite songwriters... I have no reason to be lackluster in any review unless it is how I really feel...

This is not a bad release.  Unfortunately, its not a good release either.  It's a solid ""ho hum"".  It's main problem is it and its songs is generally boring.  The songs are either slow or most are lacking in emotion.  Most are also very close to the originals in arrangement but a lesser finished product... in the way you hear when some studio band cranks out the top 40 hits ""as performed by ____"" that you used to see for $1.99 at department stores.  For me, it makes me think of the originals and why I like them better.  Broken Wings and Waiting For A Girl Like You are great songs originally... but they sound very similar here and in the case of WFAGLY, it was simply BETTER, with Lou Gramm singing it.  Unfortunately, there is not one cover here that I think is an improvement upon the original... (unlike how Rick made ""I've Done Everything For You"" and a few other covers through his career so much better than their originals).  Few here even get me remotely excited.  Here, the standout covers are Human and Baker Street (which is a lighter more heartfelt version than the one put out a few years ago by Foo Fighters).  The whole album is so lacking in intensity.  I know he intentionally chose songs that are mellow, but I just don't think that was wise and it makes for a release that is easy to file in your collection and forget.  There isn't any cover song except Baker Street that makes me want to hear it again.  Rick is a master of intensity in the right places... Shock Denial Anger Acceptance seemed to reiterate that point both to Rick and to the fans.  Had he done a cover CD with some more rocking tunes mixed in, I think it might have been at least more interesting if not downright good... this one just isn't and I can only hope this hasn't kept him from working on new songs for the next real CD.

The one gem on this release is Rick's own song Cry, and that alone really makes it worth something to the diehards (in addition to the fact that diehards will buy anything he does anyway).  It is a very good song that is emotional and has some great vocals upon it.  I find it only adds to my wish that Rick would have spent this time recording his own work than doing this!  Unless you have all other Rick albums already, you are better off putting your money into them than this album.  Especially be sure you have Shock Denial Anger Acceptance, Living In Oz, or Working Class Dog before even considering this one... those are Rick at his best.

(Again, this isn't a bad CD... but Rick's real work is so superior and an average release for Rick isn't indicative of his abilities.  I'd hate to see someone buy this as their introduction to Rick and come away thinking he isn't all that good.)"
,B0011B6UI8,1,1,4,"The Good

There's not much to say about this release really. For the most part Springfield stays True to the original arrangements of the songs, albeit for a different guitar or piano tone here and there. With the songs I recognize, ""I'm Not in Love,"" ""Life in a Northern Town,"" ""Broken Wings,"" ""Baker Street,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" ""For No On,"" and ""Imagine,"" they sound just like the originals versions, except their being sung by Rick Springfield. All of the tracks chosen are mellow and flow nicely together. Rick is in great voice, but doesn't really challenge himself.

The Bad

It doesn't really make sense to include a new song (""Cry"") on a covers album, but at least it fits in with the rest. I would have liked to have heard a couple of slightly different versions or arrangements.

The Verdict

I know I've been a little critical of this album, but overall I like it. They're songs I know, from an artist I enjoy. The best thing about Rick Springfield staying True to the originals is that there's no room to mess them up, which happens sometimes with covers albums."
,B0011B6UI8,1,-1,2,"The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought ""Cool...this just might work!"" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's True talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's ""I'm Not In Love."" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the ""Big boys don't cry"" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the ""I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back"" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with ""Under The Milky Way"", ""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Broken Wings."" Oh, sure, ""Under...."" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on ""....Town"" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for ""Town"", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for ""Wing""). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal ""Human."" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a True testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. ""Holding On To Yesterday"" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. ""Baker Street"" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. ""Let's Go Out Tonight"" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on ""For The One."" Much like ""Human"", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to ""Miss You Nights"" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! ""Blue Rose"" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. ""Cry"" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (""You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb""), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with ""Imagine"", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here)."
,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,3,"Rick Springfield has been anything but bland, from his breakout ""Jessie's Girl"" to his previous release, SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE.  THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is, unfortunately, a largely bland effort.  Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker (there are some excellent guitar riffs in here), but his voice has gotten worse (worked well on SDAA, but a raspy, spoken-voiced version of ""Imagine""?  Come on).

Therefore, this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans, nor please his old ones (especially since it's a cover album, and he has only one original on here that doesn't measure up to his usual songwriting standards).  The main flaw of the record is this: Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit ""Human Touch.""  In fact, this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record, with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory.  And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality, and while a few of his performances shine (""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Miss You Nights"" specifically), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let-down.  Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield, if not in his finest vocal form, at least writing his own tunes again, and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits, or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA."
,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,1,"I truly did not want to believe that this was one of my beloved favorites, Rick Springfield murdering each and every song on this album, but a person can only go so far on denial. In my case delusion didn't even make it through the first track, and by the time I trudged on through to the end I only got really, really sad.

I didn't know that Rick could suck.

This album is a massacre. It should be taken away, hidden, and hopefully forgotten."

,B0011DNO12,1,1,5,"Almost 25 years old, and still great. Metal is dead now. There aren't songs like this anymore."
,B0011DNO12,1,1,5,"Originally released in 1990 and nominated (not selected) for Best Rock Song (Grammy Awards), this song has transcended the years and now, in 2014, it is still amazing; ethereal, melodic, and wonderfully engineered.  Geoff Tates voice/delivery is simply flawless.  Composed by Chris DeGarmo (lead guitar), Silent Lucidity is dynamic and backed by an orchestra.

Silent Lucidity is originally from the album Empire; and is matched with numerous tracks of quality musicianship. (Silent Lucidity, Empire,  Best I Can, Della Brown, and Hand on Heart are my favs).  Enjoy."

,B0011DNO12,1,1,4,nice job. thanks
,B0011DNO12,1,1,5,Great song.  The remaster is excellent.  Really enjoyed finding it and adding it to my collection of music that has been lost over the years.
,B0011DNO12,1,1,5,"From the album Empire, ranked #21 on VH1s Greatest Power Ballads, reached #9 on Billboard Hot 100, #1 on Billboard Album Rock Tracks, and was Grammy-nominated for Best Rock Song."
,B0011GF9ZI,-1,1,5,Just another tune that when you hear it takes you back.  And this one also has you banging your head to the beat.  Awesome song.
,B0011GF9ZI,-1,-1,2,This is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said. The only place that has the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of 80s CD. It sounds a little thin to me but its the right version at least.
,B0011GR6ZY,1,1,5,corona is a grate singer i love the song its a older song but sounds grate i love it and i play the song all day
,B0011U59CW,1,1,5,"loved the movie XXX love the song , good to hear trying to stay awake driving home from work !!!!"
,B0011U59CW,1,1,5,"One of my favorite words!  This is the perfect song to seduce someone with!  The music makes you feel sexy, and the person with you becomes mesmorized!!!!"
,B0011U59CW,1,1,5,"This is such a super naughty song, but really love the slinkly sexy beat.  The cover photo it really funny"
,B0011UKT0Y,1,1,5,"Drenched in guitars and strings, and in a minor key, ""There Is A Tree"" hooked me the minute Carrie began to sing, and from there the album never lost my interest.  Thoughtful, unusual songs yet sound familiar, and upon a second listen, feel like old friends.  The instrumentation, although relatively spare, sounds full and rich, complimenting Newcomer's lovely, alto voice perfectly, without ever stealing the spotlight.  A few tracks have gentle, sometimes driving rhythms, and there are subtle yet surprising sounds around every bend, so there's enough variety to keep THE GEOGRAPHY OF LIGHT from becoming too somber.  In fact the title and the cover art are quite apt, as the general mood of this wonderful CD does remind me of one of those days when half the sky is dark with a passing storm, yet clear enough in spaces to let shafts of golden sunlight through.

A couple of side notes: not only has Carrie written perhaps the only song ever sung about geodes, but she then ends this elegant album on an upbeat note with ""Don't Push Send,"" a highly amusing ditty about the dangers of writing and sending letters in cyber-space.  Presumably, she calls this a ""bonus track"" because it's so different from the rest of the album, but it works, and I've quickly decided that it's not a throwaway; it belongs here...

I've been listening to Carrie Newcomer's songs for many years, and have most of her albums on CD.  But it wasn't until 2000's THE AGE OF POSSIBILITY that I thought Carrie had finally done a truly solid album.  In 2002 and 2005, respectively, she released two more fine CD's, GATHERING OF SPIRITS and REGULARS AND REFUGEES.  The latter included a single from the previous release, a BEST OF collection, ""Betty's Diner"" which had been inspired by her own short story.  The subsequent album was all about the people she imagined as customers of said diner.  The conceit worked well, and I could hardly wait to hear what Newcomer would come up with next.  It would be a two-year wait, but it was worth it.  I believe Carrie Newcomer has topped herself and turned out her best album yet.  Not a False step here; this is a woman who has hit her stride.  She has always written compelling lyrics, but this time out, the the melodies, music and arrangements rise to their level in just about every instance.  If you like thoughtful, mature songs that are about something, and your taste runs toward the melodic, I can recommend this CD without reservation."
,B0011UY1F8,1,-1,3,Nice Song.
,B0011UY1F8,1,1,5,another catchy tune
,B0011UY1F8,-1,1,5,"If you played Portal you will know this song and probably will ""get"" it. If you have not played Portal it will probably seem silly to you though maybe catchy."
,B0011UY1F8,1,1,5,"Still Alive / B0011UY1F8

So, I just finished ""Portal"" and OMG-AWESOME-SONG at the end prompted me to cruise over to Amazon and download this MP3. I'm pleased to report that this MP3 is identical to the end-game song, I was afraid that this might be a ""remix"" or some craziness when all I wanted was the actual song at the end of the game.

I've had no quality problems with this - loaded it into my MP3 player, hooked it up to the car stereo, and blasted it out the windows going down the highway and it still sounded great. Like all Amazon MP3s, there is no DRM nonsense to deal with - once you buy it, you can load it onto any device you like without having to mess with passwords or device registration.

,B0011W1VYU,1,1,5,"This singer ""LeAnne Rimes"" Is the greatest singer. She sings a little Patsy Cline and has her own style. The title song is the greatest.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greatest-Hits/dp/B0000D9PFN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greatest Hits</a>"
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,"The song ""Held"" speaks of a mother whose baby dies. In this instance, God does not prevent the tragedy, but He is with this grieving mother and holds her while she goes through this trial."
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,I have loved this song for many years. I have it on DVD and wanted it on my Kindle. It spoke to my heart when my son died unexpectedly. Now I understand what it means to be HELD.
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,"I got this when my nephew died. I was hoping to send it to my brother.
It doesn't really go far enough to council, but is a beautiful song and inspiring."
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,Great song to listen too.  Great reminder that God is with us in the hard times and while some things happen that totally suck God is still there to hold us in our pain.
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,"This vocalist is blessed with great talent, yet delivers with great emotion-filled lyrics.  Listen closely - you who have suffered any kind of loss will find comfort.  This is a great gift - to yourself or for someone else!"
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,This song on the album was one of the best songs that had good music and words that had a real meaning. My wife and I enjoyed the music very much and will be purchasing more of her albums.
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,"A wonderful song about how uplifting even the lightest of human touches can be.  All of us have a need that only the ""touch"" of another can satisfy."
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,"The product was exceptional and I love the convenience of clicking and downloading. Fast and easy, from anywhere you might be."
,B0011W0D6C,1,1,5,love song and it sounds awesome.  would recommend the download to anyone wanting this song to sound crisp and clear
,B0011W0D6C,1,1,4,"The lyrics definitely bring you to a point of thought unescapeably  brilliant.
Although I liked the song, it didn't give me that jolt that I look for in a country song."
,B0011W0D6C,1,1,5,"Everyone should listen to the story the lyrics tell.  The woman's life is falling apart (she's having a bad week) and she is taking it on full force singing ""tomorrows another day and I'm thirsty anyway so bring on the rain.""  The subtle harmonies w/ Tim are nice.  A great song for when life has got you down; it reminds you that you're not beat."
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,"I ONLY buy my MP3's from Amazon.  Easy to purchase, easy to find, easy to download.  I have them on my Cloud so if I changed from an I Phone back to an Android; I only have to upload the app and there is my music."
,B0011W1U9G,1,1,5,"I think I had ""heard"" this song on the radio many times before I actually stopped to listen to what was actually being sung.  It is a song about the loss of innocent life--long before it's time--and yet finding some hope in that God is still in control of everything.  What I like is that Natalie dared to sing about something that happens to many people and is very painful.  As Christians, we do often wonder why God lets suffering exist in this world.  While there is not an easy answer to that question, it is clear that God remains a source of hope."
,B0011W0D6C,1,1,5,"Wonderful lady,sings awesome songs. I love her voice"
,B0011W0D6C,1,1,5,MP3 Music Download - Bought it because a family member likes the song.
,B0011W0D6C,1,1,5,LOVE IT
,B0011W0D6C,-1,1,5,The first time I saw her live sing this it actually started to rain lol.
,B0011W0D6C,1,1,5,Great sound!
,B0011W0D6C,1,1,4,This is a very good song sung by her. My wife really likes her music.
,B0011W0CTA,1,1,5,This was a huge hit for LeAnn Rimes years ago; it is very pretty.
,B0011W0CTA,1,1,4,Beautiful song from a pure country voice.
,B0011W0CTA,1,1,5,I never realized how much soul LeAnn Rimes has she can compete with the best. I love this song so much and especially her yodel I wish I could do that. Great Great song!
,B0011W0CTA,1,1,5,love anything this man sings again why must I type all this when all I need to say is I loved it
,B0011W0CTA,1,1,5,"I am sure she is tired of hearing that!  This song was made when she was just a teen of 13 or 14.  Her voice was (and still is) one of the sweetest sounds in music.

Thanks to Mike Curb (of Curb Records) for taking a chance on this kid!  I can only hope her career lasts for many more years!"
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,"Again I am not a country music person, but I happend to hear this on XPN (they play everything), and it made me stop and think about how I react and act in front of my kids.

Since then, I've been watching what I say, and catch myself before I let my mouth fly off.

A great ""lessons in life"" song for us parents... get it!"
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,like it alot
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,Perfect!
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,Great
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,great music
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,A+
,B0011W20PY,1,-1,3,yep !
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,I just love this song.  Plumb has just a wonderful voice.  The lyrics are very encouraging too.  When you get down in this world sometimes you need to stop and reflect on what you are worrying about.  You are always safe in the arms of your loving God.
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorite Plumb songs.  So sweet and beautiful.  It almost sounds like a lullaby, and with her characteristic profound, lyrical words and music.  Love it!  Nearly makes me cry, which is difficult to do.  I suspect anyone with kids would find it easy to cry listening to this one."
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,Heard a song by her on Vampire Diaries a few seasons back.  She has such a beautiful and haunting voice.  This is one of my favorite songs right now!
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,This is a favorite song of both myself and my daughter and means alot to the two of us.  It's a beautiful expression of the relationship between a mother and child in all it's beauty and heartache.  There are just no words that can better express what this song does.
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,"This is an amazing song that deserves more than it gets.  I believe if mainstream radio got a hold of this one it would do extremly well.  It's sad not many people hear it.  A soft song that grows, the voice reminds me of Evanescence."
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,Great
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,I heard this song on the radio and fell in love with it.  My husband heard it and it brought tears to his eyes. You never know what a song will do. This is a powerful song with positive meaning.  We have a son and he repeats alot thankfully we don't curse in front of him.
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,This is a must have for any music collection.  You won't be disappointed with this great download. I highly recommend.
,B0011W20PY,-1,1,5,"I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.
See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:"
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,"My son brought me this song on his computer to listen to one night.  I listened to it and after I fought back tears for a while, I had to buy it.  It is also my ringtone for my phone. Great song, grateful my son shared it with me."
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,"This song makes me think of my boys growing up, and doing the same thing thier dad did. Now with kids of thier own i watch my grandsons do the same."
,B0011W20PY,1,1,5,"Rodney Atkins' song, ""Watching you"", is a great song to add to your collection. If you like country music this song is a must. Good father-son song."
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,"Plumb expresses many of my feelings toward God, and they stir those feeling often."
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,4,"Great song, using this for one of my childrens' yearly  movie compilations."
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,"I just love this song. It is touching a powerful, with sweeping melodies, good lyrics, and powerful vocals. Great for mothers or people who just want to be inspired."
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,4,It's always best to listen to the samples of the whole album and decide if it would be cheaper to buy the whole album or just your favorites.
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,WIFE GOT MP3 PLAYER. SHE LIKE THE SONG. DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT OTHER THAN THAT. SHE SEEMS TO ENJOY.
,B0011W3VXO,-1,1,5,"Beautiful song about being a parent, Plumb never disappoints. It sounds sad or eerie, but the words really aren't. It's not played on the radio enough for me so I bought it."
,B0011W3VXO,-1,1,5,this song is about how a mother feels about her baby and imagines how that will change as he/she grows up!
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,This is my review about this song. It is a great song. I like the singing and the music a whole lot.
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,great music love the artist i still need to get more of her songs cant stop listening to her at all
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,4,I really like this group.  I had never heard of them before. Now I have 2 of their songs that are amazing.
,B0011W3VXO,1,1,5,"Powerful and awesome to know in our hearts that we are truly safe in His arms.
Plum brings out the heart of God"

,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,Shipped fast
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,I first heard this as an accompaniment to a YouTube video tribute to the troops on a Memorial Day clip. It was sensational. I think about their sacrifice every time I play this exceptional version of an old hymn.
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,the best rendition of this song that i have heard bravo
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,Great song.
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,good

,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,"AWESOME love song, this was my wedding song!"
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,"I ordered this for a very close friend's funeral. I fell in love the first time I listened to it. I knew this was the one. The audio was superb. No cutting out, no static, no nothing but beautiful music."
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,good
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,"I downloaded this song to play at my husbands funeral, was beautiful!!"
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,I love it in honor of Whitney Houston.
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,Just a beautiful song by two great country artists...The video was also very well done and never a day goes by that I don't sit back and listen to it...
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,Lucky dog.... :)  Great music from a great artist.  See him in person and listen to his music.  You will enjoy.
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,"I enjoy having ""It's Your Love"" on the cloud so I can listen to it any time I wish.
Great !"
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,"This was our wedding song and my husband always sings it to me, it's the only song he'll sing at karaoke...."
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,Wonderful rendition by LeAnn. Her voice is perfection
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,"Strong, powerful vocal  Best version of song ever."
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,4,"I would recommend this song to anyone who is a fan of LeAnn Rimes or a fan of Amazing Grace.  I have only had this song for one day, and have listened to it twice so far, but plan to listen to it more as time goes on.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The quality of the MP3 is GREAT, and the price was reasonable."
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,I get chills every time I hear this song and Leann Rimes hit the spot in my heart with her great voice.
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,"Oh my goodness ! The greatest cover to this traditional tune ever recorded. The power, range, tone and bold beauty of LeAnn's voice is a siren that knows no limits. Remarkable talent !"
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,This is a great arrangement of a beautiful song..One of her best efforts in a long time for this fan of LeAnn Rimes..
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,Keep them coming Amazon! Tim rocks on all his songs and I love adding to my collection even more now
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,4,I down loaded fast and I was alble to listen to the music right away. I like the song very much.
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,"Bought this just in time for Valentine's Day!  Hadn't heard it in a while and when it came on the radio, I knew I had to buy it.  Their voices are so perfect together and the song lyrics are so sweet."
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,"I know, not a unique pick, but still one of my favorite songs of all time. Beautiful, beautiful song and he sings it so well."
,B0011W0CE0,1,1,5,I used this song in a fantastic CD I created. The CD is music to make love by...used 16 sexy and romantic songs.
,B0011W0CE0,-1,1,5,I bought and paid for this song also and it says it down loaded but It says it downloaded but I can not find it on my itunes or my windows media player....How do I find it?
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,"Leann Rimes sang Amazing Grace beautifully !!  I was already a fan of some of her songs, but she really nailed this one !!  I would suggest this to anyone !!"
,B0011W1W5S,1,1,5,LeAnn Rimes' version of this song is classic and always gives me goosebumps.  This is my favorite hymn and her version is the best.
,B0011W20RW,1,1,4,this is just a good comfort song that you know and you for some reason just want to get up and sing and dance to. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a song that makes you move even if it is just a little bit in your work chair.

,B0011W20RW,1,1,5,Always a great deal on the down load of a great country song. Always a great price and easy to get to on the cloud.
,B0011W20RW,1,1,5,The lyrics are great and mean a lot to anyone who has had a lot of tribulations in their life. Rodney Atkins is a great talent!
,B0011W20RW,1,1,5,I work at an auto parts store #666 that is our store song. Just because of our store number. We have a great store and good people working it.
,B0011W5T7K,1,1,5,I like fast paced songs. I just like to have some CDs that have all upbeat songs and good verity.
,B0011W5T7K,1,1,5,"This song is just an instant classic. It's my favorite Jo Dee Messina song ever (even beating out ""My Give a Damn's Busted"") and I love the message of getting out, of going somewhere and chasing down freedom and life, wherever they take you. It's fun, it's catchy, and you'll find yourself singing along every time you get in the car. :)"
,B0011W1Y2E,1,1,5,"Sound quality was good, nothing that shouldn't be in there, and had everything that it should. Very pleased with this download."
,B0011W1Y2E,1,1,5,This is a good one to sing along with and dance to.  It's one of my kitchen-dance songs LOL  I love Tim McGraw's music.
,B0011W1XJS,1,1,5,"This song which I think is also on the television movie soundtrack about my JESUS is a very touching, beautiful song about how much we need JESUS!! I would definitely recommend! GOD Bless!!"
,B0011W1XJS,1,1,5,Just flat out liked this song when I first heard several years ago.  Its a love song to the person you love and you want to pour your heart out them.
,B0011W1XJS,1,1,5,"I Can't help but love the soulful, sonorous, deep and beautiful voice of Leann rimes in this song. Simply beautiful."
,B0011W1XJS,1,1,5,Another awesome tune.  I love her voice.  Just wish she was singing more these days.  Her voice is too great to keep to herself.  Classic and timeless.  You won't be disappointed.
,B0011W1Y2E,1,1,5,great for line dancing
,B0011W1Y2E,-1,1,4,as expected
,B0011W1Y2E,1,1,5,I LIKE IT I LOVE IT.....who doesn't like Tim McGraw!  It's a fun listen and makes me smile and sing along!
,B0011W1Y2E,1,-1,2,i bought 3 of this song and they were all the same. they were live proforments. i was looking for one i could line dance to.. they were not good of line dancing.
,B0011W1Y2E,1,-1,2,i bought 3 of this song and they were all the same. they were live proforments. i was looking for one i could line dance to.  they were not good of line dancing.
,B0011W1Y2E,1,1,4,"I really liked when it first came out and its just an upbeat song and good wholesome lyrics, not a lot of swear words."
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,Good song
,B0011W20MW,1,1,4,"This is a REALLY good song, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Tim McGraw or of country music.  Not only is it tell a good story, but it's clean and I would feel comfortable having my nephews (or other children) listen to it.  I am highly satisfied with my purchase, the quality of the MP3, and will definitely be purchasing from Amazon again."
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,Love this man
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,Wonderful song.
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,thanks
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,Love it!
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,I have always love this tear jerker. From the first time I heard it I was hooked on the song
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,"What a great song, great lyrics and sung by the great Tim McGraw.  It doesn't get better than this!  I really like the lyrics, and the story they tell of human beings and how our priorities change over time."
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,"This song tells a story about a young girl and boy who grow up and get married and have a daughter. It's a sad ending and Tim McGraw sings it beautifully. I love this song. Of course, I'm a Tim McGraw fan."
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs n I just love it Tim McGraw really nails it. Sometimes I think it is the perfect song on a bad day
,B0011W20MW,1,1,5,"I loved this song.  But, I no longer have it on my computer or cloud drive since I had to have my computer repaired.  This song makes you remember what your childhood was like.  It made me remember those times that I wished I could have one of my parents entirely to myself.  That's kind of hard to do when you are number 8 in a family of 9 that also has 1 Uncle living with you.  And, one of two of your siblings always has a friend or two over.."
,B0011W20MW,1,-1,3,I am not a big Tim McGraw fan but I bought this song for a friend of mine who lost her daughter.
,B0011W20MW,1,1,4,"A friend showed me this song, and I had to download it.  The song is good, and such a sweet idea!  The last verse is definitely my favorite.  Well worth the buy!  Enjoy!"
,B0011W3Z7G,1,1,5,I Love the song and the mood of it. I heard it on Pandora and had to get it to play when I wanted to hear it.
,B0011W3Z7G,1,1,5,Its a really nice song. Its peaceful gives people a sence of hope. Its nice to listen to I was listening to it a lot.
,B0011W3Z7G,1,1,5,Wife heard this on The Vampire Diaries and feel in love with it. I would suggest that all TVD fans buy this song.
,B0011W3Z7G,1,1,5,"first heard this song on the vampire diaries tv show, i had not heard for Plumb before. loved the lyric so much, they are so deep."
,B0011W3Z7G,1,1,5,"Being a new fan of Plumb's, I came across this song recently and was left breathless.  I understand she has quite a painful history - but this song really touches on a sensitive, but very deep issue that I have been through as well.  I truly appreciate her sharing of her suffering, and thank her for verbalizing the pain in such a beautiful, accurate, and profound way."
,B0011W3Z7G,1,1,5,love it.  and just got exactly what i wanted and no more.  save bzillians this way!!!!!!  greatest invention ever in the music industy.  thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,B0011W5PYM,-1,1,5,"It's Selah. What can I say? Wonderful vocals, and obviously anointed. I'm not sure it's possible for Selah to perform a song badly."
,B0011W3WQA,1,1,5,love anything this man sings again why must I type all this when all I need to say is I loved it
,B0011W0D6M,1,1,5,One of her best! This album makes me think of great times in my life - her voice is amazing; this is definitely when she shined.
,B0011W0D6M,1,1,5,"I had never heard of Jo Dee Messina before downloading this song.  I think it was a special price like $.25 or something like that, so listened to it and liked it immediately.  Now she is one of my favorites, plus I am finding out there are a LOT of new country-western singers I didn't know about, and am adding even more to my list.  Thanks Amazon!"
,B0011W0AME,1,1,5,"I lost my version of this song and came back for seconds.  Christmas is not Christmas for me without it. Michael English does this superbly well and given this is my second buy, clearly I recommend it."
,B0011W5UTW,1,1,5,"I like Holy's  perspective on a bad time or what could have been bad time , but made us laugh a lot.  Thanks Steve Holy."
,B0011W5UTW,1,1,5,Another song I have heard on the radio over and over.  I really like it.  So now it is mine.
,B0011W0G2I,1,1,5,"this is kindof my theme song right now.
I spent 20 years loving my wife but not showing her.
I would do anything to see her smile but she never new it."
,B0011W0G2I,1,1,4,This is a good song and he does it very well. I like a lot of Country. This is among my favorites.
,B0011W0G2I,1,1,5,I don't think I could ever get sick of this McGraw song. A story of what it's like to love someone who doesn't love you back. We've all been there.
,B0011W3ZXA,1,1,4,I love those farm kids in this song. Play this every time I drive my jacked-up truck. Makes me feel good.
,B0011W3ZXA,1,1,5,"Sound quality was good, nothing that shouldn't be in there, and had everything that it should. Very pleased with this download."
,B0011W3ZXA,1,1,5,"no problems daughter loves it.  highly reccomend. akdjfasd asdfas asdfasf asdfas asdfa asfasd sadfas great song, easy download. plays great"
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Great song from a really good movie. After seeing Flicka I had to have this song so I purchased the mp3 download for my computer and my phone.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,4,Good father daughter dance song
,B0011W5T52,1,1,4,"Saying ""Let Your Love Flow"" is a classic is like saying that Elvis sold a lot of records. The Bellamy Brothers' main claim to fame opened the door to a catalog of well-done body of music available on their ""Greatest Hits"" album. Even with the hits and misses, don't miss out on the totality of their work."
,B0011W5T52,1,1,4,"Every once in a while I get the urge to buy an oldie. Amazon mp3 downloads are convenient for my purposes. I found several versions the other day and it was fast and easy to get in, buy, and listen within a minute or so. There are no strings with any 'monthly-membership' charges here: just purchase, and move on."
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,This is a great song by a pretty good band. It brings up many memories of my childhood.  I would recommend it for anyone who likes country/rock/folk or similar music.  One of those songs that just don't get old.  The download from amazon.com worked perfectly and the song had no skips or other problems.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Love it
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Really describes my daughter.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,4,good music
,B0011W7GNK,1,1,5,"It is a pleasure to hear it every time, but beware....the lyrics are addictive and you will find yourself singing them either in your head or aloud!!!"
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,"It's great to be able to purchase a single song. I use these to create memory movies, such as this was for our daughter's graduations."
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Awesome song!  Love Tim McGraw!
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,"I would highly recommend this song to anyone who is a fan of this song, or Tim McGraw.  I gave this song this rating because it reminds us not to take life for granted, and that we aren't promised tomorrow. I was highly satisfied with the price that I paid, the time that it took to download, song quality, and all I will definitely purchase from Amazon again."
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,"This is not a new song, but I heard it on the radio the other day and made a point to download it.  The music itself is nice, but you have to listen to the words.  It's something we all need to hear every now and then.  Life is too short and too precious.  Do that small thing for someone - even if you think it might be an imposition right now - if you're not glad you did it, that person will be glad you did it.  If you've lost someone close to you, this will probably bring a tear to your eye."
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,How could have a Library and not have this great oldie in it.
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,good one
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,"This is just a feel good song that, in my opinion, can transcend generations of music lovers.  It's definitely one of my Top 100 of all time and is ALWAYS on my mixed play list!  I Love this Song!"
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,This is a fun swingy song by The Bellamy Brothers from years ago.
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,Awesome!
,B0011W5T52,1,1,4,The song is fabulous.  The handiness of an mp3 download is fabulous.  But the squeezed and compressed  fidelity of mp3's in general have a lot to be desired.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Great wedding song.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Good song.
,B0011W0BKA,1,1,5,"I think LeAnn did really well with the National Anthem. If you're looking for a version where there's no instruments just singing, then buy this one!"
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,"I first heard this song when I was a teenager in the '90s, on my Billboard Hits 1976 tape.  I've liked it ever since.  I was glad to find it on here.  It's a catchy song, with a bit of a breezy/summery sound."
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,"This is the song that essentially put the Bellamy Brothers ""on the map"", so to speak. A timeless classic - one that will never grow old with time. Excellent lyrics and great background music - a real ""toe tapper""! Great stuff...!!"
,B0011W5T52,1,1,5,"This song make an excellent collection to my mp3 collection.
Highly recomended for any music lover that loves music from before the 2000s"
,B0011W5T52,-1,1,5,I recieved a free Mp3 purchase when I bought CDs from amazon. I love this special deal because I am able to buy music from CDs that I would not buy. I only like this particular song and so I bought it.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Love this song
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Love this song!  Danced with my dad at my wedding to it!
,B0011W0FSI,1,-1,3,yep !
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Danced to this song with my daddy at my wedding and sing it to my own daughter often.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Thank you!
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Thanks
,B0011W7GKS,-1,-1,3,Preferred the singing on Pitch Perfect 2 better.  This is ok.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,"This song came out right about he time my father was diagnosed with cancer. Although he didn't do a bucket list of things, he continued to work like it didn't affect him until it eventually made a child of him and eventually took his life."
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Love it.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Also a great song. Very touching.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Love this song.  This was also my Aunt Kim's favorite song.  Then a few months after it came out my Aunt died suddenly and unexpectedly at 36 years old from a massive heart attack 5 days before her son's 1st birthday.  Then 3 1/2 years later we lost a cousin at 29 years old also to a heart attack when her blood sugar crashed on her in the middle of the night.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Love it
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,4,good stuff
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Beautiful
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,4,"It's a good song. No doubt. But I believe that it touches a woman's heart much more than a man's. I'm not being a feminist by any means. So ladies, I ask that you take no offense as none is intended!"
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,My wife loves this song. We have recently had to watch the movie Flicka because of this song. But This is a great song.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Love 'My Little Girl' by Tim McGraw. It is a beautiful song of a father's love for his daughter and how he feels when it is time to give her away in marriage! Beautiful enough to make me cry every time I hear it...no matter how many times I hear it! He reminds the groom that he will always be a part of his daughter's life because she will always be his little girl in his heart! Wonderful song for a father & daughter dance at a wedding or any special event involving a father and daughter. It was used in the film 'My Friend Flicka.' Loved the movie. Love the song!
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,"We were looking for songs for the daddy/daughter dance for our daughter's wedding and I stumbled upon this song.  I played it for my husband and he said ""that's the one"".  We let our daughter know what he had chosen and she said ""what are you trying to do?  make me cry?"".  It was a beautiful and touching moment to watch them dance to this song."
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,We love this song.  Tim is a great singer and we all enjoy this in our family.  I recommend buying it.
,B0011W0FSI,1,-1,3,"I liked it because its nice that he dedicated it to his daughter, its great dad and daughter song, so I got to play for a reminder of my dad"
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Love this song. Used it as background music for the movie I clipped together for my daughter's birthday. Beautiful song and great quality. Love being able to download music instantly.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,For a perfect movie this is a perfect song. I loved hearing with my dad and I hope my daughter will love the same with her dad
,B0011W5PUQ,1,1,4,Selah has a beautiful voice.  Great song but it always makes me cry. This is my first song from Selah and I am sure I will buy more.
,B0011W5PUQ,1,1,5,I am so glad I discovered this group.  Their music is contemporary with a beautiful old hymn added every now and then.  The Title song never fails to send chills down my spine.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Great
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,absolutely great song about what a man does when he finds out he will be dying soon - I loved it!
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,love it
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Love Tim McGraw.  Beautiful music.
,B0011W7H3O,1,1,5,"Ever since ""Dancing with the Stars"" used this as one of their dance songs, I have enjoyed listening to it.  I think it will be timeless."
,B0011W7H3O,1,1,5,"no problems daughter loves it.  highly reccomend. akdjfasd asdfas asdfasf asdfas asdfa asfasd sadfas great song, easy download. plays great"
,B0011W5PUQ,1,1,5,For my wife to enjoy.
,B0011W5PUQ,1,1,5,"A dear friend gave me the album as a gift.  This has been a favorite of mine for quite a few years now.  Really love the violin, vocals and lyrics."
,B0011W5PUQ,1,1,5,Great Song!
,B0011W5PUQ,1,1,5,Love the song.
,B0011W5PUQ,1,1,5,Best version.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,"I Love this song and didn't want the whole album, but will probably buy it later. This is one of those Father Daughter song that will last forever."
,B0011W0FSI,-1,-1,3,I love the song and really wanted to play it for my daughters graduation party I had and add to her DVD  I made her but couldn't. because it wasn't as easy to down load like i was said so it didn't get used on either but just played on my home computer for her so it was a waste of money and time.
,B0011W0FSI,1,1,5,Loved this song. Used it for slideshow for my daughter. It was beautiful and timeless. Any parent can relate to the words.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,I really like this song.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Powerful and moving!
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,4,a good song for Tim
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,4,"Great song. No longer a big Tim McGraw fan, c'mon, we've seen how douchy he can be, especially to fans, but the song is super, lyrics amazing."
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Heard this on the radio and had to find out what it was.  It is a powerful song and deeply moving.  I really like it and I am not a country person.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,"Purchased this song because I, or a family member likes it."
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Especially in these trying times.
,B0011W5PUQ,1,1,5,Awesome song.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,great song
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,This song touches my heart. I have spent over 40 years not nowing if I would be alive tomorrow.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Tim McGraw is one of my favorite Country Singers; and this song is has a lot feeling in it.  I give it 5 stars
,B0011W7GKS,-1,1,5,GIVES you something to think about. We should all follow his example.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Excellent song> Makes you appreciate living even more!
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,4,great song
,B0011VUN1S,1,1,5,"Despite that this doesn't have new liner notes, or the little booklet that other Verve by request reissues had, I'm still giving it 5 stars since this album has been out of print for decades. It was reissued on an audiophile lp pressing a few years back though. These are fun takes on Mancini originals. Jones sure has a great imagination and is fun. The occasional track sounds dated using sound effects that was popular in the 60's, but on the whole, this album is really fun and is worth checking out. But the big minus is that they didn't reproduce the liner notes in a little booklet. It's reproduced on the cover and is really small. That is a shame since the notes are informative. Other than that, a fine reissue with top notch remastering!"
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Great Country song
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,More Time McGraw
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,"These 3 songs get played together on a radio station out of Nebraska every night. Don't Take The Girl, A Woman Like You and Live Like You Were Dying so I sorta got used to hearing them play all together. But this is good advice to follow. Live like you were dying."
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,i don't listen to country much but TIM MC GRAW has changed my music perspective.  this is a song that stays with you forever & we should all adapt to this mantra!!!!
,B0011W7GKS,-1,-1,3,Would hate to listen to it over and over. I had a credit that had to be used.  Did not know that I could check music before downloading.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,This is the most awesome song ever & one that many could or should relate to!  Tim chose a great song & so glad he & his dad had such a good relationship at the end.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Bucket list!! Tim McGraw and Faith Hill are great artists love their music. especially this song by Tim. Most of my country friends have this album and believe in a bucket list!
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,This is one of those songs that tell you how you need to live your life to the fullest. Song to fully live by.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,4,"This is one of those songs that gets you to think about your own life and how you are living it.
Helps you to think of what's really important in life."
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,I love the fact that I can purchase the music I like and not have to purchase a entire album.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Heard this song in a little Deli in Pasadena called Simply Sandi's...such an inspirational song!  Off the charts great!  Buy it today!
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,This is a great song to listen to day after day. This song makes me feel good every time I hear it.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,This song in total is great advice for everyone. Don't miss a day of living in your life as each one is unique and can't be re-lived.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,I love this song so much!  I have always been a fan of TIm McGraw's music.  I have one more song to love.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,4,he is such a great singer love his family and also faith hillt his song is about living like tomorrow was ur last day and how his father was dying
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,"Anybody diagnosed with Cancer will change how they look at life and to the music they listen to..I made it out to the other end, but will never forget the second chance I got and this song became a very personal reminder to always 'Live Like You Were Dying'.  rlw"
,B0011W5PRE,1,1,5,"Anyone who lost a loved one can identify with this song, not just those lives lost in war.  Very thought prevoking."
,B0011W5PRE,1,1,5,"I love Tim McGraw.  They boy can definitely sing.  As the wife and mother of soldiers, I have a special afinity for those who have lost someone to war.  It touched my heart."
,B0011W5PRE,1,1,5,Tim McGraw couldn't have made a bigger impact.  This song will live on in the hearts and minds of everyone whom hears it.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,4,I like this song as I know it was meant for his Father Tug McGraw. It is a great song and Tim does a good job singing it but I am not a fan of Tim's.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,"Talk about an inspirational song!  I love this song so much!  The first time I heard this song, I was at work.  I couldn't believe I have been missing out on this song for so long."
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,"Tim McGraw sings this with all his feeling, because it was for his father. I sing it, because it is for me!"
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,This is a great song at a great price and easy download.  Will enjoy this for a while.  Would definitely suggest purchase.
,B0011W7GKS,1,1,5,Our music minister sang this song a few weeks ago & I just loved it.  This song really makes a person evaluate how he/she is living life.
,B0011W3ZYO,1,1,5,Love all of Faith's music. The video for this song is awesome as well. Would recommend for anyone wanting to hear romantic music.
,B0011W0FQK,1,1,5,Love how the artists did this song in their own genres and yet it sounds so good. The video is also wonderful.
,B0011WABE6,-1,1,5,the music download are for me about convenience. the download is fast simple and easy and I don't want to go to a big box store just to get 1 song.
,B0011WABE6,1,1,5,"great rythme, great story, great lyrics, and it all makes you want to sing along with his sung statements that a country man can survive."
,B0011WABE6,-1,1,5,"I shouldn't like this song. I am a Christian, and he cusses in the chorus. I don't like Country music. But this song makes me smile and makes me feel good. I think most people who respect hard work and family would like this song."
,B0011WABE6,1,1,5,Bocephus at his best. one of those songs that will make you feel like you could take on anything and put those wussy dooms day preppers to shame. because everyone knows a country boy can survive.
,B0011W3ZYO,1,1,5,love
,B0011W3ZYO,1,1,4,great song

,B0011W3WRE,1,1,5,"Well, I gotta love it. I've always been interested in history, family, and music. The three interests converge here to capture my heart. When I first heard Grandpa, I had just become a proud grandpa of a beautiful baby girl. I cried when I heard Grandpa a second time. It is captivating and it is accompanied by several other beautiful songs. I can highly recommend this album, especially if you long for your grandpa, love your grandpa, or if you are a grandpa!"
,B0011WABE6,-1,1,4,"did not order, so can't review"

,B0011W3WRE,-1,1,5,"Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout The Good Old Days) by The Judd's
No one sings it as good as the original artist that made the song famous!"
,B0011W3WRE,1,1,5,"I love this song! It's one of my favorites from when the Judds were singing together. Both of my grandfathers died when I was much younger, but I love the idea of ""good old days"" stories."
,B0011W3WRE,1,1,5,"I love music, downloads great, nice song and have a lot of  other songs by this artist, am a music lover."
,B0011W3WRE,1,1,5,I recently saw Wy at a casino and was reminded of all these great songs.  I'm so happy to have this in my MP3 collection.

,B0011W3WRE,1,1,5,"This song was selected for a granddaughter's high school graduation for her from her grandpa, making the memories of a lifetime."
,B0011W3WRE,1,1,4,used this for my uncle's funeral and the download did the job it was used for.  Not much to say about a music mp3
,B0011W3WRE,1,1,5,The product was exactly as advertised. We will buy again next time we need it. Thanks for the quick shipment.
,B0011WABE6,1,1,4,Hey I no the song is way I bout IT.

,B0011W8V20,1,1,5,We performed at a friends wedding and it was awesome. Thanks it was affordable and a great asset to the wedding celebration. The ability to download was a great service too. No more waiting for weeks to get a soundtrack. Awesoe.
,B0011W8V20,1,1,5,"I like Rascal Flatts, and I like their version, but this original one is so much better and captures the emotion better, particularly having both male and female singing."
,B0011W8V20,1,1,5,"Great job on a standard that many call the wedding song. The usual and expected quality from Selah, well done."
,B0011W8V20,1,1,5,this is a second purchase of Selahs music and I really like her. I have had this a couple of weeks now.
,B0011W8V20,1,1,5,"I am not sure why Amazon insists that I review every purchase, but I do love this song. It is an emotional song that resonates with my husband and I and was played at our wedding."
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,"I purchased and rated it because it is a great song, I highly recommend it to those who like Country."
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,OK
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,Great song.
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,GREAT SONG FOR THE WEDDING
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it...
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,sounds great
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,Awesome love song.
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,"I had never heard this before until my boyfriend played it for me; he said it was exactly how he felt. Needless to say, i bawled, he smiled and hugged me. How does Tim McGraw do it? His smooth vocals, emotion-filled ballads evoke a sense of what love is all about.  A favorite of mine-- don't bother watching the you tube video--just imagine your sweetheart sayin these things to you...or better yet, look across the desk at them as they sing with TM and mean every word with adoration in their eyes.  (I am one lucky lady!)"
,B0011W3ZW6,1,1,5,You know all you guys are so sweet when you write songs and put women on a pedestal and rightly so but when you going to wake up?  The rappers just say I want to put it in you and they are stealing all your women. So my advice to you is while you being a nice guy with your best friend some rappers trying to get on your girls booty. So beware Tim
,B0011W5VMS,1,1,5,Every time I hear this song I boo hoo like a big baby. I will always love this song. I love Faith Hill. As a matter of fact she is one of the main reasons that I named my daughter Faith. Brings up some beautiful memories and yet painful ones from long ago.
,B0011W5VMS,1,1,5,"Very simply, I purchased it because I like the song. What other reason would there be. I like the song."
,B0011W5VMS,1,1,5,"Faith never ceases to amaze. Her husband, Tim McGraw, released this a few years ago. Now, she comes back with her own version and it absolutely annihilates the first version. A timeless voice was needed with all the new faces on the scene. Thanks to Faith, we now have that timeless voice. Incredible!"
,B0011W5VMS,1,1,5,"I heard this love song just once, and that was all it took. It absolutely makes your heart break. Faith does a great job of bringing us into her pain. I can't play it enough."
,B0011W5VMS,1,1,5,I love the convenience of downloading from Amazon MP3s. I am able to download music on both my computer and cell phone. Great Going Amazon!
,B0011W5VMS,1,1,5,"I have almost all of Faith Hill & Tim McGraw's duets, and while most of them have lyrics of undying love, this song is different.  This song tells of going your separate ways in spite of the fact that love still exists between you, and neither wants to be the first to admit it.  It's sad and very lovely & I listen to it all the time. If you're a fan of Tim & Faith's, you'll love it!"
,B0011W7H5C,1,1,4,This song has been around for a while.  I still like it.  It reminds me of the good ole days.
,B0011W7H5C,1,1,5,"Sound quality was good, nothing that shouldn't be in there, and had everything that it should. Very pleased with this download."
,B0011W7H5C,1,1,4,"I like the creativity of this song, and bought it as I enjoyed the writing.  I don't have a daughter, but he painted the picture very well.  Not a whole lot more to say, other than this is a really good country song!"
,B0011W7H5C,1,1,4,"Thank you, just adding music to my itunes collection. Rodney Atkins is funny and creatyes good tunes. Makes you think"
,B0011W7H5C,1,1,5,"Oh can I see so many Dads doing this, so many Moms also! Gotta love it,hit the nail on the head. Should be played for every first time date!"
,B0011W7H5C,1,1,5,"I love this song.
It was a great story as well as something to make you think and I even laughed."
,B0011W0CFY,1,1,5,I heard this song on The Voice.  I think it is beautiful and touching.  This is definitely a love song you will enjoy.
,B0011W0CFY,1,1,5,Tim McGraw is one of my favorite country singers and this is one of my favorite songs.  Every time I hear this song it brings back special memories of someone I once loved.
,B0011W0CFY,1,1,5,"I always enjoy the secure and easy way of ordering music from Amazon. Easy to navigate, very fast in download time."
,B0011W0CFY,1,1,5,thanks
,B0011W0CFY,1,1,4,"Nice simple, mellow recording by a country superstar!"
,B0011W0CFY,1,1,5,great music
,B0011W0CFY,1,1,5,That is one of my favorite songs by Tim McGraw. I will enjoy it forever. Such a sweet meaning to the song.
,B0011W0CFY,1,1,5,This is a beautiful song and can't say enough as to how much i Love it and enjoy listening to it. I would recommend it for sure!
,B0011WDZGW,1,1,5,I have never been one for religious singing groups untile I discovered this one.  The album is wonderful.
,B0011WDZGW,1,1,5,Great Song!
,B0011WDZGW,1,1,5,The voices of Selah are so beautiful and uplifting. This is one of my favorite songs by this group so far.
,B0011WDZGW,1,1,5,So inspirational.  We sing it in choir.
,B0011W7E78,1,1,5,good
,B0011W7E78,1,1,5,Great sound
,B0011W7E78,1,1,5,"Her voice is amazing and this whole album is amazing. Some of her other albums are great, but IMO, none compare to this one!"
,B0011W7E78,1,1,5,"Hits a note for many of us, male and female, young and old, who've stuck around past the expiration date of a relationship."
,B0011W1TZ6,1,1,5,I totally love this amazing song. The price was great and worth it.  I highly recommend everyone buy this song!
,B0011W1TZ6,1,1,5,"My favorite of the Judds releases, I was glad to be able to get it without having to buy and entire album."
,B0011W1TZ6,1,1,5,Great song!
,B0011W1TZ6,1,1,5,"This recording by The Judds of Love Can Build A Bridge has wonderful sound to it and The Judds sang it from their hearts, their voices sing with such passion!

For me personally, this is a very special song that has so much truth to it. I downloaded the words to this song from AZLyrics.com before I purchased this song from Amazon and so glad that I had all of the lyrics. Then my volunteer group went to a Senior Center and sang this song to the participants. And since there are so many kinds of love and because love is so important, this song says it all::

The song speaks of whispering love yet so loudly so that every heart will understand that love and only love joins man. And it goes on to say when we stand together, it is our finest hour--we can do anything we set our minds to do because it is love that gives us power.

This song is so inspiring to me and gives me hope and joy when I listen to it. And it keeps me so reminded that love is really all that matters at the end of the day.

Highly recommend this song!"
,B0011W1TZ6,1,1,5,I love this song for weddings
,B0011W1TZ6,1,1,5,I recently saw Wy at a casino and was reminded of all these great songs.  I'm so happy to have this in my MP3 collection.
,B0011W1TZ6,1,1,5,"The Judds are a great Mom and Daughter Duo, I think there songs are amazing, and would buy more again."
,B0011W7DEM,1,1,5,"this is kindof my theme song right now.
I spent 20 years loving my wife but not showing her.
I would do anything to see her smile but she never new it."
,B0011W7DEM,1,1,4,This is a good song and he does it very well. I like a lot of Country. This is among my favorites.
,B0011W7DEM,1,1,5,I don't think I could ever get sick of this McGraw song. A story of what it's like to love someone who doesn't love you back. We've all been there.
,B0011WA98Y,1,1,5,"The word, music and emotion in Wynonna's voice push me over the edge every time.  This is a beautiful song."
,B0011WA98Y,1,1,4,Very nicely done.
,B0011WA98Y,1,1,5,SATISFIED
,B0011WA98Y,1,1,5,to watch her sing this song with so much emotion was just awesome. a lot of  her songs can relate to your personal life. what a beautiful person she is.
,B0011WA98Y,1,1,5,"I Can Only Imagine by Wynonna Judd's
No one sings it as good as the original artist that made the song famous!"
,B0011WA98Y,1,1,5,"I love this song I can only Imagine. I also love Wynonna.
So put this combination together and I just had to have it.
I wasn't disappointed. Never heard a song by Wynonna I didn't
like... This I love..."
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,Great song to reflect on meeting believing loved ones again some day. Matthew West has a terrific signature sound and is certainly one of the premier Christian music artists of our day.
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,Very good sound quality
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,Wonderful song
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,A very touching faith based song sung as if singing to someone who had passed away.
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,"Great song. I downloaded it to play at my Grandma's funeral, and it fit so well. Also helped me in my grief to remember the positive."
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,"I love, ABSOLUTELY LOVE, Matthew West.  This isn't my very favorite of his, but it's good.  We played it at my husband's funeral and it was very fitting.  ""Save a place for me (in heaven of course).  I'll be there soon.""  Very appropriate.  All Matthew West's songs bring glory and honor to God.  You cannot go wrong if you want some good CONTEMPORARY Christian music.  I absolutely do not like all that old southern gospel sound."
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,awesome
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,I love this soulful song.  Reminds me of where we are headed as followers of Christ Jesus!
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,I love this song...i think of my brother when i hear it...hope he's saving a place for me
,B0011XDO4O,1,1,5,My sweet little boy is saving a place for his Nana.
,B0011XUHGM,1,1,4,We remember this song from the Ice Age movies years ago.  We heard it recently and finally remembered to buy the MP3...
,B0011XUHGM,1,1,5,This is one good song it has this trible sound that makes you want to grove.  Plus I t toke me a bit to find a good version and this one is it.
,B0011Y04GO,1,1,5,it took me forever to find this song after i kept hearing it on the radio and always missed them calling out the title and artist
,B0011Y04GO,1,1,5,I heard this song first on a local station and was hooked. This has awesome bass sounds and vibrant vocals making a great combination. just a sample will compel you to purchase. Enjoy!
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,I love Christian music and this is some of my favorite.  It truly makes my day more enjoyable.  I would recommend it.
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,I totally love this amazing song. The price was great and worth it.  I highly recommend everyone buy this song!
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,I downloaded this for my wife and she loves it. I had not heard it before but after listening to the lyrics I really like it. Try it.
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,cool
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,4,Love the lyrics and the beat.....find myself humming it

,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,good Godly song
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,Love the song.
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,"This is an awesome song with an awesome message!!! We need more music like this in the world, it would make it a much better place to live in!!!"
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,Great tune...builds me up spiritually everytime I hear it. Highly recommend it for you spiritual libray...it will bless you and remind you who you really are.
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,I have been a Christian for 8 years and thought his words were worth listening to again and again to keep in mind how important my current choices are concerning my Christian walk. Every choice means something. And surrendering to Christ or to my self is a battle that rages all day long. This song is helpful in that struggle.
,B0011XFEDI,1,1,5,"I heard this on Pandora on my contemporary Christian station.  This song sounds a bit like Casting Crowns, which is why it showed up on my Pandora station.  The music and the words are both great - good message and good tune.  I have played it at church for the music after the service ends."
,B0011Y8IU8,1,1,5,"From what I gather about Jeanne Robertson, she doesn't consider herself a ""stand-up comic"" so much as ""public speaker,"" but make no mistake about it - she is as funny as anyone in the business.  She comes from a little corner of North Carolina, and if Mayberry actually existed, you wouldn't have difficulty imagining that her home must be just up the road a spell from Andy and Barney.

I recently had my first exposure to the Sirius radio network, and tracks from this ""Flat-Out Funny"" recording were prominently rotated between Bill Cosby and Jeff Foxworthy.  It is no faint praise to say that Jeanne Robertson is as funny as any of them.

Her stories are full of wry and hilarious insights into the human condition, and it appears that any obstacle in her life simply becomes ""new material"".  This also seems to mean that anyone in her life is ""fair game"" for inclusion in her routines.  We hear many details about her husband, Jerry ""Leftbrain"", including his hesitation to accompany her on a near-disastrous eight-day rafting trip through the grand canyon, which included recreational opportunities such as hanging precariously from the side of a cliff, using AARP-vintage hands that at home would have difficulty opening a jar in the kitchen.

This recording is an absolute obvious choice for that person or family or group who wants to hear ""flat-out funny"" comedy that is suitable for all ears, but the truth is that she is also as funny as the comedians who use the full spectrum of language.

Flat-Out recommended."
,B0011Y8IU8,1,1,4,This is a very funny and clean comedy album. I would let my kids list to this particular album. A recommended album
,B0011XDO6C,1,1,5,"Awesome awesome AWESOME song! We downloaded this for a family photo DVD we are making, and it is a highlight!"
,B0011XCZ1M,1,1,5,great

,B0011XCZ1M,1,1,4,Love Classical music
,B0011XCZ1M,-1,1,5,Ty
,B0011XCZ1M,1,1,5,"Very nice classical piece of music to be enjoyed here,excellent for some nice dinner with wine background mood music."
,B0011XCZ1M,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

,B0011Y4KQE,1,1,5,"If you've never heard Jeanne Robertson, you must try something of hers soon!  Her comedy is clean and hilarious!  She is going to appear live at a venue near me in 2013, so I am looking forward to getting tickets to the event.  That's how much I love her style and her sense of humor.  If you are a Southerner, you should be ashamed if you've never heard of Jeanne Robertson.  She is the epitome of a True Southern lady and her stories will be something you should relate to easily.  I think I have everything she has ever recorded and have never been disappointed.  I recommend you buy at least one track if not an entire ""show"" and hear about her and Left Brain's lives.  You won't regret it!"
,B0011Y4KQE,1,1,5,"Jeanne Robertson is funny.  Real funny.  I dare you to listen to this recording for a minute and not laugh.  I DARE you.  Go ahead... we can wait.

We don't laugh often enough, do we?  We don't take the time, as Jeanne has done, to actually NOTICE the things that are funny in the world.  Like the absolute greatest masters of the comedic form, Mrs. Robertson doesn't ""make up stuff"" or ""tell jokes"".  She simply lets us take a glimpse at the world at she sees it.  She holds a mirror up to life and finds hilarious that which is looking back.

She has several funny, FUNNY recordings which you can get as audio or DVD recordings, but ""Southern Style"" is easily in her top 2 or 3 and includes perhaps her most famous story of all: ""Left Brain's Grocery List"" could stand toe to toe with Bill Cosby's ""Noah"" or Richard Pryor's ""Mudbone"" or Andy Griffith's ""What it was, was Football"".

Mrs. Robertson's husband is named Jerry, but she calls him ""Left Brain"" and if you don't understand that, as she says, you may be one too...  Jeanne has been drafted into making several of her famous 7-up pound cakes, and needs to dispatch Jerry to the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients.  You'll just have to hear the results, but as the tears roll down your cheeks with laughter the part of your soul that recognizes the truthfulness of things will know there is a little Left Brain in most of us.

Thank Heaven for BOTH of the Robertsons and for Jeanne's gift for sharing her magnificently cultivated sense of humor.

A final word: perhaps most miraculously of all, Mrs. Robertson makes you laugh and laugh and laugh with nary an off-color word.  Not just fun for the whole family - this is FUNNY for the whole family!"
,B0011Y4KQE,1,1,5,"I have lived all around the US, both growing up as a military dependant and then with my husband when he was in the military for 20 years.  Now we're living, for the first time, in the True South.  In Tennessee.

Sometimes I forget just how important a sense of humour is in order to make it from day to day.  But Ms Jeanne's stories are a wonderful reminder.  Sometimes you just have to laugh.

When you first hear some of Ms Jeanne's stories you can't believe people are really like that in real life.  But now that we're here in Tennessee, I can honestly say they are exactly like that.

So do yourself a favor and experience some of the best story telling there is around.  Try Southern Style by Ms. Jeanne.

By the way, here in the south, everyone is referred to by their first name with the respectful Ms or Mr in front."

AZ, perhaps, one of the most underrated lyricists to grace hip hop, returns back to the scene by dropping his new album entitled, A.W.O.L., on his new independent Quiet Money Records label.  AZ is probably best known for his now legendary guest appearance on Life's a Bitch from Nas's classic Illmatic album.  AZ has always released quality material, but he was never been able to really blow up in the music scene.  Was it industry politics?  Bad timing?  Whatever the case is, AZ has never allowed for his lack of notoriety to effect his ability in creating quality music.

With A.W.O.L., rather than following the watered-down movement that's plagued rap for the last few years, AZ stays consistent and refuses to change up his formula.  He still has that smooth flawless delivery that's been blessing listeners since the early to mid 90's.  He's still that wise street poet who somehow is able to construct verses in a nearly flawless manner.  Plus, to further compliment the lyrics, the production on this album is top notch including beats by DJ Premier, Buckwild, and others...  The only weak spot on this album may be Envious featuring Bounty Killer, but that's only due to a clash of styles.

Top tracks include:  The Come Up, Never Change, Still Alive, City Of Gods, and Magic Hour.

Guest appearances include Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Half-A-Mill (recently deceased), Begetz, Bounty Killer, and CL Smooth..."
,B0011YBRFQ,1,-1,3,"I am a bit disappointed by AZ's A.W.O.L. This album lacks of consistance. I love ""Do Or Die"", which in my humble opinion is a masterpiece (just like Nas' ""Illmatic""), but A.W.O.L. seems like a mixtape with major lack of coherence.

There are standout tracks, such as ""Never Change"", ""Can't Stop"", ""City Of Gods"", ""The Come Up"" and the Bonustrack #2 ""Magic Hour"", but the rest of the album just seems to be randomly and unkindly put together.

AZ is one of the best MCs in the business (no doubt), but he needs to come up with a neatly organized album. I am thinking about DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Buckwild to produce it with guest appearances by Nas, CL Smooth, Common and Cormega.

None the less, pick up this CD to support AZ. He is one of the last True rappers in the business! Check out AZ's Greatest Hits CD ""Decade 94-04"", which is hard to find in the US. This album rocks!"
,B0011YBRFQ,1,1,5,"Definately a classic; mellow tracks with some futuristic beats,  lyrics consistent with his style, much more hardcore on some tracks than in previous CD's, for your listening pleasure. This is one for your collection. I don't usually do a track rating but will in the future, especially for my favorite artist.

Bonus material was good as well.  As you can see I am really feelin this, particularly because it is underground in content meaning that the material is fresh and unpredictable but still have it's roots in the rap culture.  It is more Rap than hiphop which for ole headz is on point and for the new headz who can appreciate depth, quality and rich lyrical content."
,B0011YBRFQ,1,1,4,"AZ, one of the realest and one of the best ever behind the mic, is back after slightly over 3 years since his last LP to bring you the appropriately titled ""A.W.O.L."" - his 5th solo release (not counting his ""S.O.S.A."" EP that was shelved in 2000 and his ""Final Call"" album that was supposed to come out in June 2004 but kept getting pushed back & bootlegged and eventually was shelved as well). How it rates to his other albums, probably right in the middle, not his worst (which I'd still say is a strong 4 star album) and not the best.  Packed with 15 songs (track 13 is 3 songs off his ""Final Call"" album), it has 1 classic, 9 songs are good and the other 5 are ok. Guests rap on 3 songs and do hook on 2 others so you get enough of AZ to satisfy your thirst after a long AZ drought. Production is only about average (other then on a few tracks) which brings the album down a little (it's never his lyrics or flow which are both top notch and A game). Heatmakerz, and Baby Paul each do 2 songs, Disco D, Emile, Frado, Vinny Idol, Fizzy Womack of M.O.P., DJ Absolut, Tone Mason, J Hen, DJ Premier, MoSS, and Buckwild all do 1 song. A great album to have for his fans and fans of True hip-hop.

Anthony Cruz --- Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY -- b. around 1972"
,B0011YBRFQ,1,1,4,"AZ (Anthony Cruz) continues to deliver the heat with his latest album ""A.W.O.L."" (2005). The first real standout for me is ""Never Change"" a cut where AZ reflects about a friend who died, delivering some memorable lyrics and a premium chorus. Wu-Tang's Raekwon and Ghostface then drop in for a solid collaboration repping their city ""New York"". Backed by a crazy beat, AZ rhymes with hunger on ""Still Alive"". My current favorite is ""City Of Gods"", AZ shines rhyming well and laces this one with another impressive chorus. One of the things I have always liked about AZ is he remains genuine. Half-A-Mil was murdered a few years ago, AZ brings him back for the sad and heartfelt ""Street Life"" feat. Begetz. AZ then tells a short ""Bedtime Story"" remembering past years. It's nice to see AZ getting the production he deserves, Premo hooked AZ up for ""The Come Up"" and AZ shines again. Not a Bounty Killer fan, so not feeling ""Envious"", while the title track is solid. The bonus material is decent, good to that CL Smooth is still around feeling ""Magic Hour"". I recently heard another new excellent AZ track called ""Game of Life"", wish that one had been included on this release. For years people have slept on AZ's music, I don't know if that will continue, I do highly recommend checking out ""A.W.O.L.""."
,B0011YBRFQ,1,1,5,I can go on and review each song/track...  But damn- this Cd is hot!  AZ shines on all tracks.  production is on point.  Nuff said.
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,4,"For those of you who are familiar with the music of The Bangles, they have been called the female equivalent of the Beatles.  Their bright, sweet choral harmonies are enough to capture any listener's attention.  This was one of the bands that I had grown up with alongside Madonna, The Go Go's, and other 80's artists.  After three albums of mega smash after smash, they unfortunately imploded and took a 13 year absence.  Susanna Hoffs would create 2 solo albums, and Vicki/Debbi Peterson would create their own records under the pseudonym Continental Drifters.

So once they reunited in 2003 and released this then-new LP, it was as if The Bangles had never left.  Although their voices sounded a bit older, so has their sound matured.  This CD starts off with a fiery one-two punch of the title track sung by Susanna.  Other songs would be very energetic as well -- Debbi's ""Stealing Rosemary"", Vicki's ""Mixed Messages"", and Michael Steele's 2 very important songs (and my personal favorites as well):  ""Nickel Romeo"" and ""Between The Two"".  Check out the lyric ""a Cheshire Cat in yellow Beatle boots...""  Hint hint, anyone??

The only 2 songs I did not like were Susanna's ""I Will Take Care Of You"" and Debbi's ""Lost At Sea.""  But that is only from my personal taste and bears absolutely NO reflection on the band itself!  I was very saddened/disheartened when Michael Steele eventually left The Bangles permanently, before this decade even started.  So, in other words, you won't hear any of her tracks on the band's 2011 LP, ""Sweetheart Of The Sun.""  I am somehow okay with that, because in all fairness, each one of the four female members DO have a very unique, distinctive voice and incredible instrumental talent that attracted droves of fans in the first place.

Other than Susanna's recent 2012 solo release, ""Someday"", I'm still betting that The Bangles have some more songs left in them for the rest of this decade to follow!!  :)"
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,4,"The CD is full of ""nice"" Bangles songs - no home runs or commercial hits, but no duds.  The Bangles show a greater sophistication in composition than prior efforts in this disc.  ""Nickle Romeo"" is a high point for me, with minor keys and harmonies this is clearly one of Michael Steeles' best songs ever!
The title cut is catchy with rather bizarre lyrics, and the whole disc earns a solid ""B"".  As the foursome dissolved after this, it's the last music made by the band as a whole, and should be in every Bangles fan's collection.

The DVD is another story, being so short and disjointed it's hard to not ask ""Why did they bother?"""
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Of all the bands that I have grown up with since I was a child, The Bangles is one of the few that has stayed with me into my adult years. I recently have bought a ticket for their upcoming fall tour so in preparation I picked up a copy of the band's last studio album (when Michael Steele was still in the band) Doll Revolution (the band's first album since Everything). I used to have the cd years ago but had to sell it for some much needed cash. I am so glad I bought it again. I almost forgot how much I loved the album. I definitely can hear the maturity in the band's songwriting. Like in the '80s, the women all harmonize perfectly together as well as take turns singing lead. I enjoyed all the songs. The bonus dvd is a nice treat for fans of the band. Overall I felt like I got my money's worth. I am so looking forward to seeing the band later this fall."
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,4,"Doll Revolution is 59 minutes and 29 seconds and was released on September 9, 2003. Doll Revolution reached #23 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Charts and of the fifteen songs on it, only one of the songs charted. The group seems to be unfocused on this album. It seems that they just decided to put fifteen songs on the CD and see what the results were. Even their first album, All Over the Place, seems better then this one. Doll Revolution gets a B- from me.

,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,4,"""Tear Off Your Own Head (Doll Revolution)"" written by the famous songwriter Declan MacManus and featuring the unmistakable vocals of Ms. Susanna Hoffs, starts off this CD like a crack of thunder. It's a full-frontal attitude piece, reminiscent in spirit of the earlier ""Hero Takes A Fall."" The thing that set The Bangles apart from other ""girl groups"" from the beginning was the attitude...that sideways look from Susanna in the ""Walk Like An Egyptian"" video, for starters. I have a bias when it comes to this band. I'll support anything they choose to release, and in this situation, that support reaped an ample reward."
,B0011XW5WQ,-1,-1,3,"I quote the first line from ""Between the Two"", the fourteenth track off the Bangles' latest album Doll Revolution, because I'm wondering if this is going to be their last album. It's been 15 years since they recorded an album together, and when I looked at the liner notes -- actually, there really aren't any, which makes you wonder if they just rushed into the studio to put this album out. Also, this album is on Koch Records, and Koch seems to be the place where everyone eventually ends up -- well, either there or TVT.
All the other three-star reviews for this album are pretty accurate, and each person seems to have a different opinion of which song(s) stands out. To me, the best song on here is the song they have out now, ""Something That You Said"" (its video also appears on the bonus DVD). And ""Mixed Messages"" is pretty catchy despite the lyrical shortcomings. But the rest of the songs aren't that great.
A lot of these songs really could have been written better. At times the lyrics go from lazy (""Ride the Ride"", ""Ask Me No Questions"") to crazy (Elvis Costello's ""Tear Off Your Own Head""). ""Grateful"" is tolerable, but it's the kind of song you'd expect to hear from them when they were still in their teens, not in their forties. And sorry, but the ballad ""I Will Take Care of You"" sounds like a watered-down version of ""Eternal Flame"".
People say a lot of the songs on here sound better live than they do on the album, and if that's the case, then you should just see them in concert. Or else if you're still feeling nostalgic about the Bangles, then just pull out their `80s albums or their Greatest Hits package. The ladies can still play and sing, but I wouldn't really call Doll Revolution a revolutionary album.
Anthony Rupert"
,B0011XW5WQ,-1,-1,3,instead seems uninspired in parts. if these ladies had kept it together instead of doing this whole thing this band would have been amazing. Too bad people have personalities and stuff that interfere with what's important.
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Al Stewart (had a big radio hit with the song Year of the Cat) said recently that he still has a great fondness for ""jangle-y bands"" -- guitar-based good time pop music that rocks, but not too hard.  What the Bangles have produced on Doll Revolution is a classic of the jangle-y genre.
When a band takes a break of over a decade and then re-forms for a new project, there is always justifiable worry that the old magic can't be captured again. The Bangles proved an exception to the rule by producing the strongest work of their career on this long-awaited new album. Granted, not every tune on Doll Revolution is a solid gold gem, but there are at least ten well-turned songs on this record, which is about the most anyone can reasonably ask.
If you liked the old Bangles, there is no reason you shouldn't be happy with the new Bangles. They can still rock, and sing beautifully produced and sincere love songs. If anything, their harmonies are sweeter and more perfect than ever. The recording does not have state-of-the-art clarity, which is a bit of a disappointment, but the fidelity is at least equivalent to their previous records from the eighties.
There is one sour note, not in the music, but in the fact that if you want the lyrics, you won't get them in the booklet. They are found only on the limited edition DVD version -- on the DVD. So you are supposed to run to your DVD player every time you want to check out the song lyrics? Not cool.
The Bangles have shown that you *can* go home again. They recorded this album on their own terms, took their time, and carefully crafted something they could be proud of. And they should be proud. This is good stuff. It isn't revolutionary, despite the title. They sing of love, loss, confusion, frustration, and loneliness. They make it rhyme, and they make us tap our feet and smile. I can't ask for more than that."
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"I have long thought of the Bangles as a second tier band, sort of the ugly stepsisters to the more enjoyable GoGo's, and nowhere near in the same league as the Cinderella of all groups, Fanny (still the premiere all-female band). I've always liked the group, I just wasn't moved by them. Too much of the time they seemed like four individuals fighting for the solo spotlight, versus a tight, together unit. Well, all that has changed with DOLL REVOLUTION, the new release from 2003's Most Improved act. Tight, cohesive and intelligent, this is a group to be reckoned with. This is clear right from the start; the disc opens with a blistering cover of Elvis Costello's ""Tear Off Your Own Head."" Susanna Hoff's opening ""HEY!"" only hints at things to come in the rest of the song...hand claps, a pounding rhythm section, tinkling piano and soaring vocals coalesce, resulting in one of the Bangles' best, hardest rocking songs to date. ""Stealing Rosemary"" has a rockin', neo-folk vibe to it, while ""Something That You Said"" has a delicate (yet fresh) techno groove behind it's hushed vocals and tender lyrics. This touching song of True love (""Showing you every weakness and feeling strong for it/I used to run from real love now I long for it/Now I know what I've been missing/Since I've been listening"") features an assured lead vocal from Hoffs, probably her best to date. The same could be said about Debbi Peterson and her aching take on ""Ask Me No Questions."" Gorgeous harmonies round out this beauty. ""The Rain Song"" has to be one of my favorite tracks. A mid-tempo rocker, it sports a gutsy lead vocal from guitarist Vicki Peterson and smart lyrics (""I don't think about us much anymore/Frankly the topic has become a bore"" and ""I don't think about us when I'm sleeping/It doesn't even cross my dreamlike mind/And I don't think I see your face through the curtains/Hell, I don't even miss you half the time""). This is an AC hit waiting to happen! Bassist Michael Steele steps into the spotlight and shines on her groovy ""Nickel Romeo."" This cut is a great example of how much the group has grown into a more unified musical unit. ""Ride The Ride"" is a rollicking group effort, while ""I Will Take Care Of You"" is another gentle Hoffs number. ""Here Right Now"" is a real gem that slowly grew on me. Drummer Debbi Peterson was always kind of ""the kid sister who has to be in the band"" to me, sort of a female Ringo, but she has SO come into her own on DOLL REVOLUTION, both as a vocalist and lyricist (""In and outta town/Time for you to settle down/Stand back, take a look around you/You're runnin' from the pressures of the restless world/Hush for a moment, baby just be still""). Captivating....simply captivating! From here we segue into another favorite, Vicki Peterson's hauntingly dark ""Single By Choice."" With it's opening chorus (""Single by choice/Never married, never ever divorced/Listen to the solitary voice/Tell you I'm single by choice""), one might think there's a bitterness to the song, but nothing could be farther from the truth...as you get deeper into the track, you see there's an intelligence and life-experience to it that's missing from much of today's music (""I know what you're thinkin'/She can't be complete/Til the right kind of man/Comes sweep her off her feet/Well I've been there before/Times four, times five/With the right kind of man/Barely made it out alive""). Brava, Ms. Peterson (kind of ironic, though, that Vicki just got engaged)! ""Lost At Sea"" is another winner from Peterson's baby sister...Debbi once again shines on this heartfelt ballad that builds and soars, with spot-on lyrics that everyone can identify with (""Can we try to salvage what we can/From the weight of water and sand/Lift us up again"", ""Well,you walk/Never ever looking back/One defends and one attacks/There's a thousand reasons to begin again""). ""Song For A Good Son"" is a great story-song from Steele. Intense and propulsive, the lyrics are stunningly visual - sort of a mini movie! - and Michael delivers them with conviction and in a strong, authoritative vocal. ""Mixed Messages"" and ""Between The Two"" are probably my two least favorite tracks on DOLL REVOLUTION, not because they're bad, just because everything else is so strong. ""Mixed Messages"" has a nice enough 60's feel to it, while ""Between The Two"" has a soaring (albeit slightly forced) intensity. The disc closes with the gorgeous ""Grateful."" Be it an ode to her children or a musical thank-you to her fellow band members for a successful second chance together, the song is delivered from Hoffs' heart and gut. Floating out of your speakers, it makes you thankful for unexpected opportunities and small surprises. Much the same could be said about DOLL REVOLUTION!"
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"I was so thrilled when their reunion album finally happened.  I did not, however, expect it to exceed classics such as All Over The Place and Different Light, and it doesn't, but the songs are as fresh as if hearing them for the first time ever.  After fifteen years... Wow!  Getting this prevented me from tearing off my own head, to paraphrase the leading song. Key=[lead vocalist]
After the phrase, ""One must tear off one's own head,"" comes a quick burst of snarling punkish guitar and Susanna's familiar sugary voice.  I haven't heard the original Elvis Costello version, but they really jam on ""Tear Off Your Own Head (Doll Revolution)""  This opening number makes this yet another classic in the Bangles pantheon of hits.
""Stealing Rosemary"" is a simple song of a woman doing the title action for her man.  What, without parsley, sage, and thyme?  Kidding.  [Debbi]
""Something That You Said"" is another classic, with the solid Beatles/Byrds influence heard with the guitar and the harmony vocals.  The drum machine in the background paints a modern addition.  And Susanna's voice never sounded so good!
""Ask Me No Questions"" has rhythmic overtones of the Beatles ""Rain"" without the feedback guitar.  The main chorus goes ""Oh, I'm in love with you/But I turn away when you look in my eyes/Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies."" [Debbi]
""Rain Song"" sung by Vicki is an upbeat guitar-oriented number where when it rains, she remembers her ex.  And there's a bitter taste with this line:  ""I'm doing fine as long as you stay locked up/Inside a cloud of grey""  Whoa! [Vicki]
That's quite a fancy dresser in ""Nickel Romeo"", someone who's described as ""a Cheshire cat in yellow Beatle boots"".  ""Strange desperation-you gotta cop that fix/Making every little girl is keeping you alive.""  That bad, huh?  [Michael]
""Ride The Ride"" has a similar beat but less ferocious than ""Doll Revolution"".  With signature guitar hooks, call it a close cousin to ""In Your Room"" [all]
Just what I needed, another tender ballad to melt my heart, and my favourite song here.  ""I Will Take Care Of You"" is an affirmative song of support from a loved one who will stand tall alongside through times of fear and sadness:  ""Smile, if you can now/Smile through your tears/Here where your fears are known/
Know you're safe at home.""  Magic! [Susanna, of course!]
Guitar and soundwise, the upbeat ""Here Right Now"" sounds like Green-era R.E.M. and calls for one to slow down.  ""Stand back and take a look around you/Running from the pressures of a restless world/Hush for a moment, baby, just be still/Here now./Spend a minute next to me.""  Amen to that!
The woman in bittersweet ""Single By Choice"" is affirmative of the title, adding ""Never marry, never ever divorce/Listen to the solitary voice.""  Even though she gives bad experiences she had, sad, isn't it? [Vicki]
""Lost At Sea"" details a couple who's lost so far in arguments that it's as if they are lost at sea.  The solution:  ""Take my hand, come to me/Save a life, rescue you, rescue me.""  Another Byrdsy song replete with harmonies. [Vicki]
""Song For A Good Son"" details a woman explaining to her son why she seems emotionally cold.  She is scarred by the loss of her mother, taken by the ocean current.  There are suicidal overtones:  ""Waterside so deep and wide/If I follow, maybe I will find her."" [Michael]
""Grateful"" is a lullaby to one's young son, enhanced by chorus harmonies of ""All we are and all we need is"" while Susanna's whispery sweet voice does lead.
The bonus DVD contains ""A Day In The Life Of The Bangles"" mini-documentary, which basically explains how they felt about getting back together, story behind ""TOYOH"", and their amazement at the large fan base they had, the ""Something That You Said"" video, audio and lyrics pages.
All the familiar elements are there, Susanna's sweet voice, the tight harmonies, the 60's rock influenced sound, the brand of garage pop/rock hybrid.  It's as if they never broke up.  A warm welcome back!"
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from Everything (though this is by no means All Over The Place, Volume 2).
I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's ""Nickel Romeo,"" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susanna sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (""Something That You Said"", ""I Will Take Care of You"", ""Grateful""). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on ""Ask Me No Questions"" and ""Here Right Now,"" and Vicki sounds great on ""Single by Choice,"" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's ""I Am A Rock."" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on ""Mixed Messages""? As for ""The Rain Song,"" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!
The ensemble vocals on ""Ride the Ride"" and ""Stealing Rosemary"" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.
My only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened Doll Revolution by dropping ""Lost at Sea,"" ""Song for a Good Son,"" and ""Between the Two.""
I understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to Doll Revolution. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?"
,B0011XW5WQ,-1,-1,2,when the Bangles first came out in the 80's that had a cool vibe about them.they were if you will a Poor Maid's version of the Go-Go Girls.and over time they never quite shook that tag.the Bangles never wrote songs that took off was the big knock against them then&still.some of the Instrumentation is alright in spots but Vocally not much has changed.
,B0011XW5WQ,-1,-1,3,"I think it's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd.  Their last full one was 1989's 'Everything'.  In my opinion it is hard for them to ever top their debut album (not their EP).  You had to figure U.S. record companies must have had similar thoughts since this disk has been released everywhere else since early 2003.
They still have decent songwriting abilities and continue to have great blended harmonies (""Stealing Rosemary"").  Both of these things are their saving grace.
Each member has one very good song. Debbie Peterson has ""Here Right Now"", which should have been the initial single. Susanna Hoffs has ""Something That You Said"", which is the first single and would have been a great follow-up single selection. Vicki Peterson has ""Single By Choice"" and Michael Steele has ""Between the Two"".  There are others that are certainly ok, just nothing outstanding.  Even ""Ride the Ride"" isn't as good as the version I downloaded off the internet (oops) almost 2 years ago.
Overall, Debbie Peterson and Michael Steele are the most consistent on this disk.  Steele has always been under-utilized as a lead vocalist and songwriter. Nothing changes here.  I'm really liking her  ""Song For a Good Son"".  She's at least got the most original material of the four - and always has. I always liked Vicki Peterson's stuff, but it's all just very bland on this disk (""Ask Me No Questions"").  Susanna Hoffs is astonishingly the weakest during this set (except for the aforementioned 'Something That You Said"").  ""I Will Take Care of You"" is just downright lame.
In my opinion, the album closer, 'Grateful', is possibly the worst song the Bangles have ever done.  The chorus is one step away from a bad children's chorale.  And they did nothing special to cover the Elvis Costello title tune.
Supposedly they are working towards a new release, since this has really been completed for a year.  Let's hope they get it together and deliver a stellar disk."
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from _Everything_ (though this is by no means _All Over The Place_, Volume 2).
I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's ""Nickel Romeo,"" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susannah sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (""Something That You Said"", ""I Will Take Care of You"", ""Grateful""). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days--for example, the two bonus tracks on this album, both sides of the Bangles' first single. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on ""Ask Me No Questions"" and ""Here Right Now,"" and Vicki sounds great on ""Single by Choice,"" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's ""I Am A Rock."" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on ""Mixed Messages""? As for ""The Rain Song,"" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!
The ensemble vocals on ""Ride the Ride"" and ""Stealing Rosemary"" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.
My only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened 'Doll Revolution' by dropping ""Lost at Sea,"" ""Song for a Good Son,"" and ""Between the Two.""
I understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to 'Doll Revolution'. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?"
,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,4,"Whoever thinks COMEBACK CDs are never any good should give this one a listen ! THE BANGLES surprise ! They sound fresh and even evoke the same musical spirit as they did during their 80s glory days ! Their vocals are filled with melodic power as the musical arrangements are contemporary and very radio friendly.
This CD will delight any True BANGLE fan and may convert some new members of the current generation to walk like an egyptian !"

,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Being a massive fan of The Bangles' music since the early '80s, ""Doll Revolution"" was a long time coming for me, especially after the ""Behind the Music"" episode on them. I have been waiting for this cd for two years, let alone the past decade for new music from them in general. Now that I have the cd in my hands, it was so well worth the money and wait for the cd to arrive in my mailbox. ""Doll Revolution"" did not fail to disappoint me. There really isn't an artist or band that harmonizes as well as The Bangles do. ""Doll Revolution"" is a great reminder how well Susanna, Vicky, Debbi, and Michael's vocals sounds together. ""Mixed Messages"" is a great example the band's abilities to harmonize. On the VH1's ""Behind the Music"" episode on The Bangles, at the end the viewer was introduced to a sampling of ""Ride the Ride"" and ""Lost At Sea"" which are found on the cd, much to my delight. Overall, ""Doll Revolution"" is a mixture of ""All Over the Place"" and ""Everything"", the raw production of ""All Over the Place"" with the sweet melodies of ""Everything"". The best of both worlds if anything. Susanna, Vicky, Debbi, and Michael all sound as if the band never broke up in the late '80s. I loved every single song on the album. Not a single dud on the album. I sure hope it sees the light of day over on my side of the Atlantic. This is one cd I don't want to see swept under the rug."

,B0011Z0XSC,1,1,4,I bought this for my easy listening playlist. His voice is very soothing. I would recommend this to anyone looking to add to their easy listening playlist.
,B0011Z0XSC,1,1,5,Are you kidding me?  Michael Buble is fantastic.  So talented and extremely sexy.  Don't even have to see him to know he is as sexy looking as he is sounding.
,B0011Z0VXE,1,1,4,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B0011Z0VXE,1,1,5,Like that I can just download from amazon right to my phone. Always great quality. Lots of great songs to choose from.
,B0011Z0VXE,1,1,5,This band has a very distinctive sound; I believe the clear strong lead vocals make the music what it is.
,B0011Z0VXE,1,1,5,Great song...I first heard it when I was watching a video on Youtube.  Great message by a great group.  Would recommend this song to anyone interested in songs by Nickelback or is just looking for great music in general.
,B0011Z0VXE,1,-1,3,ok
,B0011Z0VXE,1,1,5,"great item, easy clear description, quick shipper  thanks"

,B0011Z0VXE,1,1,5,Good song
,B0011Z0XFK,1,1,5,I downloaded this to add to a bizarre collection of music for a Christmas party.  Everyone loved the different genres offered.
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,"It's been a while but I still remember just the way you taste.... Umm, do I have to explain how awesome the rest of this song is?"
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,"There is just something very profound about this song that I really relate to. I was as wild as they came back in the day. I did a lot of things (that I look back on now) and cringe when I remember,  I look back on a lot of things and bow my head in shame. I see the faces of those that have seen me at my worse. Most of them have been gracious enough to forgive me. I was never a really bad person; never truly cruel...But I sure as hell came really, REALLY close to crossing the line; The Point Of No Return. BUT, I did NOT cross that line. I DID stop...I stopped right before I turned into someone or someTHING that I would NOT have ever been able to forgive. The person that is NOW looking back at me, when I look into the mirror nowadays, is just thankful. Thankful for what I have, and WHO I have...Yup, It's Been Awhile since I was the person that was ashamed when he looked into the mirror."
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,Always a great moody song you want to sing along to all day.
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,Love it but it doesn't hold up with age. But one of the best in its genre.
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,4,Great music
,B0011Z0VXE,1,1,5,great - wish you could make your own samplers with individual songs - would be cheaper than buying individual songs  or buying an album for only one or two songs

,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,great song
,B0011Z0YQI,-1,-1,1,NOTHING LIKE iTunes reliability
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,I love this song.  It was one of my husbands favorites for it seemed to follow his life.  He passed away at 53 of pancreatic cancer after only 32 days after the diagnosis.  This song honors him.
,B0011Z0YQI,1,-1,3,It's a catchy tune but I but I never listen to it any longer...it's a song so I don't know what else I can say as far as this review goes...you either like it or you don't.
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,4,Great tune. Way deep. Mellow and soulful
,B0011Z0YQI,-1,1,5,yup ! healing
,B0011Z0XFK,1,1,5,"Great Song from a Great Band, Great beat, keeps you going.  I had this song stuck in my head for days, finally downloaded it."
,B0011Z0XFK,-1,1,5,Not sure why they want this reviewed.. It's a song. I knew what I was getting and that's what I got..  ????
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,Good band
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,Great song if you have at some point in your life had someone do something to you and then send you the words to this song. Can relate to this song like no other.
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,"I love the artist and the whole tone and mood of the song, a definite buy that will remain popular even when the song is considered to be vintage."
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,I've always loved this song since the first time I heard it on the radio.  It's worth the money to buy it.
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,The Lyrics depict so many individuals lives before and after recovery from addiction....It's EXCELLENT!!!!  More people need to understand the long road back
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,"Amazon cloud is Awesome! I bought this song and now I always have easy access to it through the cloud. I have since downloaded it to my computer, Android phone, and iPod. If I ever lose the song I can always come back to the cloud and get it again."
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,downloaded this song on my laptop and it is a very clear and good download. burnt it to a disc and I listen to it all the time.
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,"Well, sounds like a classic, one that will always stand out. It has good tempo, drum beat, instrumental subtlety,  vocals. While not a deep theme, it is one of introspection, and relation to one you are very close with. It rocks for me, great running song."
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,"Great song, great quality. I listen to this at the gym, but for cooling down. Nice way to end training and bring your mind back to a calm state after a hard work out."
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,4,I think this version is very powerful although you can't play it everywhere.  Some of Staind's songs are a little harsh for me but when they turn out ballads like this it suits me fine.
,B0011Z0YQI,-1,-1,2,"I didn't like the explicit version at all, the song didn't have the same smooth flow as the non explicit verion did, seemed kind of herky jerky to me."
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,"A long time fan of Staind, had to add this song to my collection.  It's part of the soundtrack of my life."
,B0011Z0YQI,1,1,5,Virgin :so as my first musik buying experience?amazing...well protected gentle yet force fully  pleasure able....yes i will do it again!

,B0011Z0ZP8,1,1,4,I have 2 or 3 favorites from Staind and this is one of them!  His voice is so haunting! Great!
,B0011Z0ZP8,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs good all the way around. Staind has alot of great songs but i really like Outside. Would reccomend this song for everyone.
,B0011Z0ZP8,1,1,5,I use to hear this song on the radio but never bought the cd because just liked this one song. top 5 of my favorite songs
,B0011Z0ZP8,1,1,5,"This song speaks to us in a way that allows us to come to terms with who we are in these times when relationships are changing, one is becoming awakened and one is not.

It is the realization that maybe your partner is holding you back, keeping you in pain, and it is time for you to move on.

The chord structures and heart-felt vocals arising up from the core of the lead singer's being break through the barriers of that which we do not wish to acknowledge and allow us to recognize that pain, bringing it forth and at last allowing us to step forward in our inherent integrity and move on.

You will feel empowered, you will cry, you will move to this music in a way that will forever touch you."
,B0011Z0WQU,1,1,5,Well if you are already familiar with bette milder and the song from the movie with the same name ..the rose..then you will be as happy as me with it .if you aren't familiar with the artist or her music let it be this beautiful evokable song be the one to introduce you.one of my all time favorites.
,B0011Z0WQU,1,1,5,This is so beautiful! The music I purchase from Amazon is always reasonably priced and pmazing! I will enjoy it continuously. Thanks.
,B0011Z0WQU,1,1,4,Really good song.

,B0011Z0WQU,1,1,5,Always a favorite from a favorite
,B0011Z0WQU,1,1,5,"I can't recommend this song too much! I would give it 10 stars!

I have many memories about when Bette sang this song. Still one of my favorites!"
,B0011Z0WQU,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

LYRICS:
Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed.
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger,
An endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
And you its only seed.

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance.
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
Who cannot seem to give,
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live.

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long,
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong,
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose."
,B0011Z0WQU,-1,-1,3,"Again, no one mentions that this is live..not done in a studio. I love the song....just can't stand hearing screaming in the back ground from the crowd. Disappointed as this is my 2nd purchase of the same song - hoping for just a clear copy of the original!"

,B0011Z110G,1,1,5,"Ok, I bought this song/s from Amazon in a download so I liked it, I can't say If anyone else would like it, listen to it and if you like it, download it, Amazon makes it easy to do, much easier that iTunes."

I purchased it right away and when I feel in the mood to be moved and inspired, I listen to this song.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves Bette Midler as she sings it like no one else can."

,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,"""Smoke on the Water,"" originally from the great Deep Purple album ""Machine Head,"" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat. Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record ""Machine Head"" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.

The song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood,"" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I recommend ""Machine Head,"" but the ""Best Hits"" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price. One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple."

,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,"riffs often are very important to hard rock. this one starts in a vacuum & just builds beautifully. the lead singer quavers and lends a tone of pure
passion to the song. lord is in beautiful form on keyboards."
,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,"Classic Deep Purple. Crazy song, but really engaging"
,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,Very good old rock and roll song from the 70's. It has an excellent beat and really sounds good on this download.
,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,"My understanding is that the band wrote the song while on tour, standing on their balcony watching the fire burn near a lake, hence smoke on the water. Timeless classic."
,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,This is a typical recording of the song everyone knows.  It is a nice addition to a 1960's/1970's collection.  Enjoy!
,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,This song brings back a lot of memories. I use to listen to it on my 8 track player. AAAA ++++
,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,"Smoke on the Water by deep purple as the most recoginized guitar riff in music history, this song tells the story of the band going to Frank Zappa's to record and somebody shoots a flare indoors and burns the place down. This song stands the test of
time I've heard it probably 1,000 times and everytime I hear it I turn the radio up and sing along."
,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,This item was just what I need at the time. It arrived in a timely fashion and was well packaged.
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,another good love song
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,great love song
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,good cd
,B0011Z0XOQ,-1,1,5,"Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. If the name alone isn't enough to convince you to part with your 69 cents and make the purchase or if you just aren't very familiar with the artist, it would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Soo....scroll up and click on the little triangle next to ""sample this song""."
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,always loved this song
,B0011Z1D0E,1,1,5,"I love this song, but every fan of the Doors loves this song. When I was gathering a few of my favorites, I grabbed this one, too."
,B0011Z1D0E,1,1,5,I have always liked the long version of this song with the long instrumental interlude. The long version carries me away.
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,"Pretty song; a tear jerker if there ever was one.  I was not familiar with the artist, but he's good, and the song is beautiful."
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,"Every time I hear this song, it reminds me of a Seven Days episode. I've always loved the words and the melody."
,B0011Z0YTK,1,1,5,"Amazon cloud is Awesome! I bought this song and now I always have easy access to it through the cloud. I have since downloaded it to my computer, Android phone, and iPod. If I ever lose the song I can always come back to the cloud and get it again."
,B0011Z0YTK,1,1,4,"If you like the song on the radio, then you'll like the download. I liked it but I don't listen to it any longer."
,B0011Z0YTK,1,1,5,"All their stuff is great!! Powerful vocals and masterful guitars!! These guys need to put their egos aside and play for their fans!! The fans are why they are where their at today!!! Come on guys, get along!!!"
,B0011Z1D0E,1,1,5,Call me sentimental.  I like the music during the years I was a teen better than the old man.  I can't find anyone who remembers so old memories like spring wine.
,B0011Z1D0E,-1,1,5,IN MY PLAYLIST!
,B0011Z1D0E,1,1,5,"Buying and downloading digital music from Amazon is so fast and easy. I especially like being able to buy just one song I like for $1 rather than spending $10 on an album for a lot of songs I don't care about. The Doors' song ""Light My Fire"" brings back a lot of memories. I remember lying in bed in my hootch in Southeast Asia in the late 60s listening to it on my little boom box. I really like this long version - such a great piece, and my favorite of all the Doors' music."
,B0011Z1D0E,1,1,5,Thank You
,B0011Z1D0E,1,1,5,"What more can I say about Light My Fire? It defines so much. But more importantly, it brings so many things to mind."
,B0011Z1D0E,1,1,5,LOVE this music
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,great song
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,4,Great song

,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,WOW..... SO BEAUTIFUL...I MELTED !!!
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,Love IT......
,B0011Z10WU,1,1,5,really like this one...used to play CSN constantly back in the day
,B0011Z10WU,1,1,5,"If you drove or rode in a hot rod from the late 60's-early 70's as I recall on a very long road trip...an 8 track player was the magic carpet into the soaring melodies of these smooth sounding stars . How these three artisans could be together and managing to put so much praiseworthy music for even one single is difficult for me to fathom , I know this groups history , now , which really causes me to be amazed that they could sing together at all , but I am convinced that my road trip would not have seemed too short if not for this song and this 8 track tape. As bad as those players were I am still surprised at how this song/album/group continues to astonish me with their skill . Thank You Stills & Nash for putting yourselves with Crosby again so that several more generations can appreciate what has always sounded like Southern Rock to me , but that was a trip from Texas to Alabama so I may be influenced by I-20 ."
,B0011Z10WU,1,1,5,If you love 60's music this is a must have for your collection.  CSN had a lot of great hits and this is just one of them.
,B0011Z0YTK,1,1,5,great

,B0011Z0YTK,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0011Z0YTK,1,1,4,Love this song
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,Beautiful song. I'm glad to finally have it on my playlist. For  long time I didn't know who sang it.
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,4,i love this song and growing up as a teen in the 90's i never get tired of hearing grundge music. grundge will continue to live on forever.
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,The title says it all. Just what can California do for you and to you. I don't think of myself as a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan but this song is so lyrically clever invoking great images and fitting the melody so well that I had to buy it. My version has explicit lyrics so be careful which version you let your kids buy.
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,Great song off the band's album of the same name.  The song may be about the dark side of Hollywood but features a great melody and guitar solo.
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,"Love this song by this group...became a big fan of theirs, not everything on the album is great but they have a few songs that are really awesome, this is one."
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,Had to have this to add to my Eric Clapton collection.  I have always enjoyed this song.  Great lyrics here.
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,I like Eric Clapton sings best who team up with Babyface and I know Shiela E on percussion.  It is the beautiful jazz and blues song.
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,Nice to be able to download this song.  Heard it back in the 90s.  Nice overall instrument and voice arrangements.  Clapton's voice is haunting and soulful.  Love this song.
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,4,Ohh... this is the song from the Sons of Anarchy Season 4 promo on TV. I ' RHCP!! Thank you ;)
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,"The down load was very fast and the quality is perfect!! This is one of my girlfriends favorite songs by Edwin, so this made her very happy to hear it again!!"
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,"i just wantted it , it brought back memories . i would recamend it to others and freinds , great song"
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,5,"I'll Be is Edwin McCain at his finest! This song should be on everyone's play list, whatever your favorite genre or age. Beautiful, timeless, sure to be a classic!"
,B0011Z0XOQ,1,1,4,I would highly recommend this song for anyone who is a fan of Edwin McCain or of the movie A Cinderella Story.  This is the song they play while Sam and Austin are dancing at the Halloween dance.  I was highly satisfied with my purchase.
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,This song Californication by Red Hot Chili Peppers is a catchy alternative rock song that appears to celebrate the various pop culture facets associated with California. I also enjoy how the group weaves phrases in the song that stick in a persons mind and makes one think what could the phrase mean; such as when they say first born unicorn. Im glad to say that I first heard the song Californication by Red Hot Chili Peppers during my senior year of high school (it was either from television and/or local radio).
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,Not as spicy as indicated.
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,awesome song!! would buy again
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,Been loving it since 2000
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,"Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good."
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,Great song!
,B0011Z0VPM,1,1,5,OMG  I love this song how may song can yo think of  that  can sit and rhyme and make since  giggles.
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,I'm very happy and satisfied!!
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,Good song
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,4,Sounds great!
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,It is a nice song.  The lyrics are so beautiful
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,"Eric Clapton is awesome! His music is so touching. This love song is so beautiful. ""If I could reach the stars. Bring one down for you"". I love the words and the melody. Great song."
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,Brilliant! From the best rock guitarist ever.
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,"In my own opinion this is one of Eric Clapton's BEST SONGS!!!.
I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for Rock Music from the 1970s/1980s!!!."
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,Fun drum song
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,4,good
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,Awesome band
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,Perfect... Thanks!
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,"Great song, sad lyrics"
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,I've always loved this song and just haven't gotten around to get it.  Awesome song from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,This is one of a few songs I picked up while on a memorabilia hunt.  Just can't go wrong with stuff like this. Great album. Thanks
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"Always a favorite song of mine, even with the criminal ""Frisco bay"" line, I don't recall downloading this one. How Otis had the foresight to write what became his final song and biggest hit, was divine intervention."
,B0011Z1D8Q,-1,1,5,"I love this man and his songs.  taken from us way too soon.  This is definitely one of his best.  Some music you can ""work through""  Even when it's playing you can continue to talk to a friend or check your email.  When this song plays you have got to stop and listen."
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,Always wanted this title by this artist. Thanks to Amazon I was able to download this as an individual song.
,B0011Z1DDQ,-1,1,4,I'm a lover of this type of music. I get the MP3 downloads which hasn't been the best with Amazon's Downloading device this past 4 months which is why I knocked a star off.
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,I love this gentle and beautiful song. I was lucky enough to see them at the 97 Grammys and they are just as powereful and creative in this version I highly recomend it.
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,"Do you ever have a moment when you hear an old song and it brings you right back to the first time you heard it? Well, this happened to me recently with this song. It reminded me of two things. 1. I'm getting old! and 2. The oldies are still worth playing!"
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,great been looking for this for a long time finally found it and it was a good price  will look for more
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,"This is an old song that I haven't heard in a while.  I heard it on the radio the other day and didn't have it, so I bought it.  I love it.  It is a beautiful Eric Clapton song."
,B0011Z1DDQ,1,1,5,"This is such a beautiful song.  And the collaboration between Eric Clapton and Babyface was perfect--they just complemented each other so well.  The music, the words--everything about this song is wonderful."
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,"Don't you wish everything on the radio sounded as cool as this?  This is one of the Chili Peppers' best songs.  It tells a story, paints a picture."
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,"If you love the Red Hot Chili Peppers, this song is a must have! What a great song, and a must have for your collection!"
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,"LOVED THIS SONG!!  THis is a good song, over and over, why am i writting about this?  this is dumb!"
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,"The drum beat is unique and flows well with the lyrics. Hard to say what catches your ear, but that beat and the rock and roll character of the song make it a winner."
,B0011Z0XDC,1,1,5,i like song. perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect gthte donr bbj
,B0011Z0XDC,-1,1,5,Not sure why they want this reviewed.. It's a song. I knew what I was getting and that's what I got..  ????
,B0011Z1D1S,1,1,5,"GH was listed on the album sleeve under pseudonym L Angelo Misterioso. IMO, this is Cream's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the Beatles around the same time. Clapton always worked better with strong collaborators than under the solo moniker."
,B0011Z1D1S,1,1,5,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
,B0011Z1D1S,1,1,5,"This is in stereo and it's Hi-Fi. It is far cleaner than the single version. If you love Clapton, you need this in your collection!"
,B0011Z10Y8,1,1,5,"my husband loves green day and listens to them all the time, this happened to be a song my 14 year old son wanted for his MP3 player"
,B0011Z10Y8,-1,1,4,"I repeat, it's Green Day. 'Nuff said. They are revising their raw talent into finer talent. Still hardcore. Edgy. Walks the line between alternative rock and punk. Does contain explicit language."
,B0011Z10Y8,1,1,4,This is an oldie but a goodie.  I remember this song from high school.  The sound quality of the track is great.
,B0011Z1DMC,1,1,5,This one really helps me relax in my peace room in my home surrounded by lighthouses. I love rock and roll and this song describes what it does for me so well. I drift away.
,B0011Z1DMC,1,1,4,My wife wanted me to download this for her to put on her iPod Nano. She likes the song and with the free MP3 credit you couldn't argue with the price.
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"I just  had to have it,I couldn't resist."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,Great
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,Classic.
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,As good as any recording I have heard
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,One of the greatest chill songs ever written and performed.
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"""That girl took that song away from me."" It was the summer of 1967. Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival. What he was referring to of course was the way Aretha Franklin had turned his song ""Respect"" into one of the biggest hits of the year. His version topped out at #35 on the pop charts a couple of years earlier. But I digress. Otis Redding was just beginning to hit his stride as summer turned to autumn in 1967. This veteran performer had been around for a while. The fact is that up until this point he had made the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 19 times although his records usually ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the chart. His tunes fared much better on the Soul/R&B charts where 8 of them had made it into the Top Ten. It is really difficult to understand why the man had not had greater commercial success up until this point. After taking a few months off Otis Redding returned to the studio in early December 1967. There he recorded a song he had co-written with Steve Cropper. Everyone thought it was a mistake. His wife hated it. Three days later Otis Redding was dead at 26, a victim of a tragic plane crash in Wisconsin.

When the story appeared in the newspaper I remember thinking to myself ""Who is that?"" And although I had been collecting records for about three years I had never heard of him. Despite his enormous talent Otis Redding had just not quite connected with general audiences. Less than two months later in January of 1968, Volt records released that tune his wife and friends hated so much. ""(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay"" went all the way to #1 on the Pop charts and remained there for a month. Everyone now finally realized just how talented this man had been.  An American classic."
,B0011Z1D8Q,-1,1,5,Plus plus Plus
,B0011Z1D1S,1,1,5,Inscrutable lyrics can't diminish the power of this tune
,B0011Z1D1S,-1,1,4,Ok.
,B0011Z1D1S,1,1,5,Great song from a great band.
,B0011Z1D1S,1,1,5,"Before Badfinger used a similar guitar effect in 'No Matter What"" there was Badge.  GREAT tune."
,B0011Z1D1S,1,1,5,"""Badge"" was the standard to measure Cream by and was one of their greatest hits.  It seems to be rarely played anymore but every time I hear it and those around me who hear it seem to come alive and it always seem to start a conversation up.  It is the Gold Standard to measure Cream by and All Time Favorites of a truly Golden Era of Rock.  Eric Clapton at his best prior to his all time great hit, ""Layla""."
,B0011Z10Y8,1,1,5,Motivating!!!!
,B0011Z10Y8,1,1,4,"Great song and music, I could do without the F bomb, but then it wouldn't be the same."
,B0011Z10Y8,1,1,5,"One of Green Day's best!  This song thunders out it's rhythm right from the start and doesn't let up.  It's controversial lyrics and subject matter, and non-stop fast pace leave one highly energized.  This song is loaded with the ""you're number 1 (middle finger raised in the air) anti-political, anti-news media agenda that points straight to the heart of many of America's problems with society today.  This IS punk at it's best, a load, well-written song (and video) that's short and directly to the point.  Bravo Green Day!"
,B0011Z10Y8,1,1,5,"Ok, I bought this song/s from Amazon in a download so I liked it, I can't say If anyone else would like it, listen to it and if you like it, download it, Amazon makes it easy to do, much easier that iTunes."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"I really just love listening to these older songs. They really do bring back so many memories. Memory lane as they say. Some of these songs can really bring you back to a certain times of your life. Often times I remember things that I had long forgotten, or so I thought. It is just great to listen and relax and enjoy these great songs. I grow up with so many of them. I love that I have my music on Amazon, this way I have them every where I go that I can excess my Amazon Music. I do often listen on my laptop when I am travel and staying in hotels. Nice to have some thing familiar with me. I love that I will never ever lose them or scratch them ever again. No more finding the wrong CD in the case either! That really was aggravating. Will have them forever if you are buying your music in mp3 form from Amazon."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,4,good stuff
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,Love me some Otis

,B0011Z1DMC,1,1,5,Great product
,B0011Z1DMC,-1,1,5,"I like the original and the remake, Uncle Kracker did it justice."
,B0011Z1DMC,1,1,4,"A second production by a second Musician keeping the original theme while giving the song an interesting spin, worth the download."
,B0011Z1DMC,-1,1,5,"I've always kinda liked this song, but was never really fond of Dobie Gray's higher-pitched voice for some reason. This guy & his band, however, really harmonize the lyrics quite well, and turned this piece from a ""ho-hum"" song to one that is quite a ""listening"" piece! Well worth the price, I think!"
,B0011Z1DMC,1,1,5,"""Drift Away"" sung by Uncle Kracker was excellent.  It soothed my mind and body while listening to it.  Would recommend to all family and friends."
,B0011Z1DMC,1,1,5,"This is probably my favorite performance of this song, despite the horrible sound editing that was done on it, which can be especially noticeable during the line ""When my mind is free, no melody can move me....""  etc.  WHO DID THE SOUND ENGINEERING ON THIS?  LEARN YOUR JOB DUDE!!  But other than that it's pretty good.  And definitely a decent buy."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,Great Music!

,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"I heard this cut for the first time on the night of the first Kennedy assassination. I was a kid then. I recalled listening to the words...I wondered if there was a better adult world in the future? Still looking for it, and Otis is at his best singing this cut."

,B0011Z0W2Y,1,1,5,"How can one possibly rate a mp3 download negatively? I give five stars to this purchase, because it was quick and hassel free."
,B0011Z0W2Y,1,-1,3,"Easy enough to listen to, not the best song in the world, but with the $.99 I paid for it."
,B0011Z0W2Y,-1,1,4,"Nickelback must have been grooving on a hippie vibe when they wrote this song.  Or else John Lennon was coming through the Ouija board.  Imagine IMAGINE rewritten for a modern audience by Nickelback and you're half way there.

I like this song.  It's got punch and it evokes what the song-meisters want you to think and feel, but it's somehow still lightweight.

Recommend it.  (I mean I did buy it)"
,B0011Z0W2Y,1,1,5,"I was not sure if I would like this band, but I love it.  The music is great for working out!"
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,4,"Happy to report that I bought this for use on a personal ""radio"" show that I do for myself and some friends (during gaming sessions). Love this song"
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,Met or exceeded my expectations. What is shown is what I received. I down loaded this and expect to listen to it often
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,A review really is not necessary for one of the best songs ever to come out of a pair of speakers. It's timeless
,B0011Z0W2Y,1,1,5,"Great quality sound and playback, it was an awesome addition to my overall music collection."
,B0011Z0W2Y,1,1,5,great song
,B0011Z0W2Y,1,1,5,Love it.
,B0011Z0W2Y,1,-1,3,"Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one.

,B0011Z1D8Q,-1,-1,2,"Not only did this track have a lot of static but it plays with a drag, in other word its like playing an old-fashioned 45 record and the speed is too slow."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"This guy's voice, and his music, are classic, and are great listening to chill out in the evenings after a tense day. Few artists rise to this level, in my opinion."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,This is one of my very favorite songs of all time and now I get to hear it everyday since I am using as a ringtone---I sometimes forget to answer the call however..LOL
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"deep, aching metaphor. it's weird to whimsically whistle a song without thinking about it only to realize how sad and beautiful it is. great song. ps, amazon should rule the world."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,Easy to download. Easy listening. Classic tune that gets in your head and you can sing along with it all day.
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,Testimonies of love lost and realizing one has made a mistake are always great to listen to.  This song is no different.  The rich melodic voices of the band blend perfectly together to offer a soothing sound of love lost and found.
,B0011Z0YN6,1,-1,3,This is one of my favorite songs from Nickelback. I liked this product because it was a good price. This song did meet my expectations.
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,Like that I can just download from amazon right to my phone. Always great quality. Lots of great songs to choose from.
,B0011Z0YN6,-1,1,4,"When I first heard this song on the radio, I was like, 'Wow, that's a change of pace.' And it was, after the usual modern rock chart-toppers they marched out one-by-one, this song is a refreshing change until... Radio drags it through the mud that is their airwaves 10 times a day. It was after a little while of that that I got more of a critical eye with the song as I came up with reasons to hate the song that was so overplayed by radio jocks. So first off, while the verses are good, the chorus, especially the last couple rounds of it in the last minute or so in the song, turns away from that, and falls flat, making it a flat love song at the end.

So overall, great verses, bad chorus. Maybe not the best of songs to win your lovers hand. But in any case, it's a good shake-up from the usual Nickelback."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,I live near the plane crash and hadn't thought much about it until I listened to the lyrics and heard Otis testify!
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,You can't beat the classics and Sittin' On The Dock Of The Bay is no different. No one does it like Otis!
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"I often wonder what would have been.  This was classic soul back in the late '60-'70s.  I actually sat on the dock of the bay in San Francisco when this song was current.  Sweet memories, even if you didn't get to the dock."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,I really enjoyed listening to the song.  It was of good quality.  I have no issues with the song at all.
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,4,This is a good little ditty. When you feel like relaxing on the back porch and sipping on an adult beverage this is a good song to listen to.
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"I grew up in the 60's through '72 and this song was one of my favorites !!  When I heard it, it brought back some good memories, so I bought it right then & there !!"
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"Fantastic tune from yesteryear that never looses its message. Fast download and flawless tune, I love to purchase through Amazon for the clairity of the music."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,Not sure anyone needs a review of this song to know whether or not they want to purchase it. A classic that is great to have on my playlist for the car.
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"When I wanted to fill my Kindle with the music I prefer to listen to, then I found the song, my Kindle downloaded it with ease, so I am satisfied."
,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,Then you would love this! It is an soldier but a goodie.  I love old school music. You would not be disappointed.
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,Listened to this song a lot growing up and I still really like it.
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,Awesome when working out.. or just even driving...
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,"Great song, again another band that seemed to disappear off the radar"
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,"ok well I am a Nickelback fan so what I say comes from my deep LOVE for this band. This song makes you just LOVE the idea of LOVE. It's mellow and beautiful. This is a great date night song for that cuddle playlist. Makes you want to hold the person that you love tighter, kiss harder and fall even deeper in love."
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,4,"If you like Nickelback, make sure to check out this song, it's well worth a listen."
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,A Nickelback best.
,B0011Z0YN6,-1,1,5,Ty
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,"Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good."
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,My favorite Nickelback song.
,B0011Z0YN6,1,-1,3,"This was a gift, so I cannot comment."
,B0011Z0YN6,-1,1,5,For my wife Renee!
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,I love Nickelback.  One of my favorites.
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,4,I have been been a fan of this group and really liked this song. I had to own it and play it over and over again
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,Amazing!  Love it!
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,"Great quality sound and playback, it was an awesome addition to my overall music collection."
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,GREAT album!
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,Love it.

Comment"
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,I love this song.. Even though the lyrics aren't exactly the circumstances.. the main point of the song carries me away. For instance.. Mistakes have been made.. regrets linger...timing is always off and for everything in between there lay a story that needed to be heard that always whisper I never stopped loving you but circumstances made my fate.. it's kind of a goodbye for me however it's also a tell me you forgive me and loved me too at one point and a second chance to be friends kind of thing because you will always be more to me than just a stranger...
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,Definitely NIckelback's best song in my opinion.  Loved the change of key toward the end of the song.  Really made it for me.
,B0011Z0YN6,1,1,5,"This is a great CD and song. Everyone in the family loves listening, young to old. Great product, high quality and best part of all instant arrival."
,B0011Z0YR2,-1,1,4,a real bore. Catchy tune but one gets tired of listening to it real quick.
,B0011Z0YR2,-1,1,4,"Say what you want about Nickelback, they're one of, if not the most popular rock group today. And their ""most annoying"" is their best song. The song is basically wanting the life of a Rockstar, which Nickelback is, so... not the most original theme. In fact, this song is more cliched than a international South Park cartoon character. But, what makes the song is the catchiness. You'll have it stuck in your head whether you like it or not, and soon, in the middle of a crowded elevator, you'll start singing, ""I'm going to pop my pills with a pez dispenser."" This may of course cause you much embarrassment, and will cause you to smash your radio. But in the end, it's a rock song, and Nickelback's best rock song, and maybe best song period. I'm not saying it's a great song, just Nickelback's best song, because it's so darn catchy.

Overall, there are many warnings to give before getting this song, and they are too numerous to name here. So, be warned, you might not like, or get out of your head, what you hear."
,B0011Z10HK,1,1,5,"This hard rockin' tune has enormous replay value. You'll just love it. The group has that partying, fun feeling that's just amazing. I highly recommend this track."
,B0011Z10HK,1,1,5,"Reminds me alot of Queen, so it was cool to have a modern band with a classic sound. Try it, you might like it."
,B0011Z10HK,1,1,5,I think it is a great tune that I would recommend to everyone who likes this type of music. Very Iconic to the genre.
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,"I loved this song the first time I heard it on the radio years ago and the quality of this download is even better than what I was hearing on the radio. Because tastes in music are very subjective and vary from person to person, I urge anybody considering buying the download to play the sample clip first."
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,4,Excellent Product
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,"Oh yeah baby!!  Doesn't everyone want to be a Rockstar?  Me, not so much, but this is a great song."
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,I love this song !
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,Good song
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,Thank You
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,This song tells a story. It sort of makes fun of being a Rockstar but somehow still makes the life seem like something everyone would want to do. This is feel good music personified.  But I am a Nickelback fan.
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,great song
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z10HK,1,1,4,Good song

,B0011Z10HK,-1,-1,3,I had to do it for the memories.
,B0011Z10HK,1,1,5,"This is a great song, especially to jam out to. I am so happy with this purchase, I recommend this song."
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
,B0011Z0YR2,-1,1,5,Ty
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,"Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good."

,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,Great Music and voice.
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,LOVE
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,A very good song and I encountered no issues downloading this song and the sound quality was as expected. Recommended
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,I ABSOLUTELY love this song  and the band. They are the Best. I seen them live last a couple of years ago and was amazed that they were.True t o form.
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,I love their music. They are a great band that does not disappoint. I am glad I got thier CD
,B0011Z0YR2,-1,1,5,I don't care what anyone says about Nickelback. Obviously they don't either. Juju doesn't affect them. Freely case cigarettes day marred
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,Met or exceeded my expectations. What is shown is what I received. I to use as often as I can. Great.
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,"ROCKSTAR!  Wow, this band is so incredibly awesome and I love EVERY SINGLE SONG THEY SING!  Now that is hard to say about anyone! :)  I got it no time as it's in the MP3 format, downloaded to computer, synced to my MP3 player and listened to it right away!  LOVE IT!  Thank you!"
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,I purchased this to add to my IPOD collections so I can listen while napping before a long day at work.
,B0011Z0YR2,1,-1,3,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,One of their best songs. I have this as my ringtone!!! Everyone loves it when my cell phone goes off!
,B0011Z0YR2,1,1,5,My step-son from my last marriage introduced me to the music by Nickelback and although not all of their works interest me there are a few of their songs I enjoy listening to such as is the case with this song.
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,This is a great song that I completely forgot. Recorded just at the start of the 90's but still had a strong 80's vibe to it. Great song to dance to as well.
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,"Great !!!  It is PRINCE, what more is there to say !"
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,best of Prince
,B0011Z0YEA,-1,1,5,Brought back memories.
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,Love Prince!
,B0011Z0YR2,1,-1,3,"This song is funny. It's decent but many hate it, and I guess I can't blame them. I however, liked it enough to write a review on it so you guys can see my opinion. This song has nothing on Photograph in my opinion though. I love that song.

Chad is basically saying how everyone wants to be a rock star, how everyone in the industry is skinny and trying to be a centerfold and also, interesting enough, ""have their dealers on speed dial.""

lol....

My cousin Tasha LOVES this song. (:

3.5 stars."
,B0011Z0ZU8,1,1,4,"I have to say that, out of all the songs on the CD on which this song appears, there are only two songs I like.  This, obviously, is one of them.  I like it quite a lot, have seen the video and like it too.  The lead singer has a very appealing, lilting voice.  I just advise anyone who may be buying an entire CD from ""Sixpence None the Richer"" to listen to a portion of all the songs.  It may just be me; others may like all the songs, but my advice is to check it out."
,B0011Z0ZU8,1,1,5,"Love the tune of this song, and the lyrics!  Love to listen to it over and over! It is a wonderful song !!

Rhonda"
,B0011Z0ZU8,-1,1,4,They were a two hit wonder (this song was on Dawson's Creek and the other was on the songtrack to So I Married an Axe Murderer) and for .$69 I bought it.
,B0011Z0ZU8,1,1,4,Now I don't have to listen to the radio anymore to hear this song ten times a day.
,B0011Z0ZU8,1,1,4,"I don't know when I first heard it, but it's a romantic movie classic. And you really got to love how upfront she is, ""Kiss me!"" If only more girls were like that... Anyways, lyrically, it is what is, take it or leave it, they really make this song a pop-novelty. The music work is great, kind of a soft rock vibe to it, and if you can find the instrumental version of the song, it's pretty interesting to listen to.

Overall, only a song you could find in the 90's. A romantic pop-novelty classic that doesn't hold anything back.

Oh, and listen to New Found Glory's cover of the song. They actually improve on some of the elements of this song, and in some ways perfect it, till you hit the chorus. Good song nevertheless."
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,He was on every wall in my bedroom and I will forever love him! RIP Prince!
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,4,great music
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,"I love this song. The first time i heard it, i knew i had to buy it. It's got a great beat and the words are so smooth. The best way to listen to this is by headphones. It sounds awesome. Prince is great."
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,5,Love the fact that I can get real music from the past and put it on my Kindle.  Great prices and quality!
,B0011Z0YEA,1,1,4,"I like several songs by the muse from Minnesota

This being one of them.

The beat and music is to cool for school."
,B0011Z0ZU8,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0011Z0ZU8,1,1,5,"best of their hits so far, love the music, background, and voices."
,B0011Z0ZU8,1,1,4,GREAT FOOD!!
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,"Exact music file, no scratches or dropouts!! Great for making your OWN PERSONAL CDS!  This is the only way to get music!"
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,"Having heard CSN sing Southern Cross and been moved by the words and music, I never thought I'd ever SEE the Southern Cross, but I did! And, we sang the music while we sailed under it!! Whe[...]
Great music, what voices and what writers! They don't make 'em like this any more!! Get this."
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,Loved it

,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,love this song
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,An excellent oldie to add to my collection
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,"Geez...its CS&N one of the besg groups to come out of the 70s...great harmony,  catchy tune and great lyrics...unlike mist of the trash one hears today."
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,This song was always on the radio and takes me back to the days when life was much more simple :)
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,Southern Cross was actually one of the songs I incorporated into my Jurisprudence paper during my third year of Law School at the Great University Of Texas School Of Law.  I wish I had taken it more to heart in later years during my practice.  Lots of good thoughts there.
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,If you love 60's music this is a must have for your collection.  CSN had a lot of great hits and this is just one of them.
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,4,I've always liked their acoustic sound and this CD focuses very heavily on that sound. I like playing this in the car on the kindle along with other faves from my 20s.

,B0011Z1EJ4,1,1,5,"Just enhancing my LZ collection in preparation for the Jason Bonham Led Zep experience / Heartbreaker tour coming to town here shortly.  If you haven't checked out Stairway to Heaven Kennedy Center honors on you tube, you've got to see it!  Houses of the Holy came out shortly before the band broke up.  I saw them in concert twice, but this track which is out-standing was never performed live by the Gods."
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,4,"Classic rock at its finest.  what more to say, I have to write seven more words... now the last four!"
,B0011Z10UM,-1,1,5,"I'm always loved this song. Just got around to actually buying it.  There's no sound like Crosby, stills, Nash, and young."
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,"i actually got up at 3 am to see this when i was on a cruise
this song inspired me that much!
the lyrics are awesome and the beat is great
listen to it on the beach all the time
and also when i have 5 feet of snow all around
makes me long to go to the islands...

and who can forget:  and we never failed to fail - it was the easiest thing to do!"
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,4,Great song!  Bought it for back ground music while I work.  Will be back for more songs soon!!! Enjoy the great music of this generation.
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,This song has been around for many many years. It was a song I listened to in my late teens. Very mellow and thought provoking. I have seen teens of this decade listening to it and enjoying it with the same passion that I did years ago.
,B0011Z10UM,1,1,5,"I guess i am an old timer...I liked this one better than the remastered as the lead singer kept the lead through the whole song, without being overpowered by the chorus singers. It just felt ""softer"" than the remastered, which gave it that ""more heart felt"" sound. Amazon delivered promptly with no problems...Yea Amazon!!!!"
,B0011Z2YR0,1,1,5,This reminds me of earlier rock fast and heavy I'd say progressive great guitar work if your a rocker you will like this song

,B0011Z10BG,1,1,5,Missy knows she has some great beats in all of her songs. There is not one song she has made that you can not dance to.

The five songs we get here truly are among the very best from Gordon Lightfoot; and this is excellent music that stands the test of time. ""Sundown"" is brilliantly done; Gordon does this so well and I really like ""Sundown."" As another reviewer notes, ""Sundown"" really sticks in your mind after you've listened to it! There's also ""If You Could Read My Mind;"" I could never tire of hearing this ballad. Gordon sings this with True passion, heart and soul; it's a little masterpiece. ""Beautiful"" is very well done; and ""Carefree Highway"" is yet another classic Lightfoot tune. The track set ends with Gordon Lightfoot's ""Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald."" ""Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,"" just like the other songs here, got a lot of airplay when it was first released and it will never sound stale.

Gordon Lightfoot fans can download these songs to enjoy them again and again. This five track set also makes the perfect introduction to Gordon Lightfoot to newcomers just discovering his magical artistry."
,B0011Z31FY,1,1,5,One of the best of the early sixties balladiers was Gordon Lightfoot. This CD has only 3 songs but they are the best of his music. They are wonderful to listen to and you will remember them for along time to come.
,B0011Z30MS,1,1,5,A haunting song that I bought in reminisense of Prince.  May he rest in peace.

,B0011Z31FY,-1,1,5,"The title sums this up, i'd come looking for a copy of The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald which led me to this EP. I was familiar with nearly every song on it, and those that i weren't were just as good. At the price, i'd've been stupid to by just one or two of the songs."
,B0011Z31FY,1,1,5,A great collection of Gordon's greatest hits.  These songs are timeless and this album is at a right price.  A must for any serious audiophile's collection.
,B0011Z2Z0Q,1,1,5,I love you Prince...your legacy will definitely live on!!

,B0011Z31FY,1,1,5,"Header says it all.  These are the best songs of Gordon Lightfoot.  I've always liked these songs, and I feel fortunate to find them together at a reasonable price."
,B0011Z31FY,1,1,5,The Wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald it one of my favorites by him and this one had a few extra treasures that you might like or remember.
,B0011Z30MS,1,1,5,I love old time Prince songs
,B0011Z30MS,1,1,5,"Prince need I say more. Well if I do,

,B0011Z2Z0Q,1,1,5,"I love some of Prince's music. Some of it is sexually explicit but he has a style of his own.
He is so handsome!
  Thank you,
  Senceria"
,B0011Z2Z0Q,1,1,5,"This song is absolutely awesome.  I had to have it.  Although it's been performed by others after him, no one can belt it out like Prince."
,B0011Z30SM,1,1,5,"I love the song and others by the artist, cover design is beautiful and exquisite.  Finally, great value, just like iTunes, except without the limited iTunes card."
,B0011Z30SM,1,1,5,I love this song and was excited to find it on Amazon. I was even happier that the process to download it to my computer and then into my iTunes library to put on my iPod was quite simple as well!
,B0011Z2XL2,1,1,4,"CRAWLING: 4/5

The music video always helped me swallow this song a little easier for some reason. It was a weird mixture between a hard song and a ballad, and I think it was unsettling. But it also made the song unique. And it's one of the songs that defines Hybrid Theory, so what's not to love?"
,B0011Z2XL2,1,1,5,Great Workout Song. Love it!
,B0011Z2XL2,1,1,5,Great product
,B0011Z2XL2,1,1,4,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
,B0011Z2XL2,1,1,5,great service and a good product. i would buy again if needed. the quality is what i expected for the price.
,B0011Z2XL2,1,1,4,I know this song because we have all walk a mile in this shoes.  if you have not then you have not lived.
,B0011Z2XL2,1,1,5,its a good song niot much i can say other then i enjoy it and it is good in my opinion
,B0011Z0VGG,1,1,5,It's easy to purchase your favorite songs on Amazon. You have the choice of playing them on your Cloud Player or adding them to your MP3 so you can have them with you.
,B0011Z0VGG,1,1,5,"Have a friend who's going through this. This is a tribute to the wisdom of leaving folks alone to deal with pain and move on when a relationship is over. You left, so go already!"
,B0011Z0VGG,1,1,5,I think this is the only one of The Wreckers' songs I've actually heard.  One of my favorites from a couple of years ago.
,B0011Z0Y9K,1,1,5,"I love my chemical romance and I think ""the black parade"" is their best Lp yet! Each track was awesome! Please buy!!! Worth it!!"
,B0011Z0Y9K,1,1,5,Good Song

,B0011Z0Y9K,1,1,5,"I love the artist and the whole tone and mood of the song, a definite buy that will remain popular even when the song is considered to be vintage."
,B0011Z0Y9K,1,1,5,"I absolutely love this song it is one of my favorite and
 I would recommend it to everyone. It's a great song
 to just listen to."
,B0011Z0Y9K,1,1,5,My nine-year-old heard this song and asked me to look it up.  He has great taste.  Now it's one of my favorites!
,B0011Z0Y9K,1,1,5,"My Chemical Romance is one fo the best groups and this is a another wonderful song from them. Good lyrics, personally meaningful, and again just another wonderful song from MCR"
,B0011Z0Y9K,1,1,5,"Welcome to the Black Parade is one of My Chemical Romance's best songs - it has a rockin' beat and is very catchy.  It starts out like a ballad and then jams thru the rest of the song.  I liked it the first time I heard it, then I heard it again at a friends house and she knew the name and I came home and immediately downloaded it from Amazon!  I play it almost every day!!"
,B0011Z339S,1,1,5,Great Music
,B0011Z30SW,1,1,5,awesome transaction. past no hassles. easy to find. i will recommend it to anyone trying to find music. thank you

,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,5,Love this song and added it to my must have list of classics as you should too!!!  Who doesn't love a little Prince from now to then?
,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,5,Prince at his nastiest! I remember dancing to this song in the clubs in the 80's.  Hot then and hot now.  Great song to strip to too!
,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,5,Another great song from the collection!
,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,5,great song
,B0011Z2Z1K,-1,1,5,Its Prince
,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,5,"One of the most suggestive songs on  The Purple Rain Soundtrack. Another great song that put Prince on the censorship page. I was only a preteen when this came out, but what was the big deal? Today's music has gotten more racy and raunchy, but I'm no prude. If you don't like it don't listen. An amazing song would recommend it to anyone."
,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,5,RIP prince.
,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,5,"Naughty Song, but that was Prince during this period. Timeless classic from a music genius."
,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,4,I like alot of Prince freaky songs He's too much and I miss him.. RIP Prince

,B0011Z2Z1K,1,1,5,Prince is an awesome artist with alot of talent with excellent musical writing and singing. THis song is just good with a nice rhythm.
,B0011Z1DPY,1,1,5,Great Nickelback song
,B0011Z1DPY,1,-1,3,"Pretty much the same as my previous Nickleback song review, you know what you're getting. It's listenable, at least for a few times."
,B0011Z1DPY,1,1,5,this are one of the song from nickleback that I've been trying to find for a long time and now I found it.
,B0011Z1DPY,1,-1,3,"I like the band's music.  The only problem I have is that every song is similar.  Admittedlly this could be that I haven't listened to them much and the samples don't really reflect the entire composition.  Good Band, Good Song."
,B0011Z1DPY,-1,1,5,"I liked this song, but didn't want the whole album. I just searched for the names of this group's songs that I want."
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,AWESOME SONG!

,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Freakin' great!!

,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Great!!!
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,4,Good song i like this one
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Disturbed is just a great band.

,B0011Z3E0Q,-1,-1,1,"Have you ever thought what would happen if you told your parrot to write a song, that sounded like a love song, but actually had a dark meaning, then told the parrot to sing the song, put it on an album? Neither have I, but that logic is what drives this song. Really folks, this song has all the quality of you're parrot doing. Especially the singing, oh gosh the singing...

Overall, a pathetic effort, from a guy that doesn't deserve to see the light of the music world day."
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,great song!
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have purchased it...
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Everything excellent!
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,for yourorkout pleasure
,B0011Z1BHO,-1,-1,1,"The four letter words were terrible, ruined the whole song for me. I bought the wrong version."
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Great heavy metal band!
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Love it
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Favorite of their albums.
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,4,"After hearing their remake of ""Land of Confusion"" I thought I'd check out some of their other stuff.  This is great song.

CA Luster"
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,All of us love this. We watch / play / read it often. Item was in condition as expected and there were no troubles with it.
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,I really like this song. The sound quality is good. The song starts where it should and ends where it should. Doesn't have an awkward cut off. No complaints.
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,Heard the song on the radio and had to buy it.  I have an eclectic taste and also love this kind of music.
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,I listen to the whole CD not just specific tracks.  Now they are Fight or Flight so go see them when you can.
,B0011Z3E0Q,1,1,5,t is awesome song.
,B0011Z3E0Q,1,1,5,Great tune
,B0011Z3E0Q,1,1,5,HIT SONG. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS.  VERY CLEAR.  I AM A JAMES BLUNT FAN.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.A NICE SONG WORTH GETTING IT.
,B0011Z3E0Q,1,1,5,"Loved this song from the time I first heard it on the radio, and it was so great being able to purchase JUST this one and not a whole album inexpensively.  Take a preview listen and then BUY."
,B0011Z3E0Q,1,1,5,I don't know if his is the 1st one to come out but I've heard other renditions but I like his the best.
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,4,"This tune fits into a library for exercising or when you are just wanting to hear something harder than the candy pop that is on the radio these days.  Not something I would play for my kids, but to make me angry enough to finish running the last half mile in the neighborhood, it does the job."
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,5,"Anyone can tell ya this song does not disappoint. Really gets the blood pumping!! If ya want to kick things up a notch this is definitely the song!! I know I know, this is the same review I gave for Stupify but what else can a guy say. You can really feel this music."
,B0011Z1BHO,1,1,4,I down loaded fast and I was alble to listen to the music right away. I like the song very much.
,B0011Z1BHO,-1,1,5,haave it on my phone to exercise to/ always makes me run faster  definitely R rated/not for kids under 16
,B0011Z1DEA,1,1,5,I love music and Eric Clapton is a great performer and singer.  I saw him in concert a couple of times. This particular saw is a favorite
,B0011Z1DEA,1,1,5,Eric Clapton has always been an incredible song writer & performer. But he really pours his heart & soul into this one - perhaps one of the very best songs he's ever written or performed! I could listen to this song over & over & never get tired of it - it's that good...!!
,B0011Z2Y5C,-1,1,5,Not sure why they want this reviewed.. It's a song. I knew what I was getting and that's what I got..  ????
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,4,good
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,Excellent song  Sandra K.
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,"This is Red Hot Chili Peppers the music.  If you are looking for spices, this is not that."
,B0011Z2Y5C,-1,1,5,Everyone I know has every word of this song memorized.
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,4,ok
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,4,"When it has honestly came down to Josh Groban, he just has shown one of the noblest voices in the music industry in a very long time. Yet, he just has never been able to top one of his biggest songs from 2003, You Raise Me Up. The song is definitely very uplifting, and shows a strength in the simplest voice that many artists just haven't been able to show in their brightest lights. I really hope that one day, Josh can really deliver something as beautiful as this song showed very soon. We really don't have distinctive voices out there right now.

Song: B+"
,B0011Z310Y,-1,-1,3,"First of all, this is at least the third cover of this song, as it was originally done by an Irish group, while Groban is (I'm pretty sure) Italian. And while Groban does have a good voice (it's more of a very mature acquired taste), his songs are boring, and inspirational. This song also sounds like the producer was heavily involved making this, rather than the artist. And due to the undue success of this song from saps who need a little lifting up, the inspirational genre is now a big sappy industry. And what's bad is, it has zero substance. Sure the lyrics, good gosh the lyrics, I mean, anybody can write these songs, but all the great ones don't because it's unoriginal. I mean if this song helps you, great. But for the rest of us that only care about great music, the song is only ok.

Overall, if you're a sappy soccer mom who needs a little lifting and inspiration in your life, buy the song, otherwise, don't support this genre any longer. Please!"
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"An operatic quality lyric baritone male voice for our time on a par with Enrico Caruso, and a nice guy.  Talk about humble... ""you raise me up""?  Geez, fella."
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,"Sounds just like a digital file of the actual song, which is exactly what it is."
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,My time like this was early 1987...
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,"Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good."
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,Classic!
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,I absolutely love this song and Josh Groban's voice touches my heart. Very inspiring.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,ok
,B0011Z2Y5C,-1,1,5,smoof
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,Who doesn't love mp3's
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,This song I always liked because it has a R&B influence in the choices of chords and phrasing used for the guitar playing. I had to look up the words to the last chorus (Under the bridge downtown/Is where I drew some blood) when the female backing vocalist(s) joins in because that part of the song is the best to me :) A great song by one of the great contemporary bands!
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Love Love Love this song
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,What else is there to say beautiful and uplifting
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Really good music.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Wonderful song!
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,also one of the greatest songs--Josh has a great voice and is an interesting person
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,Great song! Great Band! Great Recording! What more could you ask for??? Well MORE of course! I am a huge fan!
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,"This song will always be a reminder of where I was and what I was doing at the time this song was released. It will go down in rock history as a classic rock song. It's same as the Eagles, Hotel California."
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,"This is a good song, I like this song, it is by a good artist, I would buy it again."
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,What can i say Another hit for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I've always been a fan and probably always will be.
,B0011Z2Y5C,1,1,5,"Love this song by this group...became a big fan of theirs, not everything on the album is great but they have a few songs that are really awesome, this is one."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,good song
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,uplifting love song
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,Have loved this song for as long as I can remember. I highly recommend it and the album. It's great!
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,"Songs like this one are not played everyday by your local radio cm. So,if want to listen to them again get a copy while you still can. Vinyl records are a thing of the past and so songs like this one unless people continue to listen and/or request he's to keep playing them."
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,"Great song that brings back memories of a simpler time.  Frankie Valli's signature voice leading the way is a great trip back in time.  Glad ""Jersey Boys"" has reminded us of this GREAT classic music."
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,Great sounding in hearing the best time of my life again in music!! I would definitely suggest this collection to anyone wishing to relive those great years of the Four Seasons.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,It's a good song.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Thank you so very much for this spirit lifting hymn.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,My wife love's it .
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,"This is a classic song from a group that was probably famous for any number of tunes, but this is my favorite..... Brings back a lot of memories. Good stuff"
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs.
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,awesome
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,a ok
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,Best
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,4,Classic.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Good song. Enjoy listening to Contemporary Christian music.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Love this song
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,GREAT
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,Perfect
,B0011Z2Y16,-1,-1,3,"the sound quality is terrible, but I guess that is what is was in those days"
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,4,"My favorite Four Seasons' song from the sixties. It was on the soundtrack of the movie ""Conspiracy Theory"" . . ."
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,This song brings back so many fond memories in that period of my life when I first heard it.  I was amazed that I didn't own it.  ....and of course the great Four Seasons and Frankie Valli.
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,One of their best songs. Great purchase.
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,Great and beautiful song
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,5,good song...
,B0011Z2Y16,1,1,4,"As expected
Fast arrival. Good price!"
,B0011Z310Y,-1,1,5,5 stars
,B0011Z310Y,-1,1,5,"Very similar to Wind Beneath My Wings. Not familiar with this artist's work, so this is a good intro."
,B0011Z1AWA,1,1,5,"The song has that ""ethereal shimmering"" sound and lyrics. Almost Psychedelic Folk Rock but without the  stupid drug and pagan elements. Great rhythm guitar(yes there's 2 H's in rhythm, it looks weird but the spell checker insists). ""If the silence takes you then I hope it takes me too"".Priceless(but not really True)."
,B0011Z1AWA,1,1,5,"This song and others from this artist fall into the category of 'songs I mean to get someday'.  It got way too much airplay when it came out, but now I enjoy this well done production that really put the group in the public eye."
,B0011Z1AWA,1,1,5,This group (or at least this song) has a unique blend of indy pop/folk sound and a psychedelic sound. It's like Of Monsters and Men meets Pink Floyd.
,B0011Z1AWA,1,1,5,i love it. i love it. i love it. i hate being required to do this. i love it. i love it
,B0011Z1AWA,1,1,5,"""Soul Meets Body"" was originally released in 2005 as the first single from the band's full-length&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PLANS/dp/B0011Z933S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PLANS</a>.  It's easily one of the best songs on the album, but not because PLANS is mediocre; ""Soul Meets Body"" is one of Death Cab for Cutie's best.  Ben Gibbard's lyrics border on poetry here, and his voice finds a place between mellow crooning and urgent singing.  The band's instrumentation is just as interesting as the lyrics: use of slight electronics, keys, mandolins.  The final line: ""a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere"" might as well be describing the song itself.  If you are looking for one song to convince you to listen to the band, ""Soul Meets Body"" might as well be it.  Fantastic song."
,B0011Z1AWA,1,1,5,"I haven't heard much else from Death Cab for Cutie, though I'm told that their songs tend towards the gloomy.  This one doesn't quite fit that bill, though; it's upbeat, undeniably catchy, with a lovely rhythm and arrangement.  It takes a while to absorb the lyrics, so I will leave that to you to do on your own.
You won't get tired of it."
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.

It opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3/4 string/guitar progression accompanied by a 4/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.

My favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.

Kashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.

Most fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door. So much has been written about this song, you can find many online treatises that analyze its brilliance. I prefer to let it all wash over me like an oasis in the desert."
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,SO EPIC MAN
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,4,"Even if it talks about India, I do believed they wrote the song when it was not polluted and rather beautiful. I think still beautiful..."

,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,"I must say that Amazon has the best selection for Classic Rock, which will be here for all times. No music will ever compare to the music of that era. I have so far purchased 688 songs from Amazon over the years. Not all Classic Rock, for I do like Christian Hymns very much. But they always have a great selection no matter what genre you are looking for."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,The perfect tribute song for that person in your life who has mentored you and helped you to become more than you ever though was possible.  Also an inspiration to try to be the kind of man (or woman) who would make someone feel this way about you.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Great Music!
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,You raise me up with your amazing voice.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"Perhaps one of the greatest songs / recordings of all time.  You cannot go wrong with Josh Groban's beautiful voice, and the style would appeal to anyone.  Not really classical, not opera, not show tunes, not gospel...but anyone who likes those would like this.  I don't typically like ANY of those, but this is just beautiful.  I'm sure this will go down in the history of greatest recordings ever."
,B0011Z310Y,-1,1,5,Can't beat Josh no voice like his
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,This was a big hit from 1975 by Led Zeppelin; it is also a very long track.

,B0011Z1DEK,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z1DEK,1,1,5,"This is a unique, beautiful, bewitching tune. It grew on me like a feline that keeps coming back, night after night, when at first you didn't think you even wanted a cat around! Then suddenly, you realize it's won your heart.* I love the minor key of this song. I tugs at my heart and attempts to draw my very soul out. I actually visualize the darkened rooms in the evening. Then I see a young man pleading with his girlfriend to take steps toward a commitment she isn't sure she's ready for. Looking back over my fifty years, I didn't appreciate this ballad so much as I do now. I am fortunate that I've been married more than half of my life to the same man. Yet I see so many young kids getting married and I hope that they are doing it for love, not just because they're expected to. I hope that women especially will realize that they are forever someone's daughter. Someday, God willing, they will become a mother and grandmother -- but when will they ever just be themselves?  There needs to be a year or two where they learn who they are, not what they are by how someone else defines them!

*Note, I am a cat lover. I just didn't know how else to phrase the praise for this song."
,B0011Z1DEK,1,1,5,"Yeah, again this is the recording like on the original vinyl and not some recorded live concert version. I would recommend this."
,B0011Z1DEK,1,1,5,"I like to listen to this song when I really want to focus on the storytelling of a song and not necessarily the music or rhythmic aspect part. I like the haunting, dynamics of the music also :) A great song by a timeless artist! *""The Best of Santana"" came in on CD on Friday a week ago, so I'm getting closer to having most of the songs I can remember while growing up :)"
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,Great !!!!
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,Good music.
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,had never heard this song but i love Led Zeppelin and it was a great price.

,B0011Z1D5Y,1,1,5,Great oldie for my kindle. Not much else you can write about a song but they require a lot oif words.
,B0011Z1D5Y,1,1,5,I really like it when I just want one song and that's all I have to buy. The song quality was very good. Amazon cloud player is also nice and easy to use.
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,This is a classic rock song- it is timeless...doesn't sound too 80's or 90's it makes ya head bob regardless!
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,Number one. Led Zepplin song in my book. The music to listen to with great headphones on is just mesmerizing. So awesome . Takes me to another place in time.
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,i was thinking about this old song and didn't want to buy a whole cd so I bought this one song
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,"I hate having to write umpteen words just to give a rating to a song.  Music in my opinion is a very subjective, personnel thing.  What you like, you like.  What you don't, you don't - regardless of whether it is considered ""great"" music by critics and audiophiles.  In any case, great song.  Buy it.  :)"
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,"Led Zeppelin is THE classic rock band of all time. Of course they're known for ""Stairway to Heaven"" but I actually prefer this song more. It gives off a kind of mysterious/magical vibe."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Great song
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,What's not to like about Josh Groban singing You 'Raise Me Up'?  The quality is good and the sound is clear.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,4,It's a very uplifting song. Josh groban has an amazing voice.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,4,Nice song - just prefer some of his others much more.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"I would give it 12 out of 10 stars.  Love his voice, love the song, love the visuals...wow how much talent...think I will go listen to it again!"
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Love it.  Gives me so much inspiration.
,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,One of the best songs ever recorded and way ahead of its time classicly modern.  The stylings of this band is classic.
,B0011Z310Y,-1,-1,3,"I actually didn't buy this song for myself.  It's too slow for me.  I bought this track for a lady in my church who wanted to sing it, and she does a good job on it."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Josh Groban's voice possesses an electric energy that resonates through space and time --True artestry.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"I love this song, I love his voice"

Will order from this seller again."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"This song is probably considered really overplayed and obnoxious to many, but it is still my favorite Josh Groban song to this day. It's so uplifting and comforting, and it's pulled me through a lot. Josh Groban is a really great artist."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"Love this man's voice! What a great, inspirational song, sung by a great, amazing singer! highly recommend to anyone who loves Josh
Groban, or loves this song."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"If this young man can't take you to your knees, no one can. He has been blessed with a voice that everyone should hear and be inspired by."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Works like a charm. I am a happy customer. The product does what it is intended to do. I would recommend this to others.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"This is the first song that I've bought that has been performed by J.G.
I have alwasy liked this songa and I like J.G.'s voice.
Great purchase!"
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Josh Groban is an exceptional singer.  The lyrics and his voice gives one goosebumps when he is singing this song!!  ENJIOY!
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Josh Groban has a voice that makes what ever he sings wonderful. This is a song that once you hear it you find it hard to get out of your head and you find yourself humming along with the lyrics that are in your mind. A lovely song sung by a handsome man with a tremendous voice. Life is good.
,B0011Z4WP2,1,1,5,"PAPERCUT: 5/5

Okay, here's a song that I think every twelve to sixteen year old boy or girl can relate to; that everyone's out to get you. That people are talking about you behind your back. The song has the fastest tempo on the entire album and it's a smart idea to start it off with a bang. The the word ""papercut"" is never in the song, but I think it represents that the song will give you a mental papercut; it'll make you suck your thumb while you listen to the other songs. The song cuts deep."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,What's not to like.  He has a heavenly voice.  He is also a great artist.  I would highly recommend all his albums.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"Glad to have access to this music.  Really like Josh Groban.  Keep his music coming, and I'll keep buying it."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,4,If you like  this type of music then you will like this album and it's type of songs. s s
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"Can't get enough of this guy, the voice is magnificent and this song is song spine tingling. Buy this one!"
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,What a cool song.  I was introduced to it by a very good friend and we worked it into the arrangement at my daughter's funeral.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,I'm only vaguely familiar with this singer and heard this song on sat radio; I thought the song was great and purchased it. It's a great addition to my song inventory.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,I know I have listened to at least 10people sing this song on Pandora  he was by far the best
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,A great performer with a great rendition of a timeless and favorite song. I highly recommend this artist to everyone.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"Josh Groban sings this hymn with depth and feeling, bringing to it all the superb qualities of his matchless voice.  His interpretation of it grabbed me.  I would highly recommend it."
,B0011Z105C,1,1,5,"Rob Thomas has really proven that he is/was the heart and soul of Matchbox Twenty, and can match the level of intensity found in their songs even on his own. Great song."
,B0011Z105C,1,1,5,i have nothing bad to say about this product.  It works well and i use it everyday. nice and easy
,B0011Z105C,-1,-1,1,"Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.

Overall, not a great song to say the least. It's radio-friendly (which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on), it's poorly done, and most of all, it's just flat-out boring. Sorry Rob, you've done better. A whole lot better."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"I fell in love with Josh Grobans voice the first time I heard him. I never cared much for opera until he came along. His voice is so wonderful to listen to, especially when I'm tense. You won't regret buying this song, or his albums."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Josh Groban...need I say more? I will say more! This man has such a powerful and clear voice. Such an inspiring singer with so much emotion and depth~
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"This is one of Josh Groban's best albums.  It is absolutely beautiful with great songs.  ""You Raise Me UP"" is a great hit with me!"
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"Emotional, inspirational song. I really like Josh Groban's ""You raise me up"" because it complemented my presentation that I put together for my high school's veteran's day assembly."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,This is his all time perfect signature song.  You just don't get any better then this.  He has a lots to offer the listener.
,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,5,"If you like country music, this is a song you'll love. It's a bit ridiculous but it's fun and catchy and I find myself singing it everywhere. If you like the song, you should definitely check out the music video because it only makes this awesome song better. If that's even possible."
,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,5,I love this song and the video. It really rocks! You don't even have to like country to like this.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"This song is an example of how music can lift one's spirits, at it's best.  Josh Groban, of course, never fails to inspire, but this song is one for the ages."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,4,Everybody and every denomination can use this song in their church. Great inspiration and great message. Josh nailed it. Awesome
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"Everyone knows the version done by Celtic Woman; but this is the original, and Josh Groban's strong voice has you on your feet, with your hands raised in praise!!!  If you love this song, buy  this mp3 download.  We love it!!"
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,This is a wonderful song by Josh Groban.  I love the lyrics.  They could be expressing praise to God or it would be a great song to pay homage to a father.  Would be a good song for Father's Day.

,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,4,"This song always makes me smile, and I love the strong bass and voices of Big and Rich.  After hearing them in concert, I like this song even more, and the play on words is so great.  I would recommend this piece to anyone who likes country western music, who loves the songs with out-of-the-ordinary lyrics, and who can imagine themselves hitting the dance floor in their cowboy boots to dance."

,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"Oh, my goodness! If you are a self-respecting Josh Groban fan, buy this now! If you have heard other versions of this song, this version is the best, buy it now! If you think Josh it hot, buy it now! If you like really pretty music along the lines of Andrea Boccelli and Celene Dion, buy this now! If you like my little speech and think it's worth a shot, you are smart, buy this now! If you don't like my speech and think it's lame, I don't care, buy this now! If you want to get the feels from a song, buy this now!!!"
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,I don't think Groban has done a song I did not like. This is as good as any other of his performances.

,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,5,It's Big and Rich! You can't go wrong with one of their songs. It's a great song to sing out loud.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,4,Bought for a funeral slide show. Dont like it but i guess good for what it is. The clients liked it
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Really ahead of her time. I always thought this was a 90s song.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Doesn't get more 90's than this......good memories.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Superb.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Good song.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,"With a title like ""Fast Car,"" one would probably expect an upbeat, blood-pounding song in the vein of ""Shut Up and Drive"" or even ""Life Is a Highway.""  One certainly wouldn't expect a poignant, even melancholy ballad about escaping the drudgery of life... only to find oneself back where they started in the end.  And when I stopped and listened to the lyrics I was shocked at just how sad this song was... and yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life but finding herself reliving it anyhow.

It's not a happy song... yet Tracy Chapman sings it so beautifully.  Her wistful voice is never overwrought or melodramatic, conveying just the right amount of emotion to fit the theme of the song.  And the simple instrumentation keeps the song appropriately low-key.  Sometimes a beautiful song is spoiled by being overproduced or oversung, and it was nice to see the singer and producers resist that temptation here.

While a melancholy song, ""Fast Car"" is still lovely to listen to, and certainly more thoughtful than the endless parade of love songs that make up popular music nowadays.  If you like James Taylor, you might also enjoy ""Fast Car."""
,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,4,If you want to have some country fun this is the song for you! Kinda dirty but fun and hot.
,B0011Z1BXS,-1,1,4,I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to  so  I liked it.
,B0011Z1BXS,-1,1,4,I knew the song before i purchased. What can I say?  I like it.  It isn't a song I had so I purchased. it.
,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,5,"I have always loved this song by Big & Rich, however, The drum cover ""really"" kicks it up. Either way I love them both."
,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,5,"Who doesn't love this song?  Not only is it funny and ironic, it has a great beat and everyone should own this song."
,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,5,"Fun and becoming a classic, you can't find better modern country -- it has a horse (Leroy) a Chevy, and a fiddle, and you can't go to a club any more and not hear it.  Not Beethoven, but worthy of the country accolades.  Everybody can sing along after you've heard it once, the beat is quick, the tune is catchy, and the guys don't sing all that well (it's almost country rap), but that's what makes it cool.  Buy it.  Listen to it."
,B0011Z1BXS,1,1,4,"Nice little tune to get you going. Definitely a fun listen. Like some traditional country, but I like this too."
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,Love my oldies.
,B0011Z4X9C,-1,-1,3,Purchased but won't play in my library
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,Nice
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,I have loved this song ever since it was first recorded!
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,A great song by a time dependable singer. It was a classic when it first came out and again after the movie Stand by Me. Give it a try.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Tracy Chapman is amazing
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,4,Good classic song.

,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,This is one of all of his albums that are just beauiful.  I go to sleep listening to all of his songs.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,This artist and song are inspiriational and helps me to get in the mood for the day by motivating my quest to have a personal relationalship with Jesus Christ
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Love me some 90's music
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,4,I have always enjoyed hearing this song on the Wave had to download into M.P.3

,B0011Z4Z3G,-1,1,5,Eric
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Good song
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"I've heard this song by various artists.  Josh's version tops them all in my opinion. His voice is wonderful on anything he sings, but this is my favorite."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,Long been one of my favorite songs from one of the most outstanding voices of this century. Inspiring and beautiful.
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,awesome
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,Still a great song
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,"Great classic song from a gent with a great, soulful voice"
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,This is the type of song when you hear it you have to pull on the side of the road and just listen to it.!
,B0011Z4Z3G,-1,1,4,ok song
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,A classic beauty.
,B0011Z4Z3G,-1,1,5,REMINDS ME OF MY SOPHOMORE YR. IN HS
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Great 90's song and one of my favorites.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,this is the hit song for josh groban.  he has the voice with the instrumental background gives this song a great inspiation for what God does for us.  just a great song to listen too.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,I have always loved this song and it just brings me comfort each time I hear it. I even love the version done by the Celtic Women.
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,4,"Maybe the artist didn't want to include the Lord's NAME, but it seems like a perfect song to sing to our Lord, as opposed to a girl friend. But that's just my opinion. It's like Amy Grant's, ""You light up my life."" They include it on Christian Praise and Worship CD's, but it was marketed as ""pop"" I believe, so it could be sold as a love song also. This is the same way."
,B0011Z310Y,-1,1,5,"I downloaded this song onto my mp3 player on my phone, heard this song on the radio and had to have it for days when filling down."
,B0011Z310Y,1,1,5,"A great CD!  If you like Josh Grogan you'll love this CD!  Especially the title song, ""You Raise Me Up""  He has one of the truly great voices in the business today!"
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,-1,3,We have always enjoy listening to this music. We put in on play lists for events with family and friends.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,4,Got this track because I adored this song back when it was playing on the radio constantly. Tracy's mellow voice and guitar are just perfect for sitting back and chilling.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,-1,3,"This latest effort by Tracy is reminiscent of ""Gove me one reason"" but worth it to hear her fresh sound again.....Tracy is a very talented artist."
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Tracy is just so awesome. I listen to her depressing songs to get me out of my depression and truthfully it works great. She has a great voice.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,"This song makes me sad, which is probably what the intended effect is. It really helps me to feel what the singer was supposedly feeling."
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,5,Bought this and Still Into You. Paramore comes out with a track every omce in awhile that I can't stop playing this was the first.
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,5,"I love the song and others by the artist, cover design is beautiful and exquisite.  Finally, great value, just like iTunes, except without the limited iTunes card."
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,5,I think that this is one of there best songs (and album) out of them all. I just wish that Paramore will go back to the way they were. If you did not hear about them start with there first album till there latest and you will also hear a huge difference
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,5,"Awesome beat and great vocals.  The lyrics really match the tempo, which makes you immediately want to rock.  Awesome song if you are looking for a really quick pace with beats that jump up and kick your butt to get it moving."
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,It's an excellent song from the eighties. I didn't feel this song too old. She tells a nice story in the lyrics.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,4,"Another great song. It's too bad it ended up being more like a one hit wonder. Her voice sounds very unique and gives one the feeling of a person who has an ""old soul""."
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,"Is there really anything to say about Tracy Chapman, but she is a great singer. I like her music alot."
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,This haunting sound stays with you  even after the song ends. I love beign able to have just the songs I like with out buying the whole album.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,"I love Tracy Chapman. All of her songs have such meaning, but this one held even more for me because it really was about what I was experiencing. It's a very powerful song."
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button."
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,classic
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,awesome
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,Classic
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,5,I am a fan Paramore and this is one of their many songs I enjoy listening to. Definitely a good buy.
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,4,"I have always liked Paramore, so this is a pumpin breakout song that really just sticks with you when you want to hear a awesome song"
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,4,Give it up for Paramore. the did it again with misery Business. Every time i hear them the more i want to.
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,5,I really enjoy this song! I'm so happy I bought it because now I can put it on my iPod!
,B0011Z0YF4,1,1,4,"I like this song but I don't know why. I have had this song for a while now and I'm not sick of it yet. So, maybe you will like it too."
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,Still love this music all these years later.  Glad I found it.  Please keep adding to your library and I will keep buying.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,I love the melody- especially the chorus and the words tell a story i can relate to. And Tracy has a beautiful voice.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,one of my great songs i had to have and purchased twice first was on another music service then on amazon which gave a good deal on fast car and some others i purchased. i would recommend amazon to some of my friends for some good deals if they didn't know about amazon.
,B0011Z4Z3G,1,1,5,I love this song from Tracy Chapman and it sounds beautiful. I ordered it and receive it through the Cloud Player at Amazon and it is friendly to use. I highly recommend it. Thank you so much!
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,I seriously don't know what I can add to the greatness that was Ben E. King. Stand By Me is a classic.
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,ben has his own sound
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,What a great song.  Lives on through the ages.
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,Always a good song
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,"Love this song. It is a classic. Had to have it for my workout playlist & my everyday playlist.
This song means so much to me, my late sister & I used to sing it to each other as she was sick. I told her I would always Stand By Her."
,B0011Z4X9C,1,-1,3,Great song
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,good song.
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,"Love this song, this is that old school, real love that only death and than again not even death could break."
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,Classic good music.  Great quality after all these years.
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,"I brought this song because it's  a classic and I like it.  This song has stood the test of time, it was a great song back in the day and it's a great song today.  Add this one to your collection. Ben E. King is gone but the song lives on."
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,"Always brings back memories, Gret Memories."
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,4,"It is so sad that whenever someone who has been so talented and underrated passes away, and no one really knows him just beyond what one song that everyone really is about. Ben E. King was one of those singers. Sadly, Ben E. King passed away at the age of 76. He honestly has been known for R&B in so many hits with The Drifters, but honestly there is only one song that everyone really knows him for, Stand By Me. The song is a very dear song that really has stood the test of time. It really is a very down to Earth song that really is simple and just says a whole lot from the heart. I still enjoy listening to this song whenever I feel down and just out. It is one of those songs that really has stayed with the corners of the Earth, covered so many times by others like John Lennon, and really will never get old. If you have never heard a great, simple song this is one worth listening too. R.I.P. Ben E. King.

Ben E. King 1938-2015

Song: B+"
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,Another GREAT song!
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,This song and this man are good stuff.
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,Classic!! No one does it better than Ben E. King!!
,B0011Z4X9C,1,1,5,"It's hard to review music, because it is such a 'personal taste' thing, but I like this."
,B0011Z4ZCC,1,1,5,Gotta love this duet between Michael and Nelly.  The blend of music and their voices makes it a magical piece.
,B0011Z2Y7A,1,1,5,"Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good."
,B0011Z2Y7A,1,1,5,"What can I say?  One of their earliest hits and featured in the movie The Coneheads. If you love 90s music, you will like this."
,B0011Z2Y7A,1,1,5,Who doesn't love mp3's
,B0011Z2Y7A,1,1,5,"I have only heard one version of this song and it's on this Greatest Hits album. It is not a live or concert version, it's the same one you hear on the movie ""Coneheads."""
,B0011Z2Y7A,1,1,5,"The rating I give is based on how much I like the song.  My opinion

I don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.

But youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.

I guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs."
,B0011Z2Y7A,-1,1,5,Not sure why they want this reviewed.. It's a song. I knew what I was getting and that's what I got..  ????
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,This song brings back great memories for me & I'm glad I was able to put it on my MP3 player.  It takes me back to some really good times.
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,"This is her best song. I like all the songs on her greatest hits album. All the songs on that album are good,but this is her best."
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,"I love this song and the sound quality is amazing. The sound is crisp and clear, and the balance is just right."
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,4,Like it.
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS SONG....PERFECT
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,GREAT SONG FROM THE PAST
,B0011Z3F8M,-1,1,5,e
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,"As expected
Fast arrival. Good price!"
,B0011Z3F8M,1,-1,3,Humorous lyrics....it is rumored that she was talking about James Taylor
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,4,Classic song....the volume is a bit low but maybe to be expected since it's an old song.
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,I used to sing along in the car when I was so small I could barely walk.
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,You guys are so great!!
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,classic!
,B0011Z3F8M,-1,-1,1,didnt order this
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,its good
,B0011Z3F8M,1,-1,3,Good song
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,Great song. So had to have it for my music collection. Find it on Amazon and downloaded it for a nice price
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,One of the few songs from the 1970s worth listening to. Reminds me of Army basic training where I heard it first.
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,"One of the best break-up songs along with These Boots Are Made For Walking, this was a great laugh at the concert."
,B0011Z3F8M,1,1,5,"Because I've always liked that song. It reminds me of the 70's which is the decade I grew up in. Carly Simon
is a great singer. I remember the Heinz Ketchup commercial from years ago and they played ""Anticipation""."
,B0011Z4XF6,-1,-1,3,alright so this isn't there only good song they have lots most i cant even name but these peppers are hot you no what i mean
,B0011Z4XF6,-1,1,5,Not sure why they want this reviewed.. It's a song. I knew what I was getting and that's what I got..  ????
,B0011Z4XF6,1,1,5,I downloaded this to add to a bizaar collection of music for a Christmas party.  Everyone loved the different genres offered.
,B0011Z4XJ2,1,1,5,hearing this will bring you back to the place and time you first heard it. it was used in superbowl 47 in a commercial too but a different version
,B0011Z4XJ2,-1,1,4,"I must say that I am not particularly familiar with the Goo goo dolls but I really like this cover of Supertramp's ""Give a little bit"". It is a bit more of a rock version with driving guitars and not-so ethereal vocals."
,B0011Z4XJ2,1,1,5,This cover of a great Supertramp song is given new life and snap by the Goo Goo Dolls. It remains True to the original while imparting a heavier vocal and instrumental feel typical of the Goo Goos. The mid-song guitar riff is a bit heavier. I actually prefer the vocals on this version as the Supertramp vocalist seems a bit twangy to me. Additionally there are a few syncopations that add variety and spark to this version.
,B0011Z4XF6,1,1,5,Sounds like an MP3 digital file.
,B0011Z4XF6,1,1,5,"Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good."
,B0011Z4XF6,1,1,5,Perfect... Thanks!
,B0011Z4XF6,1,1,5,what can I say these boys here had to get mixed in with the music because its only right ..
,B0011Z4XF6,-1,1,5,I really think reviewing songs are worthless. It's a song and if I didn't like it I would not have purchased it.
,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,5,Love Prince and all of his music. This is one of my favorite songs by him.
,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,5,great

,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,"Another 90's masterpiece from Seal, I love this song because rhythm it delivers. A cool song from a great musician from the 90's."
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,"I happen to be familiar with the song Crazy by Seal because it played a lot on local radio (near where I lived) during the 1990s and the song would also play on VH1.  Im taking the song Crazy by Seal to mean being less rigid when it comes to how a person approaches life, but once again I understand that this dance/pop song could mean something else."
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,One of the best seal!!!!
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,Great rock ballad from my younger years.
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,"Have been a Seal fan since first hearing him on the radio in the states.  I feel he gets better and better with each new release. Nothing can hold back real talent and Seal has that in abundance, as he has shown time and time again."
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,I loved this song since forever but never really knew how sang it.  It has a lot of bass but it's smooth.  Love this song.  It is my current earworm.
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,"wonderful, wonderful song. Great song to inspire people &help them through their day by listening to  MY SHOW ON KGLP.ORG  Don't worry, be happy! show."
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,I really would recommend this cd and song. I am glad amazon has this option to download music from them and also a cloud player so I can hear them for life.
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,"I know this song is from the 90's, but its still good.  I always did like Seal...hope to hear more from him."
,B0011Z5IIM,1,1,5,"I sang and dance with this song a lot, when I get my first car (1982 VW bettle) after installing a sound system, this was the first song played on it."

,B0011Z4YB4,-1,1,5,memories
,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,4,"There is no words to describe the tragic news of today that Prince had passed away at age 57. With a set of deviating deaths in R&B legends we've lost this year with Natalie Cole, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire, but honestly no death is more shocking and sad than the passing of Prince. The guy not only was brilliant, but his sound and song with R&B, funk, jazz and Rock is and will always transcend beyond boundaries in the way that David Bowie kept rolling with the tides years earlier. The guy really had so many memorable, that he had kept changing with time and everyone followed so deeply with the punches, and not bashing him at heart. When Doves Cry is one of his deepest songs from Purple Rain. The song still ignites aflame that can definitely showcase his sensuality in song, with a deep soul from his heart that really showed his sensitivity in song. There will never be a songwriter who was just as gifted, who died young. The doves are deeply crying, and that will never stop with this song.

Prince: 1958-2016

Song: B+"
,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,5,"This is one of his songs you can really feel.
When doves cry....never thought of their sound until this song was released."
,B0011Z5IFK,1,1,5,Great Workout Song. Love it!
,B0011Z5IFK,1,1,5,"Linkin Park are tha biz - if you like them then check out Devin the Dude&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smoke-Sessions-Vol-1/dp/B00142RX4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1</a>- his first release since leaving Rapalot and his first album to hit The Billboard Charts"
,B0011Z5IFK,-1,1,4,"First off, while this song may have a close structure to a certain U2 song, it wouldn't be the first time a good song sounded like a good song, Boulevard of Broken Dreams-Wonderwall? What about Take Me Out-Paralyzer? The point is, not a big deal.

So anyways, the song has a nice buildup. It is a little slow, and the payoff may be less than satisfying, but Linkin Park is clearly going for a soft rock sound, to go in some background somewhere. Some people may like the sound, like soft rock fans, but fans of Linkin park will be like, WTH? ""In The End"" this is not. The vocals suit the song, the lyrics are good. Are they trying to go for a love song or something?

Overall, try first, maybe buy if you like. For me, it's just another song on radio I could really care less about. And definitely not one you want to hear all the time. Maybe every once in a while, but that's it."
,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,5,One of my favorites
,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,5,It's Prince! Always good stuff!

,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,I love this song and was so happy to get it at such a great price. I will be shopping here more for my music.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,I remember the first time I heard this song. I was waiting for a friend at the mall when I heard it over the radio. I have loved this song since then. It makes me think of being 13 again and having fun in the summer sun.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,4,"It is hard to believe that Seal is celebrating his 20th anniversary since his debut album right now. While he has had a lot of highs, musically and personally, the past several years have been very hard for him. With his marriage to Heidi Klum ending, and his albums not as strong as they used to be, he seems to be at a personal crossroads in his life. Nothing he has done in music has ever had the impact he made with Kiss From A Rose, from the Batman Forever soundtrack and off his second self-titled album. The song is still his biggest opus that is just as good today, as it was when it came out in 1994. It definitely is a great download if you are new to Seal's music, or if you want to hear what a real voice is like, and not something that is weighed down. Hopefully, Seal can come out with something as distinctive as he did back then.

Song: B+"
,B0011Z5IJG,-1,1,5,I don't really care for his music but I cannot get enough of this song.  Up there where the air is rare.  Great harmony and spectacular performance on this one track.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,"Im not really sunshine and roses, so I love this song it just is awesome."
,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,5,"*sigh* This is Prince. Of course, I think it is awesome. I would not have purchased it if I didn't."
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,This song tells of a love I seek.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,Classic we all sing along with in the car.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,Very happy with this purchase!
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,4,Great song!!!
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,"This is the first song I heard from Seal, and love it :). If any of you remember this was part of the Batman 2 soundtrack, with 2 face. I don't think there is any song from Seal that has been disappointing. It is a recommended hit, you will love it."

""I'm just a little unwell...""

,B0011Z4WOI,1,1,5,This song brings back memories but it's still as good now as it was then. Definitely just as catchy and fun.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,Very good song
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,Excellent chill music

,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,"Yeah, I wanted to hear this song, since I loss my CD, then, I remember! AMAZON! Great sounds! I am enjoying as I type! Rate a 5plus!"
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,one of the best songs ever!
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,"With just about every movie where there's a love interest, there's a love song.
Well when ""Batman Forever"" was released, my three sons raved about this song. With the franchise changing Batmans like the four seasons, my sons like most kids were into it (so was their mother).
Seal's range of vocal talent is very versatile on this one. He sings sweetly & calm, then gradually crescendos to his full range of expression.
I love the Circus sound @the intro, to a guitar solo with violins soaring & swelling to the choral part.
I believe there is a sound of a harpsicord, electronic or not, lovely.
His lyric of ""compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey"" brings it home for me.
The bridge of the song is testament to that. A beautiful tribute to any woman who listens to it, with a British seaside imagined by only the way Seal can give it to us. Makes me feel as though I myself has bloomed."
,B0011Z5IJG,-1,1,5,Eric
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,This was a favorite of mine 20 yrs ago when it was first released & it remains a classic today.  Love this song.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it...
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,always love this song
,B0011Z4Y6E,1,1,5,This is such a cute song! It worked perfectly for the wedding slideshow I used it for. I found nothing wrong with it whatsoever. I was very pleased with the quality.
,B0011Z4Y6E,-1,-1,3,"Let's face it, Mr. Bubl&eacute; is the Frank Sinatra of today, and he's darn good at it. And in a world where half-hearted covers of Sinatra and others are common by half-hearted sell-outs trying to make a buck, Mr. Bubl&eacute; puts them all to shame. And it's not just his covers which are good, his originals are great too; ""Home"" was an awesome love song. However, this song seems to fall for the most part, flat. While Bubl&eacute;'s vocals are still as charming and brilliant as ever, the song itself could have been better. It's a simple song saying, you guessed it, you're my everything. Pretty darn simple to say the least. And while you could complain all day about how light and poppy the music sounds, I won't go into too much more depth than that.

So overall, not Bubl&eacute;'s best, and probably not even close. It's a light poppy tune, that keeps it very simple. Whether this is a good thing, or not, is up to you to decide, but this song isn't for people like me, who want a little bit more complexity and originality for our music."
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,"If you like Michael Buble, and if you also like oldies, then you will like this tune, I think! Buy it and see for yourself!
Ron Sheets"
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,"This is an awesome remake!  Anyone (even singles) can see themselves out on the dance floor with that special someone with this song in the background.  Fun, flirtatious, and fabulous."
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,I love this song and especially this version of it.  It gets my foot tapping and my mouth smiling.  He does a great job singing it.
,B0011Z2YZW,1,1,5,This Movie sound track was about the best Thing Prince has ever recorded. What A film / movie and what a kick but Album also. That is what Boston is well known for is great artist like Him Prince and so many others that are out there.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,"A beautiful love song. Have no idea what the lyrics mean, but it is truly heart-wrenching."
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,4,"A nice remake of a good old song. Seal has a great voice, I really am in tune with songs of the type, soft and smooth and slow. Seal puts it out there and it's good. But I am really glad that He and Heidi broke up She's way to good for him.."
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,"I love this track!  I heard it on Pandora and just had to buy it.  This song played on the radio during the happiest years of my childhood, listening to music from this time really brings me back.  This is a great track by a great artist, just buy it!"

,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,Mellow is the word.  Forget that it was on the Batman Forever soundtrack.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,4,My first introduction to Seal and his music. This is a great pop tune that is worth listening to over and over again. Definitely worth checking out!
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,4,good song from seal melodious and easy to listen to is a good addition to my music collection good song
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,Great classic seal song from batman forever. I would definitely recommend this to any retro batman movie fans or seal fans who like his music.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,I love this song.  It is very romantic and emotional.  I just had to add it to my music collection.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,I don't think anyone can really compare with Seal. This is one of the few songs I didn't get tired of when it first came out and they kept playing it on the radio.
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,"I have to admit that I don't really understand what the lyrics mean, but this is a beautifully written and performed song.  I will undoubtedly listen to it from time to time for many years."
,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,5,"Honestly, I wasn't aware of the connection to the Batman movie, but played and watched with video of movie segment and had to have it. Reminds me of a time period personally."

,B0011Z3ESI,1,1,5,I love this version of this song. Maybe a little better than the original that was sung by the band Genesis!

,B0011Z2YZW,1,1,5,Timeless classic from a music genius.

,B0011Z2Z4C,1,1,5,"Wonderful! Let's ""keep the party going!"" Even though he's gone, this one makes me smile and feel happy. (But was shocked to find out that he does not have a star on the ""Walk of Fame,"" That's a shame. Maybe it will be rectified soon."

,B0011Z2Z4C,-1,1,5,He is a star
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,"Michael Buble has to be an al time favorite singer of mine.  I had seen a video of Jeremy abbott doing this song at an exibihiton for skating , I knew i need to get it cause I loved it."

,B0011Z4Y6E,1,1,5,"I wasn't familiar with Michael Buble, but I heard ""It's a Beautiful Day"" on the radio and liked the sound. After investigating his music a little more, I picked up a few more tracks that I like and this is one of them."
,B0011Z4Y6E,1,1,4,I am a big fan of his and have enjoyed all of his songs that I have purchased this one is no different it will be just what you are looking for at just the right time
,B0011Z4Y6E,1,1,5,I love this song!  It's lovely and he has such an amazing voice it's wonderful to listen to. I like this song best on the cd.
,B0011Z4Y6E,1,1,5,I bought this for my easy listening playlist. His voice is very soothing. I would recommend this to anyone looking to add to their easy listening playlist.
,B0011Z2YZW,1,1,5,Great song. He was truly talented.
,B0011Z2YZW,1,-1,3,"I like this song. I know it's dated but it's just got a fun vibe to it. I'm sure Prince is known for alot of music since this cd, but it's still enjoyable."

,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,"Prince is so Hot
I think new artist like the Dream and Tiec Tocc

,B0011Z4Y6E,1,1,5,glad to see that when a male artist makes a music cd they can leave their clothes on and it still sells
,B0011Z4Y6E,1,1,5,I love Michael Buble and his jazz style. I love the price of songs on amazon and will continue to come back for my future music purchases.
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,"Another great song that I heard from the movie :The Wedding Date:.  Michael does it again.  He's a wonderful singer.  Another song I purchased for my iPhone, Kindle Fire, as well as the ringtone.  It has a uplifting beat."
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,"What can I say about Michael Buble! He is the bomb! I have loved every song he ever sang. This one is actually used in the romantic comedy ""The Wedding Date"" with Dermot Mulroney and Debra Messing. I can see the scenes when I listed to this song. Love it!!!!"
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,"Great song to dance a slow waltz to. Michael Buble really sounds like he could have came from the errer of B.E. King, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin."
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,I love this old song!  It always reminds me of J-Lo and Richard Gere dancing!!  A feel-good song if there ever was one.
,B0011Z4ZGI,1,1,5,I love Michael Buble and all of his music. I love his jazz style and can't wait to get his Christmas music.
,B0011Z3ESI,-1,1,5,
,B0011Z3ESI,1,1,5,Exactly what I was expecting it to be. I am happy with my purchase.
,B0011Z3ESI,-1,-1,2,decent i suppose
,B0011Z3ESI,1,1,5,"Land of Confusion by Disturbed contains some strong hard rock music and vocals that are a respective tribute to Genesiss Land of Confusion.  I actually first heard this song around 2006/2007 when I was living in Florida and I naturally understood it to be a message to be more awake and less asleep when it comes to military and/or political matters.  However,  after researching info for a college project (around early 2010) about military conflicts between military forces from Russia and citizens in Afghanistan (during 1980s) and how it tied into the  2000s era of Afghanistan and U.S. military affairs leaves me wanting to avoid publicly saying more.  Nonetheless, Land of Confusion by Disturbed is a compelling hard rock version take on the Genesis classic Land of Confusion."
,B0011Z4YA0,1,1,5,I forgot about so many of his great songs. This is definitely a must own!
,B0011Z4YA0,1,1,5,RIP

,B0011Z3ESI,1,1,5,"I loved it! I grew up on the Phill Collins version (also Great), this one is a lot better."
,B0011Z3ESI,1,1,4,Terrific version of this song!
,B0011Z4ZZY,1,1,5,It's better than the other song w/ the same title in my opinion. It's kind of a sweetheart based tune.
,B0011Z4ZZY,1,1,4,Yeah - this was in the category of a one hit wonder - but the song is fun and in a Reggae style (though not Reggae). A good beat and fun to dance or work out to.
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,4,You have to buy and listen to it to really understand why it is such a good song.

,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,Great song
,B0011Z0WNS,-1,1,5,It's Prince!
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,GREAT SONG
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,One of my favorite Prince songs. A good aerobics tune.
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,Dynamic
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,"Love it, sounds quality is good!"
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,I forgot about so many of his great songs. This is definitely a must own!
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,I forgot about so many of his great songs. This is definitely a must own!
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,Great song! 
,B0011Z1DAO,1,1,4,...I downloaded when I was collecting all the music they played on the T.V. show Miami Vice.  The music on Miami Vice was great - including the instrumental stuff by Jan Hammer...
,B0011Z1DAO,1,1,4,"I am not a Clapton fanatic. As a guitarist growing up in the 70s, I was inundated with Clapton fanatics and all that. I like his work, I don't think ALL of it is great. In face, I think some of it is repetitious. That is just me. Eddie can do that too.

But this song I think is a strong showing of his talent for adding a Blues style to a good pop song. His lead throughout the song is like another singer singing along with his. Good tone, arrangement, production, etc. Great but for the price here at Amazon."
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,Prince...none like him!
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,A great song by a great artist. He will be missed.
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,"This entire album speaks for itself. Every, single song on this album (Purple Rain), is great, including this one. This song is one of the stand outs."
,B0011Z0WNS,-1,1,5,no comment
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,"I Would Die 4 U by Prince is a very romantic 80s pop/dance song.  He makes it clear to whoever he dedicated this song to that he prefers to not be known as a conventional label to them, but that he does care enough about them to go to great lengths for them (obviously I understand that this song by Prince does not mean that a person would do literally anything, especially too dangerous, in the name of love but rather they are willing to go to great lengths and dramatic measures to please the person the love."
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,4,Gotta love Prince
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,"Priceless,timeless, classic music. Prince is the best!"
,B0011Z0WNS,-1,1,5,Hit
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,I love this song
,B0011Z0WNS,-1,1,5,I am what you don't understand
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,"This is a timeless song that's fun and alive! I mean, who doesn't love Prince? I don't know of such a person..."
,B0011Z0WNS,1,1,5,"I was certain that I would never be able to own this music ever again, but Amazon.com had it. I made the purchase and it was easy and fast. I would recommend them to anyone interested in retrieving the music of their life."
,B0011Z5IJQ,1,1,5,Great heavy metal band!
,B0011Z5IJQ,1,1,5,Heard it on the radio and iHeart radio a good bit before I finally decided to add it to my collection. Great song!
,B0011Z5IJQ,1,1,5,Love it!
,B0011Z5IJQ,1,1,5,"Great song...why else would one pay to download it??? Why do they ask these questions??? Sometimes, I don't get amazon!!!"
,B0011Z5IJQ,1,1,5,Anyone can tell ya this song does not disappoint. Really gets the blood pumping!! If ya want to kick things up a notch this is definitely the song!!
,B0011Z5K76,1,1,5,great oldies
,B0011Z5K76,1,1,4,Great song for memory lane. Bring back memory of the old days good for easy listening on nice day or on a long ride.
,B0011Z4ZVI,1,1,4,I wanted this version of the song I saw on video when it was released originally;  the one with Sheena Easton.
,B0011Z4ZVI,1,1,5,Can't deny Prince. I bought these so I could play them in my car while I car-pooled with my co-worker who loves Prince.
,B0011Z4ZVI,1,1,5,"Prince and one of my top 4 female artist of the 80's Sheena Easton teamed up with Prince to make this a hit. I loved it so much. The video is great.  Thanks Prince and Sheena. was fascinated by Sheena easton, Laura Branigan, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper. They were the 80's."
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,"IN THE END: 5/5

Everyone and their mothers know a couple of lyrics in this song. This song was probably one of the nails in the Nu Metal genre's coffin. It is the best song on Hybrid Theory, and because of it, it was played over and over and over and over and over again . . . it was one of the catalysts in the Nu Metal extinction event. Bravo!"
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,"Great tune, awesome lyrics, great band. The song almost yanked words out of my head.  Truly enjoy when I can relate to others similar circumstances.  Cannot listen to song enough. Enough said!"
,B0011Z4XTC,1,1,4,"Great old song from a great man from our canadian neighbors up north, brings back a lot of old memories"

,B0011Z4ZVI,-1,1,5,What can I say it's PRINCE !
,B0011Z4ZVI,1,1,5,"Anyone who knows the work of the artist formally known as, known, this album was one of his best, this single included, giving us multiple hits from this album (singles) and some of his best work. Like the saying goes, there are many Kings and Queens, but only one Prince."
,B0011Z4ZVI,1,1,5,"Hands down one of the Best songs Prince has ever done. When I was hitting the clubs, this was the song we used to get ready with. This song brings back some good memories. Prince was one of a kind."
,B0011Z4ZVI,1,1,5,I am a huge Prince fan.  This is a classic song.  May his soul rest in peace.
,B0011Z4ZVI,1,1,5,"Great !  It is PRINCE, what more is there to say !"

,B0011Z4WT8,-1,1,5,"""In The End""

(It starts with one)
 One thing I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To explain in due time
 (All I know)
 Time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down to the end of the day
 The clock ticks life away
 (Its so unreal)
 Didnt look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on but didn't even know
 I wasted it all just to watch you go

 I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time when...

 I tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end
 It doesn't even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end
 It doesn't even matter

 One thing, I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To remind myself how
 I tried so hard
 In spite of the way you were mocking me
 Acting like I was part of your property
 Remembering all the times you fought with me
 Im surprised it got so (far)
 Things aren't the way they were before
 You wouldnt even recognize me anymore
 Not that you knew me back then
 But it all comes back to me
 In the end

 You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...

 I tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end
 It doesnt even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end
 It doesnt even matter

 I've put my trust in you
 Pushed as far as I can go
 For all this
 Theres only one thing you should know
 I've put my trust in you
 Pushed as far as I can go
 For all this
 Theres only one thing you should know

 I tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end
 It doesnt even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end
 It doesnt even matter"
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,This is one of Linkin Parks best song defiant buy if you like them highly recommend this song is awesome!!!
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,how do you relate to writing about a song you buy you buy it because you want the song sometimes this stuff is silly but whatever
,B0011Z4WT8,-1,1,5,I had no other reason to get this song other than I was thinking of another Linkin Park song and thought hay this one is not bad either.
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,"I love the artist and the whole tone and mood of the song, a definite buy that will remain popular even when the song is considered to be vintage."
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,"This song has been basically my self evaluation song on how I've lived my life and what it means to actually have done something. If you need a song to motivate your sense of accomplishment, I would ask that you give this song a chance, you might actually like it."
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,downloaded this song on my laptop and it is a very clear and good download. burnt it to a disc and I listen to it all the time.
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,"I let my oldest Grand Daughter Down load some of the tunes she is really into or shares a like interest in, she likes all kinds of Musik like her Grand Dad ha ha , even go to a few concerts with her for her Favorite bands."
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,4,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,4,I know this song because we have all walk a mile in this shoes.  if you have not then you have not lived.
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,"I Love this song and all on Linkin Park's songs....They have an awesome way they mix they songs, I will but more soon!"
,B0011Z4WT8,1,1,5,My daughter likes this band and wanted to download it to her mp3 which worked well and she listens to it all of the time.
,B0011Z52A6,1,1,5,This is a must have for any music collection.  You won't be disappointed with this great download. I highly recommend.
,B0011Z52A6,1,1,5,If you love 60's music this is a must have for your collection.  CSN had a lot of great hits and this is just one of them.
,B0011Z52A6,1,1,5,"What else can I say... this is an acoustic classic and lyrical masterpiece of epic proportions, period... no matter what genre you might favor. Also, a favorite by many to play on acoustic. And for those of you that may not be familiar with these guys, it's Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young not what's shown under the title."
,B0011Z52A6,1,1,5,"One of my all-time favorites from one of my all-time favorite bands, from an era where they were trying to lift people up, not bring them down. Great song, great lyrics, and great harmonies; something to treasure. This was one of the first ""supergroups"" comprising of very talented people from different bands merging to make the most of their talents."
,B0011Z52A6,1,1,5,"The words are timeless. And great harmony. It 's on all my playlist. This song rings True. My parents are in their 80s.
They taught me to love. It 's my time to let them know, we will continue the cycle."
,B0011Z4ZDQ,1,1,4,"Always hearing this song on the radio, and really did not want to purchase it for the full price. instead i got it cheap. Like this Green Day song and their music. Can't go wrong with Green Day"
,B0011Z4ZDQ,-1,1,5,"Twenty years ago, at the end of 1994, MTV counted down 100 music videos of 1994 and gave the number one video position to the song Basket Case by Green Day from the CD Dookie. I used a magnifying glass to study the picture art on the cover of the CD jewel case and found the caption: twisted dog sister. The blimp in the upper left corner of the picture on the CD cover has the message: BAD YEAR. The CD is round and does not have the entire message, but the art on the CD itself clearly has bombs that are called DOOKIE. This CD was released in 1994 during the transition from January to February, so MTV had many opportunities to play the song Basket Case during the year 1994, and I think a special thrill was beheld internally at the idea of giving myself the creeps and my mind plays tricks on me. Basket Case was the Martin Luther Stonehood of 1994 expressing itself in punk rock, and people who have forgotten are like Americans who lack Hegel circling the present with the depth of its past."
,B0011Z4ZDQ,1,1,5,Great
,B0011Z4ZDQ,1,1,5,Love Green Day love this song very much and I would highly recommend it to all that love their music.
,B0011Z4ZDQ,1,1,5,"I love the artist and the whole tone and mood of the song, a definite buy that will remain popular even when the song is considered to be vintage."
,B0011Z4ZDQ,1,1,5,You can relate to this song depending on your own life's experience. I don't know anyone who was never a basket case. Do you?
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,I recently purchased prince/lets go crazy from the amazon store and downloaded it to my kindle fire/hd and enjoy listening to it with my personal headphones.
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,4,"Gets me over & through the hump , while doing cardio machines

I actually need the driving beat to push me up over & beyond"
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,"how good to get music in such a simple easy manner, plus these songs were part of  bonus points so they were free, though the original price of .99 is a bargain, cheaper than 45's in the day."
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,This song along with the entire album is well worth the download and minimum cost to own. Would suggest this to all listeners
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,How could you not love Prince? His voice and wicked great skills on guitar make this album a must have for any True 1980's fan!
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,I like the classic Prince and was able to see his last tour forever and was taken back by his talent. Then man is phenomenal and the women go crazy for his music!!! This is a musty have classic Prince song to add to you MP3 catalog!!
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,True to Prince and his old self.  Reminds me of when my sons were young and loved Prince. Brings back fond memories.
,B0011Z3ETW,1,1,5,"I really know nothing about Cream. Always had the impression they were kind of dull, but I enjoyed this song in the BBC programme, Life on Mars, enough that I had to have it on my iPod."
,B0011Z3ETW,1,1,5,I like the older songs they are easy to listen to and understand what they are saying and I also like the band Cream.
,B0011Z3ETW,1,1,5,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."

,B0011Z3ETW,1,-1,3,In the white room with black curtains at the station....Classic Rock at its finest. I used to jam out to it on vinyl when I was young.
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,You have to buy this song it is very good. And the beats in the songs are also great.
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,I like it
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,good purchase
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,"This was an important part of my teenage years.  I think this is my favorite Prince song of all time.  Whenever I hear, ""Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life"" and I have to stop whatever I'm doing and play along.  This gets weird when I'm driving."
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0011Z3ETW,1,-1,1,"I love this song, but I never got it. I wish that I had."

,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,"The song itself is a favorite for its funk-rock energy, but the absolutely tortured guitar solo that winds up the tune -- you know, the one where it sounds like the guitar itself is screaming its guts out and the amplifier is about to detonate like a bomb -- is absolutely one of the greatest ever."
,B0011Z74IE,1,1,5,"This is Prince ""LET'S GO CRAZY LET'S GET NUTS. I wonder of all the songs this man did that are locked up in vaults and never released how many more exceptional hits would he have. He also wrote song s for many other performers."
,B0011Z5KBC,-1,-1,3,Not one of my favorites Clapton songs but I bought this song for a friends daughter's funeral who passed away recently.
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,Good
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,Was a simple download with no complications afterwards.
,B0011Z5KBC,-1,1,5,Bring me to tears
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,I have always like Eric Clapton
,B0011Z75H4,1,1,4,"I like this song too. It sounds like a comforting song. I think everybody needs a hug sometimes. ""Good song""."
,B0011Z75H4,1,1,5,"Don't listen to this with a broken heart, it will just make you want the person even more.
Soulful voice, simple words, from the heart."
,B0011Z75H4,1,1,5,"Tracy Chapman is one of a kind. Her music, singing and playing is, to put it simply, beautiful. This song crosses cultures, a favorite of my Batswana friends as well as Americans, and stirs the soul."
,B0011Z74B6,1,1,5,Modern alternative music at its best.  This song is a must for your portable electronic player's playlist.
,B0011Z74B6,1,1,4,I like this. Nice beat
,B0011Z74B6,1,1,5,It is a thought - provoking song about what is happening with the youth. It has a catchy tune too.
,B0011Z74B6,1,1,5,youth of the nation is an amazing song!! POD WAS AWESOME AT UPROAR FESTIVAL !! They are a Christian rock band that play great music
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,great song for our photo memorial for my dear friend
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,love this man
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,awesome
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,Great song.
,B0011Z5KBC,-1,1,5,Blast from the past!!!
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,God Bless
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,4,Heartfelt song
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,Very good song Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton.  I recommend this song.
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z760U,1,1,5,"One of my All-Time favorite songs by him...

He passed on today, Thursday April 21 2016 - at the age of 57."
,B0011Z760U,1,1,5,Love this song
,B0011Z760U,1,1,4,Prince is a good artist but most of all he can really play the musical instruments.  He should make more songs but I am sure that he is enjoying his life.
,B0011Z760U,1,1,5,"Old school music is the way to go when you want to hear True, clean talent. I love all of Prince's music, movies and videos which I hope to start collecting (the video's). I already have most of his music."
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,Beautiful from the heart song.
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,It was one of my mother's wishes to have this song played at her funeral service.  I'm glad I was able to download it and include it in her slide show presentation.
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,Love it!
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,Great song with a lot of personal meaning to me... the sound quality doesn't take away from the meaning either.  Great download get it now!!!
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,used a song for a funeral
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,Beautiful and sad.
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,4,"Religion has been the institutional way in which culture attempts to keep this kind of thinking alive. I sang in church choirs at some stages in life and wanted to do the Bob Dylan song I Shall Be Released during a church service before I did his gospel songs like When He Returns. Dreams and movies with fantasies of high places or falling through space invoke the kind of death that Tears In Heaven is a response to suitable for brains to latch onto. If life gives you lemmings, play some lemming music."
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,"I have heard the song many times before, but did not know the depth and sorrow of the song and why it was written.  After learning the tragic story and the healing process that hopefully helped Eric Clapton and the child's mother get through; I wanted to have it in my collection.  The song and music stirs emotions in all of us as to how precious and fragile life really is, and how we should love and appreciate one another with what God has given us."
,B0011Z5KBC,1,-1,3,"Used for memorial video after loved one's death, and it worked great.  The family loved it and found it very comforting."
,B0011Z5KBC,-1,1,4,I'm a lover of this type of music. I get the MP3 downloads which hasn't been the best with Amazon's Downloading device this past 4 months which is why I knocked a star off.
,B0011Z760U,1,1,5,"The very first prince song I ever heard and once it passed through my earlobes, I was an immediate fan.  If you only know of his stuff from 1999 on, then you owe it to yourself to add this and many of his earlier hits.  When Prince passed this was the 1st song I added to my digital collection and out of all the great Prince songs, I have listened to this one the most."
,B0011Z760U,1,1,5,This tune is the bomb and the sound quality is very good.
,B0011Z7696,1,1,5,One of Prince's best ballads that I don't feel he gets enough credit for. Wish more people knew about this song.
,B0011Z7696,1,1,4,"This is heavy funk, and very juicy with vocals,  the female vocalist in this jam belts it out very hard, while still maintaining the meaning and the rhythm of soul."
,B0011Z760U,-1,1,5,#DOPECLASSICALBUM!!
,B0011Z760U,1,1,5,Great music love getting my music from Amazon MP3
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,"Love the melody.  Enjoy Eric Clapton, but this song helps with peace of loosing a daughter.  I don't believe there are tears in heaven, as it's our eternal place as a Christian."
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,"This is one song on my list of favorites.  It's so sad, but so beautiful.  This is another good pick to keep on your mp3 devises."
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,"Under such  horrific pain a beautiful song was wrote and sung by one of my favorite singers, I loved it the fist time I heard it and still do."
,B0011Z7696,1,1,5,A beauty from his Princeness!
,B0011Z7696,1,1,5,such an great album...
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,This has always been one of my favorite songs.  I purchased it after our minister used it in his sermon.  It downloaded easily and plays great on my Kindle Fire.
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,We got this song to use in a DVD Memorial for my son's father who passed away from cancer.  My son picked it put.
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,5,"This is one of those songs that when I heard it, I had to learn to play and sing.  Eric may not have much of a voice, but his delivery is so good."
,B0011Z5KBC,1,1,4,"...written after a tragedy in Eric Clapton's life.  For him, it was about the loss of his son.  For me, it was about the love I had for my little boys and how I worried about something ever happening to them..."
,B0011Z2YKW,1,1,5,I love being able to pick the individual songs I want rather than ordering an entire album.  Love this song!
,B0011Z2YKW,1,1,5,Most beautiful words ever written sung by a beautiful voice. Hearing this song always brings tears to my eyes. Always!
,B0011Z2YKW,1,1,5,Perfect Download!!! Love this song and there were no problems downloading it. Thank you amazon for having another one of my favorite old songs
,B0011Z5KP8,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z5KP8,1,1,5,"I don't know why, but this song feels profound.  I love it.  I almost didn't buy it because the Nickelback concert I wanted to go to got cancelled while Chad Kroger dealt with his drunk driving in Canada."
,B0011Z76GE,1,1,5,Great song
,B0011Z76GE,1,1,5,"This is great for Zumba and just fun to dance to.
(they want nine more words for this post, that is just silly)"
,B0011Z76GE,1,-1,1,"I was a cashier on Junior's 4th floor shoes at Macy's Herald Square in Manhattan.  I had mad fun, actually working at my favorite department store.  There was this playlist that played nonstop.  This was one of the tunes on it. Sean Paul is mad fine.  A spanish guy from Jamaica.  Dancehall had come in style since I was a high school student.  One of the names mentioned in the song is ""Rebekah,"" that's me, which is why I love it.  ""Rebekah, Joanna, Donna, Annabella, and Jodi.""  These are the names of the sexy women he mentions in ""Get Busy.""  I don't know if ""Kana Kana"" counts as a name.
The beats in ""Get Busy"" are pretty fast, terribly abrupt, and choppy. There is that syncopated constant short clap beat throughout the song in addition to that daydream um....sound.  He rhymes pretty fast.  Jamaican patwa is quick.  He says, ""it's all good girl,"" making it a feel good song.  Sean Paul is good peoples!"
,B0011Z5K94,1,1,4,...I downloaded this song to round out my collection of music they played on the T.V. series Miami Vice.  The music on the show was great.  You'd be surprised how many people collected it - including the instrumental music on the show by Jan Hammer...
,B0011Z5K94,1,1,5,I love me some slow hand.  Need i say more.  this man is a legend and I love this song
,B0011Z74C0,1,-1,3,thanks
,B0011Z74C0,1,1,5,I love Michael. I owe a lot of his music and this one did not disappoint!
,B0011Z74C0,1,-1,3,"This was a gift, so I cannot comment."
,B0011Z74C0,1,1,4,Like it!
,B0011Z74C0,1,1,5,"This modern day Sinatra-like artist always delivers. This song is no different! Perfect song to lighten a sad day, to sing on the way to work in the morning, to play for a friend after a break-up, or to clean the house to! Enjoy!"
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,"The gang who backed Elvis and other favorites on their 60s recordings also came up with this True Memphis classic. Takes me back to days when soul music had soul and r & b had a lot of blues in it. Raw, catchy, haunting."
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,"I have loved this song since hearing it in the soundtrack of American Graffiti. Great instrumental, one of the great rock and roll oldies."
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,"This song has been used for so many commercials, etc... It's been over 50 years and still I never grow tired of it! Small wonder.. Booker T... Steve Cropper... Donald ""Duck"" Dunn!!"
,B0011Z77TA,-1,-1,2,"Great song, but after downloading this song I noticed that there was background noise on this particular download. (Tried the download 2 different times)

I called Amazon and they gave me a credit and said they would notify me when the problem was fixed.

Two months and I have not heard anything yet."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"I'm not a big fan of todays music! But I love this song ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley,a great fun song with catchy hooks!!! A+"
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,4,"I can't remember which summer was dominated by this hit... 2006? But anyways, it became a hit for good reason, the lyrics are witty, interesting, and original. The vocals work rather well with the song, and the music seems to although fit rather nicely with the song.

So overall, one of those songs that comes out of nowhere and surprises you. And this song is surprising. If you have never heard it before, you might want to give it a try. But, some will not like it, while others will love it. It's a hit or miss song.

But if you love this song, or you hate this song, give The Kook's cover of the song a try. They give it a very interesting, and unique acoustic take to the song. And, the added British vocals give the song another level of charm."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"I don't know anyone personally that was crazy about it like me...

but that's a whole different story!

This song rocks...
""cause when you're out there, without care, baby, i was out of touch...""
""but it wasn't because i didn't know enough...i just knew too much!""

love the lyrics. i guess the people that didn't like it couldn't relate.

my aunt thought it was the ""worst song ever""...

Yeah, right!!

4.5 stars.

end note: now I remember my cousin, Cita! God bless you, Cita (lol)! she liked it too! haha..."
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,"A classic, to get to the roots of rock, listen to this song."
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,Love it.

,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,"Nice blues and soul instrumental. Sit down, lay back and just listen."
,B0011Z76XW,-1,1,4,oldie and goodie
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,If this does not get your feet tapping nothing will.

,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"Love this song, I'm 79 and it makes me want to dance, never too old to be crazy! I'll!"
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,The beauty of buying a single song is that you only buy the ones you like.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Good song.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Great song
,B0011Z7L1Y,1,1,5,I recently lost my ipod with 5000 unbacked songs. This was one of the faves that I remembered and its a great start to rebuilding my collection.
,B0011Z7L1Y,1,1,5,"I like the original, and I think this remake is a brilliant take. I ever get tired of it. Also crosses generations, young and old."
,B0011Z7L1Y,1,1,5,"The first time I heard the song I bought it. Its very good.
I would recommend this song to everyone."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Hear about it on a TV show and had to have it.  Great song.son
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Good Song!
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Good song performed by a great singer.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,This song kicks. I play it loud for my crazy friends.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,one of the great songs of all time.
,B0011Z76XW,-1,1,5,This is is a classic to me and many of my friends from the era. Nothing like the instrumental of Green Onions. Never tired of it in the 60s-70s and love it today even more since there is no music anymore......... just computer generated noise.
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,"An older song, but I love the music.  It's just hard to beat and has a great sound!  I would buy this song again and highly recommend it."
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,"Have heard this played in many movies and on the radio.  I never knew the name of the song until the Xmen movie.  Once I found out the name, I had to have it."
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,"What a wonderful song to hear over and over.  This song is better today than it was back in the '60's.  We just don't have great songs like this anymore, you don't have it yet, get it."
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,I am very happy with this purchase and the product. I would even give this to friends and family who were interested in this type of product. .
,B0011Z76XW,1,1,5,This song is a classic and has stood the test of time. It should be mandatory listening for all B3 players
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Just what I wanted!!!
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Love it

,B0011Z5L98,1,1,5,"Led Zeppelin had progressed from the blues roots of ""Communication Breakdown"" to ""Fool in the Rain"". An amazing career in rock and an amazing string of albums and radio hits. Nothing they have done since has measured up to what these four gentlemen did for the rock genre."
,B0011Z5L98,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z5L98,1,1,5,"This song got a lot of radio air time due to it's ""Pop nature"" - but it's still Zeppelin at their finest. Drums are fantastic, vocals, guitars - all great. Catchy song too!"

,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Great Song. Love the beat.
,B0011Z528I,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z528I,1,1,5,This song embodied the ideals of many of the flower children -- a revolt against the complexities and dehumanization of our highly technical and speeded-up world. It's among the songs I use like some people use their favorite benzodiazepine.
,B0011Z528I,1,1,5,If you love 60's music this is a must have for your collection.  CSN had a lot of great hits and this is just one of them.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,perfect

,B0011Z76JG,1,1,5,"Thank you, thank you Amazon. Found this song in the .69 area. I'm not a poker of whole album's but this album from Nickleback is so awesome I played my CD unroll it started skipping."
,B0011Z76JG,1,1,5,Its a good song with a nice beat and its just a snappy tune. Nickelback is a very good band.
,B0011Z76JG,1,1,5,I use to have this song and then when I had to switch computers I lost some music in the process so it's nice to have this song back in my music library. I like this song.
,B0011Z77TA,-1,1,5,: )
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Very good song.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,great song!

,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,This is a great song!  Love it! Hard to sit still while listening to it! He has a unique voice.
,B0011Z77TA,-1,1,5,"Afer I downloaded another song by G. Barkley( Who's gonna save my soul) I remembered this diddy, so I got this one too. Only thing I don't like is prior song I bought was recorded very low and this one very loud, so when I use my play list have to crank one and then run back n lower volume for 2nd song, which kinda suc*s."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"This is one of my very favorite tunes. I love the tune, the word and with CeeLo singing, it's the best."
,B0011Z77TA,-1,1,5,"Love the song ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley, but couldn't remember the name of the performer.  Not to worry:  my IHOP waiter knew it right off.  I was in Gatlinburg, where my cell service was not too good.  The first time it downloaded it did not do so correctly.  So I received an email warning me of this problem.  The next time I looked (later in the day). without any further action on my part the song had downloaded perfectly."
,B0011Z0YH2,1,1,4,"December 2nd, 2009 (2:48 AM)

If you are behind the times like I was, GET INTO THIS TRACK. It is extremely hooky and even more catchy is the bridge which goes,

""Rock and Roll, baby
Don't you know that
We're all alone now
I need something to sing about

Rock and Roll (Hey!)
Don't you know, baby
We're all alone now
I need something to sing about

Rock and Roll (Hey!)
Don't you know, baby
We're all alone now
Give me something to sing about""

Might not look like much there, but it is extremely catchy.

The video must also be spoken of because although it's not super-glamorous or anything, it makes listening to the song even better. It features Hayley and the band just jammin' out, her at the mic and them on the drums and guitars just having fun in what looks like a desert.

The song itself is about a boy that Hayley is ""crushcrushcrushing"" on, and he's not there for her. Not until the bridge does he come into the picture as more than just one-way thoughts. But the song itself, I think talks about being alone and thinking of that someone that lights your fire, even if they aren't with you.

Written by Hayley Williams (lead singer) and Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals).

,B0011Z4XOW,1,1,5,love it
,B0011Z4XOW,1,1,5,Amazing!  Love it!
,B0011Z4XOW,1,1,5,Great Workout Song. Love it! v
,B0011Z4XOW,1,1,5,Another great Nickelback song
,B0011Z4XOW,1,1,5,"Love, love this song. Luckily found it in the .69 area. Wish more songs were available for .69. Was able to get several songs at this price"
,B0011Z4XOW,1,1,5,"This song is perfect for working out. I have a list of songs that are great for Spinning, Running, etc. Amazon is making me use 20 words - so... I am."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,I love this song! I always have to dance whenever I hear it. I just can't help it. Worth it.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Very awesome song to have and to listen to. Really like the lyrics and the whole beat and tune of the song.
,B0011Z77TA,1,-1,3,This is a fine song my son wanted it and thought it would be fun but once we got it he was over it.  LOL children!
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"Celo Green sings like no other artist I know of. He's original and paired with this song, his talent is flawless."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"Amazing song! I am always looking for a good song that fits my emotional needs, and one that I can easily put on repeat. Otherwise, I wouldn't have purchased it."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,4,Not crazy about his other songs but this one is very good (only one I like) but there another song but I can't find it!!
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"I had no knowledge of Gnarls Barkley (and only passing knowledge of Cee-Lo's work with Goodie Mob) when I first heard the song ""Crazy"" when watching its music video on MTV.  Talk about a stunning first impression.  This video is, essentially, a transforming Rorschach test showing morphing images of Cee-Lo singing, intermingled with fellow GB partner, DJ Danger Mouse, working the beats and a variety of other visuals.

  The captivating nature of the video gives in a good review.  When the new-style music and lyrics composed by Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo's eclectic Falsetto voice, you have one of 2006's best songs."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,4,Very good song with excellent vocals and rythym.  Lyrics get forced in a few places but overall this is good listening and is on my bigger play list.  Will investigate more of Gnarls material because of this.
,B0011Z764Q,1,-1,3,"I enjoy cultural complexities, and here is one on point for this (in)famous song. The Catholic pop music critic Mark (""Marky') White has opined that this reaches up there with the greatest human spiritual achievements in culture apparently:

In an idle moment, I busted out a few tracks from the first Batman movie soundtrack, just to re-live the time. Listening took me back to those heady days of cassette tapes, and a crystalline realization left me humbled like a man in front of Niagara Falls:

Let's reflect for a moment--

Between 1982 and 1987, Prince came out with 1999, Purple Rain, Around the World in a Day, Parade, and Sign o' the Times.

Pause. Taking it in...

Do you realize how many songs are included here that are necessary elements of the cosmos?

By my count, at least twelve.

This is the most amazing thing that has ever been done.

If the man had only produced Purple Rain, that would be the most amazing thing that has ever been done.

...Can we really doubt, you know, the Almighty Hand?

No.""

Since the author is a great fan of Thomists like Ralph McInerny, let us note that this must be another Summum Bonum."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"had to get this for my kindle fire hd,,, my friends and I love this song, and all the cd's I bought from Amazon were put on my kindle fire hd for free which is great.... thought I would use my kindle for just books,,, but love the music, games and hot love stories.. at 56  and never getting old, this song rocks  for books , songs and games see my reviews.  but this is my favorite song or at least one of them.... lol"
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,4,I like the pace and the way the song is put together it is a good listen and like it
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,One of his best!  I have to use 16 more words to talk about this order so I got it and I like it and it is on my Kindle and I will keep it forever if I can
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"I want familiar with Gnarls Barkley before CeeLo was on the voice and did this song, but I purchased it and added it to my dance playlist."
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Love this song by Gnarls Barkley. One of my all-time favorites. Don't remember when I first heard it but it captured my attention.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,I love the Amazon Cloud!  Songs download in minutes and are available to listen to.  I like being able to purchase one song and not the whole album.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"thx  + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

,B0011Z77TA,1,1,4,I know this song because we have all walk a mile in this shoes.  if you have not then you have not lived.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,This is another song from a few years ago that just had something catchy and addicting about it. Fun song.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"I love buying my music from Amazon. It's quick, it's easy and I buy only the songs that I want. Amazon is the only place I buy music."
,B0011Z77TA,1,-1,3,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,This song has been one of my favorite songs ever. I enjoy the lyrics and this mans voice in this one and only song
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,I just really like everything about this song. It has a fun sound to it and really nice lyrics. I enjoy every time I listen to it and can keep listening and listening.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,CeeLo definitely got it right with this tune.  Loved it the first time I heard it and it still sounds fresh.
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,Cee-Lo is outstanding..what more can I say.  I've been buying most of my music from Amazon lately as it is very easy to do and I don't need to download any players or what not from the other guy..i-something right?
,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"""Crazy,"" by Gnarls Barkley caught me off-guard. I did not expect to like it. It is now a favorite.

At first, it sounds like there is this easy groove, the kind found during long late night drives. Then, it gets going, and you might yourself doing the cubicle strut. You know, the boogie thing you hope no one else sees, but you have to swing with the groove?

""I remember when, I remember
I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo
In so much space.""

I fully recommend, ""Crazy,"" by Gnarls Barkley.

,B0011Z8NAM,1,1,5,"My dad has KUPL playing at work and this song pops up from time to time. I went on Amazon and there it was in all its glory. and it is so True and I really want to be on Some Beach, Some Where"
,B0011Z8NAM,1,1,4,"As always Blake can have a good time, glad to be able to download songs to my Amazon 3 cloud account ."
,B0011Z8NAM,1,1,5,"""Clever use of the common vernacular!"" The song is a fun song plus Blake's voice sounds good putting you right into the song!"
,B0011Z8NAM,1,1,5,great product had no problems with the product i would recommend to my friends and family 5 stars thank you
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,I love this song. Classic.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Love the song!
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Great Mp3.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,4,ok
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,best.song.ever. RIP.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"It's Prince, It's Purple Rain, it's Great!
This is the extended recording, it has longer guitar playing at the end."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"The album of the same name was released in 1984. Notably, this song is the full length version, not one of those chopped or butchered follow up versions, usually used by radio stations. There is not much I can add to who and what Prince Rodgers Nelson was. Any additional remarks on my part would be quite redundant. I bought the vinyl album back then and played it frequently using high end turntables connected to an audiophile grade system. Years later, I switched to high end CD players and improved analog system technology. I briefly owned the virtual Red Book CD. It sounded just as good as the vinyl, actually cleaner and with improved dynamic range. The MP3 sound quality of this version is amazingly good for this type of format. The DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) I use offsets some of the MP3 file shortfalls, so I am happy with this file. I love the song."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Timelessly haunting... love Prince
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,My husband's favorite
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"Great song, I didn't know that there was a longer version. I like a few prince songs and this one gives me the chills, it's just beautiful. He was a great songwriter and performer. He will be missed."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,great cd
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,4,great!
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Prince at his best !!!
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Good music
,B0011Z76ZK,1,1,5,"Very good download!! Song sound quality is perfect!! This is another song by Edwin that really touches the heart!! Plus my girlfriend really loves this song, so that's a extra plus!!!"
,B0011Z76ZK,1,1,5,"This is not a new song, but it is still a favorite. There aren't many singer/songwriters more talented than Edwin McCain. Love him!"
,B0011Z76ZK,1,1,5,"I love Edwin McCain's voice, and I wanted so much to have this song! I know that this is a contender for his other song ""I'll Be"" as my wedding song, but I guess I can have both played, because isn't that the prerogative of the bride!"
,B0011Z764Q,1,-1,3,ok
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,It doesn't get better than this.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"I really love this song,  this was my most favorite song by Prince"
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Always really enjoyed Prince. Have his albums. So sad he is gone.
,B0011Z74IO,1,1,5,I didn't watch the movie Rent for a long time because I knew it would be sad. But I was totally missing out on the music. I love the music from this movie. This song in particular just gets stuck in your head and you find yourself humming it all day and waiting for the next opportunity to watch the movie again and again. Absolutely wonderful song.
,B0011Z74IO,1,1,5,Still love this music all these years later.  Glad I found it.  Please keep adding to your library and I will keep buying.
,B0011Z76ZK,1,1,5,Love it!
,B0011Z76ZK,1,1,5,Great song for our wedding video
,B0011Z76ZK,1,1,5,All good.
,B0011Z76ZK,1,1,4,I love this song it's awesome . I didn't care for most of the songs on the cd but I had to get this song it reminds me of a love I just recently lost.
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,Can't deny Prince. I bought these so I could play them in my car while I car-pooled with my co-worker who loves Prince.
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,This is a rock classic from little ole Prince (he only 5 feet tall or something).  I hope the Bezos MP3 is fixed by now.  I already had it in iTunes.
,B0011Z762I,-1,-1,1,"Multiple SKIPS or DROP-OUTS, the first is at 1:05. There is an annoying POP or click sound at 2:16."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"It is Prince Rogers Nelson's original theme
song. It is beautifully written, performed,
& probably played more than ever around the
world when he passed away.
Makes one imagine ""purple rain"", a modern
& original way to define sadness other than
blue. Brilliant idea from A hometown prodigy.
He is loved, & missed."
,B0011Z74IO,1,1,5,I like this song a lot!
,B0011Z74IO,1,1,5,"Homosexuality, AIDS/HIV, Love, Struggles, Music, Friendships, Relationships, Tears, Laughter, Companionship, and, of course, Rent (the monthly crap payment due to my and your landlords is what this song ""Seasons of Love"" and the movie ""Rent"" is all about. I must admit that the movie ""Rent"" was entertaining but dragged on with a lot of singing and emotions. However, the 1 memorable thing about the movie was this song ""Seasons of Love"". Although the song is only a few minutes long, we should listen to the message and story, and consider and think about it for 525,600 minutes..."
,B0011Z74IO,1,1,5,This song is my favorite of all. It's timeless. I will listen to it even in 10 years. The cast is excellent.
,B0011Z74IO,1,1,5,"this is from the motion picture the sound is great and its def a go too feel good song
when i want up lifting..."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,ok
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,What's not to like?  Prince at his finest
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Movie was fantastic music was great
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,GREAT!
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Love this entire album.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Awesome
,B0011Z764Q,-1,-1,1,"Sorry I got this song, I do not like it at all!!"
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,Nothing could have closed one of the all-time great series than with this song.  I find it makes a great segue as I think of other facets of my life.  Good way to ring out the old...
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,4,"With all the hype of Green Day's new musical American Idiot, they definitely have been welcomed with open arms to the Broadway community with all the joys of seeing their music being well-showcased to new audiences with the rankings of Elton John and recently with the departed Frank Sinatra and the new musical based around his music Come Fly With Me. For Green Day, it also is a great time to re-introduce their classic to a new audience and that is the case with Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) from their 1997 album Nimrod. The song still absolutely stands as one of their finest works of their musical career. The song is still one of their best works from their catalog. If you haven't yet owned a Green Day song for your MP3 library, than this would be a nice place to start.

Song: B+"

,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"Best Song by Prince,RIP. He will be missed."
,B0011Z764Q,1,-1,3,"...of the 80s and Belgium.  One of my troops was a big Prince fan and he played this album when we were in the office.  I already had a couple of Prince's greatest hits albums, but this song wouldn't play because of a bad spot on the CD; so I downloaded it from Amazon to replace it on my computer."
,B0011Z762I,-1,1,5,"Um, Prince...."
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,The reason why I love Corvettes to this day.
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,It's Prince. Nothing else needs to be said.
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,Nice
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,It's Prince and Little Red Corvette is classic and timeless! '''

,B0011Z8OFG,1,-1,3,Good
,B0011Z75RE,1,1,5,"After a hiatus from music, Matchbox Twenty/20 is back in business, at least for this half best-of/ep, then it's back to the solo work. So, you could look at this as their comeback song, and it greatly tides over our thirst for everything MB20. First off, the lyrics are incredible just like they are with any MB20 song, with lyrics like, ""I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world/ but it feels just like every other morning before."" The song is catchy and well-written, and overall just well done. And even though this is a rather successful single, it doesn't really sound it. In fact, most of the best songs on their albums were singles anyhow. The bridge is also great musically, and the only thing that could get me down on this song is the chorus. While it is a great chorus for concerts, and to get you pumping, it just seems like more could have been done to it.

But overall, a great song, a great single, a great group. Here's to hoping MB20 comes back much sooner rather than later. We need new material here!"
,B0011Z75RE,1,1,4,"When it comes to acts who've made reunions this past year, most have brought the substance back to the table like Genesis and The Police. That also was said last year with Matchbox Twenty with their latest track. How Far We've Come, the first single from their 2007 Greatest Hits album Exile On Mainstream is a great song. It really shows that Rob Thomas and the group haven't lost that luster after all those years away from the music scene, and with Rob Thomas on his own with Something To Be. The song sounds refreshing, lively and feels really good. I hope Matchbox Twenty can keep making good songs like this one on their next album.

Song: B+"
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,Sounds great.
,B0011Z762I,-1,1,4,Prince :(

,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,"It's Prince, what more can I say. :)"

,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Classic
,B0011Z764Q,-1,1,5,This is Prince's anthem song that made his career what it was.  I have added this song to my Prince collection.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Great song!
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"Can't get any Prince songs on Amazon Prime Music, so had to purchase, but I love Prince, so I had to."
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,Wonderful  song.
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"This is a great song! We used it for one of the songs in a sports slide show and it turned out amazing, it is a good memories song for sure. Very clear version and clean file, downloaded flawlessly!"
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,A great artist.
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,"Can't get any Prince songs on Amazon Prime Music, so had to purchase, but I love Prince, so I had to."

,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,Prince at his best!
,B0011Z75RE,1,1,5,I really love this song! A lot of memories! Is great. Great lyric and sound. I bought and now I can listen in the cloud.
,B0011Z75RE,1,1,4,this is the best song ever. Could nor expect any more from them. Love that I can download from home.
,B0011Z75RE,1,1,5,I really enjoy this song! I'm so happy I bought it because now I can put it on my iPod!
,B0011Z75RE,1,1,5,"I would recommend this to anyone who likes music, whether they are young or old.  Great song, very upbeat and fun."
,B0011Z73E4,1,1,5,This is a great track that samples Crazy Train and brings a whole new greatness. You have no choice but to get hype when this song comes on!
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,Really like this song and play it often.
,B0011Z8OFG,-1,1,5,xlint
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"There are some songs that are timeless, this is one of those songs, and only Bette MIdler could ever do this song justice"
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"In my opinion, Bette Midler has become the owner of WING BENEATH MY WINGS.  It is a moving song that I've heard sung so many ways, most of which should be erased from existence.  Like the national anthem, some folks want to put their own style to the song.  What's wrong with letting the song be the star, and the singer the instrument to make it a quality song?  Bette doesn't play around with this one.  She sings the song in a simple fashion, letting the listener focus on the words and melody.  Brava Bette.

This is a beautiful rendition of a classic song.  I love it.  I hope you will too."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"Used in a photo slide show of my father in laws life made on his 67th birthday as a gift to reflect on the wonderful journey he has made!

Great song!"
,B0011Z764Q,-1,1,5,Ordered because I grew up listening to his music
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Greatest hit ever
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,LOVE THEM VETS
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs by prince.
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,"Great song, can't help but dance around."
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"One of the older hits, but still a good one. It isn't really about having the time of your life and how nice that was, but rather it's about regrets for having wasted the formative years and ending up in a dead-end job or relationship. The artist is saying he hopes the wasted listener had the time of his life, because that's the last of the good times. A little poetic justice as it were. You can't simply have ""the time of your life"" and subsequently hope to do better, because sooner or later the ""time"" ends and reality sets in. Best be ready for it!"
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z8OFG,1,-1,3,good
,B0011Z8OFG,-1,1,4,"Should have the starting ""screw ups"" deleted. Other than that, good song."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"What's not to love? Prince was a musical genius. I have loved him since I was a child. Born and raised in Minnesota, I feel a special connection to where his music comes from. Purple Rain is a very layered song that brings on layers of emotions. Between the instrumental genius to the lyrics and just the way that Price uses his voice as an instrument is sheer artistic genius. In a day and age where music is mostly technology, I like to turn back to the musicians who used raw talent to create these kind of masterpieces. This song is ageless. It never sounds dated. That is another thing about Prince's music I love. You can listen to this song and not tell that it is as old as it is at all. It could have been made yesterday! Beautiful song."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,A+
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,4,The song is a classic and will always be relevant
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,Prince will be missed.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"the only thing I can say is ""Genius"""
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,Great
,B0011Z762I,-1,1,4,been there done that
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,Just a sexy song sung by an even sexier man. I love Prince
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,I forgot about so many of his great songs. This is definitely a must own!
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,One of our favorite songs
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,hope you had the time of your life
,B0011Z8OFG,-1,-1,3,It was ok.
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"This is, of course, a Bette Midler classic and needs no review from me to make it a simply awesome song."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,Beautiful amazing song!
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,Great song...
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B0011Z8MIU,1,1,4,"I'll be honest, I am not a huge fan of this band. But, the couple songs of their's that I do like, I really like! And the this one, One Step Closer, really delivers!"
,B0011Z8MIU,1,1,4,What can I possibly say about this song? There isn't much you can say in a review about a song. If I didn't like it at least I wouldn't of spent money to get it.
,B0011Z8MIU,1,1,4,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
,B0011Z8MIU,1,1,4,I know this song because we have all walk a mile in this shoes.  if you have not then you have not lived.
,B0011Z8MIU,1,1,5,"ARE THEY BANGING OR WHAT.

LINKIN PARK classic.
I love to listen to this.
It is on my mp3, which I listen to at the gym

great price"
,B0011Z8MIU,1,1,4,"ONE STEP CLOSER: 4/5

Immediately after the fastest song on the album, it's followed up by the hardest one. One Step Closer was never one of my favorite songs (I've never been a very angry person in general--however, some days this song could be my best friend). But I respected the fact that even in Hybrid Theory (foreshadowing their career in general), Linkin Park could shift music styles like snapping fingers."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"Love, Love, Love it"
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,outstanding song ever
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,Good song.
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,This was a sentimental purchase.  I have a lot of Prince's later music but had never gotten around to this one.  I always liked it and now I own it!
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,One of the catchiest tunes ever. A little bit of everything that made Prince a King. This song will stick in your head all day and its not a problem. You don't need a cure.
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,Love the song-love the car. This is my favorite Prince song.
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,Love this song
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,nice song
,B0011Z8OFG,-1,1,5,REMINDS ME OF MY SKYDIVING DAYS
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,Great
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,"The song that really launched Prince to super stardom.  It is a great song, that has a little something for everyone.  Sly lyrics, some adult themes, interesting instrumentation.  It is just one of those songs that I appreciate more and more as the years go by."
,B0011Z762I,1,1,5,"One of my favorite songs by Prince, I enjoy listening to this MP3 download very much."
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"Good sound quality, it suited the purpose that I was using it for, it was used in a graduation video."
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,4,"i like the ""instant shipping"""
,B0011Z8OFG,-1,-1,1,Could not get this to download.  Kept getting error saying download failed.  This is a waste of money.  Don't buy if you want to download to your computer.
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"Brought back fond memories. This and many other songs from this time period always seem to return to my memory and make me long for some of my old friends,"
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"Is a great Song! One of my Favorite! Is perfect!
Una excelente cancion, de mis favoritas! Una obra maestra de la musica. Rock 4 ever"
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"Who doesn't love this song (and subsequently thinks of their high school prom? This song never, ever, ever gets old."
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"I heard this from a family member, and had to download it once again.  Reminds me a little of Kansas' Dust In The Wind, but with a twist.  The voice doesn't overpower the song.  A very good, balanced song."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,still the one after all these years
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"The song, The Movie are the best! One of the stars has gone. And there will be Purple Rain now that Prince Rodgers Nelson has left us. But he left us with wonderful music to listen to and a #! movie to watch if you're fortunate and blessed enough to have your personal copy. Jehovah watch over you."
,B0011Z764Q,-1,-1,1,NOT SO ROYAL PURPLE RAIN
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,I forgot about so many of his great songs. This is definitely a must own!

,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"This will always be my favorite song by Prince and the Revolution. It's not just the lyrics. The music is fantastic! He plays that guitar like he never has again. I wonder if he was apologizing to a girlfriend or sweetheart. Regardless, it was his best performance ever!!!"

,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"I love the artist and the whole tone and mood of the song, a definite buy that will remain popular even when the song is considered to be vintage."

,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,Love it
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,wonderful

,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,I love jamming out to this song in my car. It's well written and excellent to listen to everywhere and anywhere.
,B0011Z8OFG,1,1,5,"Quite poignant for a group not known for anything even in this solar system that is remotely poignant. Maybe that for its lovely
surprise. And good luck to you, Mr. Armstrong. I hear you're in tough times. Been there. Trust what you are, first."

,B0011Z8PMS,1,1,5,It is a song that very accurately describes those with a mental disorder of any kind and the heartless people who dismiss those with mental disorders who have a soul just most people in the world.
,B0011Z8PMS,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs by Matchbox Twenty.  Easy to download and add to my iTunes library and onto my ipod and phone.  Listen to it almost daily :)
,B0011Z8PMS,1,1,5,"Matchbox 20 is great at coming up with songs that will stay with you for a long time, and this is no exception.  Concerning a separation/break-up, this song is about that rather sickly feeling one can get during such a time.  Nicely done."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,4,Arrived promptly and as described
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,All I can say is GREAT song.

,B0011Z72TK,1,1,5,I love amazon!! i buy the song one time and i can use it on all my devices and i have it for life :)
,B0011Z72TK,-1,-1,1,This crappy song isn't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a$$ Target commercial that try to be hip by playing some mainstream hipster tunes
,B0011Z764Q,-1,1,5,memories
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,who doesn't love Purple Rain?
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,I have always loved this song and I know the story behind it...
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"I love Bette Midler's Wind Beneath My Wings.  When I first ordered it, I played it over and over.  It's such a moving song that I come to tears when hearing it."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,We purchased this to play at the funeral home during my Dad's viewing in honor of his love and support for all of us.
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,This is an old favorite and the singing is just wonderful. The  movie was great also but loved this song for an inspirational uplift.
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,Bette Midler is the only one that sings this perfectly.  I understand the song and have had this experience in life.  It's uplifting as well as a sad song.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,My favorite Prince's song
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"Soulful, longing, wanting, anger, frustration, etc...one of the world's best songs ever."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"Prince is an artist like no other. I went to see this movie when I was a kid, and his unique style of music, and delivery of that music will always bring a flash from the past....that, and you can never listen to perfection too much."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"I was never a big fan of Bette Midler, but she does this song as good as any other performer. I'll keep this in my library for sure."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,Always have liked this song and just decided it was time to obtain a copy to listen to at will.
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"One of the all time greats, sang by so many different artist, but always a heart grabber, it can apply to so many people!"
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,4,"This is a great song, regardless of whether or not you saw the movie ""Beaches"".  It is inspiring and emotional.  One of Bette Midler's best in my opinion."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,"We need that one special person to listen, to support us through happy moments and tragedy. The song was to be the background song for a school promotion."
,B0011Z8OFQ,1,1,5,She warms my heart with this beautiful song which has been one of my favorites for years. Buy yours today!
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,"I am putting together what I call the "" jukebox"".  It consists of tunes I grew up with from the 40's through present day.  It is a big and fun project and includes various genres from ""long hair"" to jazz.  Eventually I will get all of them on to a stick drive and have non stop music whenever I want.  All these are great tunes in my opinion."
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,Wilson Pickett was a great artist and Mustang Sally is a great song to dance too
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,You have to love the classics!
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,"It's a song track.  I like it, I wanted it, I bought it.  It is a quick way to get a single you want.  I use these as practice aids for band work.  The MP3 format is not optimum for real listening enjoyment.  In order to compress the data, a lot of tones are left out.  Even a good cassette tape outperforms this storage medium.  But it has its uses, and is inexpensive."
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,Great song for my mp3 on my Kindle Fire.  Love listening to the music.
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,"Lots of memories in this one, from working for Ford to dancing.  Love it."
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,Classic.
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,Very good listening. Classic song. Highly recommended.

,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,"This song was included in my 1995 Mustang GT convertible cassette. Finally traced it down, bought the cassette (new) through Amazon, but all my old cassette players failed.  So I bought all ten o the songs listed in cassette and this is one. Well done + great fidelity and sounds great in my 2014 Mustang convertible!"

,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,"To my ""Drive Your Car"" playlistto date this one is over 10 hours longgreat on L-O-N-G Road TripsHit The Gas!"
,B0011Z8RHQ,-1,1,4,I'm a lover of this type of music. I get the MP3 downloads which hasn't been the best with Amazon's Downloading device this past 4 months which is why I knocked a star off.

,B0011Z8PU0,-1,-1,3,"I bought this because I was in high school when it came out and I remember it playing a lot and it just had a lot of good memories. But, really, on its on merits? Its not that great of a song. Wah-wah-wah. Sorry."
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,Can't deny Prince. I bought these so I could play them in my car while I car-pooled with my co-worker who loves Prince.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,Such an amazing song. I saw a soldier sing it and it touched my soul..I am glad Michael sung this..
,B0011Z8O2O,-1,1,5,Touches a chord in me every time I hear it. He puts emotion into it.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,good download.

,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,Very Patriotic
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,"Sweet song, sexy man"
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,Met or exceeded my expectations. What is shown is what I received. I down loaded this and expect to listen to it often.
,B0011Z8RHQ,-1,-1,1,"This file is of a very poor quality, it reminds me of the vinyl LP's because there is so much static over the complete track."
,B0011Z8RHQ,1,1,5,Great oldie for my kindle. Not much else you can write about a song but they require a lot oif words.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,4,"Prince can do no wrong. I found myself catapulted back to the 80s when this tune came on. I could remember sitting in front of my friends television set as we quietly watched a the movie, the soundtrack is based on. Giggling, eyes covered sometimes wide in sheer shock, but feeling good. This song leaves me with an abundance of good silly dreams."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"I like my recent purchase of purple rain for my kindle fire hd, I enjoy listening to it on a regular basis."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"The iconic ballad from a masterful guitarist, songwriter and performer.  It's definitely on my short list of favorite songs of all time."
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,LOVE THIS SONG
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,Chill. Peaceful. You need it in your collection.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,"I like it a lot. Nice song, very romantic. Good lyrics. The best song so far of Michael Buble. In my opinion...."
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,I love this song so for sure it is good! It keeps me awake while I am driving and it makes me relax.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,"It just doesn't get much better than Michael Buble', especially this track.  Great addition to your music favorite music collection.  Really nice song."
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,"rated 4 stars because, I know the history behind the album and give much Respect...lyrics and musicianship was live...music and artistry awesome....bring me back to home...thank you amazon
Why no voting buttons?"
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,4,Greater oldie
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,"What more can you say about a song that sponsored the entire world ringing in a new millennium?  When this song came out in the 80's it was an instant hit, however I don't think anyone could have predicted how much this song would mean to everyone celebrating the 2000 new year.  Every Prince fan is aware of this song and album and knows it is a must have to your collection.  If you aren't a Prince fan, start with this album/song and you will become an instant fan."
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,always loved the Artist aka Prince
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,"A must have, if you are a True Prince fan."
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,Love Prince
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,"His best song ever, sexy and really danceable!"
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,Great song from a great artist.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,I still love all of his music I respect this artist for so many reason a True creative genuis way before his time we was and is!
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,This is an all time awesome classic that will never get old.  This song will always be in and never get old. :-)
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"I've always loved this song. It's an oldie but goodie. I used to have the tape and wore it out, so I was glad that I could download this!"
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,I have always hated prince. But this one song I really love and enjoy to listen often. It gives me this warm feeling inside my soul and feeds my heart.
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,The song Bad Day has a magical quality and performed well by Daniel Powter. I would recommend this song to anyone who is a fan of Daniel Powter's music.
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,"I must say, listening to this track really makes my day a lot better when I'm down. It has a great message and whenever you're down this track will without a doubt lift your spirits."
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,"Sounds a lot like the group Train (""Drops Of Jupiter""), but is not. Very good song to listen to, to brighten your day when you think everything is going wrong."
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,This is easily one of my favorite songs.  I enjoyed it the first time I heard it and I still love to listen to it whenever it comes on the radio.  The video is awesome too.
,B0011Z7M2C,-1,-1,3,"Right Said Fred and Blind Melon; Daniel Powter joins the ranks of the poor one-hit wonders who were destined to crank out one overly played radio hit that grinded on everyone's nerves, and then disappeared. ""Bad Day"" is the first major goodbye song on American Idol, and as that was the first season I really became a fan, I started noticing on message boards, and various other entertainments sits, what is the name of that song? I first heard the name on MSNBC's Reality TV questions column, before the song's monumental success. Soon after that column, the song rocketed up the charts, and while I don't think it #1, it came pretty darn close, and still remains a download favorite a couple years later.

The song itself is good, not great. The vocals match and work with the song, the lyrics are good, and the piano works very well with the song. However, it kind of gets sappy after awhile. And again, after the radio long wheres out it's welcome, you're cursing the radio to stop playing that darn song.

So overall, a nice song, but it'll where on you after awhile, but it'll stay long after it's welcome, so beware. And yes, Daniel Powter still shows no sign of follow-up success. Say hello to Right Said Fred."

,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,4,"It is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and talented passes on, it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically. That happened with Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and John Lennon because of their impacts on music from top to bottom. Now, with the deep and tragic loss of Prince, the world is feeling the same bits of sadness from beginning to end all over again. He not only transformed music with each and every album he had made, every song he recorded, but Prince honestly was one of those artists that never got older with his music, he got better with each and every song. 1999 is one of those songs that still clicks every time when you think of party anthems and celebrations in music. It is still one of those songs that really connects with celebration. Prince was definitely a gem that really transcended music at the soul, where a lot of other artists have stopped. May the Purple One's legacy live on.

Prince 1058-2016

,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,I love old time Prince songs
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,5,awesome
,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,4,1999 was an immensely hot tune back in the day. Anyone who likes Prince and his music would cherish this as a song to savor for years and years to come.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,"Wow. He makes my heart melts when he sings.  Listen to the sample of his song on here and you will agree, his beautiful voice will melt your heart, too."
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,"I was watching the movie ""The Wedding Date"" which I have seen many times & this is one of the songs from the movie.  It is a fantastic song that has so much meaning.  I used muy iPhone w/Shazam and jpurchased the song for both my iPhone & Kindle Fire as well as the ringtone.  it is such a BEAUTIFUL Song.  I listen to it @ home, in my car as well as in my office.  LOVE this song.  2 thumbs up to Michael Buble."
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,Great old song.  It's nice to have the opportunity to find the classic rock songs and download them.  Great quality.  Thanks.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,"If your entering a singing contest this is a good one to learn. The only Problem being is that you Will be compared to Michael Buble. Which if you can pull it off, and add a little of yourself to the Song, you'll win. (Not Guaranteed)"
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,4,"This has a classic sound, but I first heard it as a Blake Shelton song.  It depends on my mood as to which version I like better, but the lyrics are classic."
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,4,"Someone recommend this song to me, after I heard it at the very first time, I do enjoy this song."
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,"Nice to hear real music these days when so much of what comes out is loud, unintelligible and, many time, offensive.  Takes you back to a much gentler time."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,4,I got this song for my father inlaw because he was always walking around singing it. Now this song has been on repeat for weeks. OY! But hes happy so Im happy.
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,4,"Good song, cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"Prince was an icon in his time, crazy as he was.  My sons adored him, and I understand why. Brings back fond memories of those years."
,B0011Z764Q,1,1,5,"Purple rain...just great background music for whatever you are doing. Music is haunting. Vocals are perfect. Give it a try, you won't be sorry. A classic"
,B0011Z8O2O,-1,-1,3,This song is so sweet and sentimental but I can't help but notice that it's very repetitive and gets old really fast. Still a good song with very meaningful words.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,I bought this for my easy listening playlist. His voice is very soothing. I would recommend this to anyone looking to add to their easy listening playlist.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,Awesome song. Awesome lyrics. Awesome singing. Michael Buble is awesome.  Did I say awesome already? I highly recommend this beautiful song.
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,This is a really good song and worth the $$$$! This is a popular song what else is there to say?
,B0011Z8O2O,1,1,5,glad to see that when a male artist makes a music cd they can leave their clothes on and it still sells

,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,Loved it
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,4,Great song. I remember it from some years ago when it was played all the time during a season of American Idol.
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,"I love this song, it cheers me up every time I hear it.  Daniel Powter is a very talented guy and this is a really great song!"
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,"I found this song on an album I had, and I wasn't even upset because this song is so good. It makes you feel glad to be alive."

,B0011Z768M,1,1,5,Brings back happy memories of better times.
,B0011Z768M,1,1,5,"Dude. This is Prince. Everything Prince has ever done is awesome. Even when he didn't have a name, it was awesome."
,B0011Z768M,1,1,5,Even though this is an older song it never gets old! I love the song and I am happy that it was available through Amazon.
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,"Despite the name, this song always makes me feel better whenever I hear it.  Instead of waiting, I decided to buy it so I could hear it whenever I wanted."
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,4,"Can't help but get in a better mood whenever I hear this song. It's fun, up-beat, and can be shared with almost anyone of any age and music tastes."
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,4,"A musical acknowledgement that ""you had a bad day"" could be therapeutic.
It is a quintessential ""pop music"" song and because of that if you're a music snob who insists upon everything being obscure and atypical then it might not be for you however honestly it works. It hops between melancholy and upbeat, it lifts you up dusts you off and sets back on your path."
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,I got this for the CDs for my dad's funeral. So yea it was perfect because he loved it. Perfect.
,B0011Z8SMA,1,1,5,If you love 60's music this is a must have for your collection.  CSN had a lot of great hits and this is just one of them.
,B0011Z8SMA,1,1,5,"I saw these guys perform this in the movie of the Woodstock festival back in the day, and they did it great live. I saw them recently on AXS TV at a much more recent concert, and they still did it great, white hair and potbellies and all."
,B0011Z8SMA,1,1,5,This is a very pratical way to add hard to find music to my collection. Downloading just what I need to my computer'
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,"This song's catchy tune and lyrics are perfect  when you think your world's gone all batty, only to discover that you're not alone!"
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,"I call this a smile song, because when having a bad day this song just gets me dancing around and forget my worries"
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,This song came out a few years ago and I always thought it was kind of neat. I still like it.
,B0011Z7M2C,1,1,5,For me it was easy download this song to listen on my Ipod instead to buy the whole album. The sound is good.
,B0011Z8OX8,-1,1,4,as expected
,B0011Z8OX8,1,1,5,great
,B0011Z8OX8,-1,1,5,throwback
,B0011Z8OX8,1,1,5,Good Song
,B0011Z8OX8,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B0011Z8OX8,1,1,5,If you buy songs on amazon they store it on the cloud for you so if you accidentally delete it you can retrieve it from them.
,B0011Z8OX8,1,1,5,"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the G'D door? Very catchy little one liner in this song. It reminds me of another song that I can't quite put my finger on. It's a good pop like tune, though it is played on an Alternative Rock station in my area and is a part of their top 20 air played."
,B0011Z8OX8,1,1,5,"love this song. Every time  I hear i this song on the  radio,  I have to  turn up the  volume."
,B0011Z8P8M,-1,-1,3,"Usually, a Tracy Chapman song is urbane, in a quiet understated hip way, with a slice of wit. ""Talkin' Bout A Revolution"" is not that. Although it has become popular as an anthem in her concerts and covered by several artists, it is thin from start to finish.

Trying to address real problems (poverty apparently, but not clearly, due to oppression), Chapman's lyrics have nothing original about them. She released this as the second single of her career. Considered political aware, it offers nothing but a complaint about the obvious.

For example:

""Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion.""

She whispers ""It sounds like a whisper.""

And she fills in space by repeating ""Run Run Run Run...""

The music is sharply produced, but is stuck in a generic 1980s folk rock beat.

Tracy Chapman tried too hard on this one and delivered a weak song. She has a better catalog than this.

,B0011Z7448,1,1,5,Still surprised this Jet ballad barely broke the Top 40 in the US when it was released. It never has gotten the airplay deserved.
,B0011Z7448,-1,1,4,"I downloaded 3 songs after listening to this album.  Granted, the album was really good, however the 3 I downloaded were the only songs worth listening to more than once or twice. My advice: listen to the album samples first."
,B0011Z929S,1,1,5,Awesome!
,B0011Z929S,1,1,5,Reminds me of Catholic school.
,B0011Z929S,1,1,5,"GREAT SONG! Love this song! I feel it in my soul when I hear it! I love music that moves me, this moves me!"
,B0011Z929S,1,1,5,I love Death Cab For Cutie. I think that they are one of the most underrated bands out there but then again that is just my own opinion. I would definitely have to recommend giving it a listen if you are into steady soft beats and not the crazy club music that some enjoy. Give it a try.
,B0011Z929S,1,1,5,"I can listen to this song over and over.  One of my favorites.  Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
,B0011Z929S,1,1,5,"Dark, but great song. And its easy to play on an acoustic guitar. liked it, good value for the price and convienient to download. I love amazon."
,B0011Z94XM,1,1,5,"Jason Mraz is a great up and coming artist whose music, lyrics and vocals should produce #1 hit for a long time"
,B0011Z94XM,1,1,5,"Jason Mraz is definitely an underrated artist in the music world. It's all too easy to write him off as another John Mayer/Dave Matthews type artist. Nope, M.R.A.Z. is a whole nother breed. He has a little bit country, little bit rap, bit adult alt, bit pop, bit folk, the point is, Mraz can do it all. And this song shows all those elements, and the song writing style of Mraz. Even though this song was co-written by The Matrix song writing group, you can tell which parts are theirs, and which parts are Mraz.

First off, the opening lines are awesome, and really set the tone for the verses. They're out of the ordinary, but seem to fit, and most importantly flow. And that's what this song's got going for it the most, flow. The verses, the pre-chorus, the chorus all flow freely even though they all have their unique style. This is accomplished for the most part by Mraz's vocals. The structure is also unique in that it has the verses which are great in of themselves, then you have the pre-chorus which could be a chorus in its own right, and then you have the chorus, which is in True radio-friendly style to grab those radio people, and has the True influence of The Matrix.

In fact, the only thing you could really criticize the song about is the pre-chorus, as it may just be one chorus too many, or maybe it could be a thinly veiled reference to sex or something. In either case, it both works, and it doesn't. I personally think it should have its own song, although it does great in this song.

So overall, definitely not your everyday radio fare. It may have a few of those elements, but it has enough originality to keep you interested and tuned in. Kudos to everybody involved with song. It's well-written, well-sung, and well-structured. This song is just another in the long list of reasons to love Jason Mraz."
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,"Prince has some really good music, including this song.  I highly recommend this song as well as others by this artist."
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,4,"Prince

Rocking it out with a cool tune, which always gets  my 52 year young joints moving on the cardio & machines at Planet Fitness

yea I know its a diverse & unusual play list..but who am I  to argue its success"
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,"I'm a big fan from th days when The Artist was known as Prince, and this is one of his best! I downloaded the MP3 version because I'm trying to digitize my music collection."
,B0011Z8PXC,1,-1,3,This song is well worth the download and minimum cost to own. Would suggest this to all listeners not sure if I'd buy the whole album
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,Can't deny Prince. I bought these so I could play them in my car while I car-pooled with my co-worker who loves Prince.
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,4,I wanted to add this song to my collection.  I now have a larger MP3 player with room for more music so I am adding additional songs that I didn't have room for before.
,B0011Z8Q9K,1,1,5,"I love having my choice of music. With my new kindle HD I can customize my play list, to my taste."
,B0011Z8Q9K,1,1,5,I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,Yes.
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,This could be the best song Prince ever made.  This song reminds me of my childhood.  Great song!

,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,great song
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,"The rhythmic ""CLAP"" in this song is what drew me to it when I first heard it.
A great arrangement by our prodigy Prince,
& a fun song to listen to.
I love how he tells a little story about ""what
she wore"", I know it made one wonder if he truly
knew such an individual...ha!
This is just another great hit of Prince & The
Revolution that a fan like me will always enjoy."

,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,4,My kind of music. Throwback in memory of Prince.

,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,"Music is most often a mind-altering experience but there are no other songs that I can think of that tilt my world sideways in such a happy, fun, and relaxing way as when Prince sings this song. Something about the way he croons this hits my heart chakra and fills me with silly, happy spaceland joy. So much FUN! It's a great gym workout playlist tune. It is a seXy song, to be sure, yet it has a whimsical, playful, melodic quality that is SO happymaking. Happy listing~*"
,B0011Z8PXC,1,1,5,OF COURSE WHO COULD RESIST THE PRINCE. IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO A STORY EVERY TIME YOU YOU HEAR HIM SING YOU SHOULD REALLY LISTEN TO HIS LYRICS THEY ARE WONDERFUL.
,B0011Z8O4M,1,1,5,I love his voice and his style. He is bringing quality back. I thought the genre had been lost until I found one of his songs.
,B0011Z95Q8,1,1,4,"This is one of my favorite songs by Led Zeppelin, it's mostly instrumental and it brings out just how great they truly are. If you like the 70's you will love this song. The background music is excellent and it's just a great song to listen to, especiall to chill out to. I hope you will find this song as enjoyable as I did.

,B0011Z7MBI,1,1,5,Love Zeppelin. I won this for doing something???? Beautiful!  Can't wait for the next one I get. Maybe the whole album?
,B0011Z7MBI,1,1,5,"Most of ""In Through the Out Door"" is much more Pop sounding than Led Zeppelin's earlier albums - but ""In the Evening"" is the exception! It is SO great! (not that I didn't also love the rest of the album) Jimmy's guitar sound is amazing with a nice, chunky sound on the solo. Robert's voice is raw, awesome, & sounds reminiscent of their early 70's stuff. In fact the song as a whole rocks pretty hard & almost sounds as if it was written for the purpose of playing it live in a massive arena!!!!!!"
,B0011Z7MBI,1,1,4,"I'm not a fan of Led Zeppelin, so when I finally break down and put a song on my ipod by the group, you know it must eiher be good or I am losing it.  My wife has ALL of Zeppelin's music, and she is a big fan; I, on the other hand, have refused to put any music of the group in my collection (including the super hit Stairway from Heaven).  This song has a good beat (although a bit long), and  it is enjoyable (at least for me) to listen to on occasion."
,B0011Z8QLI,1,1,5,"One of the kids had heard this and liked it, so we got the mp3.  Good quality on this recording. :)"
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,4,"Gordon may not have charisma, but he puts out solid, singable songs. They don't write them like they used to."
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,It's a fantastic mp3 that I can blast into my ears via my mp3 player=WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?  I LOVE how easy it is to purchas great sounding mp3s through Amazon.
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,"One of Gordons finest, ya just gotta hear it. He's only got a few like this, great to have, mixes in well with my road music."
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,"Gordon has a voice that makes you want to listen to it all, because you know that it will be interesting to the last. He has a story tellers ability to keep your interest in the entire message. Easy to listen to."
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,Brings back many memories of me listening to KLOK Radio in San Jose :)
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,"It's Gordon Lightfoot, need I say more? Love this song!"

,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,Love this song
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,No one can do songs like Gordon Lightfoot.
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,"Besides ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" and ""If You Could Read My Mind,"" this is my favorite song by Gordon Lightfoot :) If I close my eyes, I can picture Gordon writing this song while the sun is setting on a warm day in the mid '70s :) A great song by one of the all-time great singer-songwriters!"
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,love it!
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,"I accidentally found his songs and wish I could find his tape. I just loved his voice, so nice and mellow"
,B0011Z8NSY,1,1,5,I love being able to pick the individual songs I want rather than ordering an entire album.  Love this song!
,B0011Z94L4,-1,1,4,I'm a lover of this type of music. I get the MP3 downloads which hasn't been the best with Amazon's Downloading device this past 4 months which is why I knocked a star off.
,B0011Z94L4,1,1,5,Great oldie for my kindle. Not much else you can write about a song but they require a lot oif words.
,B0011Z94L4,1,1,5,"I love older songs. I love this song.

Pros: Great quality

I would recommend this product to anyone who loves great music!"
,B0011Z94L4,1,1,5,"Wilson Pickett's ""In the Midnight Hour"" is considered by many to be the ultimate R&B experience--a sexy, gritty romantic number familiar to thousands of us who grew up in the Golden Age of R&B music.  The driving beat and oh-so-obvious lyrics show that a lot can be said without having having to laced with profanity like so much of today's so-called music.  Wilson Pickett lives forever in the hearts of R&B fans the world over, with ""In the Midnight Hour"" as his signature song!"
,B0011Z94L4,-1,1,4,The only drawback of this artist is when he shot someone. Hence the deduction of one star.  But he was an excellent entertainer.
,B0011Z94L4,1,1,5,I DOWNLOADED THIS SONG TO ADD TO MY IPOD FOR MY BASS PRACTICE PLAY LIST.  TRUELY A CLASSIC COVER SONG TO KNOW.

,B0011Z94CI,-1,1,5,"In my other reviews I have stated that PANTERA is number one... AMON AMARTH is number two DISTURBED is number three.  NOTE to all, BLACK SABBATH/OZZY is not on the list because I do not feel that GOD'S should be listed as Number one or two.  THEY ARE THEIR OWN CATAGORY!"
,B0011Z7LBE,1,1,5,"This is something to be happy about: don't need no glitter, no Hollywood. The music is very lively, and the words tell you what you need to know."

,B0011Z8NVG,1,1,5,"The Original One, Still a Really Good Song I only wish They would make songs like this today not all that Rap and Crap."
,B0011Z8NVG,1,1,5,This is a typical recording of the song everyone knows.  It is a nice addition to a 1960's/1970's collection.  Enjoy!
,B0011Z8NVG,1,1,5,"I heard this song on WDRV's ""Ten @ 10"" from the year 1976 the other day and I have this song on my Amazon cloud player. It's a great song that tells a story, but I have to admit I still don't know all the words to this song even after listening to it all these years :) A timeless classic that brings Don McLean's ""American Pie"" to mind because they are both long songs with great storytelling."
,B0011Z8NVG,1,1,5,"This is the ballad he made that blew EVERYONE away when it came out, and cemented Gordon into the hall of musical history fame."
,B0011Z8NVG,-1,1,5,I like the old time songs better listing to then the newer stuff you can understand the music and what they are saying
,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,"one of the greatest old time singers, the song was downloaded into my computer with no problems, this is the best way to order!"
,B0011Z5K8A,1,1,4,"i bought this track by accident, mistaking it for another in the billion or so in EC's catalogue.  most of my mistakes don't have this pleasant an ending. solid clapton, though. when you have been listening to an artist's (and he IS an artist) music for over forty years, one more trip through the riffology of the man don't hurt. drums by way of phil collins, i believe."
,B0011Z5K8A,1,1,5,"I like the song because it sounds like something Santana would play. I had a recording of it, but tape was damaged. I found this one and picked it up. I would definitely recommend it!"
,B0011Z5K8A,1,1,5,"I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
,B0011Z5K8A,1,1,5,"This is a great song to work out to.  When it comes on, the energy --right from the beginning -- is fantastic!"
,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,Nice Song
,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,Pure soul. That says it all!
,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,One of his best. Every now and then you'll hear it in a movie
,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,"I think I want this song playing when I walk down the aisle.  I've been told it is inappropriate, but it accurately describes how my boyfriend has courted me, it just describes us, and it is a still a great song."
,B0011Z78V2,-1,1,5,Ok.
,B0011Z78V2,-1,1,5,Electrifying performance by Otis Redding
,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,Love it

,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,Great song. Great rendition.
,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,"!A Top Hit Song From Otis Redding From 1967. If you have seen the current McDonald's Chicken Tenders TV Ad, the song that is being sung is this song, and they are using just the last segment of it as of March 2015."

,B0011Z78V2,1,1,5,I listen to the mp3's for enjoyment but also for training purposes on the guitar. So it goes without saying that quality is paramount.
,B0011ZN4TM,1,1,5,Beautiful woman and nice jam
,B0011ZN4TM,1,1,5,MY ALL TIME FAV
,B0011ZN4TM,1,1,5,Just a great song for FAb and Tamia. Nice collaboration. But fabulous always seems to come up with great collaborations.
,B0011ZN4TM,1,-1,3,"tamia has a beautiful voice and the song is wonderful WITHOUT the rap artist
next time i buy this song it will be with only tamia singing"
,B0011ZMTFC,1,1,5,"This is a powerful, aching, anguished love song. My mother says she sounds like a dog in heat. Mama, that is so rude! She is magnificent, and so are her backup people."
,B0011ZMTFC,1,1,5,Love this song. Anita Baker's voice is amazing and the quality of the download was excellent. Downloading is so easy.
,B0011ZMTFC,1,1,5,"Anita Baker is simply a classic!  Every song she sings is expressed in the most beautiful way and its to simply say, i love you, i really truly love you."
,B0011ZMTFC,1,1,5,"First time purchasing mp3's from Amazon..it's so simple and easy to download.  I'm a big fan of AB.  One of those ""must have"" songs for all 80's RB enthusiasts right?  Highly reccommend getting this from Amazon or CDUniverse."
,B0011ZMV0A,1,1,5,"Pure raw power. Amazing guitar work and great vocals. The punch you in the face changes are awesome. The first time I heard this, I almost crapped my pants. The sheer genius of this can not be matched."
,B0011ZMV0A,1,1,5,This is one of the songs I listen to when I feel overwhelmed!  It helps re-energize me to take on the world.
,B0011ZMV0A,1,1,5,"I had been listening to music on Pandora and somehow stumbled upon this AWESOME song. Of course I listen to a ton of Dragonforce and like music, but I do have fond memories of listening to this and reading the Warrior Cats book series by Erin Hunter of many of the clans battles even right at the end I was l  istening to this when (SUPER SPOILER) Firestar died."
,B0011ZMXDK,1,1,5,"The title says it all..... at all times, we must GIVE HIM GLORY!! I love how this song motivates you"
,B0011ZMXDK,1,1,5,This is a wonderful song praising God.  We have to give him glory for all he has done for you and it truly comes out in this song.
,B0011ZN4R4,1,1,5,One of Tamia's best! It is a classic waiting to happen. This is REAL music! It makes me want yo buy the entire cd
,B0011ZN4R4,1,1,5,I love most of all her music it is really good. it makes you want to enjoy you love one. i would tell everyone to get this
,B0011Z8RUS,-1,1,4,"Great stuff when in a time of not so great ruled. The photo? Not so....the words ""lighten up "" ring loud and clear....."
,B0011Z8RUS,1,1,5,My favorite singer ever since he was in Matchbox 20. It's one of those songs I like to hear played really loud and it's fun to sing along to in the car.
,B0011ZP94K,-1,1,5,Showing my Age!!!
,B0011ZP94K,1,1,5,I got this for my MP3 player & loved it. Great sound & enjoy it very much. I will download more
,B0011ZP94K,1,1,4,i don't have much to say about this purchase. i wouldn't have bought it if i didn't already like it.
,B0011ZP94K,1,1,5,"I really love this song, I was an abused woman with 3 sons and the one thing I know they still feel is a desire to pay back their stepfather,not that they would because we live a christian life now. But the song really speaks to the long term ramifications of abuse. My precious son who was killed in a car accident 3/10/2013 once at the age of 12 had to put himself in a football stance and knock his stepdad off me because he was breaking my arm, so this was mine and my ons favorite song,because we survived it and went on to have abuse free lives, until he was killed in a car accident at age 36. Needless to say I am trying to survive this but he really was (as the oldest) my protector,and there is a hole in my heart nothing will ever be ab le to fill,but I know he is in a better place now."
,B0011ZP3RS,1,1,5,Great song by a great band!  Can't wait to start jamming to it on my mp3 player and the recently compiled CD i created!
,B0011Z95N6,1,1,5,Great song.......and easy to listen to as 'All of My Love' did chart but how high I do not recall.....it's a classic and it is Led Zep on a softer note...enjoy!
,B0011ZP3RS,1,1,4,GOOD!
,B0011ZP3RS,1,1,5,"Reluctantly, I confess that I felt guided to look up the meaning of the song Bother by Stone Sour after recently hearing it on Pandora Radio.  This is because I understand that this is both an enjoyable song and yet slightly melancholy at the same time.  I wanted to understand why such a dramatic song is soothing to my soul. According to the website songfactsdotcom, Corey Taylor mentioned that Bother is both about a person losing and finding themselves simultaneously. Bother by Stone Sour is a deep and emotional alternative rock song."
,B0011ZP3RS,1,1,5,"personally, I see this song as a reflection of my own feelings as I moved thru my 20s.
star, star, star, star, star."
,B0011ZP3RS,1,1,4,i  don't have much to say about this purchase. i wouldn't have bought it if i didn't already like it.
,B0011ZP3RS,1,1,5,I've heard this song for months on the radio and finally broke down and downloaded this from Amazon and I'm so happy I did. This song is such a wonderful song.
,B0011Z95N6,1,1,5,Amazing group  them. 
,B0011Z95N6,1,1,5,Great sale
,B0011Z95N6,1,1,5,I had tickets to see this concert when the drummer died. Zeppelin's best new music in their journey as one of rock's greatest bands ever.
,B0011Z95N6,1,1,5,Buy the CD. It's a good son duh. I like everything about this song. Song is great. O-M-G! Really! I swear.
,B0011Z95N6,1,1,5,"The combination of Robert Plant's voice, beautiful lyrics, rock band instruments, synthesizer, and orchestra music weave together a tapestry that is mesmerizing and unforgettable. Yes, I would buy it again!"
,B0011Z95N6,1,1,5,it's Led Zeppelin. What else needs to be said except it is nice to see so much of their music available at the Amazon store
,B0011Z95N6,1,1,5,"This song was heard often when first released, as it was a beautiful ballad from a Hard Rock group. Great song! As with most LZ songs - it has an underlying eeriness about it, but overall a very sweet ballad."
,B0011ZN85M,1,1,5,"I love this song and it sounds great on my Kindle Fire. I have really enjoyed listening to it! I love listening to it, because it sounds so great!"
,B0011ZOZA4,1,1,5,"Anita Baker may not have had many ""hits"", but the joy I feel each time I listen to this, makes me relax and let go. Thanks Anita!"
,B0011ZOZA4,1,1,5,This song has to be one of the most intriguing songs ever made. It's a beautiful ballad showing how pure love can be.
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,"This is another one of those songs that comes to mind when you think about '60s culture. I would say Scott McKenzie's ""San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair)"" would be another one :) Anyway, this is a great, memorable song I had to add to my collection."
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,"THIS SONG IS SO GREAT, I HEARD IT ON THE RADIO AND SAID ""THAT IS THE BEST SONG EVER"" SO I NOW HAVE IT IN MY AMAZON CLOUD DRIVE AND IT'S AWESOME. LOVE IT."
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,"This song really has a message; you can't miss it.  It laments the establishment, the use of force, and the way our nation was headed in 1965.  It's anti-war, anti-power, and pro love.  It is not really rock; I would call it a lyrical gentle song, beseeching the listener to love rather than hate."
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs of all time !
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,Who doesn't like this song?
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,"It's a song track.  I like it, I wanted it, I bought it.  It is a quick way to get a single you want.  I use these as practice aids for band work.  The MP3 format is not optimum for real listening enjoyment.  In order to compress the data, a lot of tones are left out.  Even a good cassette tape outperforms this storage medium.  But it has its uses, and is inexpensive."
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,These are classic rock and rollers......music is terrific.
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,Oh yeah!
,B0011Z76UA,-1,1,4,1
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,Nice tune.. I don't regret it..
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,Good
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,GOOD FOR AMAZON A+++++++++++
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,Great
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,4,HAPPY HAPPY
,B0011Z76UA,-1,1,5,"I ordered this song because i liked it. this is my obligated review. At least you get to sample the music like at the Virgin record store before you buy so i'm not sure if I could have a complaint...unless it's rap music, modern day rap then i wouldn't be purchasing it...just complaining"
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,A Time We Should Not Forget.
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,"Playback quality is great, and I expect that from all of my Amazon downloads.  I have not been disappointed with any of my music downloads."
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,"Again, used this for a Firefighter video background music to the photo's of live scenes the non-profit community based organization for the community to see first hand what they did to protect and save lives and property.  No video was sold, just used as PR."
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,I have always thought that this is one of the best songs on the Vietnam era. I am pleased that I down loaded it from Amazon.
,B0011Z76UA,1,1,5,"Here's my boilerplate positive review for an MP3 download: No problems, just what I was expecting. The ease of ordering MP3s from Amazon will keep me coming back. The cloud player and automatic download are great."
,B0011ZR5CO,1,1,5,"This is a wonderful song. It's a great prayer to God, especially when you just don't know what to say and it seems that nothing is going right."
,B0011ZR5CO,1,1,5,Such a soothing and meaningful song.  Beautifully sang by one of my favorites.  We can learn from this and open our hearts to Christ.
,B0011ZR5CO,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs by the great Yolanda Adams.
,B0011ZR5CO,1,1,5,Love anything this artist sings

,B0011ZR5CO,1,1,4,A wonderful Gospel song that will be a blessing to you.  It lifts your spirit and gives you hope. It is worth purchasing.
,B0011ZR5CO,1,1,5,I remember when this song first came out and I seen the video for it and I fell in love and it's also on my playlist no matter what
,B0011ZR5CO,1,1,4,The lyrics are what captured me first and then melody.  The lyrics are like a prayer with music added...I guess like Psalms in the bible.  Simply beautiful....
,B0011ZR5CO,-1,-1,2,IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE SONGS ARE STILL IN THE SYSTEM AND I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM AGAIN...I DID NOT RECEIVE ON MY IPOD.....
,B0011ZR5CO,-1,-1,2,"I wish i could tell you that it went through ok, but it did not. I have no music and was very upset that i don't."
,B0011ZR5CO,1,1,5,I remember listening to this song when I was younger. I still love it now and I am so glad that I downloaded it.
,B0011ZP0Z8,1,1,5,"I love Christmas music, and having funny songs to complement the more traditional and sacred songs makes for good giggles while doing my daily stuff. This song really fits the bill! I think some members of my family have received some of these gifts over the years, making the song even funnier!"
,B0011ZP0Z8,1,1,5,Sucha funny happy Christmas song that brings back alot of fun memories. Our kids love it and we love it. Would give it as a gift every year if I knew enough people.
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,"I love, love, love Yolanda Adams. Her music really touches you. She's a wonderful and gifted singer. A gift to gospel music."
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,I love and adore Yolanda Adams her voice is soo beautiful and each of her songs just moves you in a spiritual uplifting way. The song is great I love it I play it over and over I really cant get enough.
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,There are some songs that you need for storms in your life. This is one of them. This is one of my favorite Yolanda Adams songs. This song has great vocals and lyrics.
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,"Yolanda Adams has truly blessed my soul with this beautiful song, because In the Midst of All I know God is able to deliver me."
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,This soong it a must to have in your song list. The words truly minister's in way to uplift you out out of despair and give a great amount of encouragement
,B0011ZN40Q,1,1,5,"As I was watching DWTS; the one dance that was shown used this song, and Cowboy Troy was there in person singing it. I had not heard of Country Hip-Hop music! That was new to me. But I love this song; it is fast and fun."
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,Great voice.  Great song.  It stirs the soul.
,B0011ZP544,-1,1,5,anointed
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,This song sings to my soul! Just beautiful!
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,"What more can I say about this song that you don't arleady know, feel, and relealize when you listen to the words."
,B0011ZP544,1,1,5,I absolutely love this song!! Yolanda gave a True testament and did an amazing job when it came to encouragement. I wish I could sing it the way she did.
,B0011ZT2O8,1,1,5,I absolutely LOVE Anita Baker. This is a great album for any True AB fans.  The greatest his album would also be a good buy.
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,A really great song that is well recorded and come across they I want and remember from the first time I heard it.
,B0011ZP364,1,1,4,"Since I'm old I don't have to worry about battering either Chad or Nickelback because 'they sold out'.  In fact, I'm rather amazed at how solid their output is.  They're really rather brilliant at what they do.

As for Hero, it has the usually strengths of a Nickelback tune.  Strong imagery, thoughtful lyrics, and a melody you can hum in the car.

I can't imagine Nickelback fans haven't heard this one, but if you haven't, it's good but obviously done with a movie in mind.

Still recommend it."
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,"this song is amazing.

'and they say that a hero can save us. i'm not gonna stand here and wait.'
'i'll hold on to the ways of the eagles. and watch as we all fly away...'

i've always loved it and the flow of the song is something else. sure, there are people who are always going to hate nickelback so in turn, hate chad kroeger but i'll always think this is an awesome song.

5 stars.

end note: even 6 years later this song is as strong as ever. another i must put onto my next mp3 player.."
,B0011ZT522,-1,1,5,I've heard this on the radio a thousand times and decided it was time to add it to my collection.
,B0011ZT522,-1,-1,3,"Another good song. Not bat, and not great. I have to type 12 more words. Now I need 5 more words."
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,"Incredible lyrics, pitch perfect vocals, and excellent instrumentals with a lightly emotional slow part make this song highly recommended."
,B0011ZP364,-1,1,5,TY
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,i wish they would put this song on cd. dawn
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,love it
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,Great Workout Song. Love it!
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,i love this song
,B0011ZT522,1,1,5,Love it one of my favorite songs.
,B0011ZT522,1,1,5,Worked
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,"I really don't get all the hate directed at Nickelback.  I've heard that they're an obnoxious, repetitive band, that they've supposedly ""sold out"" artistically, and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger apparently gets flak for dating/marrying Avril Lavigne (what, celebrities aren't allowed to marry each other?).  I couldn't judge myself, as I hadn't listened to their music, so when I discovered that one of my favorite songs (on a mix CD given to me by a friend) happened to be a Nickelback song, I was a little surprised.  This song was by the much-hated band?  If this was an example of their usual work, why all the hatred?

I don't know if ""Hero"" is typical of all Nickelback's work or not, but it's a powerful song that gets me in the gut whenever I hear it.

""Hero"" is a rock number that first appeared on the ""Spiderman"" soundtrack, which is befitting.  It's a strong song about the difficulties of being a hero, and being strong in the face of adversity.  It's accompanied by a powerful guitar section, with my only nitpick being that the drum section can sometimes overpower the other instruments.  And it does have a soft, melancholy acoustic interlude that gives the listener a slight break from the heavier guitars.

If this is an example of all Nickelback's work, then I'm going to give the rest of the band's discography a shot.  If it's not their typical work... well, then at least there's one Nickelback song I really like."
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,REMEMBER LISTENING TO THIS SONG WHEN i WAS A KID SO i DOWNLOADED IT. GREAT SONG THAT BROUGHT BACK ALOT OF MEMORIES.
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,"I love this song, but I bought it because I have a friend that loves it too and we just recently started talking again. When we would sing it together we would fight about who gets the high part at the end. He wanted it, but naturally it should go to me. It makes me giggle every time I think about it, so I thought about finding the ring tone. No one seemed to carry it because it was so long ago, so I purchased the song and turned it into a ringtone. Now when he calls or text I get to hear our favorite song!"
,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,I LUV Chad Kroeger. He's got such a great voice. Love this song so nice to mellow or chillax too during down time.
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,I have been listening to this song just about everyday.  It's a song for this time.  I highly recommend this song.
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,"The words are so inspiring to the listener. Whatever the situation, remember God is able. There is no problem too large for Him to solve. He's Able!!!"
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,get your praise on with Deitrick Haddon
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,very up lifting and encouraging song
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,Love it
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,Good Listen
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,Great Buy!
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,4,I purchased the song for the chorus and rhythm. After listening to it a few times there was a message. The injury I sustained from the military made the song meaningful. I hope you like it as much as I do.
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,5,"A great track from a time where the Brat Pack was 'the' group on screen. After hearing it during the dance scene in the movie 'Napolean Dynamite', I had to put it in my collection."
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,4,"This is a great track from the 80's, and is perhaps one of the best samples to reflect the era."
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,This one  was the most moving for me. The melody and energy that's put into this song. just awesome! Thanks Amazon!
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,4,"JUST GREAT PRAISE MUSIC !!!  THIS SONG IS OFF THE CHARTS, JUST MAKES ME WANT TO WORSHIP, AND PRAISE THE LORD AMEN!!!"
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,Yes God is able and I love this song when we sing it for praise and worship at our church it just moves you! So I can't help but to give it 5 stars because it is a moving testimony of what God can do!!!
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,This song is sort of an anthem style song. You can sing this song anytime and just recieve a blessing. I definitely recommend this song by Deitrick Haddon.
,B0011ZT4PU,1,1,5,"I AM that I AM or as the three Hebrew boys said it ""He's Able"". With many giving up on God in this ungodly world it's good to be reminded that He's able."
,B0011Z92SY,1,1,5,I love to work out and run to this song
,B0011Z92SY,-1,-1,1,Don't even remember this purchase
,B0011Z92SY,1,1,5,Great Workout Song. Love it!
,B0011Z92SY,1,1,5,"Linkin Park is one of the basic bands everyone should be familiar with. Their work is pretty level - it's all great. Don't be worried about the explicit label, there are only a few words."
,B0011Z92SY,1,1,5,GREAT SONG AND BAND....ROCKS YOUR FACE OFF...I love all of Linkin Parks music...I will buy all of their songs YAY!!!
,B0011Z92SY,1,1,5,Excellent workout music!  I love it! Nothing motivates you to do what you should like listening to these guys!  GREAT STUFF.
,B0011Z92SY,1,1,5,"Have this on my ""Pump Up"" playlist on my iPod. Use this to help get me going in the Morning."
,B0011Z92SY,1,1,5,"This is one of those super short, but super awesome songs that you listen to when you're trying to pump yourself up for something big, like a boxing match. Once it's over, you'll want to hit the back button and listen to it again. Here we go for the hundredth time indeed."
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,5,Great album I would highly recommend it.
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,5,"80's awesome music. The original song, before Jay-z cover. Anyone who claims its was a Jay-z first is an idiot. A must have song in your muisc collection."
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,5,great
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,4,It's fun to be reminded of the 80's - a good time in my life!
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,4,Remember the 80's ... you will with this track.  Excellent quality transfer.

,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,5,Wonderful music!!
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,5,"Love it, I Need To Get More Songs For This Album."
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,5,Iconic song that always elicits good memories.
,B0011ZP3YG,1,1,5,I liked the song immediately after watching the movie. It added a nice touch to the dance scene for Napoleon. Had to have it. Thanks Alphaville!
,B0011ZN1ZO,-1,-1,2,"Stone Sour really surprised me when they did their own version for this song.it just doesn't feel like stone sour,because they are a hard rock band and this is a pop song. Its a decent cover,but wicked game doesn't need to be redone by stone sour. Stone sour isn't good with acoustic songs in my opinion.they should stick to their guns and make good hard rock. I wouldn't waste my money on this single.it really has nothing to offer to fans of stone sour."
,B0011ZOZXG,1,1,4,Thanks for my order it was downloaded quickly and I am grateful for good quality service. will buy with you again.
,B0011ZOZXG,1,1,5,"This track calls you to the floor. Not only you can dance with this but the lyrics are written to make all you entertainers aware of your fans.

We ask that you ""Treat'Em Right"". And c'mon back. This is just one that needs to be added to your music."
,B0011ZOZXG,1,1,5,Great classic dance song.
,B0011ZOZXG,1,1,5,Takes me back to good music days.
,B0011ZOZXG,1,1,4,classic
,B0011ZOZXG,1,1,5,"These songs return youth to my aging body and when I hear them I can't help but get up and ""Jam""(and yes I still can at 54 like it was yesterday) ! How many of you can say that they don't , I dare you to listen and not try and get up and dance. This music is great for the treadmill or just to keep my joints active."
,B0011ZOZXG,1,1,4,A great old school must have song. Add it to your collection today. Brought Back a lot of old memories
,B0011ZOZXG,1,1,4,love Chub Rock! Song brings back good care free memories. Love to dance. Good quality. really really really love it.
,B0011ZUMLK,1,1,5,"Love the artists, music is a big passion of mine. She is one of the best everyone should listen to her."
,B0011ZUMLK,1,1,5,Anita's songs are always soothing and immediately enhance the mood and tone.  Romance is promised with this one.  The melody of this song is wonderful.
,B0011ZUMLK,1,1,5,"Now if you want to go roller-bladeing/skateing, take this song with you or ASK
for it to be played! Anita Baker is so fantastic! This song gets you grooving and
wanting to move to the music! Where did these classic Happy songs go? I Love Love
this song and all of her music! Thank you Anita Baker!"
,B0011ZUMLK,1,1,5,"Anita Baker is simply a classic!  Every song she sings is expressed in the most beautiful way and its to simply say, i love you, i really truly love you."
,B0011ZUMGK,1,1,5,great!
,B0011ZUMGK,1,1,5,Great song  to have in music collections. Love it!!
,B0011ZUMGK,1,1,5,"HIP HOP CLASSIC FOR AGES. IF U GREW UP IN THE EARLY 90'S, THEN U KNOW THIS ONE HERE IS KID N' PLAY'S SIGNATURE SONG."
,B0011ZUMGK,1,1,5,I like the song. Promp service afordable price. Adequate sound and qauilty. I like the song I like the song.
,B0011ZR7V8,-1,-1,1,"This is a song I could kill someone too, it's so annoying, stupid, pathetic and repeats!!!!  This sucks so badly."
,B0011ZR7V8,1,1,5,"I first heard of this superb hard rock song of through the glass by stone sour around 2006/2007 when my husband and I were playing around with the radio stations in my 2006 mazda 3 ( I miss that car). Anyhow, through glass by stone sour touches on the vulnerability that a human soul can unintentionally get subjected to when so many people are watching them. However, the lead singer also brilliantly adds a sympathetic angle to the song with the lyrics how does it feel and implying that sometimes easy answers are not always obvious. Overall, a heartfelt and quality hard rock song."
,B0011ZR7V8,1,1,4,Exactly what I was looking for. I found this song because of a book but it was just what I would want to hear again and again.
,B0011ZR7V8,1,1,5,"When I first heard this song many years ago on the radio when it came out I had no clue who this band was, all I knew was I loved this song and to this day it's still a song that's easily added to a collection of greatest hits by great performers. Over the years their songs and sound has changed only slightly to keep up with the ever changing music sound, but this song, like I said is still a classic."
,B0011ZR7V8,1,1,5,I would never expect a song like this coming from a band like this but for them it works. Highly Recommend It!
,B0011ZR7V8,-1,1,5,I love songs start innocently enough with a single guitar and lone vocal then let you have it a third of the through. Not heavy but hard enough to get your head moving. It made my Workout playlist.
,B0011ZR7V8,1,-1,3,My children like this very much - they enjoyed the album and found it very easy to download (first time to download music)
,B0011ZURG0,1,1,5,"The stars say it all, don't know what else I could put other than I love it."
,B0011ZURG0,1,1,5,"This song is just amazing - very powerful and Josh has such a clean voice to go with it.  I originally heard this song on a Royal Caribbean cruise show - and I had to find it.  Since I have downloaded this song, I play it over and over.  I can even see this being used in a way to ""remember"" someone - like at a funeral.  I am now looking at other songs by Josh to see what else I may like."
,B0011ZURG0,1,1,5,This is one of all of his albums that are just beauiful.  I go to sleep listening to all of his songs.
,B0011ZURG0,1,1,5,"I love Josh Groban.  I love this song.  It's beautiful, dynamic, moving, powerful."
,B0011ZVL0G,1,1,5,"I put my thing down, flip it, and reverse it! This song is still in heavy rotation around these parts! You gotta hear it."
,B0011ZVL0G,1,1,5,"Some songs I just have to have them...!!!  And this is good to dance, and play.  Good price, easy download, easy pay...!!!"
,B0011ZVL0G,1,1,4,Good artist and producer. Good Production. Missy is positive and creative and fun and one of the few successful women out there in the business! Love this song!
,B0011ZVOGW,1,1,5,This song reminds me of the love and support I get from my dear husband.  I love it and recommend to anyone with a good support system in place.
,B0011ZVOGW,1,1,5,I'm a huge Levert (Eddie & Gerald) fan. If you like the Lerverts' music then you're sure to love this song.
,B0011ZW69G,1,1,5,Hmmm...what can one say about a tune that does great sampling...lyrics that are a narrative and beautiful and sad...tribute to a lost friend...classic hip-hop...1992...Whoo...they don't make cuts like these anymore...
,B0011ZW7G8,1,1,4,"In the 1970s, nobody wrote a love song like Joni Mitchell. And ""A Case of You"" is one of her best. Hearing Prince do a soul-i-fied and oh, so sexy version of this beautiful song is amazing and lovely to hear; it's a great interpretation."
,B0011ZW7G8,1,-1,3,"To know that Prince is a Joni Mitchell fan, mainly from when he name drops her in dorothy parker, you understand why it was important for him to do the tribute one of the reviewers had pointed out there where better contemporaries of hers that had great material an I agree, but this was based off his personal fondness for her work."
,B0011ZTCN4,1,1,5,"this purchase wild wild west was for a friend,
thank-you she has enjoyed very much. good song
i would recommend for others."
,B0011ZTCN4,1,1,5,I had forgotten how much I love this catchy song until I heard it yesterday and then we HAD to buy it!  We played it 3 times and I still remember most of the words!  Fun memories of singing this one in front of the mirror into the hairbrush/microphone!
,B0011ZTCN4,1,1,5,my old dance song...yee haw
,B0011ZTCN4,-1,-1,3,"Anyone remember this eighties a$$ song? Anyway, it's a direct ripoff of an Elvis Costello song from the late seventies called Pump It UP and it sounds a lot like a group that's trying to imitate INXS' sound too. Still, it invokes warm fuzzy memories of the late eighties"
,B0011ZYHPM,1,1,5,a 1 in a million style.  I thoroughly enjoyed this entertainer. He has been and always will be missed by his fans.
,B0011ZVSKE,1,1,5,great song
,B0011ZVSKE,1,1,5,I enjoyed listening to this CD. It was nice and inspirational. She has a nice voice. I have a few of her CD's
,B0011ZVSKE,1,1,5,I try to listen to music that is easy to understand and has the power to help me along my journey. On any given day one can get that from this song. GOD who is in US is greater than anything in and of this world. ALWAYS believe that. At times we give up. This song says to you Keep Going no matter what! I recommend this song to all who falter at times.
,B0011ZT5MM,1,1,4,we downloaded this to add to our long playlist of music on the go to keep us entertained when the moment called for it :)
,B0011ZT5MM,-1,1,5,"If you have ever had that feeling like you could just explode, implode, spontaneously combust... Then this is your cure."
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,4,Great music
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,just listen to the words.. this will really to your spirit
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,Great song
,B0011ZYPWM,-1,1,5,Thumbs up! 
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,I love this song since the first time I heard it. Great song to remind you to stay focus. I going to be ready for whatever he has for me to do because he showed me so much love dispute every thing I done wrong.
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,Yolanda music really impact me . . . praise and worship is wonderful
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,classic
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,Beautiful
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,4,"Heart felt sentiment comes out of this song. This is a nice slow song that is great for late nights, early mornings or a quiet afternoon of meditation!"
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,"Yolanda is one of the greatest gospel singer, her voice is truly inspirational.  I would recommend her music to everyone ..."
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,It was beautiful and it brought tears to my eyes I told my friends about is who have not hear it before and they enjoyed the wonderful sounds of gospel from Yolanda Adams
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,I absolutely love this song.  If you listen to the words as well as the melody...it speaks volumes.  You have to listen to it if you haven't before.  You will love it just as I do.
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,This song is giving me a direction for the destiny that God has shown for my Purpose. Only God given!
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,"This song is about whatever the situation you are in, God will bring you out and it reminds us to be ready at all times"
,B0011ZYPWM,1,1,5,you have to listen to the lyrics of this song to really appreciate this song.  Yolanda Adams has a very unique voice and her words are very easy to relate to.
,B001202PKU,1,1,5,"A great cover of the Tom Waits song from one of the best TV series ever.  This may be the best version of the song, but the Steve Earle version should not be overlooked.  Blind Boys Of Alabama are always great, and their performance on this song is wonderful!"
,B001202PKU,1,1,5,"We loved every season of The Wire.  It's great to have ""Way Down in the Hole"" to remember the great series.  Another excellent download from Amazon!"
,B001202PKU,1,1,5,"This is a great song, catchy, and highly listenable.  While it is most famous as the theme from the first season of the wire, it far better than a mere theme song. I would highly recomend the purchase of the song, and enjoy listening to the full version."
,B001202PKU,1,1,4,"We have been watching The Wire on DVD, and of course the catchy theme has gotten under our skin.  This is the title theme for Season 1, and now that we are on Season 3, I have noticed that they use a new artist for the same song with each season.  Season 2 Tom Waits (I'm not a fan), and Season 3 is Neville Brothers (I am a fan, but I still like the Season 1 version better).

This mp3 is shy of 3 minutes, longer than what you hear on the show.  An enjoyable track."
,B001200TKS,1,1,5,"Excellent album im lucky to have gotten to pick it up for as inexpensive as they were asking. Peter Steele and pals certainly did a great job,this cd i always play as loud as i can til someone says TURN IT DOWN !! And i say hell no this needs to be heard! Must pick it up if you get the chance."
,B00120EAU8,1,1,5,This song is just classic and I love it to death.  The way she sings the song not over singing but just perfect. I also love the beat because it doesn't over shadow Sybil. Love this jam!
,B00120EAU8,1,1,5,"To me this is one of her fun songs and I particularly love to do my daily exercises from this song.  It will uplift you early in the morning, late afternoon or late at night.  It's just that kind of song.  You don't even have to exercise to benefit from this heart throbbing song. Buy the song and fall in love all over again with Sybil."
,B00120CLW2,1,1,5,"So, I know it's almost been 10 years since this album was released, but God's love as our Father is unlimited.  I mean the revelation that Mr. Upton has in reference to the Love of God is paramount. I am telling you the truth, REAL DELIVERANCE from rejection, bitterness, anger, and being raised without a dad. Soaking in the presence of God with aid of this music has changed my perspective.

BUY IT, not in part; but the WHOLE THING! You'll have times of sweet worship.

I run a mens fellowship, and one day I just let this album just play from beginning to the end, and the fellas just sat and listened.  Every one of us was reconnected with God our FATHER in ways that we had totally over looked. Thank you Lord for such good music."
,B00120CWZI,1,1,5,Wow!! I love The Clark Sisters and this song is awesome. The praise dancers at my church are doing a dance to this song.
,B00120CWZI,1,1,5,The choir at my church sung this song and I really enjoyed it and wanted to add it to my collection.  I have other songs sung by Ms. Karen and enjoy hearing them all over and over again.  I recommend this song for anyone who loves gospel music.
,B00120AS2C,1,1,5,"Kinda like ""And It Stoned Me"" & ""Crazy Love"" etc. from Moondance.

Makes you feel like you're laying in the grass on a warm, breezy, sunny day, without a care in the world...

Thanks for introducing me to this artist with this free MP3!"
,B00120EDBY,1,1,4,"Upbeat, swingin', bluesy, jazzy big band sound.
If you like the Brian Setzer Orchestra, you'll like this.

These free MP3 songs from Amazon are introducing me to some great music. Thanks!"
,B00120EDBY,1,1,4,"Roomful of Blues sounds more like a ""swing"" band than a blues band.  It is upbeat, aggressive and very ""polished"" in its delivery.  Makes you feel more like jumpin  & jiving than sulking over a whiskey."
,B00120EDBY,-1,-1,1,"Did not order, don't know why it is showing up on my account."
,B00120EDBY,1,1,4,Enjoying
,B00120EDBY,1,1,5,excellent!!!
,B00120EDBY,1,-1,3,Good music
,B00120EDBY,1,-1,3,It is okay.  It was the kind of music I thought it would be.
,B00120EDBY,1,1,5,If you like swing this is for you. Upbeat and smooth -  great song.
,B00120EDBY,1,1,5,Good music for free. I work-out to lots of different music so I appreciate a wide variety.
,B00120EDBY,-1,-1,1,This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!
,B00120EDBY,1,1,5,excellent
,B00120EDBY,-1,-1,3,okay because it's not really me but  I think this was a good offering and I would urge you to give them a try. I'm going to leave them on my playlist.
,B00120EDBY,1,1,4,got this track mainly because it was free to get and to be honest who in there right mind would pass on something free
,B00120EDBY,1,-1,3,"Great song to inspire people &help them through their day by listening to  MY SHOW ON KGLP.ORG  Don't worry, be happy! show."
,B00120EDBY,1,1,4,"Don't get tired of this song and the TERRIFIC sounds of ""Roomful of Blues"" is sure to please any music lover of this genre'."
,B00120EDBY,1,1,5,"i love it,i allways like blues and jazz and this song is nice to listen to,i would reccommend this song to anybody that likes the blues."
,B00120EDBY,-1,-1,3,I have no recollection of ever purchasing this product so I am unable to rate it one way or another.
,B00120EDBY,1,1,4,"This is a great jazzy song that reminds me of music from the 1940s. I enjoy finding artists not featured on radio, and this is a pleasant listen."
,B00120EDBY,1,1,5,This song rocks on a dance level and any one who likes a great beat and a good time party song will love this song.
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,"I love this recording so much that I have inadvertently purchased it twice.  I don't recommend that you do that, but I recommend that you buy it."
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,"downloading songs for my MP3 player to keep me walking, dancing, and moving through the day plus keep smiling all the time"
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,"All good--I've always been very happy with all my purchases from Amazon, and I'm STILL happy!"
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,Love the song..great beat!
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,great song even now
,B00121WWXO,1,1,4,"Good tunes, did I mention I dislike writing reviews ??"
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,good
,B00121WWXO,-1,-1,3,I liked the beginning of the song . Not very fond of the miss molly mash up.
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,Awesome
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,"Great item, just what I needed."
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,Loved this track.  It keeps me awake at work during the long stretches when there is nothing to do and people will insist on bugging me.
,B00121WWXO,1,1,5,"Excellent sound quality, came in clear & loud, some tunes are not as loud as others and you have to turn the volume up right at the start!!  Rockin tune! Glad it was available as a single Mp3."
,B00121YBKQ,1,1,5,ANOTHER GREAT SONG BY THE POGUES AND SHANE MACGOWAN.  LOVE BEING ABLE TO FIND HIS MUSIC ON AMAZON.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MUSIC.
,B00121YBKQ,1,1,5,Amazing!  Love it!
,B001222436,1,1,5,I missed this song from back in the day.  Loved it then; love it now.  This cut is excellent very well done!
,B001222436,1,1,5,A great way to remember my younger years and music that was easier to listen to and understand. Instant single song download is perfect.
,B00121YBG0,1,1,5,"Probably his best song since 1966.  The version from ""I Just Wasn't Made for These Times"" and ""The Bridge School Collection, Vol. 2"" are even better than this version."
,B001223FIY,1,1,5,"This is a Leonard Cohen song and Judy Collins does it good! I have just about all her vinyl albums and gave them away,because of storage problems. I was glad to be able to get a Mp3 version and store it on Amazon cloud."
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,Glad to have it again
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,"An old favorite, while there are other versions of Judy Collins singing this song available as free downloads, this is the only one for me."
,B001224ZRY,1,1,4,I like Judy's cover of this Joni Mitchell song better than Joni's even though Joni has a better voice. I think it is the arrangement that makes it better.  Still it is a good one.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,nice
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,My favorite version of this song.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,4,good
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,Great song.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,Judy Collins is one of my all time favorite singers and this is such a lovely song.  I can relate so well to the lyrics as I've aged and changed my viewpoints over and over.  Judy's voice is so perfect for this song.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,4,Enjoyable!
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,Joni Mitchell's brilliant lyrics and Judy's angelic voice. Such a beautiful song.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,Love this song. One of my favorites. Her voice is beautiful.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,"This was a song I downloaded because I have enjoyed it for years but can't quite remember all the lyrics. I am glad that I can download songs without having to buy the entire CD.  This song does encourage people to look at both sides.
."
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,Love
,B001224ZRY,1,1,4,Well Judy Collins isn't Joni Mitchell..... I guess you have to decide which side of the bed you woke up on before you pick the version.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,Judy Collins has had a number of hits and this song is one of the really good ones.  I highly recommend it.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,"What can I say, this song has been around for ages. And know one purchases  it if they haven't herd it."
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,"In my opinion, this was her greatest hit!  She has a beautiful voice.  Other artists, who did this song, don't compare to Judy!!"
,B001224ZRY,1,1,4,"She is one of the most famous folk singer of the nineteen seventies. She has a beautiful voice,and her version is nice to listen too."
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,This song has haunted me for years because I searched for it and couldn't remember the name.  The only thing about it that I wouldn't call perfect is the title.  If you have an iota of empathy in your body you will love this song.
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,"The MP3 version of Both Sides Now is great--clear sound, which will either bring back the memories of when the song was first released or will create new fans of Judy Collins clear voice (and Joni Mitchell's songwriting).  High recommended."
,B001224ZRY,1,1,5,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.
,B0012251CW,1,1,5,Super!!!!
,B0012251CW,1,1,4,"I like this song.  It was used for many different schools as a class song, my included."
,B0012251CW,1,-1,3,"High School tune, never figured them to be right but....."
,B0012251OK,1,1,5,"This song (""Le Mer "") was a big hit for Charles Trenet.  This version swings in the Bobby Darin style Andrej is one of his best!"
,B0012251OK,1,1,5,"This song is just so spectacular.

To think, I had never even heard this song until I first saw the first commercial on TV for the video game ""BioShock.""  It set the tone so well for that game, and I knew I had to have it.

This is a great version of the song and it sounds excellent for an MP3."
,B0012251OK,1,1,4,A CLASSIC
,B0012251OK,1,1,4,Old time favorite.
,B0012251OK,1,1,5,I have always loved this song.  He was so talented and he left us way too soon.  Loved the movie that Keven Spacey did with this song as the title.
,B0012251OK,-1,1,4,"Quick buying on the computer, downloading not so bad. Once again, issues getting to iTunes or Windows Media. But I think that's a computer bug."
,B001223DPY,1,1,4,It cheerful and enjoyable every time I listen to it.
,B001223DPY,1,1,4,"What can I say about an MP3?  Obviously I like the tune or I wouldn't have purchased it as an MP3.  I don't actually know many of Leo Sayer's songs, but this one is one I enjoy, especially when running or biking as the beat always seems to be able to get me going."
,B001223DPY,1,1,5,"How can you not groove to this - or at least tap your toes? It was a smooth, easy download."
,B001223DPY,1,1,5,I don't have a lot of 70s but this is probably one of my favorite 70s songs of all time now I will dance the night away
,B001223DPY,1,1,5,"When I was young, my parents took us somewhere in Florida that had a Rose Breasted Cockatoo which did a little routine to this song. It was hilarious and my favorite part of the trip. That bird was absolutely amazing.

Recently, at a family gathering, I mentioned the singing and dancing cockatoo to other family members planning a Florida vacation. My parents looked dumbfounded and did not remember the bird show. My sister does not remember the trip. I was hoping the song might spark their memory but no such luck.

Nice quality. Pleased with the purchase."
,B0012235PW,1,1,5,"One of the key factors that made the late Ray Charles Robinson the musical icon he become in the two or three decades before his passing was the fact that,if blues came from the crossroads than Brother Ray was crossing the musical interaction. During his salad years of the late 50's/early 60's there was hard bop jazz,urban electric blues and country/western music all somehow playing on jukeboxes in black communities all over America. Ray Charles had reflected this all. Of course the foundation in all of this,if not overtly was the blues form. And considering,even on his later Atlantic days,Ray was beginning to deal with concept albums as a strong musical possibility. It would simply be the right musical choice to reflect his roots in the blues.

  ""Early In The Mornin'"" and ""I'm Movin' On"" are the two major uptempo numbers here. The melodic form is right there,smack in the center of the 12-bar blues. Yet the rhythm is right out of that Afro-Latin vibe-with Ray's electric piano all making this an extension of the uptempo,funky soul sound he'd pioneered a couple of years earlier with ""What'd I Say"". ""The Right Time"",while nostalgically conjuring up that image of Rudy Huxtable in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cosby-Show/dp/B00GOC74Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cosby Show</a>&nbsp;is an elegant,chunky number full of Fathead Newman's growling sax and the Raelette's singing at their prime. Not to even mention Ray going from his strong vocal lead to impassioned cries at a moments notice.  ""I Believe In My Soul"" starts out with a rather Oriental sounding melody on the piano while Charles own compositions ""Hard Times (No One Knows Better Than I)"",""The Midnight Hour"",""Feelin' Sad"",'Ray's Blues"",""Nobody Cares"",""Mr. Charles Blues"",""Some Day Baby"" and ""I Wonder Who"" are all mid to low tempo straight up piano based jazzy blues numbers.

  With the recent passing of Crusaders pianist/co-founder Joe Sample? I've come to think about how grateful music fans of my age group should really be that currently deceased  musical icons such as James Brown,Ray Charles and even someone as late in the game as Michael Jackson were still around during part of our lifetime. Many were musicians who played,some were masterful performs and some were both. But to people such as myself? They will not merely be a page in a history book. Even though this album was recorded almost twenty years before I was born? The strands of the new music I'd have absorbed as a child are ever present here. The really exciting part is Ray was an originator too-the key architect of the soul genre. And here he is in 1961-paying a vital musical tribute to a genre that he absorbed growing up. And so the cycle continues,and meets full circle. Pretty likely this is going to be one of the finest and most important albums you'll ever hear in your life!"
,B0012235PW,1,1,5,Great!
,B0012235PW,1,1,5,"This is a wonderful work of blues songs both covered and composed/arranged by Ray.
The production is tastefully spare, avoiding overly lush arrangements and remaining raw but still darn smooth.
Mr. Charles has a wonderful ability to draw out and convey seemingly contradictory feelings in the same song; a sad song will be so beautiful  that it brings joy; a song of content carries undertones of trouble and impermanence that creates an insidious edge.
I was turned onto this album when I read that Leonard Cohen played this frequently while writing on the Greek island of Hydra. If it's good enough for Cohen...
I sympathize with those who are familiar with versions of this album with better mastering (original vinyl etc.), but this is the only one I'm familiar with and ignorance is sometimes bliss.
An important blues album. Highly recommended."
,B0012250PA,1,1,5,"Love this track.  One of Depeche Mode's best.  Their music is timeless.  This song is a good example of that.  If you are a die hard Depeche Mode fan, you must buy this track!!"
,B0012235PW,1,1,5,"the Blues is where Ray Charles got His Center base&took  his foundation along with adding other elements&Ingrediants to His Musical Stew. His Blend with His various Musicans over the years enhanced His vibe.""Night time is the right time"" is  timeless. Ray kept it raw but also but so much feeling into His songs.this collection is a must have.strong arrangements&productions. Ray's Vocal Instrument is Strong here."

,B001226FHM,1,1,4,Beautiful song!
,B001226H8Y,1,1,5,What can I say. Josh Groban has the best voice ever and sing so beautiful it brings you to tears. His voice makes your hair stand up.
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,"This is a favorite of ours. The movie, too! Not only a holiday favorite, but kind-of fun music to play! Would recommend if you like either the movie or Josh Groban."
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,A great performer with a great rendition. Highly recommend this artist to everyone.  He has a lot of great songs.
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,To hear this at the end of the movie during the credits is worth the wait and this song stands on its own and is inspiring !
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,Anything Josh Groban sings is classic! Believe brings music and lyrics to a magical level that can only come about with what Christ means to Christmas. Thank you for demonstrating your beliefs through your gift of music and the song Believe.
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,This is a great song just not all year long. It is perfect for your Christmas Mix.  Makes an excelent data disc!
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,"Josh Groban has one of the most beautiful voices that has graced the planet. Add that to the fact that Christmas is (in my opinion) the best holiday out of the year, then you have a beautiful, magical song filled with hope and wonder. Since I bought this song, I have listened to it every day. There is no question that this song is worth buying!"
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,"What can I say. 'Believe' is from 'The Polar Express' movie, which is one of the movies I watch faithfully with my family (young and old) every Christmas. And it never gets old. And one cannot help but 'Believe' in the wonder, the blessings of Christmas after seeing the movie and listening to the music, particularly this song. Christmas is a very special time in our home and music like this helps us to remember what it is truly all about."
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,"I would recommend this CD to every one. Josh Groban has the best voice, then anyone out there.
Very Awesome!"
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,The lyrics are wonderful and of course I just love Josh.  When he sings its like magic.  A voice I love listening to.
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,Ever since I first saw this movie I have loved this song.  Such beautiful lyrics and Josh's voice is wonderful.
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,"It's Josh Groban, one of the best male vocalists in the world.  Really, what more can I say?  His voice is beautiful and the song has so much meaning.  Christmas is not just for little kids.  It is about the meaning of Christmas.  We all need child-like faith.  Sometime in middle school we sang this song (I'm assuming it was shortly after The Polar Express came out).  It was before I knew that Josh Groban sang it.  Quickly became one of my favorite Christmas songs."
,B001223E30,1,1,5,"Leo Sayer always struck me as ""borderline bubble-gum"" in his music style but that never prevented me from finding some of his tunes to be very catchy.  For me, this was the ""catchiest"" of them all.  Love the guitar chord that repeats throughout the song.  Sounds really great on a quality stereo system.  This is a song that sticks in my mind for days after hearing it (which, for this song was never a bad thing).  Decided to buy it so I can play it whenever I want, since I can barely stomach suffering through radio these days.  Nice addition to my collection."
,B001223E30,1,1,5,The incredible range that Leo Sayer used during his run was something rare and this song shows off that range better than anything else he recorded.
,B001223E30,1,1,5,Mellow classic love song that still can hit a heart if you just listen. It was a hit back in the day and it still plays well even today.
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,What can I say. Josh Groban has the best voice ever and sing so beautiful it brings you to tears. His voice makes your hair stand up.
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,"this is really a call to remind you to not forget in innocence and try to see again through a child's eyes and heart.
to just ""Believe"".  have Faith."
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,I love the movie and the song this comes from. Really beautiful song. Just another little goodie gift to myself on my Kindle Fire.
,B001226FHM,1,1,5,I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.

,B001226FHM,1,1,5,"I bought this song for Christmas light sequencing, lights to music, for my whole house. I had received the song already for free, but to insure I was legal, I purchased it too."
,B001223BPG,1,1,5,Great song. I got it because it is the song that plays in one of my favorite scenes in Martian Child.
,B001226GXU,1,1,5,One of my all time vocalize. Her voice speaks to me. All of her songs are meaningful. Where does the time go?!
,B001226GXU,1,1,5,Music was my first love. I tried to learn to play this song from The Judy Collins Songbook when I wanted to drift away from whatever beat everybody's different drum was supposed to impose an institutional time and space on life as we know it. That makes this a great song for me.
,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"There's something about Depeche Mode that just makes me like them.  It's hard for me to describe.  If you dark, like The Smiths and/or Morrissey, then likely DM is in your library as well.

The radio ready song People Are People is a nice example of their music.  But much better from this album, and apparently they know it too since it was Track 7, is Master And Servant.  Both of these songs have meaning.  Both songs have a great sound.

Depeche Mode is really, quite honestly, a group a guy like me -- and I'm far from what they would think would have been their fan base at nearly 60 years old -- likes."
,B0012236SS,1,-1,3,"Some good, 80's era synth-pop material - mostly upbeat including the well-known ""People are people"" song. Dave Gahan's vocals are sharp and the synth spot on."
,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"For me this was the best Depeche Mode album... or maybe i just heard it first at the right time for some of it to hit home..
be that as it may it's a great album still  all of these still hold up today.. even with the 80s production values... which is pretty good for this style of music really.
1. Something To Do
2. Lie To Me
3. People Are People  - truisms
4. It Doesn't Matter

,B001226HVQ,1,1,5,"The lyrics and melody of this song are beautiful. With Josh Groban singing, just makes it all the more beautiful!"
,B0012236SS,1,1,4,"The evolution of Depeche Mode hit stride when they tackled their fourth album. Instead of the thinly structured synth-pop of the two follow-ups to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speak-Spell/dp/B000ESSTKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speak & Spell</a>, ""Some Great Reward"" took the plunge into the heart of darkness. They'd gotten caught up with technology, giving the sound a fuller feel, and the lyrical content became more mature and cynical. The Dominance/Submission roleplay of ""Master and Servant"" (which was the second single) and the sociological blast of ""Blasphemous Rumours"" picked and cut deeper than before.

This was also the album that made Depeche Mode in the states. ""People Are People"" got into the American Top 20, and according the liner notes by producer Daniel Miller, the first thing recorded for the album. Egalitarian in tone, DM apparently even tried to darken the sound of the song lest it be consTrued as too pop. Those three particular songs make ""Some Great Reward"" on a par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Violator/dp/B000ESSTL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Violator</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Celebration/dp/B000002L9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Celebration</a>&nbsp;for consistency.

Like all the reissued back catalog of Depeche Mode, the 5.1 remix of the bonus disc is terrific. It fills the room with both the arena ready music that the Mode was growing into, but emphasizes the industrial samples the band was adding to the music. The clanging metal and factory wheezing leaps from the mix and shows just how ahead of the curve the band was. As for the mini-movie, ""You can get away with anything..."" chronicles the band working on the LP. I doubt I'll watch it more than twice. A pair of B-Sides and a remix of the lovely ""Somebody"" round out the package.

Given that Depeche Mode would next reach their emotionally darkest music by the next CD and then blast to superstardom (""Black Celebration,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Music-for-the-Masses/dp/B000002LCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Music for the Masses</a>), this is the CD where you can here it drop into high gear. The remastering alone is worth the extra bills."
,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"The first three DM albums are okay, but most of the time from here on, works put in perspective the band's actual potential. The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, ""Broken Frame"" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and ""Construction Time""'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.

23 years later, people can probably still identify with ""Some Great Reward."" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in ""It Doesn't Matter,"" ""Stories of Old,"" and ""Somebody."" 2 of the 3 selections are sung by Martin. ""IDM"" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on ""Stories of Old,"" possibly my favorite from the record. ""Somebody"" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track.

That doesn't mean the other 6 songs aren't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is ""Lie to Me,"" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with ""Something to Do,"" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit ""People Are People."" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen.

Then there's the awesome Wilder composition ""If You Want."" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) ""Master and Servant"" and ""Blasphemous Rumors."" ""Master"" starts with a trade-off a cappella with Martin and Dave saying ""it's a lot,"" ending it with ""like life."" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in ""Blasphemous Rumors,"" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track.

There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'80's, and rightfully so. Totatlly worth the cheap price, or if you want the re-mastered sound, you could go for the CD/DVD version."
,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"To call Some Great Reward synth pop is unfair since that means that it is ligt sounding and has lyrics that basically talk about nothing. Some Great Reward is an amazing mid 80's release and has tracks People are People, Master and Servant that all shot up to the top of charts all over the world. This album also has strong non single tracks like lie to me and something to do. They are much more experimental then their critics ever give them credit for and the sounds used on Some Great Reward and Construction Times Again are not even remotely the same. The lyrics are not as trite as many critics have accused the for being and I consider it to be one of the best albums released that year."
,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorite DM albums.  The other reviewers cover it pretty well, but I have to put my 2 in about one thing.  ""If You Want"" is not a filler song.  In fact, it is my favorite off this album.  The vocals, the lyrics, the synth...it captured me from the first time i listened to it.  Granted that was 15 years ago, but I still love it.  The band remixed just about every other song they ever made, why they passed this one by is a mystery to me.  I'd be curious to see if other DM fans feel the same way.  I have all their albums and 99% of everything else, including their 3 boxed sets of singles so i think I know what I'm talking about.
If you are new to Depeche Mode, start of with the single collections or greatest hits CD.  If you are a fan and don't own this album, get it.  It is one of their best."
,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"Much of Depeche Modes earlier material was more new-wave synth pop and more poppy in sound but this album is where they would become the dark depressing masters they are now. Some of the songs did stir up some controversy back when this album was released and this album was a major turning point for this amazing band.
Something to Do is a hard edged number that kicks this CD off. Lie To Me is an amazing song that I listen to many times without tiring. The dark melody, the sad sound to it is a treat for my ears. People Are People is a fabolous song with phat beats, killer bass lines and a sort of industrial feel. This song is about all people of all religions, races, etc. to get along regardless of their differences. This song has a great message. The ambience at the ending forever leaves this album in my memory. It doesn't matter doesn't have any major beats but has dingling synths and a both happy and sad sound to it. This song is great. Stories Of Old is another cool song but nto as great as the next one. This song is rather poppy. Somebody is a very sad piano ballad with simply pianos and Martin Gore on vocals. This song is truly a gem on this CD. Master And Servant stirred some controversy back during it's heyday. It's a hard-edged song with a strong industrial feel. This song from what I guess talks about S&M. This is my second favorite. If You Want is my favorite off SGR. It starts off as a creepy electronic song with creepy keyboards and with no drums for the first minute. At 1:30 the drums starts and the song becomes an industrial new wave dance number. Blasphemous Rumours is the one that caused controversy back in 1984. It's a very depressing song about religous doubt and suicide. It's a very sad closer to this amazing album.
This CD marks the turning point for Depeche Mode and all of their latter music. While not as strong as their next 5 albums this is a very good album and should be in every DM fans collection."

,B001227IIM,1,1,5,"Love Enya's music, and wanted some on my Kindle. Was happy to be able to get her downloaded to my Kindle. Recommend her music, so relaxing"
,B001227IIM,1,1,5,The Caribbean Blue song from Enya puts me in a good mood.  I love to share it with my friends and family.  The Album it good also which I used to have but some how have misplaced which is why I downloaded this one.
,B001227ZBC,1,1,5,You can't go wrong with old R&B. I wanted to round out my music collection and needed this song. Enjoying it.
,B001227ZBC,1,1,5,"Music is the internaional communication, there isn't a lot more to be said. If you like music, you have to throw in some Motown sound. Motown sound has been copied for quite some time. Doesn't music  make life just a little better?"
,B001227ZBC,-1,1,4,"i bought this record because, not only did I like it initially, but and being deeply hurt by my first husband, it was at that time that I realized just how thin that line really was. Years later he asked for forgiveness and I forgave him because I realized what he said was True and that we were both young and stupid. we were a long way from home and lacked guidance from both our parents or other adults that could have provided council. Even though I had some council but at that time that pain was greater than I could bear"

,B00122909W,1,1,4,"As a child growing up in the projects of New Jersey, Jaheim Hoagland accumulated more emotional baggage than all of JFK international airport.  Having lost his father at two years old, he spent most of his childhood doing the street thug thing, getting into all sorts of petty trouble while being raised in a single-parent household.  But when his mother passed away when he was 17, the pain of his loss inspired him to aggressively pursue a recording career, and 4 years later his debut, ""Ghetto Love,"" was released.  To be certain, that record wasn't perfect, and it had its share of filler.  But what made it worth the trip was Jaheim's voice, which had me do double-takes to make sure I wasn't listening to a Teddy Pendegrass record.  On his superior, impressive second album, ""Still Ghetto,"" the flava is r&b with a dash of hip hop, but the influences are clearly rooted in the old school.  Throughout its trip of nearly an hour, ""Still Ghetto"" is honest, rugged, and soulful.  Thematically, it's not a huge departure from his debut, as the majority of the songs pertain to relationships and the drama that sometimes comes with them.  Mary J. Blige openly gave Jaheim props in a Rolling Stone article, and she appears in the impressive duet, ""Beauty and Thug,"" in which the Queen of Hip Hop Soul's bruised voice goes hand-in-hand with his husky voice.  He glides effortlessly through the ultrasmooth slow jam ""Long As I Live,"" and I don't even need to explain what the song ""Tight Jeans"" is about.  ""Still Ghetto"" is essentially the record Tank's ""One Man"" should have been.  The latter record suffered from tired beats and half-inspired singing, but on ""Still Ghetto,"" Jaheim pulls it off with flying colors.  He may be a little rough on the edges, and some may even question his choice of words (um, ""Me and My B----,"" anyone?), but there's no denying his honesty.  Some records keep it real, and others keep it right.  This record does both."
,B0012286U6,1,1,5,Thank goodness I finally outgrew my high-school snobbery that you had to have the whole album. This should be part of your collection if you're a buff of the 60's sounds.

,B001226JXM,1,1,5,"Since this song seems to be one of ""INXS's"" rarities I decided to add it to my music collection.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is a fan of 1980s music!!!."
,B001226JXM,1,1,4,This is a great early hit by INXS from some of their early stuff.  Looking forward to hearing it when I want a trip to yesterday.
,B001226JXM,1,1,4,"I don't know why, but this is probably my favorite INXS song - probably because of the haunting lyrics.  If you're looking for a song to just crank up in the car and sing along to while you're air-drumming or guitaring, this is it."
,B001226JXM,1,-1,3,"I like the 1980's a lot. This wasn't my favorite song from the 80's,but its my favorite song by Inxs. I like a lot of 80's songs."

,B00122909W,1,1,5,Very nice cd love it
,B00122909W,1,1,4,"On his follow up to his debut Ghetto Love, Jahiem continued to use the R&B thug lover man persona to good use. Lead by the semi-inspiring single Fabulous, Jaheim seemed to echo a young Teddy Pendergrass & Luther Vandross. However it was the follow up single ""Put That Woman First"" which is a modern version of William Bell's I Forgot To Be Your Lover, which is the strongest song on this album.  Other highlights include the Mary J assisted Beauty and Thug, the slow jams Me & My B**ch, Backtight and Special Day. All in this is a worthy follow up to a debut by one of the strongest voices of his generation."
,B00122909W,1,1,5,"I love this cd, alsmost every song is worth playing over and over again which is what I still do to this date.  Jahiem continues to make great soulful money.

Love ya Jaheim....this is one of my all time fav CD"
,B00122909W,1,1,5,"I remember this album when I was in the 10th grade. I love this record. My aunt play it so much. Jaheim hanged on to his roots. There are 16 scintillating tracks. It is a collection of fresh new selection, including several originals, that showcase a pure and persuasive vocal gift that puts him in world-class status with R&B, hip-hop and souls old and new greats. He effortlessly embraced a full range of styles and sentiments and makes them all his own. He dedicated this album to his mother. He had put together one of the most pleasurable musical experience of the season for 2002-2003. This album has been certified Platinum. Remember, this was 2002."
,B001229AHE,1,1,5,"This song make an excellent collection to my mp3 collection.
Highly recomended for any music lover that loves music from before the 2000s"
,B00122909W,1,1,4,"From Marvin Junior (The Dells) to Teddy Pendergrass...and now Jaheim...the torch keeps passing!  Although THIS CD displays his incredible voice and makes him a STAR...I'm saving my FIVE star review for his NEXT CD.  The next one SHOULD make him a SUPERSTAR...elevating him to the Luther and Teddy heights.

I miss Teddy Pendergrass...the Teddy who sang with the Blue Notes and who later had some fantastic solo albums BEFORE the accident.  Where Luther had a touch of female in his phrasing (which made his voice incredible)...Teddy's voice was ALL testosterone, without apologies.  Forceful, direct and demanding, Teddy's singing reminded me of old Southern Negro field hollers.  All due respect to David Ruffin, Eddie Levert, Dennis Edwards...even Gerald Levert (excellent ALL)...but they're urban...they're missing that ""pig feet and hot sauce"".  Teddy had the quintescential southern black, arrogant, macho, R&B song voice...and during the 70's, I'm sure it made many white people (especially women) uncomfortable in various ways.

Jaheim has the same voice...the same approach.  What played well in the 70's...continues to play.  His ""ghetto-ness"" might turn some off...but I hope he doesn't completely drop that thug affect...yet.  It took 25 years...but the torch has been passed.  On his NEXT CD...I hope he pays a tribute to Teddy by remaking a song.

Yes...I'm ol' skool...and I thank you Jaheim...now pass the corn bread."
,B00122909W,1,1,5,"Jaheim shows the world that being ghetto isn't always a bad thing.  In fact, he makes ghetto look and sound damn good!  ""Still Ghetto"" is Jaheim's sophomore album.  He is a prime example that everyone's sophomore album can be just as good as the debut.  The album's tracklisting is all around great, from the order of the songs to the lyrics and instruments.

 ""Still Ghetto"" is about love and relationships for the most part.  Jaheim seduces and croons his female listeners practically the entire album.  ""Put that Woman First"" is the mid-tempo track that was released and went on to be a hit for 2003.  Jaheim explains that if a man does not make a woman feel that she is at the top of his list, she may leave him for another man who will.  A lot of women and even men like this song.  Jaheim showcases his seduction skills on the song ""Special Day"".  In this song Jaheim tells his woman it is her day and asks her what she would like to do.  It is a slow song with a beautiful message and melody.  ""Everywhere I Am is Jaheim's dedication to his late mother, Julie.  In the song he lets his mom know that whatever he does, he feels her presence, even in the biggest events of his life.  This song is truly heartfelt to anyone has either lost their mother or has a close bond with her.  Another favorite on ""Still Ghetto"" is Jaheim's duet with Mary J. Blige called ""Beauty and a Thug""  This song is about a man and a woman from different walks of life who attract each other. This is a lovely song.

 ""Still Ghetto"" is one of those CD's that anyone who gives it a complete listen is sure to love.  Jaheim takes being ghetto to a whole new level!  HE'S STILL GHETTO BABY!

Mikeisha's Top 5

1. Special Day

2. Me and my B**ch

3. Beauty and a Thug

4. Everywhere I am

5. Long as I Live"
,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Jaheim's (J.Hoaglan) sophomore album ""Still Ghetto"" (2002) is an uplifting album to enjoy. Jaheim is blessed with a wonderful, soulful voice which shines through on this release. Jaheim has shown alot love for Hip Hop so it makes sense that he have Kay Gee (formerly of Naughty by Nature) looking after alot of the production on this. The lead single is the inspirational ""Fabulous"" which is about staying positive and making it through the hardest of times. I like this track, The Rayne's guest appearance is good and having the children sing the chorus adds a different feel to the track. Next two tracks are standout, ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" and ""Put that Woman First"" are about appreciating ones lady. Other early songs like ""Me and My B****"" and ""Let's Talk About It"" follow through well. ""Long as I Live"" is about real love, marriage and commitment. Jaheim goes real deep on ""Everywhere I Am"" a beautiful tribute to his mom, a song where you can really feel his genuine love. Mary J and Jaheim drop a memorable collabration on ""Beauty and a Thug"". Slow love song ""Special Lady"" is another track I like. A few tracks particularly the ones at the end- are more filler material for me. However the majority of the tracks are memorable with good reply value. ""Still Ghetto"" is another Jaheim album to enjoy, one I recommend checking out."
,B00122909W,1,1,4,"I've always been of the mind state that the term ""ghetto"" is a derogatory word, but Jaheim has taken the word and made it his own. Within his music he celebrates the idea of ghetto, even going insofar as to title his sophomore album ""Still Ghetto"". While I respect Jaheim's allegiance to his roots, sometimes the sheer overload of the ""ghetto"" concept overpowers his musical prowess. Hailing from New Jersey, Jaheim is no doubt a talented singer capable of impressing even the most fickle with his ability. In fact his talent is so strong that it could almost make you angry that he doesn't have material - but images are made for reason and Jaheim has done well with his.
The first cut released from ""Still Ghetto"" was the hood anthem ""Fabulous"" whose catchy refrain sung by kids: ""don't hate on us, we're fabulous"", creeps into you head and seeks to take up permanent residence. From the celebratory ""Fabulous"", the album reflects on love with ""Diamond In Da Ruff"". It is on tracks like this as well as the soul-filled and passionate ""Put That Woman First"" that Jaheim shows you the depths and peaks of his voice. Since his debut, he's been compared to the legendary Teddy Pendergrass, a serious compliment that echoes in every part of Jaheim's vocals.
The album takes a slight turn with the less impressive ""Me & My B!tch"" and ""Tight Jeans"". While they all in their own way have some sort of appeal - it's here where you pity the subject matter. Jaheim has the voice of someone who should perhaps being singing ballads exclusively, but it often feels like his talent is wasted on sub par material not worthy of his voice. Sure, it's okay to appreciate the female form, but someone with this voice - you just know that he's capable of more. ""Backtight"" might have a dumb title - but it's subtlety is definitely a plus. The songwriting leaves you wanting a little more, but sound-wise it's very nice.
""Long As I Live"" is a tad overproduced, but because the vocals are so lush - it's hard to even care. On ""Everywhere I Am"", the crooner calls up the spirit of the older, fatter Luther Vandross (most of you know Luther was a much better singer when he ate Big Macs instead of lettuce). On the track, Jaheim sings out for his late mother and his talent is to be respected on the well-produced and well-sung track. ""Beauty And A Thug"", a duet with Mary J. Blige, tries to be jazzy but ends up just being not so great.
Things get a little more ""ghetto"" with ""Every Which Way"" which should be discarded in the do not put me on an album pile. ""Special Day"" is another of the moments that make you want to root for Jaheim. His voice has so many beautiful elements to it, that you want people to like him - you want him to succeed and more importantly, you want his record label to hire him better writers and producers.
- Final Thoughts -
Jahiem might not be a household name yet, but he has undeniable talent that will keep him floating for time to come. He'll definitely have to refine his talents if he wants to reach a broader audience, but for now he's happy being ""Still Ghetto"""
,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Jahiem is one of the few new ones on the music scene who's vocie alone is music to hear.(True singing talent) This cd is a must have for those who truley like R+B and a lil hip hop. He did the same thing carl thomas did with his last cd(who is due for another one soon) by putting a new twist on old songs and beats.  The end result is one continuous mix of r+b jams to have your cd on repeat. The tight Jams:
*Diamond in da ruff
*Fabulous
*Put that woman First
*Beauty and the Beast
*Long as I live
*Everywhere I am
*Every which Way
Overall Jahiem surpassed his first one by putting that sophomore slump jinx to rest. Anyone curious to see what the hype is about?..just imagien a cross of vocies between teddy pendegrass and luther vandross and you have jahiem.
Get It!"
,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Jaheim- Still Ghetto
G H E T T O! What a word. We all know where the word is derived but what does it mean today? Jaheim seems to know exactly how to relate""ghetto"" to everyday life. His first CD was great and this one picks up right from there. Jaheim captures the feeling of soul music. He is what NEO SOUL is supposed to be. I think the music we label as Neo Soul really isn't that. It's a new, fresh approach, reminiscent of the Langston Hughes age in Black America. Jaheim is the 70's revisited, not just in sound but in feelin. His lead single ""Fabulous"" is a great song. Some might tire of the kids participation in the song, but the real strength is the message. It highlights the up's and downs of ""ghetto life"" and how this community accepts it, shakes it off and keeps going. In listening to this song you are aware that it's really not talkin about white America but about our own community. For some reason we've developed a split in the black community, where affluent blacks look down on the ""ghetto"" life. As Ja put's it ""We've got love for yall but yall don't love us"". Good song. It's not being taken as seriously as it should. Jaheim really is a classic balladeer though, making True love music. Music we grew up too. that's where this CD shines. Track 5, ""Put That Woman First"" is reminiscent of Rrah's ""A Woman's Threat"" and uses the same sample that Ludacris used on ""Growing Pains"" from his Word Of Mouf CD. Great song. MJB makes and appearance on ""Beauty and The Thug"". Great song  and this duet was destiny from the moment Ja came on the same. they both embody the soul of the ""ghetto"". My favorite song on this CD has to be track 7 ""Me and My B*tch"". Now before you say anything I know that title might be offensive to some but MANNNNNNNNNN! Dude pulls this off! He makes this work. It has a smooth OJAY's ring to it. Great song. My favorite songs on this CD are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,13,14...This CD works because Jaheim reminds us the beauty in the ghetto, the love and the life. Too many of us have forgot that the ghetto is more than just gunshots and teen pregnancy."
,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Watching BET's Midnight Love one night, I was introduced to a r&b singer named Jaheim.  As I was watching his video, I wasn't too impressed with ""Could It Be"" at first.  I saw the song as just another new cat jumping into the r&b game.  However, as I heard the song more often, I began to like the song more and Jaheim's voice wasn't that bad, as it reminded me of the infamous Teddy P singing ""Love TKO"", ""Turn Off The Lights"", or ""Come Go With Me"".  I was still hesitant in buying ""Ghetto Love"" but everyone that had purchased the CD gave me rave reviews so I decided to purchase my own copy.  ""Ghetto Love"" turned out to be one of my favorite r&b CDs of 2001.  I liked how Jaheim used his sharp ""street"" edge to his songs.  My favorites included ""Looking For Love"", ""Ghetto Love"", ""Remarkable"" w/Terry Dexter, ""Ready, Willing & Able"", as well as the rest of his singles:  ""Just In Case"" and ""Anything"" w/Next.  With a title of ""Still Ghetto"" you would expect the same thing from his sophomore CD and ladies and gentlemen that is what you will get.  ""Still Ghetto"" starts off with Jaheim and Duganz doing what they did on a few tracks on ""Ghetto Love"" by rappin' and singin' straight from the streets.  From there, Jaheim does what he does best by lacing his fans with the street anthems and romantic melodies that he is known for now.  His 1st single, ""Fabolous"" is dedicated to the children coming up in the world today.  As Jaheim can tell you, he knows how rough it was growing up and being a hardhead so he is trying to motivate children of today to not walk in the same path that he did.  While the song may not hit you like ""Could It Be"", ""Fabolous"" gets a strong point across and was definintely the right pick for the 1st single.  The majority of the rest of the songs deal with relationships and trying to find the right woman.  The ladies will definitely be impressed with this CD.  ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" deals with a woman that Jaheim wish he would have treated better and now he realizes how much they could have had if he would have swallowed his pride and been a man about their relationship.  ""Let's Talk About It"" follows the same line as Jaheim wants to talk to someone that he dealt with in the past and try to realize where they went wrong.  He was in trouble so much that he couldn't be focused in the relationship.  ""Put That Woman First"" covers territory that has been covered by R Kelly, ""When A Woman's Fed Up"" and Joe, ""Treat Her Like A Lady"".  However, with the old school feel to the song, this will still be one of your favorites.  ""Beauty & Thug"" features the queen of r&b/hip hop, Mary J Blige and brings pleasant results.  Both singers sound very well together and Malik Pendleton, who produced Mary J. Blige's ""Seven Days"" from her ""Share My World"" CD does the production.  The fellas will be able to relate to ""Tight Jeans"", as Jaheim tells a tale about one of his good female friends always coming around him wearing tight jeans.  While he may have intentions of being a platonic friend, she is tempting him to think of her in other ways.  Jaheim also displays the same sentimental side that he showed on ""Ghetto Love"" with songs like ""Backtight"", ""Special Day"", ""Long As I Live"" and ""Everywhere I Am"".  The latter, is a powerful dedication to his mom who passed away when he was a teenager . On another song, ""Me And My B****"", Jaheim professes his loyalty for his lady, but at the same time he is saying if you try to ""get at her"", that might be the last move you make.  This may be too much for some r&b fans, but if you understand the concept, you will understand that he isn't trying to offend women, this is just his way of expressing his thoughts on this particular song.  If Jaheim would have ended ""Still Ghetto"" at track 13, I believe that he would have a 5 star CD on his hands.  However, tracks 14-16, turn out to be nothing but filler.  Especially, ""Whut You Want"", which puts a damper on 13 straight tight songs.  The majority of the production is handled by Kay Gee, formerly of Naughty By Nature and Eddie F and Darren Lighty, which provides primarily the same sound as his debut CD displayed.  Overall, Jaheim has a nice sophomore CD on his hands.  If you liked ""Ghetto Love"", you will enjoy ""Still Ghetto"" but you may enjoy the 1st CD better.

,B001227O86,1,1,5,Great and wonderful ol school song that bring back memories. If you never heard it you must take time to listen
,B001229C18,1,1,5,"This song begins with a full orchestra playing a classical movie sound track. Drums enter along with an ominous bass synthesizer. It is punctuated by distant bird-like synthesized sounds, along with an odd, semi-guttural synthesized sound. I don't like the last sound as it seems distracting but it only lasts for a minute or less. The orchestra makes an occasional return. In the middle there is a melodic classical piano solo. The drums and bass synthesizers begin again with a return to the opening sequence which is a reprise of the first half. It ends with the return to the piano solo with faint violin triplets (possibly synthesized).

Overall the song has a progressive feel with a bit of techno electronica pop overlay."

Another music track I really enjoyed listening to."
,B001226GBM,1,1,4,"""Theme From Hill Street Blues"" perfectly captures the dark, melancholy tone of the gritty, ground breaking TV series.

i am not so sure how the long version, and the single version of this song differ. i guess i will never know unless someone that i know has purchased the single version. in this version, a guys says something from the beginning before the actual song begins and there is a long solo with a distorted type of voice towards the end. i found that kind of weird and not quit sure if that is how it is supposed to sound like. very difficult to say since music nowadays have that distorted voice in it too. maybe someone will let me know. :)"
,B001226F2W,-1,-1,3,Should of stuck with the short version - it keeps you more into the song and the band instead of just a drawn out version that has no appeal to it.
,B001226F2W,1,1,5,This is a typical recording of the song everyone knows.  It is a nice addition to a 1960's/1970's collection.  Enjoy!
,B001226F2W,1,1,5,Crimson and Clover a song with the sound of the 60's.  This is one of many songs where Tommy James and The Shondells are at their very best!
,B001226F2W,-1,1,4,"I like the original version of the classic song, but as the saying goes, sometimes more it too much.  I guess they thought making it longer would be better for FM play or to have something to pack on a CD, but really, the instrumental bridge seems like it goes on forever....."
,B001226F2W,1,1,5,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
,B001226F2W,1,1,4,"Tommy James & the Shondells were like my easy listening music as a teenager. They saved themselves from being too bubble gum and put out a nice, kind of mesmerizing sound that was sweet and a bit foreign to my protest song ridden ears. An indulgence to be sure, but still healthy. Get it."
,B001229HNQ,1,1,4,"This, I imagine, is what Vegas sounded like in the years when Vegas was really VEGAS.  It's whiskey-and-cigarette two a.m. music at it's most dramatic.
""Lush Life"" meanders a bit, but ""A Stranger In Town"" begins to pick up the pace, and Davis begins to pull out the stops on ""What Kind Of Fool Am I.""
""I've Gotta Be Me"" is an absolute masterpiece, a powerful cry of self-impowerment that is as stirring today as it was upon it's release.  Is it a tad over-dramatic?  Maybe--after all, it's a Broadway tune.  But, for those of us who got downright nauseous listening to ""Candy Man"" four million times, ""I've Gotta Be Me"" is a revelation, a vocal so big and full of life that it just can't be overlooked.  It's old-style Hollywood, old-time Vegas.
By the way--anybody else remember watching Davis shoot his six-guns on the old Merv Griffin show?  That was great stuff."
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,I like it.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Classic Song added to my Library
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"Great classic song that tells about life. We put off what we should do today, family is the most important thing. Once they are gone, can't get them back."
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Yes I always liked the song....
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,classic song with True meaning
,B001226IAG,1,1,5,"I've always loved this oldie, maybe cause I like to daydream. Who is Bobby Darin anyway? Well, one thing I know for sure, his rendition of this song is Xcellent!"
,B001226IAG,1,1,5,"Dream Lover sounded just like it did when I was a teenager, sitting around the record player, swooning to Bobby Darin with my girlfriends.. Great times! Thanks for the memories!!!!!"
,B001229DPI,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorites of Renee Olstead's songs. If you love, or even like Renee, get this one."
,B001229DPI,1,1,5,This song was the song on the season finale of Ugly Betty when Justin finally danced with his guy crush and I fell in love with this song. Renee Oldtead has a beautiful melodic voice that is so soothing. I love her music.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,So True if you do not watch out
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,A favorite from the soundtrack of MY life.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Great but sad song
,B0012298LC,-1,1,5,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Sqij0rQEL._SS300_.jpg
,B0012298LC,1,1,4,What can a man say about this song?  It rings True to so many Dad's and their sons.
,B001229HNQ,1,1,5,one of  the baddest all around Musical  talents  ever was Sammy  Davis Jr.  i mean  he truly commanded a stage and knew the licks and timing and  really put something on a tune.  I've  gotta be Me he sings the lights off of it. his phrasing and  tone are top tier and this collection truly  is a must for any fan of his music. everything here  is on point.
,B001229HNQ,1,1,5,"A longtime favorite singer of mine, Sammy Davis Jr. could really belt it out and he knew how to play his voice...thank goodness he left plenty of recordings behind!"
,B001229HNQ,1,1,5,"Sammy recorded for several labels, but his best work was on the Reprise label.  This CD contains his big hits from that period as well as some choice album cuts. Most underated tune: The Shelter of Your Arms.  Excellent!"
,B001229HNQ,1,1,5,"I have always loved Sammy's voice, and felt his singing talents were underplayed within the Rat Pack. I looked for a Sammy Davis Jr. CD for a long time and was glad to have found this one. It provides a wide range of songs; some of which were made famous by him. Best of all, it excludes the ""chatty verbage"" and jazzy arrangements often included in live performances that can make a song sound so dated. I particularly love ""As Long as She Needs Me."""
,B001229HNQ,1,1,5,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC CD.  THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR ""A STRANGER IN TOWN"", YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU BOUGHT IT.  AS USUAL, SAMMY BRINGS HIS OWN SPECIAL INTERPRETATION TO ANY SONG, AND THERE ARE A FEW GEMS HERE WRITTEN BY ANTHONY NEWLEY THAT SAMMY REALLY DOES JUSTICE TO."
,B0012298LC,-1,1,5,Pathos every time I hear it.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Love it.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Love this song..loved this singer/songwriter!
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"A poignant song about the father/son realationship.  I admired my own dad and yet he did not have all the time for me I wanted.  And once I hit the teen years I had better things to pursue than time with my dad.  Later, with a wife and family of my own, I would have liked to have shared experiences and time with dad that I didn't.  And now he is gone and you can't help but regret the missed opportunities and no longer having his support and guidance.  My own son is 19 now and I see the cycle repeating.  Harry hit all the right chords and feelings with this song."
,B0012298LC,1,1,4,Great songwriter and performer. Sad he had a tragic and too early demise. Like so many other great songwriters and performers that could have brought us so many more great songs if not for tragic endings.
,B0012298LC,-1,1,5,Tear jerker
,B0012298LC,-1,-1,1,"I never liked this song. I never understood how the boy was just like the dad. He related to his dad with the same lack of attention his dad had shown him. But he sounded attentive and concerned about his own kids (they had the flu), so to me the boy turned out better that the dad, not just like him. This song is just one big blah."
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,"Great song that brings back memories of a simpler time.  Frankie Valli's signature voice leading the way is a great trip back in time.  Glad ""Jersey Boys"" has reminded us of this GREAT classic music."
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,"My mom use to hate this song. We don't know why, but we absolutely love it. My dad use to sing it to her when they were dating. We are planning on playing it at our wedding."
,B001229HGS,1,1,5,Good stuff!!
,B001229HGS,1,1,5,I love the southern rock
,B001229HGS,1,1,5,This song builds to hard hitting guitar finish. You will want to play it with the volume turned up. I have loved this song since it first came out years ago.
,B001229HGS,1,1,4,I like the vocals and instrumental parts of this song. I liked this song for sometime and when I heard it again on the radio I knew I wanted to add it to my collection of songs.
,B0012298LC,1,1,4,great
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,EXCELLENT!!!!
,B0012298LC,-1,-1,3,Oldies but goodies
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,I like it.
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,"Great song!! Original rendition! Great Buy. Express's in a good way the let down feelings, many of  us have lived through in life."
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,"I know I am a weirdo but this is my favorite Madonna song.  It is sad (sad songs are my favorite, but not sad movies or sad books, just sad songs)."
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,"Some  of my favorite songs , from one of my favorite groups"
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,Number one hit song in 60s.
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,"Good product, good price, VERY FAST downloads."
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,I LIKE THIS SONG
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,Great song by a great Frankie Valie and The Four Seasons!
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,great old song
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,This song is haunting and makes you realize what to prioritize in your life.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,perfect
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,classic song
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Sound quality is great.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,One of my three favorite songs of all time.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"it hurts, it just hurts so much. harry is the everyman father who pays the price in spades. how many fathers are there out there who neglect
their families because of their jobs...a very scary song."
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,Best Madonna song
,B00122A8HU,1,1,4,One of the few Madonna songs I enjoy listening to.
,B00122A8HU,1,-1,3,Pretty
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,I love this song by Madonna she brings the heat with this song followed by the background  of the singer babyface this song is very romantic
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,"This is the style of Madonna songs that I find appealing. When she's not running around in weird outfits (does she still do that?) and concentrates on singing, she does a great job. This song, plus Oh Father, are my two favorite Madonna songs. There are some others, but they're all slow, meaningful, and well sung."
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,Great product at a great price! Fantastic digital download was fast and at a low cost! I would recommend this to anyone.
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,It's Excellent and one of my favorite songs. I really enjoy 80's music when I was going to High School.
,B00122A8HU,1,1,5,"love it ...nice mellow song by the material girl...takes me back to the 90's...great song..buy it, you'll like it !!"
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Great old time favorite
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Classic!
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,Still love the am radio music from my childhood.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,A work by a genius who died too young and could have given us a lot more.  One that makes you realize that life can pass too fast and the roses are still there.  Especially heartfelt by us fathers.  As powerful now as ever.  Makes your brain work overtime if you've been there.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs. From the soundtrack of my youth...
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,good old tune... brings back memories.  it makes me think of my son and how I need more time with him.
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,"The year was 1960 and few boy groups - with the exception of the Lettermen - were successful. Names like Frankie Avalon, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydel were considered the kings of youth music. But all of that was about to change. Before the Beach Boys, you had this foursome. The Four Seasons emerged that year 1960 with not one or two but several 45 hits. They dominated the top of the charts and took America by storm. First with ""Sherry"" quickly followed by ""Walk like a man"" and then ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" the Four Seasons brightened up sleep overs and slumber parties everywhere. Girls couldn't get enough. The 60's arrived big time in most part to the new sound coming from New Jersey and that sound would shape the decade to come. Solo acts would fall to the side. Groups would dominate.

Later, when Frankie Vali stepped out in front of the group to bask in his own glory, the shine fell off the rose and the rising star of the Four Seasons began to fall. Vali tried to go solo only to find his voice lost in the Beatles/Stones era of music, where it never really rose to its former heights. Vali's career ended by fading away into obscurity... until a little Broadway play came along four decades later."
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,The Four Seasons sound is a must have for any fan of 50's music.  Any collection without their music is incomplete.
,B00122AB40,1,1,5,Frankie Valli had many great songs.  This is one of the really great songs from the sixties.  Worth spending a dollar.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"Great, great song - he has a grown son so the song is very moving and means a lot to him."
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,reminded me of what i missed as a child
,B0012298LC,1,1,4,Brings back lots of great memories from my youth and when times were less complicated and Love was the word on everyone's lips
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"This is the only song by Harry Chapin that I like. It is over 30 years old but it is still a good song and the lyrics have an important message in them.

Mike Serovey, MA, MISM
Owner & Webmaster of Mike Serovey Reviews"
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"This song has a lot of meaning if you are or have raised a son. How the words ring True, if not yet, they will someday."
,B00122A23K,1,1,5,"I discovered this song as a tune used in a perfume commercial. It took me a while to figure out who had recorded the original version and I finally found this fantastic version on Amazon. I downloaded most of the EP and have this playing on my car audio in repeat over and over again. Very catchy. It's one of these ear worms. Once you hear it, it haunts your brain all day long. Glad  finally have my own copy of this!"
,B00122A19K,1,1,5,I've loved this song for many years because of Judy Collins' beautiful voice and because of the lyrics. It's one of my all-time favorites.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"I've loved this song forever, and I'm not ashamed to say that the ending verse makes me cry every time.  I was so happy when I found the MP3 version of this song.  I listen to it nearly every day (I know it's obsessive, I'm sure that will wear off).  I highly recommend this song to die-hard fans and to anybody who hasn't heard this song.  It's a classic!"
,B0012298LC,1,-1,3,Again I purchased this song to a friend of mine who absolutely loves all the versions of this particular tune.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"This song could be my son and I. I, because of work was not around much when he was little and now the Army takes him away"
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,"Harry Chapin wrote a very wise & insightful song/story of a father/son not making enough time for each other. He was ahead of his time since it's probably even more True today for everyone of any gender. Chapin died too soon, what a talent we all lost."
,B00122A23K,1,1,5,Excellent!
,B00122A23K,1,1,5,great song dark and heavy
,B00122A23K,-1,1,5,:)
,B00122A23K,1,1,5,Awesome
,B00122A23K,-1,1,5,Give it a listen
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,This is a song that will take you back to your childhood if your parents worked a lot. It was easy to download.
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music
,B0012298LC,1,1,5,I have loved this song for many years...From teenager to adult. Sounds great & I find the story to be interesting. It really does say quite a bit about many peoples hectic daily lives.
,B00122A19K,1,1,5,"Love this song, reminds me of the good songs of the past when a song was more than blaring noise and told a story."
,B00122A19K,1,1,5,"Another great rendition of a wonderful song, sung by Judy Collins.  It's far beyond the Ian and Sylvia original because her voice tells the whole story through the words and memorable melody, and of the woman's wishes for her ""perfect"" man.  One of the greatest folk pop tunes of all."
,B00122A2OE,1,1,5,I have always loved this song.  He was so talented and he left us way too soon.
,B00122A2OE,1,1,5,I remember this from when I was young and wanted to hear it. Glad I downloaded it.  The download was fast and I could play immediately.
,B00122A2OE,1,1,5,This song is such a classic.  Having it on my MP3 is just fun.  It is a grea song for parties ~ makes everyone smile.

,B001228GHO,1,1,5,Nice song.
,B001228GHO,1,1,5,"Great song that brings back memories of a simpler time.  Frankie Valli's signature voice leading the way is a great trip back in time.  Glad ""Jersey Boys"" has reminded us of this GREAT classic music."
,B00122A23K,1,1,5,Good.
,B00122A23K,1,1,5,"This song is True. So many pricks try to take our saviour away from us and make it a bunch of rules and crap. They take away the PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP we can have with God, and how a secular song comes across with such a deep religious truth, I ask you? Well, don't be judging books by their covers. These guys are real artists. Thanks!"
,B00122A23K,1,1,5,"this song is so awesome, if you love music just download it and see for yourself, that is just my opinion"
,B00122A23K,1,1,4,Back in the 80's our daughter played Depeche Mode alot.  This song always stuck with me.  I enjoy listening to the song & grooving to the infectious drum beat.
,B00122A23K,1,1,5,"I first heard this song in a commercial and spent several days hunting it down. Had now idea Depeche Mode was this good. It has a haunting melody, rhythmic sound and mysterious vocals. Great song."
,B001228GHO,1,1,5,"I love this song. Loved it when it came out, and I love it now. It's a great song, and it gets you moving. Reminds me of roller skating."
,B001228GHO,1,1,5,An oldie I've always liked.
,B001228GHO,1,1,5,"Wouldn't have got it if I didn't like it, right?"
,B001228GHO,1,1,5,perfect
,B001228GHO,1,1,4,A great old school song
,B001228GHO,1,1,5,loved this song from a long time ago. good melody and harmonies. thanks
,B00122A26W,1,1,5,"For those who enjoy Otis Redding music, this is a treat. I enjoy nearly all types music, but must say 50's and 60's era songs hold a special place in my heart. Great sound, great voice."
,B00122A26W,1,1,5,"another awesome singer, the song was downloaded into my computer with no problem, the best way to order! No waiting for shipment!"
,B00122A26W,1,1,4,=D

,B00122A26W,1,1,5,"My boyfriend sent me this song and he knew i hadnt heard it before. I loved it the moment it started to play. If you lole Otis Redding, you'll be a fan with this song!"
,B00122A26W,1,1,5,Sound great as when it was released. Just was younger bring back memory of when . Great sound with good vive.
,B00122B4T6,1,1,5,"I love this song!! It reminds me of college days. I don't remember really getting into Echo and the Bunnymen, except for ""Bring on the Dancing Horses"". ""Lips Like Sugar"" is great."
,B00122B4T6,1,1,5,Great alternative oldie; heard for the first time in a long time on 1st Wave.  Took me back in time!
,B00122A0UA,-1,1,4,this one was better.....but one of the songs I paid for was missing the last 35 seconds....not happy.....
,B00122A0UA,1,1,4,What can I say.....its a song that I like....hard to write a review that everyone can appreciate when everyone's tastes are different...try it....you may like it...
,B00122A0UA,-1,-1,3,"I can remember my Dad introducing meto this song years ago, then looking feverishly for the album (as in LP) for him so he could listen to it when he wanted.  I love it, but this recording begins abruptly and Switchin to Glide  has to be purchased separately."
,B00122A0UA,1,-1,1,"This mp3 sounds great so my complaint is not about sound quality. However, this song is usually presented as a pairing 'This Beat Goes On/Slippin' To Glide' and it usually happens in a seemless manner. These songs are cult classics and I'm sure the fans out there would love these to be presented in the normal seemless manner. To me it seems like breaking them in two is just a ploy to generate extra revenue. Still, I'm sure fans would pay $2 to have this be one peerless piece of music. I will compare this this to ZZ Top's 'Waitin' The Bus/Jesus Left Chicago' or Queen's 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' - you really shouldn't hear one without the other."
,B001229BCS,1,1,5,Good song
,B001229BCS,1,1,5,Great Product with Outstanding Customer Service.
,B001229BCS,1,1,5,"One of the most heartbreaking songs you'll ever hear, a classic. Listen closely and have your Kleenex close by."
,B001229BCS,1,1,5,"Clarence Carter was blind from the age of 1. He taught himself how to play the guitar. This is a classic song from from 1970. Clarence is also known for ""Slip Away""."
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,One of the best rapper songs of all time
,B0012288VS,-1,1,5,Everybody say ho!
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,The original rap song.  Some times the original pares in comparison to more modern but this does not.  It hold its head up high to any rap song of today.  Being funny also helps.
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"Great old school music, reminds me of younger days."
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,I have great memories with this song. I think that this is the first rap song
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"i am not a Rap Music historian, but for me my title holds True. Great beat, fun clever lyrics...I can't help but singing every time I hear this song. A classic must-have."
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,This is one of the best rapps of all times. Great party song and one you can dance too.
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"If you like rap, then you need this one.. The very first, the beginning of rap!  Its a great song, fun to listen and sing to, nothing explicit - recommend.."
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"Oldie fun song ever from the late 70's or early 80""s. I saw the original video and the Sugar Hill Gang were singing on a show that played disco music. I think it was the ending time for disco music. The people on there were really dancing to it having a good time. This song will never go out of style. I is always and will be a song for party, at a club or at home. I was sad when one of the singers died about a month ago. His name was :Big Bank Hank I think. Wonderful song that will never go out of style!"
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,Very Nice Order no problems
,B0012288VS,-1,-1,3,it's ok
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"Love this,got it for my aunt ringtone.  She loves them."

,B0012288VS,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"I grew up listening to this song, Rapper's Delight. I love this particular song because it brought back memories of my childhood. Now, I have the luxury of listening to the song, repeatedly, in my own library. I own it, so thank you amazon for allowing me to purchase and download the album into my library."
,B0012288VS,1,-1,3,"Bought it since it was ranked #2 on the Rolling Stone ""Best Of"" list.  It is a classic, I guess, but might have to listen to it more to extract why it was rated so highly."
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,Haha!
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,I have listened to this song for years and actually exercise by it.  The beat is very catchy and the words tell a funny story.
,B0012288VS,1,1,4,Very cool tune I find myself singing too much. I enjoy it and find myself adding it to most of the playlist I create.  love the mp3 Amazon store
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"I memorized every work of this album back in '78 or '79.  Amazingly enough, I still remember every word after downloading it to my MP3 player.  Love it.  Excellent beat.  Funny lyrics.  I wouldn't eat that chicken either.  lol"
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"Seriously, for us middle-aged types, how many hip hop songs can you sing to? Not to mention that what you are listening to is music history. Tips for listening. Get that furniture out the damn house. Send the pets to the neighbor's house. Throw up a light or two if you got 'em. Buy some drank. Invite 40 of your closest friends. After two hours of doing the house pah-tay thing, make an announcement that you have a special song for them. Turn the speakers up to 10. That housed fittin' to get toe down."
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"What can I say... Hip-Hop started here.. If you can't dance to this, you are dead! Best Rap Ever, well besides Baby got back!"
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"great song with high energy. I enjoy listen to it whether i am at home cleaning the house, driving in my car or while working out"
,B0012288VS,1,1,4,This song was one of the pioneers of Rapping. Long before East Coast West Coast gangsta BS. The song was creative and fun and many kids back in the day would memorize it because of the fun lyrics.
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"This is a fun song, and the words are easy to understand and sing along with.  This particular group may not have lasted long, but its music endures."
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"this is a remix but still a great tune.

the start of it all.

just saw them do this as an encore with living colour. unbelievable."
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"Whether you're a fan of classic rap jams or loved the way this track was slid into the movie 'The Wedding Singer', Rapper's Delight is a True classic that will definately liven up any gathering!"
,B0012288VS,1,1,4,These were the first rappers. The original ones. They helped start a phenomenon. Besides being the first rappers they were really talented and one of the best.
,B0012288VS,1,1,5,"The Sugarhill Gang planted that seed years ago and now that seed has grown and branched. Some consider the present tree to be garbage but that would be somewhat unfair to this generation of hip hoppers because they are, essentially, what they themselves have been hearing. Great Song by a Great Group."
,B001229EKW,1,1,5,"I like all my music choices, because I pick them out!"
,B001229EKW,1,1,5,"Aha It was good living with you!! Great song and a definite must have, as most of you already do, I lost this CD years back and had to have this song!  Love listening to it and letting it take me back to better time of life!  As to date music is the only time machines I know of.... maybe besides a good watching of Ferris Bueller!! :)"
,B001229EKW,1,1,5,"I love when this song plays. It's a fun and upbeat tune. I've always liked the song, and was happy to find it for a good price on Amazon mp3 downloads."
,B001229E9S,1,1,5,This was a song my husband used to sing to me and I to him.  I had not heard it in a while.  But I did not have it on my cloud player.  I was very happy when I was able to download it.
,B00122BEN2,1,1,5,Great
,B00122BEN2,1,1,5,Awesome song!
,B00122BEN2,1,1,5,"I was raised listening to Country music, which I no longer want to hear, I transitioned to Rock.  This music is a tasteful combination of the two worlds.  The harmonica in this song is top quality."
,B001226HUC,1,1,5,"this song is so awesome, if you love music just download it and see for yourself, that is just my opinion"
,B001226HUC,1,1,5,"Man, I remember this song from a few years back, when I found this song again I quickly purchase it. I love Depeche Mode."
,B001226HUC,-1,1,5,"Depeche Mode isn't usually a group flying on the radar... but this tune.. which I thought was entitled 'Here In My Arms' or 'All I ever needed (or wanted)'.. has a odd jammy beat.. that kinda twists and turns and twists right back to where it began.. off the wall keyboards and vocals make for a tune that oddly sounds in harmony with ""The Promise"" by When In Rome.... ""Words are meaningless and forgettable.... words are very ....unnecessary.. they can only do harm"" Solid 'A' effort"
,B001226HUC,1,1,5,A great early 90's hit with a great mood and theme.
,B001226HUC,1,1,5,classic song and well enjoyed
,B00122B4UK,1,1,5,Wonderful
,B00122B4UK,-1,1,4,Human interaction has not been as great as the idea of human engineering paving paradise to put up a parking lot with a swing hot spot. A society based on having so much entertainment to sell that it would like to toss everything else in the trash so people are not distracted by memories when they should be sleeping produced benzodiazepines to be the perfect hypnotic aspect of who we are.
,B00122B4UK,1,1,5,"This song is classic Joni Mitchell, whom some people claim is classic 1960's folk music. I highly recommend it for it's sweet melody."
,B00122B4UK,1,1,5,"This song is widely regarded as the anthem, so to speak, of the environmental movement. I love this song, and Joni Mitchell in general, and it is way past time that we, as a society and country, need to listen."
,B00122B4UK,1,1,5,"This is an album whose songs are just as True today as they were in the 1970's.  They Paved Paradise And Put Up a Parking Lot is so real, it is happening all around us every day. I see forests of oaks and pines bulldozed down to put up more bank branch offices, shopping centers, and parking lots. Buy it!!!"

,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,One of the dearest versions of send in the clowns I ever heard. The lady is mesmerizing.
,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,A favorite of mine fir years.
,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,Best rendition of this song
,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,One of my favorite Judy Collins songs.  I had this on a 45 when I was a kid. I love this sond.
,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,"This song does start off as being melancholy, but ends on a hopeful note.  The song tugs at my heartstrings and you feel for the singer.  Judy Collins has a really good voice and brings out the emotions in her songs."
,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,great
,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,Long time fan. Love it.
,B00122A1H2,-1,1,5,"If she were on American Idol, she would win going away! On the other hand, why would she go on such a sham of a show!"
,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,"I have always been a fan of Judy Collins and this selection of ""Bring in the clowns"" is one of my favorites."
,B00122A1H2,1,1,5,"Great song, brings back so many memories. Most of us have been in her position at some point in our lives."
,B00122CAQM,1,1,5,"Used in a photo slide show of my father in laws life made on his 67th birthday as a gift to reflect on the wonderful journey he has made!

Great song!"
,B00122CAQM,1,1,5,"Having just seen ""The Jersey Boys"", I was eager to revisit the wonderful Four Seasons hits I loved as a teenager. ""Walk Like A Man"" was my favorite and I am pleased to have it on my Ipod to enjoy whenever I like."
,B001229952,1,1,5,"I love downloading MP3s from Amazon for three reasons: Price, ease, and safety. The price is really comparable to other sites such as Wal-Mart or iTunes. The ease is far better to me than Wal-Mart or iTunes. And the best part, I don't have to worry about downloading viruses like I would if I chose to go to a site like Limewire."
,B001229ZW4,1,1,5,Fun movie and fun song. A regular movie musical-type number aboard the train is fun to watch and fun to listen to.
,B00122D57U,1,1,5,great sound and really enjoyed listening to this song.  The melody and the words really tell a story; highly recommend.  Classic and meaningful
,B00122D57U,1,1,4,"This song reminds of a pleasant time in my life.  I mostly got it for that reason, but Madonna seldom has a bad song."
,B00122D57U,1,1,5,It sounds nice. I like the rhyme and lyric. For the money it sells it's a perfect piece of music.
,B00122D57U,1,1,5,"I know, Madonna singing this song is not the first choice I'd have gone with, but say what you will, she really puts her heart and soul into this one.  Which is what makes it so different from all the 90's style of songs we've grown accostumed to when hearing Madonna's name. The song in itself is amazing and Madonna really did this one great justice!"
,B00122D6RE,1,1,5,great song

,B00122D6RE,1,1,5,"if you like Faith Hill's music, then you will love the classic ""There You'll Be"". Perfect for relaxing and enjoying some down time."
,B00122D6RE,1,1,5,This is a must have.  It touches the soul and make you stop and think.  It's enjoyable to listen too.  It make you think about your life.  I find all of Faith Hills song to be wonderful.  This one stands out.  This one is from the movie Pearl Harbor 2003.
,B00122D6RE,-1,1,4,I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to  so  I liked it.
,B00122D6RE,1,1,5,"love al her music but enjoyed choosing my own song to listen at and download for myself only ,makes me feel closer to loved ones ,gone home."
,B00122CB4I,1,1,4,great
,B00122CB4I,1,1,5,brings back memories of my youth
,B00122CB4I,1,1,5,"The Four Seasons were (and are) one of my favorite groups of all time, and this is a beautiful song."
,B00122CB4I,1,1,5,I remember this song from my teenage years.  I have added it to my collection and I am very satisfied!  Frankie Valli what a voice!
,B00122CB4I,1,1,5,"Well done. Great Memories, I purchased selected songs that were popular at a different time."
,B00122CB4I,1,1,4,Frankie Valli has a way of reaching in and making you feel good.
,B00122CB4I,1,1,5,great song and it has so much going on the details and the sentiments.  it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it.
,B00122CB4I,1,1,5,"we have not forgotten , on this night ,  this very christmas night"
,B00122CB4I,1,1,4,A great old school song
,B00122C1WU,1,-1,3,"it's fine,it's diamond girl"
,B00122C1WU,1,1,5,te 70's music always rules
,B00122C1WU,1,1,5,Classic!
,B00122C1WU,1,1,5,Seals & Croft are amazing and I love to listen to this to unwind at night. It's just an awesome song.  I love their music.
,B00122C1WU,1,1,4,Rock the way it was meant to be. Don't even make music like this anymore. Great time to be alive.
,B00122C1WU,1,1,5,"I've always loved this song and I love the fact that most of Amazon's songs are only .99 each, so I don't have to buy the entire album and get songs I either don't like or have never heard of."
,B00122D9OY,1,1,5,"if you have to ask, you ain't old enough, this is what got us through all that was chasing us."
,B00122D9OY,1,1,5,It All STAX UP!!!  Great Music from McLemore Street in MEMPHIS!!! This is why son many from MEMPHIS are in the ROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME!!!
,B00122A1G8,1,1,5,"This album is great because it has some of her music showing different sides to her talent, voice and potential. They are unique. It isn't like her other albums containing  mostly dance hits - which make this one different - especially ""Power of Goodbye"" which is my favorite."
,B00122D76O,1,1,5,Real classic
,B00122D76O,1,1,5,I love this song.
,B00122D76O,1,1,5,GOOD
,B00122D76O,-1,1,5,Great song from a great group. Real R&B not these watered down new R and B crap.
,B00122D76O,1,1,5,Super Classic...
,B00122D76O,1,1,5,"Philly's Blue magic's ""Sideshow"" is probably one of the most recognized 70's era r&b classic song you'll hear, hope you love it as much as I do.  Brings back those disco memories with the silky shirts, angels flights, crayons or platform shoes lol."
,B00122DAU2,1,1,5,I've always loved this song.  Used to sing it with my mother in my youth so it brings back many wonderful memories.
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,"Love these guys, going to see the play Jersey Boys this week."
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,"Great song that brings back memories of a simpler time.  Frankie Valli's signature voice leading the way is a great trip back in time.  Glad ""Jersey Boys"" has reminded us of this GREAT classic music."
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,"frankie valley & the four seasons
oh what a night great song, been
listening to them for years & enjoy."
,B00122DEFI,1,1,5,"First I have to thank MIGHTY AMAZON for announcing the reissue of this splendid album on a fully remastered compact disc. I've been yearning for it for years...I purchased it the instant I was notified!.
Overall the project is well written,arranged and produced,it's just like a zepher,a cool eveling wind. Without a doubt, this is MAJOR HARRIS greatest effort!.The songs here has truly stand the rugged test of time itself and are as new as if released yesterday!!!.
This soothing effort starts with the light,bouncy yet regretful ""EACH MORNING I WAKE UP"". The ultimate song here,my most favorite, is the steamy, highly erotic and most sensual ""LOVE WONT LET ME WAIT""!!!.The yearning, the pleading, the desperation,and the reaction is as real as it can ever be. The orgasmic moans/screams by BARBARA INGRAM is as vivid as ever!!!. She is literally writhing/ranting in heat/ecstasy, nothing is left to imagine. This is surely one of the greatest lovemaking songs ever recorded!!!.
Next is the airy ""SWEET TOMORROW"" and the most sad ""SIDESHOW"",originally done by the soul group BLUE MAGIC. ""TWO WRONGS"" bouncy yet regretful. Next is the hopeful ""LOVING YOU IS MELLOW"" a favorite. ""JUST A THING I DO"" is poetry in motion, I love this work of art as well. ""AFTER LOVING YOU"" is an expression of long lost love, lively yet a tad sad. Concluding this supreme effort is his remake of the classic ""MY WAY"", with his soothing tenor voice, he makes this song his very own. I recommend this one-of-a-kind record to all fans of True soul music...A dose of life itself...You will agree as you listen...A most worthy addition to your private stock...A True treasure indeed..."
,B00122DEFI,1,1,5,"Major Harris releases his debut album My Way in 1974-75.  He has a cool vibin' voice and flows easy over the melody: no wonder why the Delfonics had him join them in the early 70's after Randy Cain (R.I.P.) left.  Here, he gets some solo shine and makes a wonderful record with different tempos and styles.  The hit single: ""Love Won't Let Me Wait""  is a cool-vibin, jazzy, classy number, with some orgasmic girl moans at the end of the slow drag.  ""Sideshow"" is a mellow cover of a Blue Magic classic jam, and Major Harris handles it well.  Other slower jams include ""Just a Thing I Do"" and ""My Way.""  The other songs are more up-tempo and also are spirit and soul up-lifters.  ""Sweet Tomorrow"" is gorgeous, poetic, and romantic.  The swinging vibe of ""Loving You Is Mellow"" with the heavenly chorus chants is another mood lifter.  All the songs on My Way are great: Major Harris has a great voice.  Anyone who loves anything from Motown to Philly Soul and even softer Disco will love this wonderful album."
,B00122DEFI,-1,1,5,"I must confess, I have never had the privilege of listening to the album.  So, I can't judge it truly.  So, I'll have to rank it based on one song!  That being said, ""Love won't let me wait"" ranks up near the top in the category of romantic R&B/Soul ballads.  The year 1975 was a good year for romantic (black) music.  ""Love won't let me wait"" was NO exception, as it's a great song.

As this CD is an import, it's expensive ($38.99 as of 12/01/2006).  Third parties have cheaper (though not much).  This is going to force me to wait.  Oh well...(sigh)...Five stars...

**This update as of 05/12/2008!  Please note that the download that you can purchase of ""Love Won't Let Me Wait"" is for the 'single' version (under 4 minutes!).  The actual full-length song is between 5 to 6 minutes!  That means you are purchasing the single version!  So, beware!!!!**"
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,"Lovely song, but sound quality could be better."
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,"Love this song and have since, well, a very long time ago.  It brings back great memories of summers and beaches and youth.  I've been trying to get to Jersey Boys because I've heard great things about the play and how this song ""came to be"".  I to, like another reviewer, play it over and over...whether in my head, Kindle or PC."
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,One of the best beats ever great song.
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,Fun song that will get in your head! Nice to hear drummer Gerry Polci sing a song. I wish he had performed more! What a lovely voice.
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,greate
,B00122CB70,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B00122CB70,1,1,4,"Fun, classic song that I got for nostalgia reasons."
,B00122DBZ6,1,1,5,"The Von Bondies and their song ""C'mon, C'mon"" is the first band and song that I researched AFTER my purchase. Having read a little about them I'm not surprised to find out that they are an alternative band formed in the late 90's. ""C'mon, C'mon"" has all the features that attract me to alternative music (I do not claim to be an music expert and many times I do not follow bands, I simply go by what I like and my own interpretations of the music--if you listen long enough you're able to identify the rock, punk, and even some 70's sounds in  many songs that are considered or identified as alternative). For me at least, the influence of good old fashioned well known punk bands, like the Clash and American punk like the Ramones is clear even in ""C'mon, C'mon""--probably one of the reasons why I liked it and bought it.

I did not know that ""C'mon C'mon"" was used as the opening music for the TV show ""Rescue Me"" but this is besides the point. I have no idea what the lyrics mean and are beyond the scope of my review. However, they're simple enough, I've caught myself singing to this song and I usually don't sing. I love that anthem sound that is so particular of alternative music (also punk, yes?). In some crazy way, it reminds me of the Clash's ""Police on my back."" Crazy, but that's what it reminds me of.

I've given ""C'mon C'mon"" five stars because I'm very happy with my purchase. The worst I can say about this song is that when typing it out, it's an awkward contraction and spell check doesn't recognize it."
,B00122D2VO,1,1,5,I love jamming out to this song in my car. It's well written and excellent to listen to everywhere and anywhere.
,B00122D2VO,1,1,5,"Crazy For You, the one Madonna song that makes my song list. This song is well done all the way around, a must for intimate song lists."
,B00122D2VO,1,1,5,This is right at the start of Madonna's run at being the greatest female artist of all-time. She would do other ballads but few equaled the magic of Crazy for You.
,B00122D782,1,1,5,This is perhaps his most well known song.  Came out about 1968 or 69 and has stood the test of time.
,B00122D782,1,1,5,"Before 'ROCKY' or any other inspirational tune, THIS WAS THE ONE. For whatever reason, 'I've Gotta Be Me' has never been given the kudos of other inspirational tunes. When I say inspiration, I DO NOT MEAN GOSPEL. I mean songs such as 'The Greatest Love of All' which is about love for SELF. This is the best song for inspiration when fighting 'THE GOOD FIGHT'."
,B00122EGAU,1,1,4,"Rob Dougan is justly best-known for his track ""Clubbed to Death,"" which first appeared when Mo'Wax was a can't-miss label. And the cinematic quality which marked that track (as well as the track itself) reappear on his debut album, _Furious Angels_. More interesting, Dougan adds his hoarse vocals to his creations, which veer more towards country-western than to pure electronic music. It's an interesting combination, if not an entirely successful one. The title track has a gospel chorus that add tension to some potentially overwrough lyrics. ""Will You Follow Me?"" sounds as if it came straight off a soundtrack -- John Williams would be proud. Not sure what Mr. Williams would think of the dirge-like ""Left Me for Dead,"" however. At times, Dougan sounds as if he's straining his voice in an attempt at emotion, and it's at odds with the elegant orchestrations. When he doesn't try as hard, as on ""There's Only Me,"" he gets across a sense of desperation and sadness much better, as does the melancholy trip-hop and warbling Falsetto of ""Nothing At All."" Not surprisingly, on the instrumental disc, the tracks in which Dougan's vocals proved problematic feel improved with just the strings, but the ones in which the vocals were an asset feel slightly empty. But the most surprising track would be ""Drinking Song,"" which has much of the simplicity and directness of the Pogues' ""Fairytale of New York."" It brings romanticism to a drunken haze -- reminiscing with a gravelly voice."
,B00122E2WW,1,1,5,"Dire Straits - another favorite band, and this song is one of their very best! Mark Knopfler is still one of the greatest guitarists EVER."
,B00122EVOG,1,1,5,excellent
,B00122EVOG,1,1,5,Feels the music deeply. Love the voice and sound.
,B00122EVOG,1,1,5,"very satisfied, thank you"
,B00122EVOG,1,1,4,"If you are a Solomon Burke, this is one of his best.  I enjoy listening to this song often.  Brings back a lot of memories."
,B00122EVOG,1,1,5,"He could've been a contender.... in the way of Sam Cooke and Brooke Benton, this is a wonderful piece of music!"
,B00122EVOG,1,1,5,"If you have good headphones, this recording will blow you away, if you, like me, like oldies. Get it. It's good!"
,B00122EX9Y,1,1,5,I heard this song on an Amazon commercial recently and realized how much I loved this song when it first came out.  This is when Cher had a beautiful and powerful voice and Sunny did write some wonderful songs.  Brings back great memories from my childhood.
,B00122CATE,-1,-1,1,"If you like little men in bow ties who sing pop songs in Falsetto, then you might like this."
,B00122EX9Y,1,1,5,"Fun rhythm, can use it for Polka!!!!"
,B00122EX9Y,1,1,5,The best do I need to say anymore
,B00122EX9Y,1,1,5,Good Song
,B00122EX9Y,1,1,5,Great addition to my music collection.
,B00122EX9Y,1,1,4,Just love this song.
,B00122EO8Y,1,1,5,A great rocking song to jam out to. I only wish it would have included Jaded like in the video and on radio play.
,B00122FLH2,1,1,5,"I have always been a fan of Madonna's from day one. If I had to be any entertainer, I would be Madonna. Anything that she touches turn to gold. I love her!"
,B00122FLH2,-1,-1,3,I'm collecting all The BOND Movie songs by the original artists. Madonna is better on her own stuff in my opinion
,B00122FLH2,1,1,5,"Great film, great song. I am not a big fan of Madonna, sorry fans, but I am a big fan of Bond. I first saw 007 in a theatre and watched Dr. No. Yeah, I know that is old. I must admit though I have seen every Bond film. As far as this Theme song is concerned, as you listen to it, visions of the film will fill your head. All in all, excellent song, flawless recording, excellent purchase. Thanks again, Amazon. You are the best!"
,B00122FLH2,1,1,5,"This was a good buy because I have a few Bond music cd's without this song on it, and I didn't want to buy the newest Bond release again."
,B00122FVOU,1,1,5,Various artists have done it before but I really like the way Michael Buble sings it.  It's a nod to a time long gone bye.
,B001229998,1,1,5,This Kiss by Faith Hill. I absolutely love the playfulness of the love expressed in this song. Just wanted to add it to my collection.
,B001229998,1,1,4,great song
,B001229998,1,1,5,A real song about a real kiss.
,B001229998,1,1,5,I like song

,B001229998,1,1,5,"What a great CD, Faith Hill just melts my Heart and Soul when she sing, if you are a fan of Faith Hill and don't have this album, buy it."
,B001229998,1,1,5,Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!
,B001229998,1,1,5,I used this song in a fantastic CD I created. The CD is music to make love by...used 16 sexy and romantic songs.
,B00122FVOU,1,1,5,This song is sooo much fun and a bit sensual.  If you like a bit of crooning than check out this song and Buble.
,B00122FVOU,1,1,5,Love it.  He sounds like he's singing just to me.
,B00122FVOU,1,1,5,Love him
,B00122FVOU,1,-1,3,"This was a gift, so I cannot comment."

,B00122FO56,1,1,5,I have listened to these guys for nearly 30 years.  They still have it.  Great song.  I heard it on the local alt rock radio station and loved it.  Was surprised to hear a new Chili Peppers song but not surprised that it was such a cool song.
,B00122FO56,1,1,4,"...loving this group. I have been a fan even through all the member changes. Whether its powerful ballads, California tunes, or even funky grooves this group knows how to bring it."

,B00122HH8I,1,1,5,"This is a great album by a great band.  Dire Straits had some great songs in this album.  The Walk of Life is the best, but there are others worth a look.  I bought the Walk of Life mp3 and have played it about 100 times.  Can't beat it.  Still sounds fresh and thunderous as if brand new."
,B00122FSMU,1,1,4,Just like the energy of this song and Alonis' voice.  Not much else to say as songs are personal preference.
,B00122FSMU,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs from her.  She has a beautiful voice and her lyrics are spot right on.  This song reminds me to thank all the bad and good things in life for that is what makes life livable.
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,5,"Ever have one of those songs that you first  heard as a teenager and they hang with you for the rest of your life?  This is one of them.  Not sure how old I was when I first heard it, but it's stuck with me all these years.  One of those feel good songs with gorgeous harmonies that you can listen to and it makes you smile.

Nostalgia isn't a bad thing.  As long as you don't wallow in it.  But some songs deserve to be wallowed in, and this is one of them."
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,5,"I love this song, it just reminds me of being little and hearing it on the radio, and is a nice love song."
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,4,"What can I say except driving along the highway listening to Orleans doesn't get much better than that!
Enjoyed the music."

,B00122HMZQ,1,1,5,"listen to this when you feel sad and you will cheer up!
fun song and cute lyrics

love to listen to it and remember our wedding..."
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,4,Love it!
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,5,I love this song. It speaks to me from my childhood.
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,5,Great song
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,4,It's a song with not many lyrics but says a lot. I enjoy listening to it and I hope you do also.
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,5,love it
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,4,This song was a big dance hit in the '80's when friends of my older siblings were hitting the dance floor so I fondluy remember it from listening to their records
,B00122HMZQ,1,1,4,Pleasant and shiny. Good guitar line and vocal harmonies. I like the harmonica solo; it adds a bright splash of sun-drenched color. It's a joyful song about the wonderful craziness of being in love.
,B00122BA18,-1,1,4,Oh get over it.....This time of the season is not a happy Folger's ad for everyone. It is stressful and very hard for a lot of people who have experienced loss or have to endure loneliness at this time of year. Take the song for what it is.
,B00122HREM,1,1,5,I love the upbeat version of this song. Definitely worth the $1! This is the second thing I've purchased of Buble. I'm going to get the whole album!
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,5,"You either love the Ramones or you don't. If you don't, you might as well stop reading this review. I happen to love ""I Want to Be Sedated"". I listen to it at least once a day because it helps me make it thru the day. When you work where I work, it has a deeper meaning to you...."
,B00122HPJ4,1,1,5,"After a successful debut Tantric comes back with a more melody driven harder album. This album is not as heavy as their debut and has some songs too repetitive (Relentless,Alright) and others that sparked energy and displayed the harmonic vocals between Hugo and Todd. Songs like After we go,Falling away,Awake,Just once pushed this album further into recognition even though people chose to ignore this band and opted for others that didn't deserve the press. After this the three main members left and Hugo was left to carry on. Tantric will never be the same without the others,they made this band into what it was."
,B00122HPJ4,-1,-1,1,"A few months ago I went to a Tantric concert in Louisville, KY because my friend likes them. A band called Silvertide was opening for them, and let me just say Tantric was pahetic compared to them. The crowd sucked, that's why I hate modern alternative rock bands like this...the fan base is as boring as the music. All the people did was stand and watch. At the beginning of one song the Tantric's singer said ""This is for all you headbangers and moshers out there"" as if he expected someone to actually make a big movement like that, and I hope he didn't, 'cause if he did, he was disappointed. Simply put: the opening band blow the headliners away. How sad is that?"
,B00122HPJ4,1,1,5,"but...this is a great follow up from there debut, i highly recommend this cd to anyone.  the remake of the chain by fleetwood mac is brilliant.  i never really got into tantric until now but i don't know why.  there debut is really good to.  hey now is also a great song but there are so many other great tracks on this cd as well.  so go do yourself a favor and buy this cd and days of the new if you like it."
,B00122EPH4,1,1,5,"This is a very beautiful song sung by a very talented artist. Lots of meaning here, you will enjoy. One of her best."
,B00122EPH4,1,1,5,"My three favorite songs by Faith Hill are Mississippi Girl, Breathe and This Kiss. The songs are great, and even the videos (seen later) are great"
,B00122HPJ4,1,1,5,"Polished mosaic. A poignant description of Tantric's latest creation. Woven with layers of intricate melodies and huge, bold, rich harmonies. So crisp you could take a bite like a green apple and taste the burst of flavor! Honestly I was surprised. I was expecting something with a harder edge. This album cuts its own slice of American Pie. There are tracks with messages of social consciousness and responsibility without the element of  ""Feel Guilty bad human"" looming overhead. This troupe of musicians reminds me that there are, yes- artists who insist on putting forth their best effort. You can tell. So, what tracks stand out? Relentless is beautiful and has a very erotic rhythm to it. It's a Taqsim kind of thing. Winslow likes Change. Their rendition of Chains is indeed a compliment to Fleetwood Mac. Finesse! Chasing After- Wow, this song is like a fresh shot of double espresso. If this doesn't wake you up and get the blood going, see your doctor. This track flows into a segue with beautiful guitar and drum tracks. Falling Away- I don't think any other group can cover this song, it is truly Tantric. Can't touch this Baby! Hey Now- need I say more? Hero takes me back to an era of the `70's when life was full of California sunshine and the beach. I don't know why but that's where it takes me: San Onofre and Trestles, salty sea air and late afternoon blue skies. Rocks this ol' surfer girl. This is a very seductive album and is a must have for the True music collector. Very well worth the investment. Rich, and Winslow is never wrong! Winslow's rating:Full tail feather fan!
Winslow is my Double Yellowhead Amazon parrot and has impeccable taste in music."
,B00122HPJ4,1,1,5,"Tantric's sophomore effort is pure brilliance.  After hearing seeing them live, I immediately went out and bought their self-titled debut and every SECOND of the album was up to pitch, fantastic rock music.  So when I heard they were coming out with another album, I was ecstatic.  Though this album is a little more 'hard' then their first CD, it's still amazing and those acoustics made famous by Todd are still there.  Their first single 'Hey Now' is actually more like their old stuff.  My favourite song on the CD would have to be 'Hero', a brilliant done song.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac remake, the beginning doesn't really sound like Tantric but once it gets to the chorus, you can hear their signature sound.  From start to finish this album delivers and I cannot WAIT to hear more.  If you liked the first album from Days of the New, Tantric's first CD or just love rock music you won't be disappointed with this.

That was my review after the first week of having the CD, now I have a little more to say.  Tantric's 'After We Go' is a timeless album, it hasn't left my CD player since it's release.  It's one of those albums that you can put on replay for the rest of your LIFE and still want to hear more.  Each track is amazingly good, it's like a big juicy apple pie, rich and delicious.  The opener, 'Chasing After' is a fast paced starter, Hugo's vocals are extremely well done here, lyrically good as well.  'After We Go' is one of my favourites (tied with about 5 others), the background vocals surpass Hugo's...strange, no.  The talent of this band is overflowing.  'Falling Away' is musically, one of the best songs I've heard.  The guitar work is actually intelligent.  The first single 'Hey Now' is a single I actually love to listen to.  'Hero' which was my favourite song when I first got the CD has now dropped a fair bit, it's still brilliant - a somewhat sweet anthem, if that is an apology, I accept.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac cover, very well done of the classic, the chorus is hard edged, I love Hugo's vocals on the 'and if you don't love me now, you will never love me again', chills.  'Change The World' is a great song to start off if you're a new Tantric fan, it's not as experimental, still extremely well done.  'Just Once' is my favourite song, I think when I listen to it, I go into a different world, the guitars and vocals put me into this dream and I never want to wake up.  These last few songs are what I call the creme de la creme, the best damn music I've ever heard in a long time!  All of these are tied with 'After We Go' for my favourite after 'Just Once' - that didn't really make sense.  In any case, 'Relentless' is lyrically amazing, Hugo's vocals are sexy as hell.  'Alright' - what can I say, the chorus ... if you're a woman, you will get caught up in the vocals, I am telling you, there is nothing sexier than Hugo's vocals.  Todd - you are a god.  Always will be.  'Before' really, there isn't much more I can say ... if I had a thesaurus close by I would look up some more incredible words to describe it's brilliance.  Lastly, 'Awake', a great closing song but every time I get there I wish there was more.  I hit repeat for the time being and I am counting down the days for the next album!!"
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,4,Good song.
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,5,"Pleasantly punk and, oddly, Stephen King's (horror writer) favorite band. Up-tempo, legible, enjoyable - something you can jam to without getting too many odd looks or fines for public obscenity."
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,5,Great song
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,5,"Did not,want it,"
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,4,"One of the Ramones best songs, and one I like to listen to as I run. It is fun to hear some of these again."
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,5,All time great hit
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,5,Great Download
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,5,"I hate drug references in pop culture but despite that bias, I still find this song irresistibly irreverent and thoroughly enjoyable."
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite Ramones songs - I can't believe it took me so long to download it!
,B00122HGQ6,1,1,4,simple and yet stout great tune from a great classic band and catchy.  one for all libraries of heavy metal bands.
,B00122HGQ6,-1,-1,1,"Forced to learn to please my bandmates...what a piece of crap song! Guess I STILL miss my Chicago, BS&T, Tower of Power and oh YES...Allman Brothers tunes."
,B00122HRN8,1,1,5,Michael Buble has one of the smoothest voices of our generation.  It's very soothing to listen to him sing and he sings this popular song well.  It's a great love song.
,B00122HRN8,1,1,5,"This is the newest version of this song, very classy version of this song.
It has been done several times since Fred Astaire danced to it in the 1930's.
The song has been in several movies and also done by Rod Stewart a few years back."
,B00122HRN8,1,1,5,"Love the new make on the classics, and love Buble's work."
,B00122HRN8,1,1,5,Have always loved this song and Buble does a great job.
,B00122HRN8,1,1,5,Buble style for a classic Sinatra song.  Mellow song with a clear rendition with Michael Buble's touch.  One of the best singers of classic Sinatra style.
,B00122CCVU,1,1,4,"Good tunes, did I mention I dislike writing reviews ??"
,B00122CCVU,1,1,5,"When I was a teenager, every guy with a guitar wanted to play this song. Lots of memories. I love finding these old songs that use girls names."
,B00122CCVU,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00122CCVU,1,1,5,NOT the original (Van Morrison and Them recorded it) but a hit nonetheless for this group and the only version I was familiar with until I heard Van doing it.
,B00122CCVU,1,1,5,"The  fact that songs such as this are still available confers a degree of merit, I suppose.  I purchased this along with about thirty others from the period because I was sitting around feeling nostalgic for my youth and the days I shared with some friends in a band in Detroit (EVERYone in Detroit in the sixties was in a band).  Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it. The only thing remarkable about this group and those like it is that the guys only had one hit in them."
,B00122CCVU,1,1,5,"If you liked this song on your AM radio or record player download the digital version, its even better. Pure classic that should be in your collection."
,B00122CCVU,1,1,5,"I remember growing up in the 60's and hearing this version of Gloria as well as the version from Van Morrison and Them.  Though I liked them both I always thought that the Shadows of Knight version sounded cleaner, while the Them version sounded rough.  Anyway, I'm very happy that we can digitally download these great songs from the 60's."
,B00122ERX6,1,1,4,"This one of my favorite jazz songs, its smooth, great for a slow dance or candle light dinner, or just to relax too."
,B00122ERX6,1,1,5,"WOW - I just heard this song on Sirius & had to look him up on Amazon. Lee Ritenour is a new artist to me - love this song, but not sure which cd to choose from for more of his music."
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,"A friend told me about Josh Groban's songs. I purchased ""Ave Maria"" track and am glad I did. What a wonderful, dynamic voice. I've since purchased other tracks."
,B00122HRNI,1,1,5,"This one is a classic and I had to have it for my collection of smooth, easy, laid-back tracks."
,B00122HHP6,1,1,4,Very Good.
,B00122HHP6,-1,1,5,What a performance.
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,"If you love AVE MARIA and love Josh Groban, this pairing should delight.  It is a wonderful arrangement which features the range of Josh's voice.  Lovely!"
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,Wonderful album
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,Love the music. Thanks.
,B00122HHP6,-1,-1,3,Love his voice and his songs but this wasn't what I expected it to be. not worth it at all
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,i really like this song and the singer who has a voice out of this world that man was blessed with a beautiful voice thanks thomas a.
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,I have always loved this song. Josh Groban is amazing and he brings me to tears with this song. Amazing!!!!!!!
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,I love Josh Groban's voice and his rendition of this song.  This was another must add song to my Christmas playlist.
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,I love his singing.  Josh is so talented.  If I was married to him he would have to sing for his supper.
,B00122HHP6,1,1,5,So perfect! Makes one feel closer to Jesus and His mother even if you do not understand the language being sung.
,B00122J05G,1,1,4,"The Spinners have a long history. Started in Detroit in 1954, as of 2015 the group was still active, with Henry Fambrough the last surviving original member. Of that early quintet, baritone Fambrough, bass Patric Jackson and tenor Billy Henderson appear on their self-titled debut 1973 ATLANTIC Records LP (SD 7256). Technically considered an original, tenor Bobby Smith replaced James Edwards only weeks after the one-time Domingoes were formed. He's here, as is tenor Phillip Wynne, co-lead with Smith and a 1971 replacement for G.C. Cameron, who chose to stay with MOTOWN when the group left for ATLANTIC.

This album was a huge seller in its day. Certified Gold, an R&B #1 and #14 on BILLBOARD's 200.
Producer, arranger, conductor Thom Bell also plays keyboards.

Originally an ""A"" side, ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" peaked at #77 on the Hot 100
and reached #14 on BILLBOARD's R&B chart. Its flip side, ""I'll Be Around"" was the group's
first ever #1 (R&B). It also was a Hot 100 #3. ""Could It Be I'm Falling in Love"" and ""One
of a Kind (Love Affair)"" also made the R&B top spot, with the former a Pop #4 and the
latter peaking at #11 on the Hot 100. Four charting singles on one LP-- not bad!

,B00122J05G,1,1,4,"I love the Spinners and I have this album in the lp version.  However, the digital version of this album is different from the original.  The song, ""Love Don't Love Nobody,"" is not as it is on the original.  I was very disappointed with that.  Otherwise, this is a great album--the music takes one back to mellow times.  My husband and I often sit and listen to the lp version and reminisce."
,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"The hits are amazing, and the other songs all fall in line.  Smooth and soulful."
,B00122J05G,-1,1,5,Part of my Old School R&B collection!
,B00122J05G,1,1,5,The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"I was stunned to see that this album was out of print. I hope that is only a temporary condition, for this remains one of the very best soul albums of all time. A jewel of 70s soul for sure, but just an amazing collection of songs that hold up nearly 40 years later. Not a dud in the bunch. If these songs don't bring a smile to your face and soothe your soul, you ain't living!"
,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"It is a myth that soul was a singles medium. At least half a myth. In the 1960s, it was True. Most Motown albums were not meant to hold together as such. But when Stevie Wonder released Music Of My Mind in early 1972, he proved soul LPs could work as cohesively as any rock LP.

And so it went for Gamble and Huff and Thom Bell, the Philly Sound. Both the O'Jays with Back Stabbers and here, this first Spinners album, are just that: albums. Playing the singles on AM was AM's gain and lack of FM airplay was FMs loss.

The Spinners, the album, does not have a concept like the O'Jays Back Stabbers or Ship Ahoy.  Or does it? If love and passion can be a concept, it is best illustrated on this album

There is the Philly Sound, there is........well, easy there, let's climb one mountain at a time.  The lush horns, strings, vibes, and master vocals are wound into one massive, wonderful silk sheet of sound. I don't have to tell you, just listen. Wagner would be proud

""I'll Be Around,"" ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,"" ""One Of A Kind Love Affair."" Anyone born by 1970 or before grew up hearing these on the radio, and do you believe how stupid some of us were? We heard this music next to Daddy Dewdrop's ""Chick-A-Boom,"" or ""Have You Ever Been Mellow,"" by Oliva Newton John, and quickly ran to our King Crimson albums, unable to separate the prime rib from the beef jerky. The best soul from the worst pop. We look at ourselves now. Wagner would NOT approve.

More proof. Yeah, sure. Play part of Coltrane's Love Supreme next to Bobby Goldsboro's ""Honey,"" and run for the hills. The blimp has crashed. But take said 'Trane and then go into ""One Of A Kind Love Affair,"" and it will be the start of a one of a kind love affair--for you. Me too.

Talking jazz,  I almost forgot. There is jazz here, too. Check out the third track, ""Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You"" I needn't go into this, but it proves my point. All this wonderful music is wonderful music, some of which happened to be singles. But listen to The Spinners from start to end, like a stranger to this music, and all the richness and craft and variation, and there is a ton, holds together musically and conceptually.

What an  ALBUM"
,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"1972 and 1973 were the years that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success.  Now with producer/writer team Thom Bell/Linda Creed, and a deal on Atlantic, they Spinners' hard work finally paid off after years.  This joint is surely a winner, with some heavy hitting mid-tempo soul jams.  This one contains some legendary jams like the rolling funk of ""I'll Be Around"" and ""Could It Be I'm Falling in Love"" heavily laden with strings, a staple of Philly Soul.  ""I'll Be Around"" is one of my favorite soul jams of all time, and even though I am 10 years younger than the song is, I remember listening to it and loving it in junior high school (in the mid 90's) when L.A. hip-hop station Power 106 FM had time set aside time for old school jams.  Rapper Rappin' 4-Tay also made his own version of it in 1994, a wonderful hip-hop jam which took the funky rolling music and some of the hook vocals for the rap song.  Another one of my favorites here is ""Just Me and You Baby,"" a slower, ballad type jam with heavenly harmony.  ""Ghetto Child"" is heavy mid-tempo jam exploring the bad side of growing up in the `hood, very sad and timeless.  ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" is a sadder lyrically rich song laden with sitars later in the song.  Phillipe Wynne, Bobbie Smith (great singers), and company surely deliver a rich album full of lush Thom Bell production and sweet harmony and melody; the transition from Detroit to Philly surely was a lucrative one.  1974's Mighty Love is another wonderful soulful album as is 1975's Pick of the Litter.  The Spinners are definitely essential listening in order to truly experience what Philly Soul has to offer."
,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"A fter enduring several years of corporate neglect at Motown, The Spinners signed with Atlantic Records and their chart fortunes changed drastically--for the better. This all-time classic album includes the masterpieces ""I'll Be Around"", ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love"", ""I Could Never (Repay Your Love)"" and ""Ghetto Child"" and is rightly regarded as a milestone of 1970s R&B. The Spinners' association with the great Thom Bell would result in some of the best Soul Music ever recorded but this was their first--and best--collaboration."
,B00122J05G,1,1,5,A great album - remastered for today - get it at a good price and enjoy it!  Five stars...
,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"I first had this ""album"" on 8 track back in the seventies. That was when the SPINNERS ruled that airways with ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" and ""I'll Be Around"". A double sided hit on one 45 RPM. Then came ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love"". Oh God, we all went Spinners crazy. Anyone who grew up on Black Soul music knows that one of the hardest thing to do, is to answer the question ""WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME?"" Could It Be I'm Falling In Love is one of my unforgettable favorites. GHETTO CHILD tells such a beautiful story. SOUL,is the music that I grew up with. SOUL, is the music that I love. I bought this CD, to fall in love again. I am no longer a teenager and I LOVE APPRECIATE and CHERISH, CLASSIC BLACK SOUL MUSIC, NOW MORE THAN EVER. FOREVER,AMEN!"
,B00122FMFI,1,1,5,"You most likely know who Madonna is and how ""Dress You Up In My Love"" sounds. You know if you like the song or not. I can tell you it's catchy and fun, full of energy and just plain great to listen to and I can tell you it's not on the ""Immaculate Conception"" compilation.
So my choice was to buy the mp3 version of this song to put on (what else) my mp3 player. Obviously, I like the song. If you like the song and don't want to buy the whole album (most of the songs are duplicated in other collections), here it is - go for it!"
,B00122IZT8,1,-1,3,"This is an okay CD, I mean its hard to rate a CD. If you like a group you like them. If you don't you don't. How do you rate a CD?"
,B00122IZT8,1,1,5,"This is one of my all time favorite songs. Perfect for the holidays to play for others to subtly point out the ridiculousness of the overly commercialized ""holiday"" season."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,I downloaded this to add to a bizarre collection of music for a Christmas party.  Everyone loved the different genres offered.
,B00122IZXO,-1,1,5,"Once again, this is one of the only Goo Goo songs that ever gets any airplay, though they do have a good repertoire of additional songs.  Such is the sad state of American radio. At any rate, this is a heartfelt plea and statement from an anguished speaker, with a somber feeling to it--not a happy dance song by any means, but one that will resonate with many listeners."
,B00122J2OU,1,1,4,Emmylou can sing just about anything in her high clear voice.  Have listened to her for years. I wish she wasn't getting old like the rest of us.
,B00122J2OU,1,1,5,"I absolutely love this song. Back in the day when I was a little girl, I would hear my grandparents playing the song because it would come on the radio which now makes me feel old but I'm only 38. I love older songs and this is one of many that Emmylou Harris wrote that is still popular to this day."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,excellent song.
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,This song so fit the movie is was part of the soundtrack for. I recently saw the movie again and had to add it to my playlist.
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,An old favorite
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,Love it
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,"Like most people, I only buy songs I've already heard and liked, so...yeah, I think it is good."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,another great goo goo dolls song
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,Another awesome song
,B00122IZXO,1,1,4,Great song from a great movie.
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,GREAT SONG.
,B00122IZXO,-1,1,5,"I like this song, but it came out while I was in high school. It may not be what some people are into, so decide for yourself."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,One of the BEST SONGS EVER!!!
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,You cant go wrong with this song or band they are awesome i love their music they are rhe bomb
,B00122IZXO,1,1,4,There is something beautifully harrowing about this song.  I love to listen to it.  Great guitar solo and vocals. Good buy.
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,Very awesome song to have and to listen to. Really like the lyrics and the whole beat and tune of the song.
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,"I am just flat-out in love with this evocative, haunting, moody and gorgeous song.  It makes my heart ache and soar at the same time."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,"A lot of great songs has a hook that captures your attention.  It could be a guitar lick, a certain lyric, or just the tune that is stuck in your head for a time.  What makes a song a truly great song is one that moves you every time you hear it.  Iris is one of those songs.  Lyrically, it's one of the better songs from the last twenty years.  The melody, along with John Rzeznik's gravely, almost desperate vocals, makes for a hauntingly beautiful song of forbidden love.  It's ironic that the song appeared in the 1998 film City of Angels with Nicolas Cage because he has always played the guy from the wrong side of the tracks whose characters would make any potential girlfriend's family nervous."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,I received my item smoothly very fast and with no problems at all. It was received immediately and one of my best transactions!
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,"Every time I hear this song it makes me think of City of Angels, when Meg dies and Nick falls from Heaven."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,4,I am a huge fan of this group and this is one of my favorite songs that they have put out. When I found this song I knew I had to have it and the discounted price just made it even more appealing.
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,"Sometimes I come to know a group that has been around for sometime.  Such is the case with the Goo Goo Dolls.  After hearing Iris on a classic music station, I must say that I am now a die hard fan.  And John is really good eye candy."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,"What do you say, If you like it buy it.  I like Train as well, calling all angels, etc.  download for movies and music is easy from amazon."
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,"Great old song.  Quality of sound is really good, compared to the records we used to listen to this song on.  Worth the dollar."
,B00122IZXO,-1,-1,3,Seems to have been well received. The selection came off of their wish list so I expected them to enjoy it and they did.
,B00122IZXO,1,1,5,"This tune is actually one of my husband favorites song. Not a a big GooGoo Dolls fan, but this a good song."
,B00122IR1O,1,1,4,A good song.
,B00122IR1O,1,1,5,"Some of the best music is from alternative artists, like this one, and are therefore not always forefront in the public eye."
,B00122IR1O,1,1,5,"Love this band and especially this track..........perfect for my collection of songs for my IPOD, glad I bought this, Thanks again!!"
,B00122IR1O,1,1,5,"Good quality sound & no crackling sound like you get from some songs that you download from Amazon.com.  If you like this song, I recommend this to you."
,B00122IR1O,1,1,5,A great song that I heard at a friends house a couple of time and had to add it to my collection.
,B00122JNL2,1,1,5,"Classic Prince what's not to love about it...it's one repeat every evening. If you love classic prince, you'll love this song!"
,B00122HOX6,-1,-1,3,its okay i thought it would be better.
,B00122HOX6,1,1,5,"It's witty, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable!"
,B00122IZP2,1,1,5,The Goo Goo Dolls were big in the 90's and Slide was one of thier greats. It is still enjoyable to listen to today.
,B00122HOX6,1,1,5,like all the versions - but be careful - not for young ears...there are some 'bad words' and 'terms' they should not hear but cute for adults.
,B00122HOX6,1,1,5,"Awesome. Loved it. Listening to this is one of my absolute favorite ways to celebrate every winter season. Adam Sandler, you will never stop rocking my world."
,B00122HOX6,1,1,5,"I loved it from the first and have been a fan of Adam Sandler all along.  Love all his songs, but these are the best!  This is an essential must have for the holidays as far as I am concerned."
,B00122IZP2,1,1,5,Love anything Goo Goo!  This is an oldie but such a goodie! They are the best!
,B00122IZP2,1,1,5,"This song is very catchy and while I do not much care for the Goo Goo Dolls since they went mainstream, this song motivated me to buy it.  I love the feel and the lyrics.  It's just a great song.  :)"
,B00122IZP2,1,1,5,"ONE OF FAVORITE SONGS BY THE GOO GOO DOLLS..GREAT TUNE FOR MY COLLECTION FOR MY IPOD,SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS, FAIR PRICE TOO!"
,B00122JNLC,1,1,5,great
,B00122JNLC,1,1,5,One of the best songs he ever did even though it's little known. Very upbeat and fun to listen to when you're working out or just want a pick me up.
,B00122JNLC,-1,1,5,What can I say...It's Prince!!!
,B00122JNLC,1,1,5,One of my favorite of Prince's funk jams...Took me back to my college-party days!
,B00122JNLC,1,1,5,"This song is from one of the first Prince albums I've ever owned. The album was given to me on vinyl for a Christmas gift many years ago. So without a doubt I wanted it in my digital library, right along side my other Prince collection."
,B00122KG7M,1,1,5,"i liked the song & all good here. no need to add more but filling out required words, that's all."
,B00122KG7M,1,1,5,"I love this song. It's the Phil Collins that I prefer over the more schmaltzy one. This is the Phil Collins that brings forth images of gritted teeth and pain and darkness. Was also recently used in Grand Theft Auto IV to great effect. One of Genesis's best songs, period."
,B00122IUHA,1,1,5,"I loved this song.  But, I no longer have it on my computer or cloud drive since I had to have my computer repaired."
,B00122IUHA,1,1,5,"Excellent song to listen to when I'm busy writing the sequels to my books The Ice Witch-Tribes, The Ice Witch 2-Seers of solstice, Dinosaur Dreams-Indian Trails, Utopia Six-The New Planet, Open Season-A Psychopath Created and The Swamp Priestess all on Amazon kindle ebooks only $2.85 each by David Charles Leitner."
,B00122IUHA,1,1,5,"Same review as the rest. A good song with a wonderful story in it. It drives home a point about how life really is, and it shines a light upon what the ""little things"" in life can really mean."
,B00122IUHA,1,1,5,Great Jam to add to the music library!
,B00122IUHA,1,1,5,Very touching song.
,B00122IUHA,1,1,5,The best
,B00122IUHA,1,1,5,"What a moving song, must hear for all military family's, glad to be able to download songs to my Amazon 3 cloud account."
,B00122KBXG,1,1,5,"Excellent service, very good listening, great addition to collection of R&B music. Delivery was recieved well within the timeline for delivery. Product arrived in great condition.
CD is everything I expected and I enjoy it a lot. A must for anyone wanting to collect this genre of music."
,B00122KBXG,1,1,5,"After they left Motown they put out a string of great hits and some classic tunes as a group, and with guest vocalists.  Great dance music and tunes you will hear a lot at wedding receptions.
Cannot go wrong with this one.  You will love it."
,B00122KBXG,1,1,4,"I really wanted to get ""Games people play"", but I got many many good hits on this cd."
,B00122KBXG,-1,-1,3,"My only gripe is that the quality on this ""remastered"" version sounds almost identical to the original compilation I bought a few years ago on Rhino. If you're buying for the music, it's a great starter set...the remastering, however, is insignificant on this release."
,B00122KBXG,1,1,4,"In the same tradition of the great Motown groups like the Temptations and the Four Tops a decade earlier, The Spinners were the most successful soul group of the Seventies compiling an amazing seven million-selling singles with hits like ""I'll Be Around,"" Could It Be I'm Falling in Love"" and ""The Rubberband Man."" Tracks 1-10 were all produced and arranged by Thom Bell.  My only complaint is that this collection omits the Top 20 hit ""I'm Coming Home."" [It should have been included in place of ""How Could I Let You Get Away,"" which was the Spinners' debut single release on Atlantic, but was replaced by the b-side:  ""I'll Be Around.""] While not as comprehensive as some other anthologies, this is a hit-packed collection of the Spinners' essential hits.  RECOMMENDED"
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,I CRY WHENEVER  I HEAR THIS SONG. I WISH I WAS A TEENAGER AGAIN. THOSE WAS THE BEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,"This song make an excellent collection to my mp3 collection.
Highly recomended for any music lover that loves music from before the 2000s"
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,"Was my favorite when I was a teenager,very hard to find,except here,keep up the good work, I will continue purchasing"
,B00122KK82,1,1,5,"I absolutely love Dusty Memphis' voice.  I remember hearing this song for the first time like it was yesterday.  My Mom, Sister and myself all have put this song in our ipods.  I also love the song she did with the Pet Shop Boys ""What have I done to deserve this.""  I hope you enjoy this song at least half as much as my family and I do!"
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,good music
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,I am totally in love with this song so I can listen to it again and again whenever I want a really good memory. Great quality and sound.
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,Great song
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,"One of my very favorites, love it."
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,Great song
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,I love this song! Excellent quality recording. And now it's a part of my music library.
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,Enjoy this song
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,love it!
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,4,I remember hearin this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and bushy mustache just like England Dan
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,Great!
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,"This song reminds me of the beach for some reason. My brother-in-law used to play this on his guitar. Great song, great artists!! Thanks Amazon for single Mp3's that can be downloaded."
,B00122JWJ0,1,1,5,My parents used to listen to this band and I recall hearing it around the house quite a bit growing up. The sound quality was good without fluctuating volume.
,B00122KQ7M,1,1,5,great song
,B00122KQ7M,1,1,5,I love this album it is good for the soul and ministers to your heart and is in good taste.
,B00122KQ7M,1,1,4,Heard this song while watching The Polar Express and it was beautiful. This Christmas I thought I must have it
,B00122KQ7M,1,1,5,"My children love this movie and they love this song.  Whenever this comes onto the playlist, everybody starts singing along.  It's well produced and the kids singing give a nice interpretation."
,B00122KQ7M,1,1,5,"I really love The Polar Express. The soundtrack really makes the movie! ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" is actually my favorite song from the film so I definitely found it necessary to buy this song!"
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,One of the greatest Christmas songs of all time!  I misplaced my CD but bought the digital download of it.
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,Just a funny song that has alot of great memories for me. My kids love it a much as I do I think. Great price and good for playing all year round for a laugh.
,B00122KQ5E,1,1,5,"No words needed!  IMO, one of the best Chili Pepper songs.  Maybe to mainstream for some hardcore fans, but I liked it."
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,"I love this, I looked for this song for so long."
,B00122JZ6A,1,-1,3,good
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,4,a funny way of the 12 days of christmas
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,This recording always brings a chuckle around the holidays.  It says everything you are thinking about while out getting ready for the holidays
,B00122KCSU,1,1,5,"There are fewer and fewer True musicians like Al Stewart playing Real Music AND Real instruments these days.  Go ahead, be good to yourself and ""Don't Say No""  to this treat and feast for the senses!"
,B00122KCSU,1,1,4,"An atmospheric, writerly piece of AOR pop from the late 70s.  Two lines describe the effects of war with breezy efficiency - ""Noone notices the customs slip away"" and ""On my wall the colors of the maps are running.""  The suffering caused by arms dealers seems so far away."
,B00122KCSU,1,1,5,"On The Border is one my favorite Stewart songs.  Full of mystery and history, which some of his songs are noted for.  Purchase and download were simple and quick."
,B00122KCSU,1,1,5,"I know I made an inflammatory statement by saying the Best song by Stewart,but for me that is so.  Other songs like ""Year of the Cat"" are well done, but I like this one better, mostly because of one line (""On the Border"") that is repeated a couple of times throughout the song.  It has some nice lines in it that are somewhat historic in nature, and it is a smooth song (nice voice, nice backup instruments)."
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,crazy fun
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,A Christmas favorite.
,B00122KT9C,1,1,4,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.
,B00122KOBA,-1,1,5,"NOT ON HER HITS, NEEDED ON MY CELL , ALL HER SONGS PERFECT POP, THIS HIT 5 ON BILLBAORD WHY NOT ON GREATEST HITS NEVER KNOW"
,B00122KOBA,1,1,5,Like this song from way back.  She knows how to mix songs.
,B00122KOBA,1,1,5,I have been a Maddona fan since I was a little girl.  Her music is timeless and this is an excellent song.
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,"My Christmas season is not complete until I hear ""12 pains of Christmas"".  It just brings such a joy to hear others having challenges with all that goes on in the season."
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,But hilarious! It seems to encompass all the things people frustrate over during the holidays. I laugh every time I hear it.
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,"classic song
as my son and I were 'stringing the lights' and could not find the stupid plug -
we both thought of this song!  I immediately downloaded it!
it is so funny and True!
'she's such a witch- I hate her!....one light goes out, they all go out...sending Christmas cards....""
very cute!"
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,This song describes all of the things that happen during December that we all hate. It is hilarious....and so True!
,B00122JZ6A,1,1,5,"I'm not one for the modern STUFF they try to call music.
Growing up in the 70's as a teenager as I did.
But, this song is GREAT, funny, and that's why I bought it.
You should to!"
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,I recently purchased prince/1999 from the amazon store and downloaded it to my kindle fire/hd and enjoy listening to it with my personal headphones.
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,4,"Who doesn't remember 1999 and the crazy millennium y2k --oh yeah, kids born in/after 2000,  besides them, this soong was a great rocking dance tune for midnight 1999..I was there"
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,"I love Prince and It's very rare when you find a artist
that can compare, I wish prince would help new acts
I love this Cd
I think that new Artist Tiec Tocc is the new prince in his own way
I love his song Frozen"
,B00122JW8Q,1,1,5,"This is a all time classic,I had the single on colored vinyl on Bearsville back in the day,they used this in the film Kingpin!"
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,I like it
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,Excellent
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,4,Everyone knows that this is a really good song. if you don't buy and you will enjoy it.
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,great song
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,The Best!
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,It's Prince. Nothing else needs to be said.
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,"It is classic Prince, what more can I say a song that will live on. Even though the year 1999 is long gone, this still song  it's still fun to listen to. I will say I'm not too thrilled with the song 's introduction (the first 30 seconds). It was definitely good purchase."
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,love
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,A good old timer.
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,I'm still grieving over Price's death 2 months later. I am interested in anything about his life or photos new to me. Nothing compared 2 U Prince! I luv your kindness to animals being a vegan & the musical genius that you are. Purple Rain was a musical masterpiece! Your legacy will live on forever!
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,I have owned more copies of 1999 than any other album.
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,A great artist.
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,"Can't get any Prince songs on Amazon Prime Music, so had to purchase, but I love Prince, so I had to."
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,It's Prince.........no review nor anymore needs saying!!
,B00122K0OQ,-1,-1,1,MY PARTY IS OVER IT'S 2016 AND I WANT TO PARTY LIKE IT'S 1999
,B00122JW8Q,1,1,5,Great song
,B00122JW8Q,1,1,5,Don't you just Love Todd !
,B00122JW8Q,1,1,5,Excellent song.
,B00122JW8Q,-1,1,5,A
,B00122JW8Q,1,1,5,"One of those classics...will always remember him...love his music...actually listened to it today at Bass Lake, CA ...in the rain....it was fun"
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,PARTY SONG OF THE 90'S
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,"One of his top 3 best ever. Will become a classic, if not already."
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,"Great music,so sad"
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,Great
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,I forgot about so many of his great songs. This is definitely a must own!
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,The best
,B00122IVQ0,1,1,5,"This is old school rap with some heavy rocking and intense drums.  When you are feeling down about who you are and whether or not people want to hear what you have to say, pop this song on your digital player and sing to the world!

You will feel empowered by Faith No More's driving style and while you are doing the moves, do the rap and join in with what I consider to be one of the best of their songs!"
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,Love PRINCE!!!
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,A legendary song
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,RIP Prince
,B00122K0OQ,-1,1,4,A good reason to party 'cause it's just like 1999.
,B00122KLMW,1,1,5,"Already knew about it, so what more is there to say?  Love him, and love the song.  I urge anyone to add it to their collection."
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,4,ok
,B00122K0OQ,-1,1,5,Dance!
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,original
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,4,"I like how his songwriting in ""1999"" describes how the Biblical Rapture goes to a tee.  Prince has Church roots which lends a hand to his songwriting.  However, I've always know  him as a sex symbol.  Of course, ""1999"" contains typical Prince beats that are associated with his material.  You know its Prince whenever you hear it."
,B00122K0OQ,1,1,5,If you had to describe a song that defined a performer in my opinion 1999 is it. While everything he did was a hit this was right up there as one of the all time greats#
,B00122KC8A,1,1,5,Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
,B00122K0QE,1,1,4,I remember this song more from the use on captain kangaroo but hey great song an imaginative songwriting. Girl you gotta take me for a lil ride up an down in an out around your leg. Awesome
,B00122K0QE,1,1,4,"I truly appreciate his uncompromising approach to his music, doing what he wants with it and creating a sound that is uniquely his. Delirious is a great dance tune as well as one you can sing along with. I like that and I think you will, too."
,B00122K0QE,1,1,5,"I have loved this Prince song for so many years!! Prince has been a great entertainer for so very many, many years."
,B00122KDDO,1,1,5,A great classic song.
,B00122KDDO,1,1,5,I was listening to my old albums recently. Decided to download my favorite songs to my computer.
,B00122KDDO,-1,1,5,"Come on, it's Joni Mitchell!"
,B00122K0QE,1,1,5,I forgot about so many of his great songs. This is definitely a must own!
,B00122K0QE,1,1,5,Great song.
,B00122K0QE,1,1,5,Awesome!
,B00122K0QE,1,1,5,One of my favorite Prince songs-makes me motivated and energetic.
,B00122K0QE,1,1,4,He was sooooo Cool whenever I was growing up in the 80's You didn't know what was coming next from Prince. After all I did like Purple Rain.
,B00122KDDO,1,1,5,nice addition to my play all the time music list.
,B00122KDDO,1,1,4,"I chose the long (almost 6 minute) version because I had never heard it.  I much prefer the version from the single she recorded, which I would give five stars.  This song and Send In The Clowns are two of my all time favorites."
,B00122J4U2,1,1,5,Sad and sweet
,B00122J4U2,1,1,5,A throwback for me and I really enjoy it.
,B00122J4U2,1,-1,3,"""Think Of Laura"" is another mellower than mellow track from Christopher Cross.  The song was written to mourn the death of a college friend and it appropriately sanguine. ABC's General Hospital began using the song for their show in reference to the love between  the series' two biggest characters Luke & Laura.  The use in the series helped propel the song to number 9 in early 1984 and was Mr. Cross' final top ten single despite the fact that people remember the song in the wrong context."
,B00122J4U2,1,1,5,"The first time I heard this song, I fell in love with it. Chris Cross sings it with such heart and compassion that one feels like they knew Laura (who this song is about). On this song, Laura represents a person that is a very good,kind and helpful person who dies at a young age. However, this Laura (as represented in this song) will always be remembered by many lives she touched. And this song is so inspiring because I knew a person like the Laura in this song that made such a difference in my life and many lives yet was taken too soon.
This song is all about this:  It is not the time and years one spends on this earth, but what one does with the time and years that counts. Whenever I play this song, I think about the inspiring lesson that this song teaches.

Very highly recommended!"

,B00122KDDO,-1,-1,1,"I like the song. Something changed at the store and as I bought this song, I ""continued shopping"". I got one of the 3 songs I was charged for. I did not get this song. I'll try again at some point. I bought another song a few days ago, so it seems to me that as long as you buy 1 song at a time there isn't a problem."
,B00122KDDO,1,1,5,"purchased it because I wanted it on MP3.  Every time I watch Love Actually this song gets stuck in my head, so now I have it on my computer to play easily any time I want."
,B00122KDDO,-1,-1,3,Joni Mitchell does a lot of fancy playing around with background music but the song winds up sounding like she's been smoking too many joints. Since I loved the version by Judy Collins you might say I'm prejudiced but I suggest you listen to both versions before jumping to conclusions.
,B00122KZBY,1,1,4,"It turns out the old saying is True: The family that plays together, stays together. Four siblings and their best pal make up indiepop group Eisley, whose debut EPs hinted at what they could do. And ""Room Noises"" certainly proves that their airy, whimsical pop was worth the long wait for.

Some of the songs are from those EPs, although they sound a bit tighter and smoother. For example, the heartbreaking ode to the bullied, ""Telescope Eyes,"" or the prettily whimsical ""Marvelous Things."" Despite the airy poesy of the songs, there's a distinctly melancholy streak through the album, which peaks at the very beginning: ""Memories,"" a haunting song about a woman mourning her husband's suicide.

Despite a few EP songs, they also have quite a few new songs, like the enchantingly sunny ""Golly Sandra,"" which has echoes of the Beach Boys. But the sparkling pop vibe continues in other songs, carried over in piano melodies and smooth guitar riffs. ""Still floating soft/I am dreaming and I'm glad I lost/And still with my fingers/I'm drawing circles in the water,"" the song goes, as fluid as the water it talks about.

That mixture of bittersweetness and innocent optimism is what makes Eisley so darn appealing. Nowhere are the stereotypical I-just-wanna-have-fun or my-boy/girlfriend-dumped-me-and-now-I-wanna-swim-with-the-toaster music for THIS pop band. While they have some love songs, the emphasis is on their enchanting kind of whimsy.

That whimsy carries over into just about whatever they sing about, whether it's Sherri and Staci singing about dragons in the woods, sunlight and butterflies, or metal teeth and ""telescope eyes."" Some of the lyrics seem to stray into Flaming Lips-type surrealism, but are also grounded by simple sentiments like, ""You have shining eyes, yes like those forest lights, and it makes me want to cry.""

After the past few years, with the group rapidly moving out of the teen bracket, one would wonder if Stacy and Sherri Dupree's angelic vocals would have gotten... well, not so pretty. No problem with that -- they sound a bit like younger versions of Beth Gibbons or perhaps Hope Sandoval. The two girls even interplay their vocals in on song, with remarkable skill and spine-tingling results.

At the start of one song, the line ""Congratulations, we've finally made it"" is sung. And so Eisley has -- and this promising band only shows signs of getting even better in albums to come."

,B00122KGOU,1,1,4,"Big log was released on Robert Plant's second solo album which was released in 1983. The song features the classic line ""My love is in league with the freeway"" which would be enough to justify its existence alone. The music is laid back, guitar biased and compelling. Theguitar line draws you into the song and Plant's voice works well and conveys the sense of longing for a lost love which is at the heart of the lyrics. The title seemingly has very little to do with the song. This isn't a great treadmill song. It's a late night last beer/last cigarette song which is lyrical and longing."
,B00122KGOU,1,1,5,What can I say I love anything Robert Plant does. 
,B00122KZBY,-1,-1,3,"3.5 stars

Eisley's debut L.P. ""Room Noises"" is a perfectly good debut record. There is more potential for greatness on this record then I have heard in some time from any band, if they only reach it occasionally.

""Memories"", the records lead off track, is the records best ssong, all minor key harmonies and a twisting, melodic as all else breakdown which is one of the coolest things I have heard this year. The next song ""Telescopic Eyes"" is another keeper, showcasing the bands darker form of melodic pop, catchy enough for radio but different enough for the rest of us.

From there the record is spotty. Or actually it's not. There really isn't a quote-unquote bad song on the record, it just gets a bit same soundy as it goes on. The group shows such potential and talent on the first handful of tunes that as the record goes on and the song remains the same you get kind of dissapointed. Maybe some changes in tone, maybe a little, just a little distortion, maybe some different types of arrangements could fix this problem. I don't know.

But I say buy this record. It is good, and this band could very easily be great a record or two from now. ""Room Noises"" is promising, even if it doesn't deliver fully on said potential. But I'll tell you one thing:

I can't wait to hear what they do next."

,B00122KGOU,-1,-1,3,"Don't care for the re-master or the transfer of this recording.  It often automatically presumed that because a recording has been re-mastered, or transferred from analog to digital, that it's better.  Not so in many cases.  Re-mastering often over-compresses the original recording and results in the equivalent of a poor mix.  Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.

In the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.  Extremely disappointing.

,B00122KGOU,1,1,5,One of Plant's best - filling out my catalog! I only wish amazon's downloads would be offered in a LOSS-LESS COMPRESSION FORMAT...
,B00122KGOU,1,1,5,Lead song from the album Priciple of Moments. A very good guitar song with the great Robert Plant singing the words bringing them to life. My Mum loved this song.
,B00122KGOU,1,1,5,"good song, grew up listening to this group and glad to find it here. Amazon is my choice of finding music i like."
,B00122KGOU,1,1,4,"It is more sophisticated and densely nuanced.  The song, like almost any song by the Band Led Zepplin, is well constructed and nicely produced.  The meaning is enigmatic but it allows many differing interpretations and I do not think that is bad.  With many lasting works of art, it will elicit different emotions and address many topics depending on the audience.  It starts with a simple , almost latin melody, and Robert comes in quietly and without hurry.  His narrative is leading and his melody makes you feel as if there is actual movement.  His matter of fact delivery is in line with his more mature sensibilities and the desperate angst of his youth is replaced with tension but not desperation.  At the end the melody continues even after the singer has completed his part.  Is it symbolic?  It is to me and that is all I can say."

,B00122KZBY,1,1,4,"5 Stars if you're new to Eisley; 4 Stars for the rest of us

Eisley has released 2 EPs in early and late 2003, the excellent ""Laughing City"" and ""Marvelous Things"". For whatever reason, it's taken over another year for the release of their debut album. The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there, and Coldplay's Chris Martin is a big fan as well (Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour).

""Room Noises"" (12 tracks, 41 min.) is full of dreamy, yet very catchy songs, not unlike, say, Sixpense None the Richer. The best songs are in the first half of the album, including the opener ""Memories"", ""I Wasn't Prepared"", ""Memories"" (the standout track of the album), and ""Brightly Wounded"" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers. Other great tracks are ""Plenty of Paper"", a great up-tempo song, and the closer ""Trolley Wood"".

What keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs (in newly recorded versions), and that's disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning. We want more new songs! Finally, the Amazon listing shows a bonus track (a remixed version of ""Lost at Sea"") but the CD I bought doesn't have it, hmmmm... Regardless, Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I can't wait to see them live! ""Room Noises"" is highly recommended!"

I also wish they would have included the 12 inch version of ""Something Just Ain't Right. It's a better version of that song.  M' faves include I Want Her, Twisted, Nobody, My Body, I'll Give All My Love 2 U, Something Just Ain't Right, Don't Stop Ur Love"", bascically all of it.  Keith Sweat has one of the most unique voices in R and B history and this album showcases all of his talent."

,B00122LLQ2,1,1,5,"This was the hottest song in the eighties.  I just love it.  It was great then and even greater now in my opinion.  I wish that the artist from the seventies, eighties and nineties could make a come back and bring back all the good tunes."
,B00122KC4E,1,1,5,"Keith Sweat is one of the premeire R&B soul singers in the game. Although Mr. Sweat hasn't released a CD of new material in four years, I'm really anxious to see what he could do with the writing skills of Ne-Yo, Sean Garret, Johnta Austin and the production of The Underdogs. The Best of Keith Sweat: Make You Sweat compiles most of the tracks that made R&B crooner Keith Sweat one of the most popular and influential of the '90s new jack swingers. Along with Teddy Riley, Tony! Toni! Ton&eacute;!, and Bell Biv Devoe, Sweat defined the forward-looking but history-mindful new jack sound that combined old-school aesthetics with hip-hop rhythms. Culled from all five of his consecutive number one R&B albums, the tracks here include such ubiquitous radio hits as ""I Want Her"" and ""Make You Sweat"" along with stellar singles including ""Nobody"" and solid album cuts like ""My Body."
,B00122KC4E,1,1,4,"For starters I have around 700 - 725 cd's, only about 12 are R&B cd's, so you can see I'm not a huge R&B fan, but I do like some of it.  Keith Sweat is one of those few I like.  With 17 songs (1 is just an extended version so it's 16 total songs), you get some of his finer songs.  Although he has 6 albums, about 40% of the songs on here are from his debut, and a few albums only have 1 song represented on here but nevertheless it's a nice collection.  It has 2 classics, 2 almost classic songs, only 1 I really skip, 5 are ok and the rest are good.  Prodcution is mostly handled by Keith Sweat and Teddy Riley and is good.  Guests are on a few and it even has his classic from the ""LSG"" album.  A must have for his fans or fans of R&B.

,B00122KC4E,1,1,5,"Keith Sweat really does it for me.  His voice is yummy and his music is romantic and gorgeous.  One of my ALL TIME FAVOURITE songs is Make it Last Forever (you get two versions here) and Twisted.  They are both here and my cd is almost scratched in these places.  I also love Merry Go Round and Make You Sweat.  He has songs for all occasions (slow, fast, romantic, dance) and I keep coming back to this cd.  It remains so high on my favourite list and I don't ever get bored with it.  Keith is great and I want new cds from him.  Please."
,B00122KC4E,1,1,4,"I had never bought a Keith Sweat album before, but I realized that I had enjoyed some of his songs from back in the day, especially ""I Want Her"". I picked this up when I saw it in a store because I figured a ""Best of"" album was a good way to get all of his good songs that I remembered. In addition to ""I Want Her"", I remembered ""Don't Stop Your Love"", ""Twisted"", the collaboration with Snoop Dogg, ""There You Go Telling Me No Again"", the LSG song ""My Body"" and ""Nobody"". I found that I liked a lot of the eighties and nineties slow jams that I hadn't heard before too. This is a good collection of an R&B star who should not soon be forgotten."
,B00122KC4E,1,1,5,"I think it was timely that they put this Keith Sweat album out.  He can make some very solid songs and is a very good singer.  He just got better and better at his craft and he sure can be begging and whining on these songs.  I still love ""I Want Her"", ""Something Just Ain't Right"", ""Merry Go Round"", ""Make You Sweat"", ""Nobody"", ""Right and A Wrong Way"", and I was surprised they put his song with LSG, ""My Body"" on there!  They covered his career widely on this album with the song selection.  Keith Sweat is one of the best R&B singers and this collection proves it."
,B00122KC4E,1,1,4,"Keith Sweat was a great modern singer even though he has a negative reputation as 'King of Begging'.  But even with that there's no denying he had some real HITS.  Songs such as 'I Want Her', Twisted, Merry Go Round, Make It Last Forever, Don't Stop Your Love, Get Up On It and Nobody perfectly display the classicness he delivered.  His voice is velvet, easily distinguished when you hear it.  Anyone interested in Keith Sweat should definitely get this greatest hits collection...it's a keeper."
,B00122KC4E,1,1,4,"Most times when an artist releases a ""greatest hits"" compilation, people beef over which songs should have or shouldn't have been on there. I've seen reviews where people give a collection one star just because THAT song wasn't on there. But this 17-song collection is a pretty accurate representation of Keith Sweat's career.
I noticed that a lot of the songs are from his first album Make It Last Forever. Sure, that was his best album, but maybe he should've included a good number of songs from ALL of the albums. Oh well, there are other hits you remember, like ""Nobody"", ""Twisted"", ""I'll Give All My Love To You"", and even LSG's ""My Body"". And most hits collections contain a hard-to-find song, and here there's ""(There You Go) Tellin' Me No Again"" (from the New Jack City soundtrack).
I'm not exactly sure why the Snoop Dogg-assisted ""Come And Get With Me"" is on here, but regardless, this is still a good album to buy if all your Keith Sweat cassettes are worn out or lost.

,B00122KYU6,-1,1,5,"Somebody please explain to me how I can own two ""Madonna's greatest hits"" albums and STILL not have this song on either of them? Okay, so perhaps it's not the best known of her songs, but it is probably the one I associate most with the mid-80s. It has a sort of upbeat neo-50s doo-wop beat that accents the song's lyrics, and it isn't quite as racy as Madonna's other music, but that's okay -- it's an 80s pop song. All-in-all, an enjoyable listen that any 80s completionist should own!

,B00122MC0Q,1,1,5,"For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

With the superb instrumental skills of pianist Don Grolnick, drummer John Guerin, bassist Bob Magnusson, guitarist Bob Mann (who also played fabulously on Rod Stewart and Steve Tyrell's recordings) and the creative flair of concertmaster David Frisina, this CD offers some of the glowing moments of Ms. Ronstadt's musical career. ""Lush Life,"" ""What's New?"" and ""For Sentimental Reasons"" are three of the greatest and most beautiful albums of standards ever recorded.

Nobody sounded more expressive than Ms. Ronstadt singing ""When I Fall In Love,"" a song lamenting that love has ended even before it has begun. You can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist, Bob Mann, complementing Ms. Ronstadt's exquisite voice. Likewise, nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of ""When Your Lover Has Gone.""

""What lonely hours
The evening shadows bring
What lonely hours
With memories lingering
Like faded flowers
Life can't mean anything . . .""

In ""Skylark,"" the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition as she brings new life to this Johnny Mercer/Hoagy Carmichael classic. She also left a lasting impression to one of Sinatra's signature songs ""I'm A Fool To Want You,"" just like Ol' Blue Eyes did with his meaningful interpretation. They both did the best versions for male and female vocals, respectively.

She swings lightly on Rodgers & Hart's gem ""You Took Advantage Of Me,"" then she takes it slower in Mills/Parish/Ellington's ""Sophisticated Lady."" And picks up the light swing tempo again on ""Can't We Be Friends?""

""Sophisticated lady I know
You miss the love you had long ago
And when nobody is nigh
You cry. . . you cry.""

If you're a lover of standards like me and an admirer of beauty in all its forms, you should have this CD in your collection and take pleasure in listening to its endless beauty.

Here's to the magic of beautiful music!"
,B00122MC0Q,1,1,5,"LUSH LIFE follows in the footsteps of WHAT'S NEW, more post WWII standards and jazz classics. The CD is worth the price alone for her captivating performance, and one of the best versions I've heard of ""Skylark"". LUSH LIFE once again shows Ronstadt as the interpreter, she ranges from playful and sassy to romantic. LUSH LIFE has more uptempo numbers than WHAT'S NEW did, but she sounds at ease with the material here, joined beautifully by Nelson Riddle and his Orchestra. She also does a nice simple version of ""When I Fall In Love"". Other highlights include ""Mean To me"", ""You Took Advantage of me"", ""I'm A Fool To Want You"" and ""Lush Life"". Go out and get it!"
,B00122MC0Q,1,1,5,"LUSH LIFE is a collection of 12 classic ""pop"" songs performed by Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle and His Orchestra.
LUSH LIFE is one out of the three Ronstadt forays into the world of jazz standards and WWII-era pop numbers. Like its companions WHAT'S NEW and FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS, it captures the multi-faceted soprano buoyed by Nelson Riddle's big band stylings. Riddle, the former Frank Sinatra arranger, employs such luminaries as Louie Bellson, Peter Asher and Don Grolnick to aid Ronstadt along the journey. Ronstadt's interpretations range from the delightful and playful to sassy and romantic. At times the orchestration can get a little too sweet, but Ronstadt sings such faves as ""When I Fall In Love,"" ""Skylark,"" ""Sophisticated Lady,"" ""Falling In Love Again,"" ""Lush Life"" and ""You Took Advantage Of Me"" with enough charm and grace to overshadow some of Riddle's overly ambitious arrangements."
,B00122MC0Q,1,-1,3,"The more up-tempo swing arrangements on this second album of standards that Linda made with the late Nelson Riddle makes this a better album in many ways than WHAT'S NEW.  That, however, really isn't saying much.  I still cannot honestly say that I really liked either of Linda's three big-band albums.  Linda should be commended for at least showing how pre-rock pop standards have affected rock and roll.  The problem is, however, there are other singers far more qualified to do standards than she is."

,B00122L0V8,1,1,5,I heard this song on the radio by accident and remembered it and had to have it.  Alot of fun.
,B00122M0D0,-1,-1,2,"I don't see what people see in this album. I couldn't rate it a 3 even. There are about 3 songs toward the end that are worth having. It's a long way from Olias or Change We Must.
I'm a Yes fan since 75 and Jon's voice is my favorite musical artistry, bar none. But this album is one of his weak ones, as he can produce.
P"
,B00122M0D0,1,1,4,"Between Vangelis and leaving Yes, Jon Anderson finally managed a second solo album four years after ""Olias of Sunhillow"".  I have the original 1980 Atlantic LP.  It is more varied than the new age flavoured debut.  ""Days"" and ""Some Are Born"" were demo-ed for Yes' 1978 LP ""Tormato"" (they appear on that reissue).  The title track was noted by one fan as solace in a time of loss.  Reissued 2006 by Wounded Bird Records, a reissue label based outside Albany, NY, with mostly WEA catalogue titles for some reason."
,B00122MCOC,1,-1,3,Great Song
,B00122MCOC,1,1,5,"This melodic and haunting song is a forgotten classic. I loved it when it was new, and I still love to listen to it. It is intelligent and has a melancholy sound that I believe stands the test if time."

,B00122MCOC,1,1,5,Good.
,B00122MCOC,1,1,4,I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.

,B00122MCOC,1,1,5,"Although this song never really gained the major popularity and major airplay that so many other songs did back in the 1970s/1980s, I decided to buy this MP3 to add some variety to my ever-growing music collection!!!.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for music from the 1970s/1980s!!!."

,B00122MSXW,1,1,5,"Among other things Mason Williams was a comedy writer for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour on CBS from 1967 to 1969. This multi-talented individual was also a folk guitarist, songwriter, author and photographer among other things. In 1968 he recorded the Grammy-award winning instrumental ""Classical Gas"". It would become one of the biggest hits of the summer of 1968. In an interview with Goldmine Williams described the song in this way: ""half flamenco, half Flatt & Scruggs, and half classical."" In fact this song actually garnered 3 Grammy awards as ""Best Instrumental Arrangement"", ""Best Contemporary-Pop Performance"" and ""Best Instrumental Theme"".  This sounds every bit as fresh today as it did when it was recorded nearly 50 years ago."
,B00122MSXW,1,1,5,"The big surprise for 1965, still a very surprising tune for the era"

,B00122MVZM,1,1,5,This is a  really great cd.  I like and know every song.  It is a classic and recommended for sure.
,B00122N296,1,1,5,"I think I heard this song for the first time while listening to milwaukeeoldies.com on the Friday Night Groove Train. I looked this song up and the information said this song came out in 1972. I know that Superfly (I have the two-disc CD) came out the same year, so I have a vague idea of who were the popular performers around that time period. This song caught my ear because the main instruments are a beat, the human voice and a organ sound. It's a pretty cool song!"
,B00122N296,1,-1,3,"I had completely forgotten this song, but knew something like this existed. By whom, I didn't know. When I stumbled across it, I bought it immediately. How did I find it? I stumbled across two covers of this song, one by Carlos Santana and Steve Winwood on YouTube. I knew it had been done by someone else, so I went searching here at Amazon. Then I stumbled upon Sade's version. All three are good, and perhaps Sade's version is best, but the original by Timmy Thomas is the one you want, then the others too. GET IT if you remember it from the late 60s! It is the precursor to Marvin Gaye's album ""What's Going On""."

,B00122NXGS,1,1,5,"I remember years ago hearing this song when I watched the movie Juno.....and I loved it then, but forgot to find it on the internet after I was out of the movie.....too bad....I would have loved to have been listening to it for years....better late than never.....

So, how did I remember this song then?  I was watching TV and heard it come on....I ran into the room and saw it was running during a Del Monte commercial for green beans.....I laughed....it was a cute commercial...and a cute tune to go with it.....

Then I went on a search for the song....and found it.....glad I checked Amazon to see if they had it and they did.....I am looking forward to putting it into my mp3 player and making a disk for the car.....

when you listen to it you cannot help but want to move and laugh.....and we certainly need more laughter in the world....."

Meet ""Robert Randolph and the Family Band""

"" I need more love"" out funks George Clinton.

""Nobody"" is a gospel song on steroids. Gospel that would rival anything as powerful as Led Zep/ AC DC has done.

""Going in the Right Direction"" is a church revival-sounding song but man does it rock and holy smoke is it funky!

""Good Times"" is an instrumental space funk song on equal footing with ""Cosmic Slop"".

Every song on this masterpiece is blistering musicianship yet on a very spiritual plain. This is killer stuff! By the way, go see Robert Randolph & Family Band live. He is the jam master supreme."
,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"Randolph at his most restrained can be classified in that Los Lonely Boys, non-threatening, adult contemporary rock sort of  way, but thankfully relies much more on passionate steal guitar solos and raucous church propulsion for an electrified debut."
,B00122N04I,1,1,5,"""Unclassified"" is a humble name for an album I'd call amazing.  Robert Randolph's guitar would have gotten me up on Sunday AM for church, for sure.

""Soul Refreshing"" was the first cut I'd heard on an alternative station here in Knoxville. Took a bit to get the DJ to answer, seems I was the 4th or 5th person to call the station and ask who the group was.

The whole CD's solid, rocked out funk. The feeling is positive and uplifting.  ""Unclassified"" would be a good CD to put on for a rainy day.

I also noticed that I had Robert Randolph in two other collections:  ""Power of Soul"" a tribute to Jimi Hendrix doing ""Purple Haze"" and Santana's ""All That I Am"" playing on ""Trinity."""
,B00122N04I,1,1,5,"My new favorite band! Imagine Al Green singing for the Family Stone with Duane Allman on guitar. Call them Stevie Ray Wonder! They are a genre-bending, jam-band with infectious grooves that simply said make you feel real happy inside. As good as this CD is, it doesn't quite capture how exciting they are live, but it gets close. This band is going to be very popular, and radio or MTV will have nothing to do with it. 4 of the 11 tracks are instrumental."
,B00122NUXE,-1,1,5,"I actually got the wrong one..but....It's Percy Sledge.  I grew up listening to him and an extra cut can't hurt.  I was supposed to get 'When a man loves a woman'...memory problems, mine"
,B00122N04I,1,1,5,"Unclassified is Robert Randolph's second album, but his first studio effort. His first album, Live At Wetlands, showed that Mr. Randolph plays one mean steel guitar. The question would be if that same sweat and fire could be recreated in the studio. The answer is a resounding yes. Mr. Randolph cut his teeth playing in a Pentecostal church in his hometown of Orange, New Jersey and the album has clear gospel roots. But the band is really more of a funk and roll band in the Parliament-Funkadelic mold. Mr. Randolph's steel guitar is often counterbalanced by popping bass lines and wailing organs. ""So Refreshing"" has a funky bass and buzz saw steel riff and ""Squeeze"" has fiery organs that perfectly contrast the wicked steel guitar. ""I Need More Love"" has a call and response chorus that sits atop a hard funk groove that is very Stevie Wonder like. ""Smile"" slows things down and features tender harmonies. ""Calypso"" has a Latin-jazz-rock Santana vibe and ""Run For Your Life"" closes out the disk on a full-out Jersey bar sound. Robert Randolph is one of the most gifted guitarists to come around in a long time and his music demands your attention."
,B00122N04I,1,-1,3,Robert Randolph is an amazing performer no matter what way you cut it. He plays his slide guitar better than anyone has attempted for awhile and has some real pumpin tunes. The one that are lacking are the slower numbers which in my view destroy what could have been an amazing disc. next time more funk.
,B00122N04I,1,1,5,"It was a late night, and I was watching the David Letterman show when these guys where introduced to play a song on the show. And judging by the look of them, i was just about to turn it off expecting them to be some kind of new rap band... but once the drums started and the guitars with great rythem and style came into it... i was plesently suprised!
Never judge a book by there cover! This band might look like a rap band coming out of the getto or somthing, but there music is back to the old roots of funk and soul, and they have both in there music!
Its been a long time since a band has emerged with feel good ,toe tapping music like this that will make you wanna move to the music, it has that much effect!
There combination of soul, funk, bluesgrass, southern rock, and ability to make you wanna move to the music is terrific! Even beeing a rocker and metal head, i found this music to be very refreshing, its not hard hitting or loud as hell, but it defnitly is a great brand of music i think anyone could get into!
Not every song on here features lyrics, and tho the lyrics arnt memroble or super great, the music and beat certinly is!
Take a chance and check this album out! Not in many years have i heard brothers with such great timing, rythem, soul, funk and fun!! They have everything that has been missing in the new age music scene in a very long time! And after hearing this, you will be glad to know that there are still talented musicions out there delivering the goods!
This album is a keeper, and this combination of diffrent blends of music, and talent having a good time together is well worth the money!
This album only leaves me wondering, whats the future hold for this great group of talented musicions?"
,B00122N04I,1,1,5,"I heard some mention about Robert Randolph & the Family Band here and there from various sources. But when I saw them perform on The Tonight Show one night, that was all I needed. I instantly rushed out and picked up the album.
To say that this album, Unclassified, is great would be an understatement. Robert Randolph and his band (consisting of all family members, in case the name didn't tip you off) provide this great album full of funk and soul. There are a few instrumental tracks that just let the band do their thing, like ""Run For Your Life"", the calypso style of, well, ""Calypso"", and the best one, ""Squeeze"". And the songs you should've heard already, ""Going In the Right Direction"" and ""I Need More Love"", still sound excellent.
Other standouts are the funky ""Soul Refreshing"" and ""Why Should I Feel Lonely"". I even like ""Problems"", a we-are-the-world style song that doesn't sound so clichd. Actually, there's no song on here that's a waste of time. Unclassified IS classified -- as one of the best albums of last year.
Anthony Rupert"
,B00122N04I,1,1,5,"Yep, Robert Randolph and the Family Band had a breakout performance tonight at the Grammys. Samuel L. Jackson and his preacher thing went a little overboard for me. EWF and Outkast were okay. George Clinton was cool by me until I starts ripping Lil' John! George! Why imitate!
I digress.
In the middle of all this Grammy supergroup shanigans many in our great nation were introduced to Robert Randolph and the Family Band. ""I Need More Love"" was tight performance of what they represent. Positive, church inspired, funk music with blistering jam band talent. Very, very rare that we hear anything that sounds fresh, new or an extension upon the foundations of black music rather than a recapitulation of established norms. These guys are the real deal. The music will raise your spirits. The talent will awe you at times. Acoustic music with power, fire, technique, soul, love, heart, courage, and power.
That's we need today, and that's what you should purchase.
Support great musicians and cop this album!
5 stars

,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"You know, I never heard of Robert Randolph until I caught a sampling of 'The Word' album on an independent radio station about a year ago. After hearing him play the pedal steel guitar on that collaboration project, I must say I was absolutely floored! EVERYTHING about his playing will bring to mind all the things that made guys like Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Duane Allman, Carlos Santana, and Stevie Ray Vaughan as revered as they are. Simply put, the brother got ""MAD SKILLZ""!!!

The same can also be said of his stellar backing unit known simply as the Family Band, whose sound I found it best to describe as being a unique hybrid of the Allman Brothers' roots-based  rock and Graham Central Station's sanctified funk. On this, their first studio-conceived album, nearly all the tracks shine from the infectiously ""gospel-delic"" groove laid down by the band as well as the industrial strength of Randolph's pedal steel work (which is a joy to behold in itself). I would've given this a 5-star rating if some of the jams were extended for greater effect, but that's just a minor complaint linked mainly to personal preference. On the other hand, I do know a good band when I hear one and something tells me that Robert Randolph & Co. aren't that far off from becoming one of the most exciting and influential bands of their generation (MY generation to be specific).

HIGHLY recommended, but also get their live album as well. This band is definitely one of the best concert draws going today."
,B00122NSG8,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs.  I like the ability to buy just one song instead of the whole cd.
,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"I First got Hip to Robert Randolph Courtesy of watching NBA on TNT with Kenny,Charles&Ernie during the ""Charles Barkley Show""&When I Heard this Brother Wailing on the Steel Guitar like He was I was like I gotta get that set as soon as it drops.the Grooves&Vibe here are tight. I Like the Edge He plays with& I see the Brother having a long Career.maybe done the Road He can do a Duet Album with Ben Harper.putting those Two Cats Together Wailing on the Axe would be tight.but for now this Set is very much on point."
,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"Excellent followup for Robert Randolph and the Family Band's underground classic ""Live at the Wetlands."" Those who liked that CD will be pleased with this one. Most of this consists of tunes that this excellent group has been performing live over the last year, like ""Run For Your Life,"" ""Good Times,"" and ""Squeeze."" Once again, John Ginty plays the heck out of his organ and Marcus Randolph and Danyel Morgan in fine support (though it would be nice if this one had more of Danyel's soaring vocals).
Overall, this is good stuff, particularly the songs that I have just mentioned. Real get-up and go music with a positive energy not often found in tunes of recent times. ""Soul Refershing"" is simply beautiful and ""Smile"" is interesting (Robert's sister Lenesha does the vocals here). ""Calypso"" (not to be confused with the Harry belafonte tune of the same name) is an interesting novelty. A few of the songs (like ""I Need More Love"") are somewhat lacking in the right mix of melody and energy that characteris\zes this group-but a so-so song from these guys are better than the best of a lot of what's out there now!
I would suggest that those who may be interested in this start with ""Live at the Wetlands"" before going on to ""Unclassified."" That will give you a better preperation for this. Then pick up ""The Word"" (RR without the Family Band) and the ""Sacred Steel"" Cds after you listen to ""Unclassified."" Then see these guys live and  you will have hope for the future of American popular music."
,B00122MEB8,1,1,5,Hadn't heard this song since high school (many moons ago!) until it popped up the other night on Pandora Radio. Popped into Amazon and bought it! Great tune.
,B00122MEB8,1,1,5,"The Confessor was the title song from Joe Walsh's seventh solo album, released in 1985. It's also the most interesting single recording he has ever released as a solo artist. A two-part acoustic/electric guitar showpiece, the song is a reflection on perceiving reality and the certainty of having to pay a price for treachery and evil.

The futuristic synthesizer intro is augmented/contrasted by Joe's bluesy electric and haunting acoustic slide guitars. You can actually hear Joe's bottleneck scraping the brass-wound guitar strings as it eerily slides over them. Slow blues from the dark realm of another universe.

 Minor and major seventh chords complement Joe singing the murky philosophical lyrics of the first, and slower, half of the song.

The second half of the song features a ferocious electric guitar solo and one of Joe's most compelling vocal performances.

The Confessor:

If you look at your reflection in the bottom of a well
What you see is only on the surface
When you try to see the meaning hidden underneath
The measure of the depth can be deceiving
The bottom has a rocky reputation

You can feel it in the distance the deeper that you stare
From up above it's hard to see but you know when you're there
On the bottom words are shallow
On the surface talk is cheap
You can only judge the distance by the company you keep
In the eyes of The Confessor

In the eyes of The Confessor
There's nowhere you can hide
You can't hide from the eyes (of The Confessor)
Don't you even try

In the eyes of The Confessor
You can't tell a lie
You cannot tell a lie (to The Confessor)
Strip you down to size

Naked as the day that you were born
Naked as the day that you were born

Take all the trauma, drama, comments
The guilt and doubt and shame
The what if's and if only's
The shackles and the chains
The violence and aggression
The pettiness and scorn
The jealousy and hatred
The tempest and discord...

AND GIVE IT UP!"
,B00122MEB8,1,1,5,GREAT CLASSIC ROCK ESSENTIAL!!  ROCK IT!!
,B00122MEB8,1,1,5,I remember when this album came out it quickly became a favorite and I played the heck out of this song..
,B00122MEB8,1,1,4,Good oldie classic rock song from the 80s
,B00122MEB8,-1,1,5,This is one of the dopest songs recorded in the eighties by anyone...PERIOD! I don't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on my 'to do' list. Check out the music video on Youtube- Trippy and creepy @ the same time!
,B00122OIY4,1,1,5,"This song make an excellent collection to my mp3 collection.
Highly recomended for any music lover that loves music from before the 2000s"
,B00122O10K,1,1,5,"To me DMSR is the crown jewel of 1999. Even though all the songs are great, DMSR is the epitome of the Prince sound at the time an gave us a glimpse to where the sound was going, it greatly benefits from the assists from the Revolution, due to him splitting the hook an lets the girls singing the backgrounds the funk becomes soo inclusive an he was aware of that, ""all the negros sang... all the white people on the floor sang"" just totally brilliant. Production wise Prince took drum programming to whole nother level while the old cats where struggling to make a drum machine sound an feel like a live drummer, Prince seen the future of funk, that kick snare pattern just loops for 8 minutes, with various breakdowns from the electric toms lol, but all the other instruments get to play freely an make it feel like what it is a funk jam where all the little nuances go a long way the Sly scream that during 80's was part of his trademark hits, the rappin ""I don't wanna be a poet..."" The wicked bass line the master overdubbing makes you feel like it was recorded live at first avenue in Minneapolis, you can taste the sweat off the party goers just funky. All studio. Very few artist could replicate this level of funk in a studio. I mean sure George an Parliament had 8, 9 minutes jams but they also had an army of nearly 12 to 20 people to do it. This was created I'm sure with 5 people or less. Awesome."
,B00122O10K,1,1,5,"Although many people who aren't his fans don't know it, Prince has a long list of very funky music.  D.M.S.R. is just about the funkiest.  From the 1st beat and synth lick...you're like...""Do you smell something?""... Then the bass comes in and you're like...""Yeah.  There's definitely something funky in here!!""."
,B00122O10K,1,1,4,"I have been a Prince fan for years, and even though I haven't heard any new music from him I stillssics rock. Prince has that style of music that makes you want to get out and dance all night long; and yes sing too.  He has that cool beat toall his songs there are some I can't stand but most are great. Prince's music isn't just for 80's music lovers it's for everybody, for newbies check out his music you will love it.

,B00122LMWK,-1,-1,2,"this is a case of yet another pedestrian, average song-played out so bad by the horrible FM Classic Rock format stations that you end up hating it just a little"
,B00122LMWK,1,1,5,"Classic. Practically a rock anthem. Seriously, how can you NOT hum along, tap your feet or at least nod your head in time to the music?"
,B00122LMWK,1,1,5,One of my all time favorites!
,B00122LMWK,-1,-1,1,Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
,B00122LMWK,1,1,5,I love the Doobies brothers music.  They just have a great sound and quite a few songs that I love to listen to.  This is a soothing easy listening song.
,B00122LMWK,1,1,4,"Great song....and  good lyrics too!  I remember it from the ""good old days"" when any song by the Doobie Brothers was a great one."
,B00122LMWK,1,1,5,"This tune has a funky, loping rhythm that really brings back memories of a certain era (early 70s). It has nice semi-funky vocals and a nice chorus. There is a great harmonica solo mid-song. The song has some Motown influence while remaining generally mainstream rock. I gotta admit I love that Motown influence. For me this is the best Doobie Brothers tune."
,B00122MUB2,1,1,4,Downloaded the single Schools Out to make a summer playlist. Seems like the perfect song for the start of summer.
,B00122MUB2,1,1,5,"Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier; February 4, 1948) released a huge, huge hit with this tune from the 1972 album of the same name. Indeed, ""School's Out"" was his first major hit single peaking at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart! True, Cooper had help from Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway and Neal Smith, but the song is by far most associated with Alice Cooper himself and those vocals are incredible! The guitar riffs and more are awesome; they also fit in perfectly with those sizzling lyrics and the overall result is very powerful.

This is one song I won't ever forget. An excellent tune by Alice Cooper and his peers that is great for this time of the year when schools are letting out, ""School's Out"" proves Alice Cooper is a genius!"
,B00122MUB2,1,1,5,Classic song. This is going on my heavy metal / hard rock play list on my mp3 player. A must have!
,B00122O10K,1,1,5,Great Buy!!!
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,Good drugs and loud guitars!
,B00122OMC2,-1,-1,3,"I liked it, but it didn't sound as good to me as the original.  So I bought the entire original ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" album."
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,very Good
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,"Perfect, always a favorite.  The long version can be an acquired taste only, but this download makes a good ring tone for my phone."
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,A classic from my youth! I loved it then and love it now!
,B00122MUB2,-1,1,5,Rocken
,B00122MUB2,-1,-1,3,I really just got this for the end of the school year. Not a huge fan.
,B00122MUB2,1,1,5,i put this on a graduation mix.  can't go wrong.
,B00122MUB2,1,1,5,"As music goes, the download was smooth, the quality of the conversion was flawless to the novice ears, and when played on multiple devices, to include an mp3 disc where I had over 200 songs made no differencethe quality was spot on.  Amazon has delivered yet another fine conversion and I love the fact that the songs I have purchased are backed up on their cloud.  What a great throwback, I love it, and I enjoy the massive selection offered by Amazon!

The services offered via Amazon are great and their music selections are massive and I love how easily I can choose while operating multiple or from any device!"
,B00122MUB2,1,1,5,I always like this song so I bought it . I have had very good luck with all my amazon songs they sound great.
,B00122MUB2,1,1,5,It's Alice Cooper man!  What's not to love!  He has so man GREAT songs it's not even funny!  This is one of them.
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,Great to reminiece
,B00122OMC2,-1,1,5,Epic
,B00122OMC2,1,1,4,When is the drum solo?  This is such a classic that even the Simpson's made fun of it.
,B00122OMC2,1,1,4,Awesome song and Great band....
,B00122OMC2,1,1,4,HAPPY HAPPY
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,great
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,"In the day as they say this diddy was very, very popular on pop music channels. It is the kind of a song that just crawls into your inerds and you can't get it out of your mind. In my case, that is many decades now when real music was being produced just out of the dark ages!"
,B00122OMC2,-1,1,5,It's just to fill in my library. I like to listen to the old rock/pop/alternative/r&b etc.
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,"Remember extended LPs, those records you'd buy which had one song you liked? Remember how you convinced yourself it was OK to buy it, even though you didn't like the rest of the album? It was OK then, and it is OK now. ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" the album, has five songs you never heard of, and one song you should know. This song is the one you want. Skip the album.

In the rock-and-roll canon, that great list of songs everyone generally agrees is great, you'll find a few Elvis, Stones and Beatles tunes. Zeppelin will have their share, and you'll see the Doors, Clapton, Buddy Holly and other familiar names repeated throughout that list. Then, somewhere close to #100 or 150, you'll see 'Iron Butterfly'. Who? It doesn't matter who. It matters what. The what is ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" a 17 minute work of rock-n-roll art.

To say Iron Butterfly was a one-hit wonder is only relating half of the story. This wasn't like ""People!"" whose cover of ""I Love You,"" hit high and then was forgotten when band members split to do other things. That's a real one-hit wonder. Iron Butterfly had one hit, but it would be like if Zeppelin only gave the world ""Stairway to Heaven."" The one song is enough to seal them in rock-n-roll history.

Has anyone covered this song? No one cares, because this is the version everyone wants. Everyone else is just giving this version an homage.

Like Skynard's guitar in ""Freebird,"" the drum solo here is what everyone talks about. The physical endurance to carry it off, and the musical strength to sustain the rhythm back into the song is amazing.

I fully recommend, ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" by Iron Butterfly.

,B00122OMC2,1,1,4,OK
,B00122OMC2,1,1,4,"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida by Iron Butterfly is one of those old war horses from the psychedelic era that rambles on for 17 plus minutes and was deemed deep and mind expanding at the time. Its the kind of song that punk rockers looked to stick a safety pin through to burst the 60s love and peace idealism. Looking back on the song with the space of almost a half-century, it is over indulgant, about 10 minutes too long, but that propulsive beat will still cause you to knod your head in rhythm. Its the thump of the beat coupled with the chilling eeriness of the organ and sting of the guitar that makes you forgot the endless noodling that goes on for the middle 13 or so minutes that threaten to sink the song."
,B00122OMC2,1,1,4,"I would really like to get the seventeen minute version., but other than that the music was great. It was wonderful to hear this music again."
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,Great!
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,A great girl power dance song!
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,One of my favorite 90s dance songs! The version I remember from the radio.
,B00122OK4C,1,1,4,"Just a song which brings back long ago days.....I am 62 years old and still love this one!  The gals sing it, and I try to bump & grind to it, but with an artificial hip, and knee, it is not as easy as 20 years ago....but the beat, the lyrics, the sexiness still move me!  Just fun, and I shall listen to it until I am 80...or whatever age it is that I last to!!"
,B00122OK4C,1,1,4,"Never met an EV single I disliked, and this one is a perfect example. Very distinctive melodies, sassy, unique attitude and style. A throwback, classic, and groundbreaker simultaneously."
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,"This is one for both genders, no one will be spared when listening to it.  Get ready to feel, get up and move around, to hold someone or allow someone to hold you, prepare a meal for him or her, just get ready!  Oh, and if you can find it, get the video of these sexy black women singing this song, it is clear to see why the cultures are crossing over!  LOVING IT!!"
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,I used to love this song when it came out a long time ago and just decided to add it to my music. It's a great older song.
,B00122OMC2,-1,1,5,This is an icon of the era. No one can rerecord this and make this as trippy. The Iron Butterfly rocks.
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,I just love this old song. My honey bought it for me as a gift. If you enjoyed old school music you'll love this song.
,B00122OMC2,1,1,5,"Love this song in the 70's at 17 yrs old, danced to it at parties, still loving it now in 2013 at 60yrs old. Some things just last!!"
,B00122OMC2,-1,1,5,"Prefer the album version, but....it is 17 minutes and 2 seconds long.  Here is a grainy video (but with clear sound) with the ""album"": version:[...]"
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,Always the best.  Love this song
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,I have also liked EnVogue and this is probably my favorite song of theirs.
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,Great music!
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,Love this Music.
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,Love this song
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,awesome group of girls
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,"Good oldies song, never get tired of listening to this song."
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,Very nice.
,B00122OK4C,1,1,5,A+
,B00122OK4C,1,1,4,solid song
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,This is one of those songs that kind of sticks in your head. A lot of nonsense but FUN nonsense. Great to listen to at work or while running!
,B00122OH0O,1,1,5,This song with several others caused a shift in my music preferences during my early teen years and I guess it was with good reason - the tune is well done and supports a slew of abstract references all orchestrated in the Robert Plant way.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville are great together singing this song. Nine more words required is not needed with song.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,I recently purchased this song for my wife on our anniversary. This was a song that was meaningful to us many years ago when we were dating. It still has a nice love song feel to it.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,4,"Great song...just heard it on the radio. Talk about a blast from the past. Realized I had to have the mp3. Linda Ronstadt's soulful base plus Aaron Neville's rich, heart-rending velvet vocals. What could be better?"
,B00122OH0O,1,1,5,great
,B00122OH0O,-1,-1,3,"Don't care for the re-master or the transfer of this recording.  It often automatically presumed that because a recording has been re-mastered, or transferred from analog to digital, that it's better.  Not so in many cases.  Re-mastering often over-compresses the original recording and results in the equivalent of a poor mix.  Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.

In the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.  Extremely disappointing.

sf"
,B00122OH0O,1,1,5,Another of Plant's best - filling out my catalog! I only wish amazon's downloads would be offered in a LOSS-LESS COMPRESSION FORMAT...
,B00122OH0O,1,1,5,The long quietly building intro is distinctive. The strumming of the chords just strikes a mood that makes you feel like YOU are in the mood for a melody too!
,B00122OH0O,1,1,4,"I have always been a fan of Zeppelin and of coarse Robert Plant. In The Mood is one of his best hits from the early 80's. The reason why I liked it is because it has that smooth rhythm and beat that defines Plant's music. I am a big fan of the classic rock era and of 80's music, it is some of the best you will ever hear. It's amazing how long this music has lasted and it's cool how younger generations are getting attached to it to. I recommend this song to anyone who enjoyed Zeppelin and especially Plant's music, it's a tune that is ageless.

,B00122OHYA,1,1,5,"""To Build a Home' is well executed.  It has a slow pace and begins with a quiet delivery that builds to an interesting climax.  I enjoy the song immensely."
,B00122OHYA,1,1,5,"It's a very lovely song. Each time I have listened to it, it has never failed to move me. I am very glad to have added it to our music collection."
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,yes
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,Classic Rock.
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,Very nice product
,B00122ML0W,-1,1,5,:-)
,B00122OI4O,1,1,5,"I chose this song, because I was strolling thru the music songs, on my Kindle fire and saw it.  I listened to it and bought the single.  I would recommend this song to all the lovers out there."
,B00122OI4O,1,1,5,If you ever played around with love & hurt another. Just remember that one day Love might come along and they might not want you.
,B00122ML0W,1,1,4,Love this song
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,fun song
,B00122ML0W,1,-1,3,OK
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,"Well known track.  Zevon at his best.  Catchy melody, clever lyrics.  Just a great listed whether it is the first or millionth time you have heard it.  Like all great music it stands the test of time."
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,cool song
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,Excellent!
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,"I miss Zevon""s music, humor and social commentary."
,B00122OHYA,1,1,4,"The music is absolutely beautiful, and the lyrics sweet. This can be used for so many situations, and I see it used almost everywhere. As a creative writer, I find it a perfect song to listen to in the background to give me inspiration and emotion."
,B00122OHYA,1,1,5,The Cinematic Orchestra and Patrick Watson make a great musical pair. I want to hear more. Perfect lyrics and instrumentation.
,B00122OHYA,1,1,5,Glad to be able to get this song! And I love that it is available through cloud to put on any device.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,I like it.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,great song by linda
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,I downloaded this song because I love the listen to Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville.  I don't get tired of it.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,"Aaron Neville and Linda Ronstadt are the right duo for this song.  Their voices go together like a hand in a glove.  I would call this a smooth, deep love song."
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,love this song
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,fun
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,Classic Linda being sexy!
,B00122OP0G,1,1,4,Everyone remembers Crimson & Clover but TJ & the Shondells had a string of Top 40 Bubble gummy hits.  I also liked 'Hanky Panky' but I have since tired of it.  'I Think We're Alone Now' reached #4 early in 1967.  Nuff said.
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,"brings back memories of being young and having fun, without the adults finding out lol. But always loved Tommy James"
,B00122OP0G,-1,1,5,"Lots of folks have covered this song (tiffany the most well known), but I think the original is the best.  Not the best Tommy James song, but a prototypical 60s pop song.  Nice beat, great hook, solid but not life changing lyrics, but ones that took longer than 30 seconds to write.  Any fan of 60s music needs this in their library.  It's not a sit in your chair song, it's good driving music, or cleaning house!"
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,"Sounds just like I remember from the radio. Thanks! $1.29 you can't beat it, I'll be a returning customer for more of my favorite songs!"
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,"Brings back memories, especially since this song was banned by many radio stations at the time! I remember Tommy James & Shondells getting a standing ovation for this song when I saw them in San Antonio-methinks for its ground breaking lyrics as well as the performance."
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,great song and a great price
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,We miss you Warren
,B00122ML0W,1,1,4,"Great song, I have loved it since it came  out."
,B00122ML0W,1,1,4,"Always enjoyed this song, now i have it."
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,good song
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Man what a song! I remember when i first heard this song and i couldn't believe how sultry Alannah Myles sang about Elvis and i knew this song would be around along time!!
,B00122OKQU,-1,1,5,Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville together? Nuff said.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,Another great song. The combination of these two voices made this song a treat for the ears and the brain.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,Linda Ronsdadt and Aaron Neville make a great sounding duet. Their unique voices make a great combination on a great song.
,B00122OKQU,1,1,5,This really speaks for those of us that have a hard time expressing our emotions to others in our lives.
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,I always like this song so I bought it . I have had very good luck with all my amazon songs they sound great.
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,"Werewolves of London featured on Zevron's 1978 album ""Excitable Boy"". Allegedly it has Mick Fleetwood and John McVie playing on it too. It has a wry sense of humour and a great rock style. Highly recommended."
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,"This is a very unusual  song.  I really like the subject.  The tune is weird but, I like unusual tunes."
,B00122ML0W,-1,1,5,"The remastering is at most slightly detectable on good equipment....I mean mp3 is not the quality of CD, period.  But it is a nice inexpensive way to own the late great Warren Zevon's signature song.  Enjoy it, and to quote W.Z. on the Letterman Show, ""Enjoy every sandwich."""
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,ok
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Good sound quality.
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Excellent as always.
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Good song
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,So Sixties! Tommy James had a few hits in that era and this was the best the Shondells could crank out for those hoppin' AM DJ's that gave us popular dance music. He even made an appearance on American Bandstand.
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,Good
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,Another classic going way back to my teens but it still sounds  great.
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,perfect
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,Love it
,B00122OP0G,1,1,5,love it

,B00122MLIY,1,1,4,good
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Probably her best.
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,classic
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"I remember first hearing this quality tune Black Velvet by Alannah Myles around the time I was 9-10 years old.  The song was played on local radio and I remember the song being performed at a carnival that was being held near the city that I lived in at the time (I just wish that I could remember if it was Alannah Myles and her group or if the performance was by a tribute band). Anyhow, the vocals and the lyrics of the  song musically paint a story that would make for good tv episode viewing or a movie about a heartbreaker who is easy on the eyes or maybe not conventionally attractive but a charmer.  Either way a person has to be open-minded to listen to this gem of a song due to the fact that the song appears to be about a womanizer who is easy on the eyes, maybe even pleasant to be around (I.e. a charmer) yet hard on a persons heart romantically speaking. Im also keeping a record of this song as one of the multiple tunes I remember from my childhood."
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music
,B00122ML0W,1,1,5,"Weird song, but understood as it is a parody, of sorts, in dealing with the subject of English ""Werewolves"". Nevertheless, it is quite a catchy tune and a real ""toe-tapper""."
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,wonderful
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,good cd
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"It's Alannah, what can I saw.  This one was missing from my digital collection."
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"Wow her voice is silky, sexy, and sultry!
This cut is 100% like the original song dating back to the early 1990s.

This song is all about Elvis.

MmmmmmmmmmAlannah !! He he he !!"
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,great
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Sexy. southern style.only Alannah Myles can bring it.she can sing to me anytime.
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Exquisite!
,B00122OIJE,1,1,5,Amazon mp3 cloud music is awesome! I have purchased a few songs and love everyone of them. I recommend purchasing mp3 music through Amazon. Worth the money.
,B00122OIJE,1,1,5,"i don't normally like christian music. But, Barlow Girl hits this one out of the park. The lyrics are so moving that in the end it doesn't matter who you believe in as long as you believe."
,B00122OIJE,1,1,5,"i loooove this song!!! discovered it on one of my Pandora radio stations & i just love it :))) this version is better than the other one. i just love when u can hear the rawness in ppl's voices, it feels more personal & genuine, & not commercialized & distant. i feel very connected to this song, & i just love it :)))"
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Love the beat and her voice on Black Velvet
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Love it

,B00122OIJE,1,1,5,"This is an awesome song with an awesome message!!! We need more music like this in the world, it would make it a much better place to live in!!!"
,B00122OIJE,1,1,5,again. Good song. Not a lot to say really. I like the song or I wouldn't have bought it. I'm not familiar with the band. I don't think I have listened to any other songs by Barlow Girl. No opinion on the band. Good song.
,B00122OIJE,1,-1,3,"I have several versions of this song. Each of them are different, but similar. I like the soft version of this song best."

,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,this is one of my all time favorites. Alannah has a beautiful and sings this blues type song well. I would recommend this song to anyone who likes music.
,B00122MLIY,1,1,4,Loved this song when it came out. Different..
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Superb
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,good oldie
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Great Song
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"Used for a project, great loved it."
,B00122MJRM,1,1,5,Love ALL of her music.
,B00122MJRM,1,1,5,This is a perfect song to play if you have ever had a loss. Just a beautiful song. Will bring out the emotions
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"black velvet is an old country favorite for me. the radio station played this song in my hometown many moons ago, and it brings back memories of my childhood. it is one of those songs that brings back memories because of some significant event in a persons' lifetime. black velvet will always be a country favorite."
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Great song. A 90's classic.
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"Listening to music makes me happy.  I like this song and the song was on sale for 69 cents, so I bought the song."
,B00122MLIY,1,1,4,"An oldie, sticks in your hands and is pretty much Country done right. Yeah there are a lot of other good country songs that are popular but, to me this is True country not the watered down stuff that you hear on the radio or those reality shows now a days."
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,This song has amazing and sensual vocals.  Great backing band performance.  Just buy it.  I need to insert more words....
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,I became familiar with the tune at Karaoke Clubs & many did it very well but Myles nailed it the best
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"Probably one of the sexiest song ever and only Alannah sings it at its best.
The recording I bought was top quality.
Everyone needs to own this song.
Oh and if you haven't figured it out, its a song about Elvis."
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,Love this song! It creates a very vivid image of dusty sunlight streaming through a old screen door while a young mother dances to the music from her old Victrola of time. Well done!
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"love this song. alannah myles  brought me  back to the type music that i grew up listening to in my youth, buy this"
,B00122MLIY,1,1,4,"The 1990s was a turbulent time for music. I just found it difficult to adjust to the change from the awesome music from the 80's to the music of the 90's. The introduction of grunge, rap, and other music was hard to get use to. In 1992 along come a great song from Alannah Myles, BLACK VELVET. I thought the music of the 1990's is not lost we have a winner. The reason why I love this song is the lyrics beat, and it has something for everybody. It is a song that is a blend of Pop/Country, the beat is a blend and the lyrics to me is more pop. So if U hate Pop music you will still love this song and vice-versa with those who dis-like Country music like me. I guarantee you will get attached to this song regardless with music you prefer, so enjoy.

THX,
Kris L. CocKayne"
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"Some songs I just have to have them...!!!  And this is good to sing along.  Good price, easy download, easy pay...!!!"
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"I liked the song and that's all I can say about it as, I didn't buy the whole CD just the one song."
,B00122MLIY,1,1,4,Great slow moving song. Perfect for slow dancing with the one you love or if you just want to mellow out.
,B00122MLIY,1,1,5,"If you like this song, definitely buy it.  It is well worth the price and Amazon.com has the best price on the internet.  Would definitely buy it again."
,B00122NZVG,1,1,5,"I gave this song 5 stars because their were no more stars to give. Miki Howard was just as talented as Whitney Houston, but never had anyone to believe in her and back her to make her journey to the top. In my book she is a legend. God bless her. I would recommend this to anyone who likes listening to real R&B, Who likes listening to a real singer and not just another pretty face who can just barely hold a note."
,B00122PIMA,1,1,5,"Please, please do it again!!!  Wonderful sounds!  Another album, I wish.  Can you believe he was LZ."
,B00122PIMA,1,1,5,Memories.  I had this as a cassette when I was in high school.

,B00122OP4M,-1,1,5,I remember listening to this song on the radio so when I found out what the name of the song was and the artist I had to have it.
,B00122OP4M,-1,1,5,"There are about 5 versions of Genesis' ""Misunderstanding"" on Amazon MP3 and this one is the CLOSEST(most faithful) to the CD release.  :)

I ran an audio analysis in ""Audacity"" - a freeware(donations accepted) Digital Audio Workstation for both PC and Mac.  This version has the extended frequency response and(most of ) the original dynamics of the original CD and 1980 LP version.  Remember: Digital Remastering is a FURTHER step AWAY from the artist's original intentions 20, 30, however many years ago the album originally sold.

Also: MAKE SOME NOISE!

Tell Amazon or whatever download service you use to offer the UNremastered original CD release as the source for their mp3 offerings alongside the Digital Remasters.  Ask them to give you the CHOICE between the remaster and the first-gen CD release version.  You're purchasing and paying for it - you should have access to it!"
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"A song from the heart and soul , that will make you melt in a wealth of great childhood memories."
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,This is definitely a purchase made because it takes me back to Christmas as a little girl. Now my kids are listening to this song and loving it also.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,This is my favorite Xmas song.  It always puts me in a good mood.  I can't waist for Xmas just so I can play it.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"The magic of Donnie still lives in this album. It's clear sounds really take you to a calm place, that you will want to stay."
,B00122OMHW,1,1,5,Just kidding. travis comes up with some great lyrics for his songs. they have a great beat too. Maybe he will make more great songs.
,B00122LVWG,1,1,4,"had a mellow sound.  They were like the Mamas and Papas without the Mamas.  Great harmony.  Windy was probably their biggest hit, but this was their best song overall..."
,B00122LVWG,1,1,5,"I was looking to put together a special CD for a friend.  Finally found out what ""their song"" was.  Easy to use"
,B00122LVWG,1,1,5,I purchased the MP3 version for a family video. I was nicely surprised at the easy download and clear recording.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,4,What more can I say that has not already been said about this beautiful song. A classic for ALL times.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Old school. No one can sing it better than Donny!
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Download is clear and sound is clear. His version of this song is so beautiful!
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,love music
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Great song quality.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Great song quality.  This brought back many good memories.
,B00122LVWG,-1,1,5,Timeless
,B00122LVWG,1,1,5,You guessed it another song I can't live without.
,B00122LVWG,1,1,5,I like it.
,B00122LVWG,1,1,5,"Cherish is another of the Association's finest ballads, that you'll catch yourself humming along to all day long. Others, such as David Cassidy, have recorded it, but nothing beats this classic."
,B00122LVWG,1,1,5,Great music as always.
,B00122LVWG,1,1,4,Nice old music
,B00122LVWG,1,1,4,I had the album (The Association-Greatest Hits) when I was growing up and loved several of the songs. I have always loved The Association singing Cherish and am enjoying listening to it again.
,B00122LVWG,1,1,5,"Digitally stored music keeps my house free from the clutter associated with collecting tapes, CDs and records. Yes, I said Records!"
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,love it
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Christmas classic!
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Donny is excellent as always
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Was exactly what i was expecting.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"Beautiful song, one everyone would love!!"
,B00122PIMA,-1,-1,2,"This CD has a lot of big Names playing on it and although I respect all the Players this just isn't my cup of tea when it comes to music.  It remind me of when Paul McCartney goes off on a big band tangent.  Yes good music, just not what I like."
,B00122PVD6,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00122PVD6,1,1,5,MUST listen to & definitely worth buying. One of the songs you can listen to for many years & it just never gets old
,B00122PVD6,1,1,5,Definitely has a deep and sad melodic atmosphere about the tune which conveys something of a hidden message of loss. There's allot of depth in this song and it realizes a period in the 80's that seems to ring True in the death of an era that the Gen-Xers can attest to all the same.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Awesome and I truly loved this product!!!
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,a brilliant artis in his own rite
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"The BEST version of this song, EVER! A staple in our Christmas music line up. Mr. Donny Hathaway was a Fantastic singer. His voice was steady, sweet and wonderful. He had great control and a whole lot of soul. Very Talented singer."
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Great sound
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,My favorite song.
,B00122PIMA,1,1,4,"Robert Plant and Jimmy Page,late of Led Zeppelin,mellow out with some R&B/swing numbers like the Top 10 hit SEA OF LOVE and the Top 20 hit ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT. Joining Plant and Page in this ensemble is Nile Rodgers,who himself had chart success with his R&B band Chic. Rodgers had quite a workload with this album and Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN. It's understandable that Plant and Page declined to carry on with Led Zeppelin after the 1980 death of drummer John Bonham. SOL was made famous originally by Phil Phillips in 1959. The differences between Phillips' recording and the cover are no ""buh-buh-buh-bum"" in the cover,a key change in the cover and Plant's accenting of some of the lyrics differently than how Phillips did it. I guess that's because Plant is English(as is Page) and Phillips is American(as is Rodgers). ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT really swings. It got the lively 1940's sound that the fighting men of World War II were dancing to at clubs. After this album,Plant,whose solo career began in or around 1982,continued going solo. Page formed his third band THE FIRM and released an album in 1985. Recently,the surviving Led Zeppelin members re-formed with a new drummer and are currently on tour."
,B00122PIMA,1,1,4,"The Honeydrippers consisted of two members of the collapsed band called Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. After Page and Plant added some new faces they had a new band, The Honeydrippers. Their new band does some great covers some of their songs. Unfortunately, this CD is rather short--and that disappoints me. What we do get, though, is excellent quality!

The track set begins with ""I Get A Thrill."" The band gives the arrangement a big band/swing/50s rock and roll flavor to this number; and the band harmonizes to perfection! Listen for some great piano playing; and the drums and percussion bolster ""I Get A Thrill"" very well. Love that electric guitar, too! ""Sea Of Love"" opens with a grand musical flourish from the violins; and when the band comes in they play and sing without a superfluous note! ""Sea Of Love"" gives us The Honeydrippers delivering one of their strongest, most enchanting love ballads ever. They harmonize well as they sing this nostalgic song to celebrate the joys of being in love. The musical interlude uses the electric guitar very well, too.

""I Got A Woman"" is a song written by the late great Ray Charles; The Honeydrippers pick up the tempo to perform this song at a faster than normal clip. The tempo helps to emphasize the joyfulness of this number that has a man celebrating his love for his woman. The band delivers this flawlessly; and the horn solo during the musical interlude impresses me very much. ""Young Boy Blues"" uses some great chord changes to make this number special, too.

The CD ends with the awesome track entitled ""Rockin' At Midnight."" If you really want to hear rock mixed with both big band and swing, listen for THIS ballad. The band celebrates being out on the town with their girlfriends; and the musical arrangement pulls out all the stops to make this number stun you with its power! The guitar solo bolsters the number as the horns play during the musical interlude; and the overall effect of ""Rockin' At Midnight"" packs a strong punch!

The liner notes include some great artwork and we get the song credits, too.

The Honeydrippers never developed to the extent I hoped they would; but this CD gives us excellent material from a band that lacked nothing. I only wish there were more than the paltry five songs on this CD! I have to take off a star because of this disappointment.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this playful, energetic CD put out by The Honeydrippers. Led Zeppelin fans will at the very least be intrigued by this CD; and people who thirst for that big band sound with those crooning vocals will love this one. Pop it in your CD player and enjoy!

Great job, guys! Thank you!"
,B00122OK1K,-1,1,4,It seems as though I purchased this twice without thinking that they were the same.  I need to pay more attention
,B00122OK1K,-1,-1,3,"I bought this because I can not find my cd, but again my computer hard drive took a dump not long after this.  It is not really anything wrong with music, just no luck.  The computer was old anyhow."
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,Loved it!
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,"It was their last great hit, and a hit it was.  I remember it being played on the radio for at least a half year, and every dance club played it regularly.  Yeah, it does bring back some wonderful memories."
,B00122PZHI,-1,1,5,BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.....
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,I can't get this old tune out of my head!  I still love it and it's great to work out to!
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,LUV IT!
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Wondetful
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,Great song
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,Who from my generation can't love this whole album as a MP3 download! Love it and love his music. Always have. Thanks!
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,I grew up with this song and now in my later years i had to have it!! This is a clasic
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,One of my absolutely all time favorites. I listen to it at the gym!! The song really makes me step up the pace.!!
,B00122PZHI,1,1,5,I love this song.  RB at it's best.  I can listen to this song over and over.  It puts me into a good mood when I listen to it and that is what music should be about.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Love this song. One of my all time favorite Christmas songs of all time. Donny Hathaway was a great singer/songwriter
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,This song has been remade by many artists but none can compare to the amazing Donny Hathaway. Every year since I was a kid we'd blast this song on the radio. I loved it and still do. It makes me smile and remember the first time I ever listened to the song. His velvety smooth voice is literally music to the ears. Hands down this is my favorite holiday song.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,It's just not quite the holidays without this song. I do enjoy hearing it for the holiday season. It really takes me back.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"Some Christmas songs are depressing. This one is not. When I want to get the Christmas spirit, this song gets me there. It paints the perfect Christmas day and is filled with joy. I stop and smile whenever this song comes on the radio, is played in stores or at Christmas parties. Thanks Donny Hathaway for lending your voice to this amazing Christmas song."
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,I asked my kids who sings this christmas and they said Chris Brown... so I had to educate them and tell them who the original singer is... sounds so good to my ears and they had to agree it was better than CB... nothing against CB I like his music too.
,B00122Q2KM,1,1,5,"If you collect this type of music, it is definitely one of the 'must have' songs if you are into this kind of music."
,B00122Q2KM,1,1,5,This song came out on the Set It Off soundtrack and I've loved it since then.  En Vogue is classic anyhow.
,B00122Q2KM,1,1,5,Amazing song the girls all are really talented and sound good together and the lyrics are awesome. My favorite part was ahh  loved it all
,B00122Q2KM,1,1,5,"I love Envogue! When I first heard this song I was a teenager, and right away I loved it! Their voices are so amazeing, I love to sing along with them, singing is one of my passions. Lol"
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Really smooth song on the kindle. I love it. Sounds great at my desk while at work. Keeps me in a happy mood.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,My grandson is learning this song for his x-mas play at preschool. To hear my baby sing along with Donny Hathaway warms my heart!
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG FOR THIS AND ANY TIME OF THE YEAR I LISTEN TO THIS SONG IN MY HOUSE,IN MY CAR , ON MY PHONE. DONNY HATHAWAY WAS THE ALL TIME FAVES. HIS VOICE AND MUSIC REALLY TELL A STORY ABOUT HIM AND HIS LIFE."
,B00122OUI8,1,1,4,"Great for Christmas season, a song that sounds awesome. He died too soon before more music could be made.  Great music"
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"Excellent listening , get the Christmas spirit. This Christmas is one of the bestChristmas songs. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to get the spirit of Christmas."
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"""This Christmas"" has been done many times, by many artists, but no version will every instantly transport you to Christmas magic like Donny Hathaway's."
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,"this is one of those classic, must have christmas songs. love it and glad i bought it. i definitely listen to it all thru the holidays and sometimes even after that!"
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,Any lover of classic Christmas music must have this gem in their collection. The combination Donny's distinctive vocals and original lyrics are as soothing as an open hearth fire.
,B00122OUI8,1,1,5,I have enjoyed listening to this song over the years as a Christmas favorite. This year I realized that I needed to add it to my Christmas collection so that I could enjoy it over and over again. I went on Amazon.com and purchased the Mp3. Why should I wait until the holidays to enjoy the songs that have brought me such pleasure.
,B00122P5LO,1,1,5,"Great song, but this is the extended version with lyrics you don't hear on the original cuts"
,B00122P5LO,1,1,5,It met all my expectations. It's nostalgic.
,B00122P5LO,1,1,5,Great song from a great album.
,B00122PEYC,1,1,5,"This song is the definition of a ""Party Song""! Play it at a gathering with good friends and it will really get people going. If you haven't heard it you should give it a listen."
,B00122PEYC,-1,1,5,"If you want to recreate the feeling of being at the Lambeau, you need this song.  Queue it up, and wait for the Pack to score a TD You probably won't have to wait too long ;).  Rock out til commercials, then go grab a beer.  Repeat."
,B00122P5LO,1,1,4,"I always loved this song. I have all my Prince music on CD's, and I needed a quick way to get to his music by downloading some songs. Due to multiple versions of the same song, for download, I inadvertantly downloaded ""extended"" versions of some songs. I prefer the originals, and in error, got the extended version of this song ""Controversy"". I LOVE the song, but don't like the extended version. Get the original single of this song. A classic."
,B00122P5LO,1,1,5,"love old school ""PRINCE"" never be another"
,B00122P5LO,1,1,5,The Artist. Musical Genius.
,B00122PEYC,-1,1,4,party song I don't want to work !
,B00122PEYC,1,1,5,I'm not a big Todd Rundgren fan but this a great tune to play at the end of the work week when you are ready to play!
,B00122PEYC,1,1,4,I really like this song and it did serve it's purpose to where I needed it and like listening  to it just because and is so upbeat...Now that's what I like...
,B00122PEYC,1,1,5,"This song is fun.  Even though I'm retired now, it makes me think of when I worked wishing I could go home right now.  Great song to be played loud."
,B00122NPDE,1,1,5,You can never go wrong with the Doobie Brothers.  My 6 year old son asked me to get this song.  He heard it once and fell in love!
,B00122NPDE,1,1,5,"You know them. They are songs you remember growing up. But like most people, I only had so much $ and ""albums"" (ask an under-30-year-old what that is) were relatively expensive. I got this album, but it is gone the way of my 8-track tapes.

This is back in the time when albums had, maybe 3 good songs on them, if that. I can name the albums full of great songs on 2 hands. This album was one I could listen all the way through.

This is the era of Another Park and the pre-MM days. Before all the pop-stuff."
,B00122Q7CK,1,1,5,"I think I selected my girlfriends in this manner (I think I love her, etc.).  a 1968 song by American rock band Tommy James and the Shondells. Written by the duo of Tommy James and drummer Peter Lucia Jr. It had a way of working on a person's mood and attitude. Nice to hear the old tunes from so long ago."
,B00122QCDY,1,1,5,"Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams was the BoDeans initial entry and studio album.  Produced by T Bone Burnett, BoDeans, at that time consisting of Kurt Neumann, Sammy Llanas, Guy Hoffman and Bob Griffin, and released in May 1986, L&H&S&D would spawn such hits as She's a Runaway, Fade Away and Lookin' For Me Somewhere.

Rolling Stone, while saying the album was ""average"" branded BoDeans as Best New Group.  What can you say?  They were darned good.

Listening to those songs it's easy to take yourself back to a simpler time... at least that's how it works for me."
,B00122QCDY,1,1,5,This is another great cd its piecefull music it not loud & noisy. any one that orders it won't be let down at all unless you are ito noisy then this is't for you.
,B00122QCDY,1,1,4,"The Bodeans sounded old and world weary when they were young.  This album, while not my favorite, have several classics (She's a Runaway, Angels, Looking for Me Somewhere).  There needs to be a place where bands like this can be played forever."
,B00122NPNO,1,1,4,Great
,B00122QCDY,1,1,4,"Back in 1985/86, Slash Records seemed to be on the brink of starting a whole new American Breed of Rockers. They had new albums and new bands from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Los-Lobos/dp/B000CCD0F8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Los Lobos</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blasters/dp/B000VUTP4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blasters</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodeans/dp/B00005Y1Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodeans</a>. They all got sort of lumped into the 'new wave' category, but there was something more going on here. ""Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams"" was one of the best embodiments of this group of bands, and reissue, almost 25 years after the fact, shows why.

The Bodeans were young and enthusiastic kids who wanted to make their own sound. Being from Wisconsin, they has no burning desire to be trendy or fashionable, just to make music that felt like escape to them. With the first thrilling notes of ""She's A Runaway"" and the rocking theme of breakout the song offers, it's an instant classic that should have slotted in comfortably next to the Springsteen or Mellencamp hits of the day. T-Bone Burnette heard the truth inside the songs and the vocal magic Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas made, and hauled them away to Los Angeles to make this album. ""Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams"" is a missing link of an album, the chain the runs between The Everly Brothers and The Rolling Stones (from whom the album nicked its title).

The remaster sounds incredible. The BoDeans were still fresh and excited, with T-Bone at the top of his early production game. ""Rickshaw Riding"" has sudden space in its slowbreathing sound. ""Looking for Me Somewhere"" sounds like Johnny Cash passed on it to hand it over to these youngsters. And the bonus track ""Turn Your Radio On"" makes you wonder why this Chuck Berry-ish rocker got left behind."
,B00122QCDY,1,1,4,"Back in 1985/86, Slash Records seemed to be on the brink of starting a whole new American Breed of Rockers. They had new albums and new bands from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Los-Lobos/dp/B000CCD0F8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Los Lobos</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blasters/dp/B000VUTP4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blasters</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodeans/dp/B00005Y1Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodeans</a>. They all got sort of lumped into the 'new wave' category, but there was something more going on here. ""Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams"" was one of the best embodiments of this group of bands, and reissue, almost 25 years after the fact, shows why.

The Bodeans were young and enthusiastic kids who wanted to make their own sound. Being from Wisconsin, they has no burning desire to be trendy or fashionable, just to make music that felt like escape to them. With the first thrilling notes of ""She's A Runaway"" and the rocking theme of breakout the song offers, it's an instant classic that should have slotted in comfortably next to the Springsteen or Mellencamp hits of the day. T-Bone Burnette heard the truth inside the songs and the vocal magic Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas made, and hauled them away to Los Angeles to make this album. ""Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams"" is a missing link of an album, the chain the runs between The Everly Brothers and The Rolling Stones (from whom the album nicked its title).

The remaster sounds incredible. The BoDeans were still fresh and excited, with T-Bone at the top of his early production game. ""Rickshaw Riding"" has sudden space in its slowbreathing sound. ""Looking for Me Somewhere"" sounds like Johnny Cash passed on it to hand it over to these youngsters. And the bonus track ""Turn Your Radio On"" makes you wonder why this Chuck Berry-ish rocker got left behind.

The there's the DVD, a homecoming of sorts with a live Minneapolis concert from 1985. Again, there's this brash enthusiasm that only a hungry young band could muster, and it's great fun to watch. It's east to see why (if you believe Kurt's liner notes) the T-Bone urged the suits at Warners to sing The Bodeans because ""they're gonna be bigger than The Beatles."" It includes songs that never made it to the studio albums done in front of a hometown audience, excited that their local heroes just might be the next big thing. ""Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams"" captures that desire, and this re-issue - from the good folks at Rhino - makes you scratch your head as to why it didn't happen."
,B00122NPNO,1,1,5,Great
,B00122NPNO,1,1,5,great
,B00122NPNO,1,1,5,For the old school listeners this was a chart topper and chart crosser. if you are not hip to this song just go to Amazon and listen to the sample.
,B00122NPNO,1,1,5,"I am one of the Original Baby Boomers and when I first learned to love and buy music The Doobie Brothers was one of the first groups I listened to.  They not only had a funky beat but you can dance to their music with no special skills at all.  I am an avid fan and I also follow Michael McDonald as well who was one of founding members of the Doobie Brothers.  Unfortunately when he left the group their music style changed quite a bit and I no longer just follow them.

I brought this CD because it has some of my most favorite songs by the Doobie Brothers.  I have all of Michael McDonald's music and I cannot wait for them to do a reunion tour if that is ever in the works.  The Doobie Brothers played at Red Rocks but the magic that I once felt for them was just not there.  I recommend this CD if you want to get your Doobie Fix."
,B00122NPNO,1,1,5,This recording is just as I remembered hearing on the radio years ago.  Glad I have this in my collection in iTunes and on-line in my Amazon Cloud Player.

Not a big fan of drugs and skepticism--I've already lived those days, but the song still brings back memories and it's a good solid piece.

,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"Alice Cooper's 1982 ""Zipper Catches Skin"" is more straight-ahead rock and less New Wave than his two previous albums, but contains some material that seems like leftovers from ""Flush the Fashion"" and ""Special Forces"".

It's an average Alice album at best, and if you skip this one you're not missing that much.

The best cuts are the galloping opener ""Zorro's Ascent""; The fiery, clever ""Tag, You're It"" has Alice assuming the role of horror-movie director and the entire song is made up of his direction to the terrified leading lady hiding from a psycho-killer. It alone makes this album worth getting. Though the militant ""I Better Be Good"" sounds like a leftover from ""Special Forces"", it's still one of the best tracks here lyrically and musically. Patty Donahue of The Waitresses appears to take Alice to task on ""I Like Girls"" and her asides are typically amusing and make the song (""What happened? Run out of gas?"" etc).

Among the rest: ""Make That Money (Scrooge's Song)"" is nothing special except the instrumental finale sounds like something straight out of the ""Killer"" era, which should please fans of the original ACG. In the slower ""I Am the Future"", Alice forgoes the sap of earlier shamaltz for a ballad with bite--exactly like a slow Coop song should be.

Some of the lyrics get a little silly, as on ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" but it's a decent sing-a-long cut nontheless, the showy chorus reminiscent of ""Hello Hurray"". The rocking ""I'm Alive (That Was the Day My Dead Pet Returned)"" also sounds like something from B$B updated for 1982.

""Adaptable (Anything For You)"", ""Remarkably Insincere"" are actually both UNremarkable.

Although ""Zipper Catches Skin"" is not a bad album--and would be decent for any other artist, Alice is capable of much more than what's here.

Three Stars--an average Coop effort."
,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"A year after the stripped-down attack of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Special-Forces/dp/B002XIN11M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Special Forces</a>, Alice Cooper produced another album in the same vein. Though this time with added theatrical flair and the return of guitarist Dick Wagner. Cooper continued to assume new identities, such as the famed swordsman of ""Zorro's Ascent"" and the put-upon son of ""Make That Money (Scrooge's Song)."" Some of the performances seem labored, and Wagner's distinctive guitar riffs feel as if they were grafted onto the songs to add flash. The stagey ballad ""I Am the Future"" might have worked well as a production number, but with Cooper descending back into alcohol addiction there was no tour. What works well is Cooper's humor on ""No Baloney Homosapiens,"" ""I Like Girls"" and ""Remarkably Insincere."" And on ""Tag, You're It"" he indulges his longtime love of cheesy cinema with a song full of slasher-film clichs. If there was no 1970s legacy with which to compare this, one might stumble upon this and think it's a long-lost power-pop album from a surprisingly talented lyricist. It's all quite listenable, and even fun as it passes by, but it's not nearly as memorable as his earlier (and some of his later) works. Collectors' Choice's domestic reissue adds the UK-only 1982 single ""For Britain Only,"" and its four-panel booklet includes new liner notes by Gene Sculatti. [2010 hyperbolium dot com]"
,B00122PJ0G,1,1,5,Happy to find this song
,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"Alice Cooper-Zipper Catches Skin **1/2

The way I look at most of Alice Coopers releases from the early to mid 1980's is the same way I look at Iggy Pop's work form the same time period. None of it is really horrible (at least not completely) but none of it is really great. They both seem to have like the whole new wave thing and wanted to join in on it. It didn't work out well for either of them. But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n' roll and yet they wanted to do something...bad..? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music.

'Zorro's Ascent' 'No Baloney Homosapiens' 'I Like Girls' and 'Tag, Your It' are all decent rock tracks. They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics. Especially 'No Baloney...' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name. Though 'Remarkably Insencire' is a real gem.

The rest of the album feels trite and boring, not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music. The production for one thing is horrendous.

While not too bad and not a total waste of your money, Zipper Catches Skin is not an album worth hunting down. IF you happen to come across it yeah it makes a cool snag, but ditch the high hopes for this one."
,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"This one has to be Alice's most inconsistent albums.  It's material ranges all over the place seemingly in search of a direction, but not really finding one.  Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on ""Special Forces"".  This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long.  Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting.  I did hear ""I Like Girls"" on my local AOR station a few times, but that was about it.  Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads, I like a lot of this disc.  You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff, as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous.  Highlights include ""Zorro's Ascent"" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together ""Adaptable"", ""I Like Girls"", and ""Remarkably Insincere"".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  ""Tag You're It"" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" days.  ""It Better Be Good"" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  ""I Am The Future"" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.  ""I'm Alive"" is another clunker that closes out the album.  Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly.  Still, I like most of it and it is defiantly one of Cooper's most ""fun"" albums."
,B00122PK9Q,1,-1,3,"Originally released in 1982, this was the follow-up to his 'Special Forces' effort (see my review). 'Zipper Catches Skin' is a rather 'off' the beaten path lp for Alice. That's not to say it doesn't have good songs, because it does. Tunes I thought were good were ""Zorro's Ascent"" (it's got a great beat to it), the radio friendly ""I Like Girls"" (with guest vocalist The Waitress's Patty Donahue - R.I.P.), ""Tag,You're It"" and ""I'm Alive (That Was The Day My Dead Pet Returned to Save My Life)"". There's a cut here ""I Am The Future"" that at first I didn't remember where I've heard it before. Turns out it was part of the movie soundtrack for 'Class Of '84'. Line-up: Alice - vocals, Mike Pinera & Richard Wagner - guitars, Erik Scott - bass, Duane Hitchings - synthesizer and Jan Uvena - drums. Make not a classic, but [very] decent."
,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"""Zipper Catches Skin"" may be the most unbalanced Cooper disk recorded. It has some fantastic songs like ""Tag, You're It"", a tribute to 80's slasher films in which Alice sings as if directing a B-Movie. ""Adaptable"" is a really fun song that will stay in your head after just one listen to the album. And you have ""I Like Girls"" and ""Remarkably Insincere"" which are fun songs about a womanizing loser. ""I Am the Future"" is actually a pretty dark song lyrically and I think is the standout song on the album. But, on the flip side you have what may be Cooper's worst song ever with ""No Baloney Homosapiens"". I am sure at the time, Cooper thought this was pretty clever, but musically it just does not flow, the lyrics are choppy, and forced into a rhyming scheme that just doesn't work. ""Make That Money"" is another forgettable ditty, with lyrics again not befitting Alice Cooper. But outside of those two songs Alice I think ""Zipper Catches Skin"" is a really good album, but still the weakest of the early 80's New Age Alice. I prefer ""Flush the Fashion"", ""Special Forces"" and the best of this era ""DaDa"". Still, it's Alice Cooper and worth the price for the import, if for nothing else than to own the entire Cooper Collection."
,B00122PK9Q,1,1,5,"Zipper Catches Skin is my biggest guilty pleasure ever!  I can listen to it at anytime, well unless other people are around who just don't understand the album.  If you're familiar with 70s Cooper and maybe 90s and onward, you have got to check this out because you will have no idea what Alice Cooper was thinking but you will find yourself loving the tunes!  Zorro's Ascent, I Like Girls, That Was the Day My Dead Returned to Save My Life... all hysterically funny and damn catchy!
The album even spawned the greatest swear phrase ever... ""Boink Off!""  Yes it's actually used on the album and how no one laughed on the recording is beyond me!"
,B00122PJ0G,1,1,5,"I am a huge Prince fan.  This is a classic song, though lesser known.  May his soul rest in peace."
,B00122PJ0G,1,1,5,Great song!
,B00122PJ0G,1,1,5,I adore prince
,B00122PJ0G,1,1,5,Love it...anyone knows about Prince's music should know about 1999.
,B00122PK9Q,-1,1,4,"Around the time this album came out, most people were probably thinking, ""What has happened to Alice Cooper?"" or ""What is Alice Cooper thinking?""  After he tried to reinvent himself for the 80s with Flush The Fashion, I think many people abandoned him for the cruddy new bands that started popping up.  The punk sound that he hinted at with Flush The Fashion and carried on with on Special Forces is still in play here.  This could actually be part 2 to Special Forces minus the ... attitude.  Alice uses this album to totally let loose his humor side with mixed results.  It's really not as funny as Alice thinks it is.  That's not to say I don't enjoy it, I do.  I actually like this album quite a bit.  I think it's great that he tried something different regardless of what people think.  The only flaw in my eyes is that it seems as though Alice Cooper-the man was taking a vacation from Alice Cooper-the character.  All of us fans fell in love with the creepy character of Alice Cooper, and this album comes across as an album by the man and not the character.  Look at his picture on the cover.  Yes, it is funny, but ""Alice Cooper"" wouldn't do something like that, or make an album of songs like that either.  Same can be said for Special Forces(though I can see the outfit working, but not the lyrics), or Flush The Fashion(where I can see the songs working but not the image).  This may sound like I'm putting these three albums down, but I really like and listen to them quite a bit.  This little known ""weird"" period of Alice's(Flush, Forces, Zipper, Dada) is very underrated if you ask me, and should be given alot more credit and attention than it does.  It's sad that the ""Trash"" period is more well known and favored.  I know this review won't be read by many because of that, and it's only hardcore Alice Cooper fans that will take any interest in this album at all.  And since that's the case, you already own it or you're eventually gonna get it and were curious about it....It'll be one step closer to having the whole collection, and you just may be surprised that it's actually a good album.  Different(it's no Love It To Death), but good nonetheless. ..."
,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,2,"Alice was far too lost by this point to make a comeback record, and it shows. Aside from ""We Are The Future,"" there really isn't a decent song here. Since you can get ""Future"" on the Box Set, you can take a pass on this one."
,B00122Q9PK,1,1,5,excellent song

,B00122T5SI,1,1,5,I love Chaka Khan and this was an awesome song by her I play this jam everyday I love her music.
,B00122T5SI,1,1,5,"I've loved this song since the first time I heard it, and all these years later, it's still brand new. I'm happy that Chaka recorded it even though it wasn't a favorite of hers. She poured her heart and soul into this tune, and it shows. This is undoubtedly one of my all-time favorite Chaka Khan songs!"
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,"I just love this--absolutely love it!!  I was a bit disappointed to read in an article that Chaka Khan said she didn't like the rap that was added into it--she actually said she wouldn't have done the song if she knew they were going to arrange it like that.  But I think all of her fans out here disagree with her--it came out fabulous.  She sounded as great as she ever did, the music had us all on the dance floor, and Melle Mel being included was a nice touch that the song just wouldn't have been the same without."
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,"I tried buying this on Google Play but they gave me the wrong version and there wasn't a whole lot of selection on Google Play for this particular song, therefore I can only assume they don't have it! Tsk tsk. In my opinion, it's best to get it from the Amazon mp3 database. As for the song and version itself - awesome and classic hit from the mid 1980es"
,B00122RZNA,1,1,4,I wanted to add this song to my collection.  I now have a larger MP3 player with room for more music so I am adding additional songs that I didn't have room for before.
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,"I remember listening to this back in the day, and was thinking of fun, earlier days that the song sent me back to.  Having Wonder do the harmonica was inspired indeed.  This is another example of a classic song written and performed by someone else (Prince originally wrote this song) becoming better known by someone else (just like Otis Redding orignally wrote ""Respect"", but Aretha Franklin's rendition is the more beloved one.) Either way, it's a song that should on anyone's Mp3 player."
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,Great memory! Loved it!
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,yep
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,Great song
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,Great
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,"Upbeat, fun and danceable tune. Two thumbs up high."
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,"always loved this song. I think she helped Prince with this, and I prefer this version to his. From the spoken word intro to the awesome harmonica break and the awesome vocals, there is nothing here not to like."
,B00122RZNA,1,1,5,love  Chaka  Khan  her music  is always  rockin  !
,B00122T6OQ,1,1,5,Great song
,B00122T6OQ,1,1,5,was looking for this song for a long time and didn't want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didn't want.
,B00122T6OQ,1,1,5,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.
,B00122RX8C,1,1,4,Always have.  Brings back a lot of good memories.  Recommend this to anyone who might love soft rock and not the kind that requires being blitzed . . .
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,"Have always loved this song, I am slowly rebuilding my collection of some of my old vinyl record favorites.  Digital music is so much more convenient than vinyl, tapes or CD's!"
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,"Its a song of joy, peace, and if you can get on board with what the artist are kicking out to you then we all would be better off
and continue to let the Crystal Blue Persuade you. So turn the volume up and relax."
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
,B00122TBN2,1,1,5,"OLD SCHOOLNEW SCHOOL MY FAVORITE UP TEMPLE BY KEITH TAKES ME BACK TO THE "" GOOD OL"" 90's when some of the best OLD SCHOOLNEW SCHOOL CAME OUT"
,B00122TBN2,1,1,5,love it
,B00122TBN2,1,1,5,"Only got it to at least add to my overall collection.  I'm a DJ and as such, I might be a little more critical but the basic review is that I like this classic song...it's enough to keep in my main collection and for personal tastes it's going to be in my regular rotation say, in my car or on my mp3 player.  Would recommend if you know this artist."
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,"enjoy this music, reminds me of playing it while driving it down to the shore"
,B00122RX8C,1,1,4,Really puts you in the mood.. It really takes you back
,B00122RX8C,1,1,4,Love this song
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,"I liked Bread when I was young (but often didn't admit it). Back then I took a little kidding for liking Bread when the ""cool"" people were into more edgy music.

When I recently I learned Bread's music was spoke to my brother and sister-in-Law's deepest feelings for each other I sought out the ""Best of Bread"" album. I'm glad I did because it renewed my interest and reminded me how much I like their music. One of several favorites on the ""best of"" album is  ""Make it With You."" It spoke to my late teen romantic heart. Hearing it now helps me remember those heady feelings and give me a 3 minute escape on a Love Song Magic Carpet to a simpler time.

Bread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I appreciate how much they meant to friends and family just a bit older than me too.

I'm glad I gave them another look. It was well worth it and :""Make it with You"" is well worth 5 stars to me.

Hope this helps someone!"
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,I love this band and their music
,B00122T9DO,1,1,4,VERY GOOD
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,Love these old tunes.  I'm glad I can pick and choose on Amazon digital.
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,On of my favorite songs of all time.
,B00122T9DO,1,1,4,good old song
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,Love it
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,perfect
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,Takes me back a few years.
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,great
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,classic!
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,"Great Song!
Samuel Medina"
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,Great song.
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,Enjoyed it
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,I'm 65; song brings back great memories!
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,I do not recall the movie name but when I heard this playing in the background I had to buy it and add it to the Old Rock playlist....so many good memories.....enjoy!
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,"So I'm sitting at home over a cold, snowy weekend watching the ""Breaking Bad"" marathon on AMC. And in one of the episodes where Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are happily going about making Heisenberg Blue, ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" starts playing as the bed for this segment. Just about the entire song. And it occurred to me that besides it being the perfect song for this particular episode, Tommy James & the Shondells did a great job on this song. They were originally a 60s Top 40 band but in the late 60s put out what would be considered psychedelic rock. This song, however, captures a little bit of jazz, vocal harmonies, great keyboards, and an overall adult contemporary feel. So I decided to download it ... but without the Heisenberg Blue ;-)"
,B00122T9DO,-1,1,5,"hello,
  having heard the song back in the early 70's, it was put away in our files.  but the quality of the tapes was not that great, so a digital copy was going to replace it.  amazon gave us a perk for ordering other products in the kindle line, so we got our digital copy via amazon download service.  since we watched breaking bad (like all of the other zillion people) straight through, the song urged us to download a digital copy. now it is on the rotation of songs...  great song and by the way, it was a great song before breaking bad, but after, it will forever be remembered as the song about....the blue stuff..."
,B00122T9DO,1,1,5,"I never cared for Tommy james and the shondells. When I first heard this song one afternoon with my girlfriend, I couldn't believe it. I was blown away by the great sound, song arrangement, even the vocal wasn'tt bad. No droning on abut ""mony Mony"" or ""hanky Panky"". It was like Tommy James had a dream with Gordon Jenkins, Sammy Cahn, and Antonio Carlos jobim lending a hand. Like the old saying ""even a blind squirrel finds an acorn once in a while""."
,B00122RX8C,1,1,4,Good song from the 70's
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,Great song.
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,Great mp3
,B00122RX8C,1,1,4,"Bread fans will note that this band was one of the better 70's soft rock groups that got a significant amount of airplay on many radio stations during that space in time. David Gates and company's ""Anthology"" CD is a nice overview of the band's career, and is worth adding to your music library."
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,"Another song that I always liked but not enough to buy an entire CD. I will now be able to pick and choose the songs that I like by Bread, for my playlist."
,B00122RX8C,1,1,4,"Great Song, what can I say... I needed that song for a party and it was easy to get, just downloaded it."
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,This is a song that I never get tired of. I think this was probably one of the most under rated bands. Their songs had a deep emotional impact on me.
,B00122RX8C,1,1,5,"What can i say, this is a perfect love song or better yet maybe a perfect just want to make love to you song i guess you could look at it like there isn't any love involved but i like to think there is. Don't you?"
,B00122TBOQ,1,1,5,Love how easy it is to purchase and download music on the website.  Will continue to download music in the future.
,B00122R1RU,1,1,5,"I will always love this song... I will always love Prince ""His Royal Badness"" You have to be old school to understand :)"
,B00122R1RU,-1,1,4,Downloaded very easily.  Good quality playback on my computer and it was a good price for a single mp3 and burned easily.
,B00122R1RU,1,1,5,"I bought this to make a suspected friend a cd for their wedding, and I don't know it they like."
,B00122S6JC,1,1,5,Freaking awesome song...
,B00122S6JC,1,1,5,I first heard this song in the movie Heat.  It never fails to get my blood pumping.  Definitely a high speed top down driving song.
,B00122R2EW,1,-1,3,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B00122R2EW,1,1,5,This album reminds me of when I fished as a youngster. It took me back to yester year. Fishin in the Dark was some of the best times fishin.
,B00122R2EW,1,1,5,This another one of the must have for any classic country fan. I recommend it for any one who likes classic country and it will have you singing along in no time!
,B00122T77M,1,1,5,love it
,B00122T77M,1,1,5,Awesome track
,B00122T77M,1,1,4,"I'm constantly searching for music to make my gym workout better.  This song by Bootsy fills the bill.  Much of the current music is filled with words that I don't care for but this song is clean.  I will add that I still listen to artist such as Shade Sheist and others, but I wish they would lose the filthy language.  Bootsy can be played for the whole family!"
,B00122T77M,1,1,5,"This is a great song by a bassist who was lucky enough to play with two musical geniuses (James Brown and George Clinton) :) The singing and overall performance on this song is solid and worth listening to repeatedly. A great song with a classic Paliament/Funkadelic feel, groove and sound!"
,B00122T77M,1,1,5,Love how easy it is to purchase and download music on the website.  Will continue to download music in the future.
,B00122UNM0,1,1,4,Forgot about this song until I was playing Guitar Hero......or maybe it was Rock Band then had to download it
,B00122UNM0,1,1,5,Dio is the best
,B00122UNM0,1,1,4,"I originally bought this on LP, way back when, and even went to the forum in Inglewood, CA to see it performed live. Over the years I lost track of the album, but thanks to Amazon, I can once again listen to it and relive those wonderful days of yesteryear!"
,B00122R1RU,1,1,5,I love Prince.

,B00122R2EW,1,1,5,"top notch, A +,absolutely love this song, have since I was a kid."
,B00122R2EW,1,1,5,"Loved it, Thank You so much."
,B00122R1RU,1,1,5,Just what I was looking for.
,B00122R2EW,1,1,5,"Will definitely down ALL of my favorite music instead of buying the album, CD etc.  Very easy to download with click of a couple of buttons."
,B00122R2EW,1,1,5,I have already said this band is great. Great music and I would recommend it to anyone. Foot stomping be bopping good time.
,B00122R2EW,1,1,5,"1987's ""Fishin' in the Dark"" was the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's third, and last (..so far), #1 single.  Having made the move from SoCal folk-rock band in the late 60's to Nashville-based country band by the early 80's, NGDB never fully lost its roots and is often credited with influencing the modern country-crossover movement.

You certainly hear those blended influences in ""Fishin' in the Dark"", which marries the toe-tapping twang of mid-80's Nashville country with the vocal harmonies of earlier SoCal folk-rockers like the Mamas and Papas.  The result is a landmark cross-over song that is both simple to listen to, and delightful to revisit."
,B00122TESY,1,1,5,"I love Donny Hathaway and I love this song.  Just takes you down memory lane.  His voice was amazing.  Those were the days when singers could reallysing.

Thanks"
,B00122TESY,1,1,5,"THis is a must have if you are interested in music and singers, he is the best ever. Anyone who has ever become a singer
of any merit learned something from this man."
,B00122TESY,1,1,5,Beautiful Classic and what a voice.  So sad we lost Donny Hathaway - always loved his sound
,B00122TESY,1,1,5,One of my many favs of his!
,B00122TESY,1,1,5,"Wow. It just doesn't get any better than this.....If you love music/jazz, you will simply be overwhelmed by THE BEST: the music, the jazz, the voice.....WOW."
,B00122TESY,1,1,5,A great love song
,B00122TESY,1,1,4,Good music
,B00122TESY,1,1,5,"I always, always cry when I hear this song. I can't help it! It makes me miss my grandmother, it make me love my husband more and makes me want to hug my daughter more, if you want to see me turn to pudding just play this song."
,B00122TDGC,1,1,5,"a geat lazy song for sunday mornings, that can stretch out into entire days. time passes, but you can still get the last train home tonight... a must have for your record collection. One of AL Stewart's best"
,B00122TDGC,1,1,5,"I like this song far better now than I did when it was first released.  Who knows why.

The sound quality is amazingly good!

Timeless!"
,B00122T6L4,1,1,5,"What can I say.  Zevon at his most clever.  Good riff, funny/semi-serious lyrics.  Just a great fun pure rock track."
,B00122T6L4,1,1,5,I always like this song so I bought it . I have had very good luck with all my amazon songs they sound great.
,B00122T6L4,1,1,5,"I don't like censorship from ANY outside source, so when I discovered that I'd downloaded a censored version of this song on another website, I kicked myself, and came where I knew I'd find a reliable product.  I've never had a problem with an Amazon download, only my own spotty memory for not remembering to come here first!"
,B00122TDGC,1,1,4,I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.
,B00122TDGC,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00122TDGC,1,1,5,I love this Product! Arrived quickly. Will order again! Thx seller!
,B00122TDGC,1,1,5,"I will buy album for this song, too. I. plan to buy it soon.  A must for those who love Stewart's singing!"
,B00122TDGC,1,1,5,This song takes me back to my listening youth. He is great at taking people home to a better time then nowadays. Very happy with all the transaction.
,B00122TDGC,1,1,5,. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great
,B00122T86M,1,1,5,This song makes me cry even though my Dad has been dead for over twenty years.  I love it and still miss daddy's hands and help.
,B00122V306,1,1,5,What an awesome product.  I couldn't ask for a better product.  easy to enstall and endless configurations to play with.
,B00122V306,1,1,5,I love this song!  I love STP.....what a great song and a great band!  So glad I bought this! Yay!
,B00122V306,1,1,5,"It was odd that the previews for ""The Crow"" played this song and I fell in love with it but in the movie it is playing shortly in the car and that was it. Just one of those songs that I really like and I can remember what was going on in my life when I first heard it."
,B00122T86M,1,1,5,Great Song!
,B00122T86M,1,1,5,good
,B00122T86M,1,1,5,"Perhaps one of the very best and certainly one of the most melodious of all of Holly Dunn's songs - wonderful message & lyrics, as well...!!"
,B00122T86M,1,1,5,We purchased this to play at the funeral home during my Dad's viewing in honor of his love and support for all of us. A real tribute to an amazing and special man.
,B00122T86M,1,1,4,We used this for the funeral of a friend who died at 36.  I put the pictures of his kids with it.  It went very well.
,B00122T86M,1,1,5,"When you listen to the words of this song, it has so many special meanings.  Daddy's hands are always there for his children.  And Daddy is always working hard for his family."
,B00122V6F8,1,1,5,"Great song, great quality, perfect motivation and that extra push that you need at times for the gym or running trails!"
,B00122V6F8,1,1,5,THIS song ROCKS! Great working out song! Really gets you pumped up to work out hard! I totally recommend it!
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,This is great and timeless music that triggers some great memories. This is the sound from the past that still has appeal and invariably provokes an attempt to sing along.
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,"This song has special meaning for me.  I was out of town, twelve, and having so much fun! I will forever remember how happy I was, and how I loved this song.  :)))"
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,"The Doors really liked the country and western song, Ghost Riders In The Sky.  But instead of just covering it, they re-imagined it with dark smokey jazz and an LA feel.  Then add Jim Morrison's poetic lyrics and you have Riders On The Storm."
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,"THE Quintessential ""Doors"" song. Moody, melodic and dark without being too creepy. I have loved the ""Doors"" since I first saw them live in an audience of about a dozen at the Fort Worth Mardi Gras only a few days after the release of their first single ""Light My Fire"" and I still think this is my favorite ""Doors"" song."
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,"What can I say?  Some things last forever, as does my love of this song  Jim Morrison could have been so much more if only........"
,B00122UP64,-1,1,5,I was never a big Doors fan but I like this song.
,B00122UP64,1,1,4,"soulful, melodic and mysterious.  Jim Morrison left us too soon."
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,good
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,Good
,B00122UP64,1,1,4,Great. Sounds as I remember it.
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,LOVE this SONG
,B00122V6AS,1,1,5,The best song to listen to when you feel down.  This song is the reason I keep moving and don't pay attention to the haters.
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,Good
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,Just as I remember so many years ago!
,B00122UP64,-1,1,4,Yea
,B00122UP64,-1,1,5,as expected
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,"The Doors' style is perfectly suited to the  spooky & threatening atmosphere of this song without being too creepy. Obviously inspired by the song ""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky."
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,What can you say.  Classic
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,"Riders On The Storm is haunting and distinctively The Doors in every sense. It sends such an evocative message of times and ideas. The sound of the lyrics, the voice and the instruments has always been and continues to be so definitive to what defines The Doors. This also is one of my favorite songs."
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,Love it!
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,"I've always enjoyed listening to this song, but even more today!"
,B00122UP64,1,1,4,It's the only Doors song I like.
,B00122UP64,1,1,4,An underrated hit from The Doors about a criminal on the loose.
,B00122UP64,1,1,5,LOVE this music
,B00122V6AS,1,1,5,Uplifting song at any point in your life
,B00122V6AS,1,1,5,Terrific song!
,B00122V6AS,1,1,5,YOLANDA IS A Phenomenal singer. Love her music.
,B00122V6AS,-1,1,5,anointed
,B00122V6AS,1,1,5,Good music.
,B00122V6AS,1,1,5,"This is a wonderful song that truly ministers to your soul.  It will encourage and lift you up.
You will enjoy the music, but get spiritual  power from the words of the song."
,B00122V6AS,1,1,5,"When I'm feeling uptight I listen to this song to calm me down, I love her voice and style of preaching in her songs"
,B00122UIOI,1,1,5,"between this song and ""Love will find a way"", YES keeps proving that they are a strong force in the world of music. Sure, it's an older song, but it has more than stood the test of time. When someone asks what 80's song you wanna hear, what are ya gonna say?  YES!!"
,B00122UIOI,-1,1,5,#1 song
,B00122UIOI,1,1,5,love it
,B00122UIOI,1,1,4,good rock
,B00122UIOI,1,1,5,love it!!! will buy again!!!
,B00122UIOI,-1,1,5,"For us baby boomers, they just don't produce songs of this caliper. Get the whole album you won't regret it!!"
,B00122UIOI,1,1,5,"Of course, anything by Yes is excellent, but ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" was a chart topper. This is rock at its best."
,B00122UIOI,1,1,5,"Normally I don't buy music this shiny or polished, but I love this song every time I hear it, and being a Yes fan doesn't make you special."
,B00122ULG8,1,-1,2,"That this song downloads as a separate from 'The Load Out'. Your promoter don't mind, the union don't mind, the roadies don't mind. The verses are specific for this 'Stay' version and is part of 'The Load Out/Stay' compile. Its one song!"
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,This was a good song off of a really good album.  I'm glad I could get such a great price on it through Amazon and I like having it sync wirelessly to my Kindle Fire.
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!
,B00122WO5Y,1,1,5,Great classic album that I purchased in my younger years I get this album five stars. I listen to this album as much as I can to everybody out I find you to purchase this album Excellent choice
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,Just a good song!
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,This song never gets old - great song
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,Good catchy songs.
,B00122TCC2,1,1,5,Best Arctic Monkeys album ever.  Buy it!  Later albums don't live up to standard set here and got more experimental.
,B00122TCC2,1,1,4,"This very British band is just an amazing mix of driving beats, vocals filled with whatever emotion is required of them, and lyrics that take on a number of subjects that usually require a more mature voice to be this good. I think it will take a few years before these guys hit their stride, but this debut has enough diversity and quality to leave you very satisfied. They might end up being too ""English"" for American tastes, but for me they really nailed it. Starting out with high energy numbers like ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor"" and ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" set you up for a completely up tempo CD and then comes the quiet thoughtful reading of ""Riot Van,"" where the tune totally belies the lyrics. Either the humor is spot on, in titles like ""Perhaps Vampires is a bit Strong..."" which is definitely not the sentiment in the song; or wicked social commentary is clearly expressed on songs like ""When The Sun Goes Down.""  The band does a good job on both types. The only drawback is the music can occasionally get a bit repetitive with the same pounding guitars and drums for a few too many songs, but that's a minor complaint compared to what this band brings to the table; a fresh approach."
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,Great music and fast transaction.
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,A great song by a great artist!
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,One of my favorites
,B00122ULG8,1,1,5,My favorite song - So glad I found it on Amazon!!
,B00122ULG8,-1,-1,2,"Why were they so many late fifties early sixties covers during this period? And how come these lackluster cover versions charted so high? This cover of an early sixties tune reeks of ""I am so coked out that I can't think of anything original to record"" Syndrome- alot of artists suffered from this in the late seventies, with the advent of cocaine as the drug of choice. Coke hampers creativity, but , i guess a lot of these Laurel Canyon artists bought the hype peddled by Jann Wenner in his music rag, Rolling Stone, which by this time had become more mainstream. Jackson Browne has written some great songs (These Days comes to mind) but this Stay cover, with it's overtly ""white cracker"" Falsetto by some female singer, is a disgrace! This God-forsaken cover gets played more frequently than any of the better JB songs out there...blame it on the lame-arsed playlists on these ""classic rock"" format stations out there these days, boy do they suck huevos!"

up for a band I play in. So I really appreciate the ability to download indivigual

,B00122X3D6,1,1,5,Bought this because Amazon has the best prices. I did not want to purchase the entire disk just certain songs so this worked out for me.
,B00122X3D6,1,1,5,I like this band and this song is something I could listen to for nearly any occasion. Love this band.
,B00122X3D6,1,1,5,This group is amazing. Their songs are so harmful and worth downloading and just all together great music I never thought I like it but I'm obbosed with it

ONE -- 1.) Spoof of the George Lucas sci-fi epic opens with un-P.C. fey humor. 2.) Redneck couple can't get served, as she's ""in drag."" 3.) Multi-tracked bit at a Chinese restaurant. 4.) Mr. Redneck can't order a drink. 5.) Song where hamburgers are a sexual experience.

""SIDE"" TWO -- 1.) Milwaukee DJ Buzz Wired makes random phone calls, trying to give away some BAM (Bumming Around Money). 2.) The same dummy (""Bob Btchin"") from 5 years earlier bungles his way through the game and wins with a wrong answer. 3.) Headache sufferer visits a Chinese physician. 4.) Record company exec suffering from a headache is hounded by a pushy, overloud producer, who demos a punk single by Ronny Rump and the Rumptones. 5.)

,B00122WK08,1,1,5,This is the best Michel'le song ever
,B00122WK08,1,1,5,Beautiful singer!
,B00122WK08,1,1,5,WHEN SHE SINGS THIS SONG SOMETHING IN MY HEART FEELS GOOD.
,B00122WK08,1,1,5,CLASSIC SONG....!!!

,B00122WK08,1,1,4,I like this song.
,B00122WK08,1,1,5,"I absolutely love this song. The songs from this era were so heartfelt and hit home. So happy that they are so easy to find today. Thanks, Amazon! Another winner."
,B00122WK08,1,1,5,When I first heard Michel'le sing this song I thought it was so beautiful and it still is. Her singing voice is amazing especially since she has such a childlike speaking voice (what's up with that?)
,B00122X3D6,1,1,5,love
,B00122X3D6,1,1,4,"It is honestly and absolutely so sad when someone young and talented throws their life away from all the vices in the world they can never get over. Unfortunately one of those 90's souls, Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver died early at the age of 48. He has had so many great songs on his own, as a part of Velvet Revolver with Slash of Guns N' Roses, but especially when he was with S.T.P. The songs he had back in the 90's were the catalyst of his life. Sadly though, he died of those drug and alcohol problems, and his time in prison. Interstate Love Song, one his biggest songs from the S.T.P. album Purple is one of those songs that really brought out the best in his voice, and his spirit. He definitely drove from top to bottom in the song. It was really his best song, and the groups' biggest hit. I think of when he was gifted with a brilliant and gritty voice. But to see Scott die early, just like Lane Staley of Alice IN Chains and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was no surprise. Hopefully, he has peace on the other side.

Scott Weiland 1967-2015

,B00122X3D6,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs of all time.
,B00122X3D6,1,1,5,This song was one of my favorites in the 90's. I would see that crazy video on MTV and couldn't help but to sing along. Perfect vocals and guitar playing. And those drums....man! There was something about that Interstate Love Song melody that always put me in a good mood.
,B00122V0L8,1,1,5,Good song!

,B00122V0L8,1,1,4,"I saw Uncle Kracker perform this song as part of a Kenny Chesney concert.  I heard it before and liked it, but after that concert I knew I had to have it.  It is great."
,B00122V0L8,1,1,4,"Awesome FUN song that was a GREAT addition to my island vacation mix! Great sound, easy listening and just a lot of fun!!!"
,B00122WLIE,1,1,5,Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!
,B00122WLIE,1,1,5,This one reminds me of the year we drove down to Florida for a family vacation.  We had stopped at the KOA for a night of bonfire fun and sleep.  As we were heading to Disney the next morning ... the sun beautifully rising in the east... this song played on the radio.  What a memory!
,B00122WLIE,1,-1,3,good quality

,B00122WLIE,1,1,4,"Nice original done by Browne, but was it live or an actual album varied original? Maybe if I can hear it more often I'll find out. But anyway it's a great song for my iTunes Library!"
,B00122WLIE,1,1,5,"Today's so called ""musicians"" are not even remotely as talented as Jackson Browne. Thank god his music and hundreds of other musicians of his era is still available. Otherwise I wouldn't have anything to listen to.

Just like Boulevard! A great song by an actually talented musician."
,B00122WLIE,1,-1,3,"This is a good listening song and I listen to it often.  I am a Forrest Gump fan and when watch the movie,  it reminds me of just how  life affects us all."
,B00122WLIE,1,1,5,Loved this song for many years trying to get as many of the old LP's so many no longer arround
,B00122WLIE,1,1,4,"Jackson Browne's unique voice and his complex lyric style and intelligent, soulful arrangement make this song one that I never seem to tire of. When he hits it right, he really hits it right."
,B00122WLIE,1,1,5,"If you heard this song once you Had to listen 99 more times . Upbeat is the mildest way to describe this song , and it holds up still in 2014 . If you need a pick-me-up  EVER , just crank up your device and THIS  SONG  will take you UP , UP ,UP ."
,B00122WLIE,1,1,5,"What more can be said about a song that you took the time to look for a then purchase. Obviously, you wanted it."
,B00122WLIE,1,-1,3,Ordered for my husband as one of his favorites.  I personally can take it or leave it.  Just mediocre for my taste.
,B00122WLIE,1,1,5,Another one of my favorites from Jackson Browne. Really like this type of music that comes from my generation. Thumbs up.
,B00122WLIE,1,1,5,This was a good song off of a really good album.  I'm glad I could get such a great price on it through Amazon and I like having it sync wirelessly to my Kindle Fire.
,B00122YSJ4,1,1,4,"I was working on a CD to put in my car(s) for when I had to take road trips that had music from ""my time"".  I bought this to add to the CD and found it to be a good quality track."
,B00122YSJ4,-1,1,5,"More music I had and either lost it, or had it stolen from me. I had much of it already to MP3, but not this song."
,B00122YSJ4,1,1,5,"I love the doors.  I love the depressive sound that the doors produce.  Puts me right back in the 60s.  Easy download, mooth transaction."
,B00122YM8Q,1,1,5,Great Song!

,B00122YMSG,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs and I recently got an iPhone for Christmas and I am adding all my songs to it and I found this one which I had forgotten about. The song ask What's Luv? It is about us and trust.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"I heard this song for the first time at a volunteer camp for the american cancer society.

It is a great song that gets kids and adults out on the dance floor.

,B00122Z6ZY,-1,1,5,"Great song! STP came and went, but they left some really nice tracks behind. I'm going to leave this review for all the STP I downloaded because I am lazy."

,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Great for a cardio workshop and body exercise. I bought the cd also.

This one file had the best production quality, so I highly recommend this one over the others."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,A good song to have in your collect especially during a BBQ or a home get together. Very popular and fun song.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,This is not a personal favorite of mine but I need to teach a beginner's line dancing class and this particular song gives directions so it makes it easy for the dancers to follow.

,B00122X5VG,1,-1,2,"This is one of those ""let's all get up and dance, because he's telling us what to do"" type songs like The Electric Slide or Cotton-Eyed Joe. It's annoying and stupid but everyone wants to get up and dance to it. It's a gateway song. So I have to appreciate it for that, but otherwise it's absolutely terrible."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Awesome song!!

,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,Fun song!
,B00122YZO2,1,-1,3,"Though I'm sure they're mostly thought of as a one-hit-wonder, man what a hit. ""In The Meantime"" has got to be one of the coolest songs of the mid-90's. After that the songs aren't as good, but still similar, and mostly interesting. Actually I think ""Cruel To Be Kind"" was a minor hit as well. Their sound is definitely retro-glam, like a ""David Bowie"" or ""Elton John"" influenced 90's alt-rock band. By now this disc is probably in every used store across the country, and well worth the price you could get it for. After a few listens, you'll realize ""Space Is The Place""."
,B00122Z5A0,-1,-1,3,"I was glad to find this song, but didn't realize I had the explicit version, but that is ok.  The problem is that there is a clicking noise every few seconds while it is playing."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,"Music, a great part of my life. I love it and live in it."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,GREAT

,B00122X5VG,-1,1,5,just as I had ordered
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,awesome
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Excellent song.  Kids love it! No profanity or disrespectful words.  This line dance song is for every age and every ocassion. Great investment.  I do the dance for exercise.
,B00122Z69A,1,1,5,Puts a little different spin on a well known 80's hit song by phil colins. yup yup yup yup yup
,B00122Z69A,1,1,5,"Love the nonpoint version... different, but not too different from the original... why change something that kicks but in the first place!"
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Music where young and old alike can dance together and have fun doing it.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,good song
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"Even my Mom who qualifies for Social Security loves this song, and even while driving I find my shoulder moving with song!"

,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,fast & easy thanks
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Very pleased with this.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Cute song
,B00122Z1F4,1,1,5,This song has a powerful message.  We all know that Yolanda has been blessed with a multi-talented voice that brings out the best in people. I definitely like the beat.
,B00122Z1F4,1,1,5,"I heard it, and just had to have it. Yolanda Adams is one of the best gospel singers of this generation, and I have three of her albums. This song, victory is at the top of my favorites. You've got to get this one."
,B00122Z5A0,1,1,5,I ordered this song because I really love it.
,B00122Z5A0,1,1,5,love it!!! works wonderfully.
,B00122Z5A0,1,1,5,"I just went to my first Uncle Kracker concert in Jackson, Ca. I loved this song from the first time I heard it. Didn't know any other music of his til I went to his concert. Then I recognized several. I will be buying more of his music."
,B00122Z69A,1,1,5,"Grungy and hardcore, awesome!"
,B00122Z69A,-1,1,4,As described
,B00122Z69A,1,1,5,I really like the remake they did with this song.
,B00122Z69A,1,1,5,"Not normally a person who like remakes or re-recordings of classic songs. This song is an exception. Great vocals, many layers of electronic instruments...it's just about perfection."
,B00122Z69A,1,1,4,Not a bad remake
,B00122Z69A,1,1,5,A lot of their music is great! And this song does the exact same....great workout song! Listen to it everytime!
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Nice..

,B00122X5VG,-1,1,5,a
,B00122Z74O,1,1,5,"I remember hearing this song as a teenager. I enjoyed the song and still do now.  It has an electrifying blend of high energy lyrics and strong guitar notes.  I read online that there was a controversy on exactly what the song is about.  There are a variant of controversial statements posted online on what he might have meant by this song.  I personally think that the lead singer actually had the best intentions in mind when recording this very compelling song.  It appears to be about sex, but when you listen to it there can be several meanings depending on how one was raised. I personally think that he was only trying to send an informative message on how the desire for power shapes a persons behavior.  Regardless, this is actually a good song and one that is still interesting to listen to even after all the years that passed since it has been released (1992(."
,B00122Z5A0,1,1,5,"Single released in 2001 from the Double Wide album, went on to #1 on Austalian ARIS chart, reached #5 on US Billboard Hot 100, and #3 on UK Singles Chart.  It also reached #1 on US Billboard Adult Pop Songs, and is his highest charting song to date."
,B00122Z5A0,1,1,5,"I just love this song soooo much. It is a fun upbeat song. I imagine myself dancing through the whole song singing to the one I love. Moving to the words and beat ofthe song.  I think that all couples should listen to this song, while  dancing close to each other singing the words together. This song is for all ages."
,B00122Z5A0,-1,-1,1,"When Uncle Kracker decided to go solo after a long association with rap/rocker, Kid Rock, you would have expected some of the same edginess that characterized Rock's music.  Instead, ""Follow Me"" resulted.  This is a piece of soft-rock swill that belongs as a track on one of those laughable ""AM Gold"" albums that used to be sold in informercials late at night, instead of on the top of the pop/rock charts.

However, this sappy love song no doubt appealed to fans who are suckers for this type of music.  In addition, I think there was another group of fans who were wary of another Kid Rock-style singer and embraced Uncle Kracker when they realized exactly how soft his music was.

Really not a fan of this song and I change the radio whenever it comes on."
,B00122Z5A0,1,1,5,i really like this song and i ordered it because i liked it other wise i would not have ordered it
,B00122Z5A0,1,1,5,"This song is ""The Song"" for my husband and I.It was our special song when we were dating :)I am so glad to have it on my Kindle."
,B00122Z5A0,1,1,5,"I'll be honest; I don't remember purchasing this song.  But it's cool, because I've always liked it.  Always sing along with it, and love the underunning theme of infidelity."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,I like dancing and I like music without F bombs every other word. Works for me.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"Yes, I do the cupid shuffle in my kitchen, at parties, the van, and anywhere this song comes on! I'm a 48 year old wife, hospital nurse, mom & grandma in the 'burbs, and this song just does it for me.  Along with ""Wobble"", this song just wants you to get your butt up and movin'.  YES, I have this on REPEAT for my gym/workout playback, it has a good medium beat to jump around to.  And of course, the cupid shuffle!  I love to embarrass my kids when I take a Cupid Shuffle dance break while mopping the floors or cooking dinner ;-)  Too funny!  So glad a young friend of mine turned me onto this song and the dance.  She created a monster (according to my kids).

ALWAYS a hit at our Wine nights with the girls when we are all getting a little relaxed, we start a line dance!  Super fun!"
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,GREAT cleaning song even with the kids.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,Get your boogie on!

,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"Thanks Cupid for the song that has a great dance to go with it!
I use this to exercise too. I put it on repeat & hey...it's better than Zumba!
Great for raising your heart rate, yet not so hard to do b/c of trying to remember
A lot of difficult steps!
Only been at it for a short while, but I've already lost several pounds!
I combine it with Pharrell Williams' ""Happy"", & I'm good to go & having fun doing it!
I'm thinking of adding a few more dance line or stepping songs like R. Kelly's
""Happy People"", & heck, I might have my own exercise video!
(HEY...THINK OF YOUR OWN IDEA! DON'T STEAL MINE A'ITE!)"
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"This is a very catchy song. After listening to it, expect to doing a little dance and mentally singing ""to the right, to the right, to the right, to the right, to the left, to the left, to the left, to the left, now kick, now kick, now kick, now kick, now walk it by yourself"" all day.

This is such a fun song to dance to also! Gotta love these songs that tell you certain moves that you can do along with it."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"This song is the ringtone when my daughter calls. No matter where I am when she calls, this song starts playing and people near me start bopping along. Makes for fun shopping trips."

,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Love the way the style of the song instructs you to get to the groove and dance.even if you don't want to get into the group.you just have to.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"This is a great song for parties, camp, family reunions or when you want a song to dance to and have a good time.  This song is kid friendly and will have everybody on their feet. I exercise to this song and work up a sweat every day. The song is very catchy and will have you singing along. To the left, to left, to the right, to the right, just love this song."

,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,on the playlist we submitted to the DJ for our wedding reception. It was an easy and great purchase with a good price
,B00122X5VG,-1,-1,1,"Not at all my type of music, so take my review from that Perspective. I do the occasional DJ party , and needed ( tripe like this to suit the younger crowd. Normally I wouldnt DARE, waste my money on this Juvenile, Pop, Garbage. But There MANY out there that Like it."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,This is a great song and I think this song is great song to dance to.my sister also loves it.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"When the  Cupid Shuffle came out I decided to show my friends that I could line dance from my wheel chair. If you can count you can follow. The only problem was the order to kick,woa no problem for me! Instead of kicks, I pumped my arms and I could work it by myself!!!"
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Many can relate when I say this song was possibly on repeat a few years back. There have been numerous versions but the original is always the best. Very entertaining.
,B00122X5VG,-1,-1,1,"Because it is important to help companys know that there product is good,and that the people than will enjoy it and buy it."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Great Song and uploaded nicely.  Learning the dance to it for school.  Awesome It is a fun dance and a great workout song actually.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"If you're going to play a line dance song at a party, Cupid Shuffle and Cha Cha Slide are the most popular."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,Fast up-beat song that you can dance to.  Downloaded because my kids heard it at chuck-e cheese and wanted to dance to the chorus.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"i love the song!! so sorry about not giving a long description about the song but I believe if you are going to purchase a song either you will know the song already or you will listen to it previously to purchasing it! but amazon requires a certain amount of words to describe the product in order for it to come off your ""review purchases"""
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"Already liked the song and love how easy Amazon made it to purchase the song, download it to my computer and with ease it was in my iTunes and on my iPod."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"I was immediately in love with this song when it came out! It's catchy, upbeat dance is so much fun! And once I saw that very popular YouTube video of the older grandmother doing The Cupid Shuffle, I was hooked!! I was older at the time myself (late 40's), and using a huge platform walker to stand with due to a spinal cord injury, but I thought, ""If she can do it, I can do it!"" So I would stand with my platform walker and do my own version of The Cupid Shuffle, much to my husband and children's delight! Lol  I'm needing to use a wheelchair most of the time now, but that's not stopping me from teaching my two year old granddaughter The Cupid Shuffle!! It's become Our Special Dance, and we'll sometimes do it for hours. Such tremendous fun!!  <3"
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,This was a great addition for our party and dance music. Fun to listen to and great to dance to.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,This song is used in my water aerobics class.  The song has a good beat for a warm up or a casual song during the class.  We have fun with this song.  It tells you the simple steps to do and it creates a different movement in class.
,B00122Z76M,1,1,5,Has to be one of my favorite songs of all time. STP knocked it out of the park with this single.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,If you just do the dance all the way through the song you will get such a thigh and butt workout! Great track! Way to make me move!
,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,Danced to this song during zumba classes in my area. Great song to dance to because it is so energetic.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,This song is very popular in my house.  Our 2 yr old and 5 yr old love dancing the cupid shuffle with this song.  I got the song from Amazon.com and it's now on my cell.  I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  The quality is awesome!  Good purchase.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,We used this at my daughter's wedding (her theme was kissed by a dragon)...it was awesome and the wedding was a hit!
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Another one in the long line of line music.  Added to the others to create a non stop dance party
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"great dance tune! if your ready to move your whole body, and exercise, this is the song for you! Get it!"
,B00122X5VG,1,-1,3,"I like this song, it is worth buying and spending the money on.  Instrumentals and the vocals are great.  Good lyrics."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Just the song I was looking for. I don't know what else they expect you to write.. its a music download.
,B00122X5VG,1,-1,3,Ballroom studios in NJ play this so I bought it to use with students when necessary.  They even did it at my nieces sweet 16 though it was a tad more energetic than I was used to.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,I use this song in my class that i teach at the ymca and they all seam to love it.
,B00122Z4Y2,1,1,5,"The Mystic Knights of The Oingo Boingo have come a long was since presiding in the Devil's Chamber in that truly cult classic, THE FORBIDDEN ZONE, directed by Richard Elfman {sibling elf}, a highly entertaining venture into the vortex of utter madness. Since their innovative neo-punk beginnings, Danny Elfman has led the Knights onto many musical victories, including his own solo projects, & finally, movie scores. Such titles as BATMAN RETURNS, BEETLEJUICE, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE XMAS, NIGHTBREED & EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, are among his celebrated compositions.
The name has been put through the guillotine, severed in half to display a highly crystallized evolution. A focus on heavier rhythm guitars have been added, giving the album a sharper edge. The cover displays an interesting little clown, deformed in his composit. The back shows some aesthetic terrorism as well.
Now, this erubescent, modern-day Wolfgang brings forth a series of songs which speak from his satanic heart, of anti-assimilation in the jesting guise of conformity. Particularly noticable in the cantible ""Insatanity"". where the voices of little ones valiantly defy xian indoctrination by recognizing its unnaturalness. Also exposed is the hypocrisy of evangelists in their two-faced, money-grubbing, sexually-twisted forms.
Another favorite is ""Mary"", which is the common story of a blossoming midwestern girl breaking the apron strings to see the great-wide-world. The rub here, is that she enjoys what she feels, & for the first time, comes unto her own realizations & conclusionsnow thyat her overbearing xian family is out of the picture. It is quite an emotionally-evoking piece, especially when the syubbornness of her unfortunately xoid kin is displayed., in their unacceptance of her, when she finally finds something she really enjoys. Indulging in the pleasures of the flesh, & living a decadently hedonistic lifestyle which brings her satisfaction, & a sense of accomplishment. She was a bigger fish than they - she had ambition. I don't think it was too much of a blasphemous coincidence that the name hosen was ""Mary"", as in ""virgin"". By the way, the violins are sublime.
There's also a remake of the Beatles' ""I Am The Walrus"", a fun song that has been played at many a frat party, no doubt. SPIDER is an enjoyable diddy about he who glares from the wall. WAR AGAIN is an inspirational tune about war & the adrenalyn & tragedy of battle. It inspires pride. It is powerful in its emotional evocation, as the words are definitely felt, greatly compliments the music.
Overall, this release is an experience, which is rare in the pop-""music"" industry, with their trivial, monotonous, monosyllabic, non-music blare. Like Elman's other works, all which make an impression upon the listener, this is sure to please the discriminating, amalgamate, audial conniseur."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,I love downloading songs from Amazon mp3 because Amazon always has a great selection with great quality! Thanks for everything Amazon!
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"We needed some fun music for a ""girls"" night party.  I had some but added this to keep things alive!"
,B00122X5VG,1,1,4,This is a cute little song that has a fun beat and I enjoy it as an add to my workout playlist.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,Bought to make a wedding CD for my daugher's wedding last year  we were not disappointed in any of the music we bought.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"These songs get me through my work day and whenever I am working out.  My son like them, too; he's 9"
,B00122Z6UE,1,1,5,"love the band ... can't beat $.99 download ...do a lot of downloading ... already a repeat customer.  Thanks, bye"
,B00122Z6UE,1,1,4,"I have so many songs from this album but, never purchased this one.
I'm glad I did.
The music is classic and the the band is great and I don't find myself getting tired of it.
I guess that's quality for ya!"
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,So I play karaoke here and there and this is one of the must-have line dance songs which is why I had to get it.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,"What a workout great sound, song and on the floor when it is played. Great song LOVE it for real."
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,My kids love this song. No wedding dance is complete without it. It ends being a very song long but really fun and the moves are really easy to learn.
,B00122X5VG,1,1,5,I really love to dance to this song. The quality of it is very good and when I go out and hear it we all start to dance.
,B0012300HC,1,1,4,The sexiest drummer of all-time and the lovliest.  This tune lit up the airwaves and to this date is her best.
,B0012300HC,1,1,4,"4 Stars
Has excellent prices, good quality and great shipping making this a 4 star encounter. I will be a repeat customer for sure."
,B0012300HC,1,1,5,DOWNLOADED THIS SONG AND SOUNDED EXCELLENT. NICE NICE NICE NICE NICE NICE NICE I will donwnload again in the future.
,B0012300HC,1,1,4,Prince protoge rocks hard on this jam as she invokes sex appeal and feminine power.  If you are in the mood for a sexy song to bring you back to the eighties than this is it right here.
,B0012300HC,1,1,5,"LOVE SHEILA E!  And love this song!  Being a retired Percussionist, I so admire her style of drumming which is pretty much freelance, per Sheila from one of her clinics I attended.  But as for this song, ""The Glamorous Life"" -  This song is so awesome, great lyrics, great tune overall AND it's Sheila E singing it!  WHAT, I ask you, is not to love?!"
,B0012300HC,1,1,5,Sheila I still love. Nothing can take the place of  you.
,B0012300HC,1,1,5,I still love this song! Sheila E. made me think that I wanted to play the drums in a sequin dress as a little girl! Lol!
,B0012300HC,1,1,5,Classic jam!
,B0012300HC,1,1,5,"In addition to being one of the world's premier female percussionists, I think Sheila E will always be remembered for this song."
,B0012300HC,1,1,4,"Reasonable price for adding an oldie but a goodie to your MP3 collection.  Go ahead, sing along with the MP3 player."
,B0012300HC,1,1,5,"I was in Junior High when this song came out, and have loved it ever since. Sheila E is like the female version of Prince, same type of music. In fact I think she did some background vocals on a couple of Prince songs, her music is hot. The reason why I like this song is because the lyrics say it all, and the band ROX. It has that beat that will stay in your head for the rest of the day once you hear it. Another great tune from the 80's that still plays on radio stations today."
,B00122YN12,1,1,5,Brings back old memories.  Love the 90s.  I watched R&B divas LA.  Michel'le sounds great (never lost her sound or voice).
,B00122Z4IS,1,1,4,Love the movie and hearing this song plays the movie in my head. No need for dvd just play this song and flash here comes the movie in your head.
,B001230PFE,1,1,4,One of the few good songs by matchbox 20
,B001230PFE,1,1,5,Love this!
,B001230PFE,1,1,4,"this is a good song, although not the one I was looking for. I have liked many of Matchbox Twenty's song since I first heard them on the radio in the early 2000's. Now there is nothing on the radio to listen to but we can download some of our favs."
,B001230PFE,1,1,5,"I love 3AM, it might be a little older of a release but still keeps you rocking and thinking back when it came out."
,B001230PFE,1,1,5,I purchased this for my kindle - I'm a mad fan of Matchbox Twenty and this just puts a favorite song at my fingertips!
,B00122UPAU,1,1,5,"In this song the poetry aspect is very clear.  And as with most Doors songs, this one can be a little disturbing but uplifting at the same time.  It's an essential American classic."
,B00122UPAU,1,1,5,Allways liked the doors from the first time on the radio to ed sulluvan to doctor office or elevator music a melody of a doors song
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,"This song is bittersweet, as it reminds me of the last days of my father's life, he had started listening to a different radio station a few months before he died. And one of the favorite songs they would play was this one, and on the last day that he was healthy (right before his stroke) this song was playing as I woke up,  so there will always be a link between this song and that day for me. The show was great, ahead of its time in some ways. and the theme song was excellent, glad to hear it was a hit. Also glad to download it again. Great song. (P.S. my dad loved the show and would watch it with me and my brothers and sisters every time it was on)"
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,"I absoltuely LOVE this feel-good, positive and up-beat song. So well sung, it gives me a lift every time I listen to it. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,This song goes along with the best TV series. I watched the show every time it was on.
,B00122YIDK,1,1,4,"One hit wonder I guess, but a catchy tune and an entertaining TV theme for a show about a guy who inherits a ""super suit"" without an owners manual - story of my life!  Still, Joey Scarbury does a great job and if you sample it, you'll end up humming it!"
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,Songs from the past.  I am so glad I could find this and only have to buy just the song I want.
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,one of my favorites from the 60's and 70's
,B00122YIDK,1,1,4,It brings back memories of my youth!
,B00122YIDK,1,1,4,good tune
,B00122YMZ4,1,1,5,LOVE IT
,B00122YMZ4,1,1,4,"This song was a fairly big hit for Stevie Nicks. I saw earlier this year that she was given an award. She was also one of the ""DWTS"" episodes and performed her latest song."
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,"I am not rating this on the song itself because if I didn't want this song I wouldn't buy it.  The rating is on the rewording download and playback.  MP3 has good sound, no pops or skips."
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,"One of the most unappreciated TV shows on the air, but the music was fantastic. Especially this song. It showed that it doesn't take a big, buff man to be a super hero. Just a man."
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,"I love, love this song it is so up lifting! On a bad day just hearing lifts me up to the sky!"
,B00122YIDK,1,1,5,"This is the song for my son, a Sgt in the Army National Guard. He truly is a hero to me"
,B001230PJ0,1,1,5,"Rob Thomas has a special way of not just writing great music, he also FEELS the emotions and that let's his followers laugh or cry."
,B001230PJ0,1,1,5,"It's hard for me to believe how old this song is (for that matter, how old I am is a bit of a shock too) but I do still love this song."
,B00122V42I,-1,1,5,I resisted this album for a long time. I thought it was just another Coltrane that I could get on a best of album. Wrong! oh so wrong. This album got some good reviews and then there are others who don't get very excited about it. I let those reviews influence me into missing this gem for a long time. Don't do as I did.. add it to yours.
,B001230AH2,1,1,5,The jazz inspired drumming is fantastic. As are the keyboards & guitar.
,B001230AH2,1,1,5,This is seven minutes of mind blowing music unmatched.
,B001230AH2,1,1,4,"overall, a good song-one of the Doors best. .More appealing for those who like a special dying breed of music(60s psych mvmt)"
,B001230AH2,1,1,5,"I recently moved all of my music from ITunes to Amazon and I'm glad that I did.  I downloaded the Amazon mp3 player to my phone, which connects to Bluetooth and plays in my car as soon as my phone connects to my car!!! sweet!!! ... the best thing that I have found is the price for mp3s on Amazon seems to be cheaper than ITunes.  Always a plus!"
,B001230AH2,1,1,5,"This song captures the once and mythical atmosphere of Los Angeles as perfectly as the very best black and white ""Film Noir"" private detective movies from the 1940's and 50's.  Again, the Doors have created an essential American classic."
,B00122WPHG,-1,1,5,"I believe this was written by Doors guitarist, Robby Krieger, about his eclectic and often fickle girlfriend.  And almost every guy has had this experience of loving an erratic women and knowing he can never tame nor keep her."
,B00122WPHG,1,1,5,I loved to listen to it while driving down the road in my muscle cars in the 60 and 70's.
,B00122WPHG,1,1,5,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Her-Madly/dp/B00122WPHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Her Madly</a>&nbsp;The late, great Jim Morrison. One of the best artists I've had the pleasure to listen to.
Simple yet deep lyrical confections that make you want to sing and dance. And listen to again and again."
,B0012323YA,1,1,5,"An obscure classic, a one-hit wonder that deserves way more credit as they have for the most part been swallowed into the oblivion of music's lexicon...But not for me, or you since you're reading this. If you like these guys, give Spock's Beard a try...a band that never had any airplay but is freakin amazing. You're welcome =)"
,B0012323YA,-1,1,4,"All I really wanted to do was rate it 4 stars, but i'm required to type something in order for me to rate the song."
,B0012323YA,1,1,5,"When this song was released in the late 90s it was like a breath of fresh air for me.  In one sense, it was a typical rock song from that era but this song incorporated a melodic intro (I believe it is a heavily processed guitar arpeggio), an odd base line, and the unique vocals from the lead singer of the group that just jumped out.  Great song that brings back great memories."
,B0012323YA,1,1,5,"Music is subjective, I love this song, others might not.  I just put this in here since I can't rate it without a review."
,B0012323YA,1,-1,3,Not a complicated song.  Great song that flows well and could fit in any social situation.  The singer has a very distinct style and I would make sure to listen to the samples before downloading multiple songs.
,B0012328SQ,1,1,5,The Load Out and Stay are catchy tunes that are meant to be played together.  This album has a lot of Jackson Browne's biggest songs.
,B0012328SQ,1,1,5,Great music and fast transaction
,B0012328SQ,1,1,5,My favorite song - So glad I found it on Amazon!!
,B0012328SQ,-1,-1,2,"My bad I guess but when I ordered this song from Amazon either I didn't read the info correctly or mistook it as the live version that Jackson Browne did with ""Stay"" as part of the medley. So, if  you're looking for that live cut this ain't it. Otherwise the song is part of one of Browne's best albums."
,B0012328SQ,-1,-1,3,"Whomever cut this song up for downloads never even listened to this song. Or missed the fact that it is compiled with the following song ""Stay"". Neither are supposed to be played without the other."
,B0012328SQ,1,1,5,Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!
,B0012328SQ,-1,-1,2,"At the End when he sings well be scheduled to appear 1000 miles away from here, the song stops.
But other than that it's ok, Amazon Gave me my money back."
,B0012328SQ,1,1,5,"Just a great song. If you haven't heard it, you need to. Again belongs on your Ipod. On Continuos replay...mood music for me"
,B0012328SQ,-1,1,4,"If you want to hear the Load Out in its entirety also with the song ""Stay"" you need to buy both MP3 Downloads or the Load Out will abrubtly just end.  If you buy both they completely mesh together when you plan them back to back.  NO DELAY at all, and it sounds just like the OLD LP Version from years back.  So my opinion is to merely buy both songs if you want to be happy."
,B001232CNW,1,1,4,Every time I hear anything from the Average White Band it takes back to a beautiful moment in my life. I miss this group because they were great.
,B001232CNW,1,1,5,"AWB is one of the best self contained bands in the history of modern music. Their vocals and instrumentation are superb and unsurpassed. They can share a stage with anybody in the music industry. This song is a classic. The vocals are so soulful and
smooth you just can't help but love this song  and its melody. Once you have heard and danced to AWB's music you will be hooked. I have traveled the world and heard them play everywhere from Okinawa to Montreal to the Bay area. Will do it again!"
,B001232CNW,-1,1,5,Average White Band was and is music to Iisten to.  1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to.
,B001232CNW,1,1,5,Love finding classic songs that take me back to my childhood and remind me of family car trips and vacations.
,B001232CNW,1,1,4,I like this song from my past. I like the smart aleck Average White Band impudence in their name. Good.

,B0012309WS,1,1,5,"What ore can anyone say about this classic. Every time I hear it its like I'm hearing it for the first time. I always hear something I hadn't heard before. One day I'm going to test this and play it on an endless loop until it becomes stale, if in fact it ever could."

,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"Jahiem made an amazing comeback with his fourth album after a label switch.  Jahiem has never sounded better vocally then he did on the lead apologetic single ""Never"". With his last album, Jah over did the soul sampling, but here it works.  Listening to Lonely reminded me of If You Think You're Lonely Now, while I've Changed reminded me of the classic Atlantic Starr duets. The highlight of the album for me though is the R.Kelly written Hush.  Jaheim continues to make good music and here's hoping he's here to stay."
,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"It's what you expect from Jaheim, good beats, and good rhymes! I had already heard most of the songs before I bought it, and I knew what to expect."
,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"Excellent cd, just as good as his first cd with the single just in case. Great voice and good lyrics. Voice as good as Teddy Pendergrass. Good cd to give as a gift or keep for yourself.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Makings-of-a-Man/dp/B000XUOLO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Makings of a Man</a>"
,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"I own most of Jaheim's music and this man never releases a bad album.  When he records an LP, he obviously brings his A-game because one can hear it in his voice: He is focused when he sings and he means every word he belts out.  He is one of the best male artists of today, easily.  Why?  Foremost, because he has a beautiful tenor singing voice and knows just how to use it.  He does not over-sing and he stays on key so well!  ""The Makings of A Man"" is one of the best albums of 2007 because it is consistent and there are some great tunes on this album.  Most of the songs are mid-tempo and about women and relationships.  Also, there are twelve songs so the album is not too short and not lengthy either.

 Jaheim will find some way to tell you that he is a reformed thug on each and every album.  I know he is serious, but it's a little funny that he feels the need to continually remind us.  This time, his thug story is found on ""Life of A Thug.""  He exposes some of the malicious things he did during that juncture in his life, and if you listen closely, he was a pretty bad guy.  This song is nicely produced; I particularly like the horns.  Also, the hook gives it replay value.  ""She Ain't You"" and ""Voice of R&B"" are great tracks.  Vocally, he does a splendid job.  The lyrics are meaningful, especially to Jaheim fanatics.  He informs his listeners that he is very important to the genre of music called R&B, and he is.  Keyshia Cole is my boo and she did well on ""I've Changed"", but that is one of the weakest songs on the album.  The song is average at best.  The hook isn't too good and neither are the lyrics or the production.  Jaheim has included quite a few songs about his mother on his albums.  Here, we have a song called ""Back Together Again.""  This heartfelt number has an emotional Jaheim singing about how his parents are united in heaven.  It's a lovely moment on the album.

 I hope I have convinced you to pick this album up, download it from iTunes, do SOMETHING!  I enjoyed it all the way through.  Be advised, this is a laid back album.  There aren't any dance tracks, just ballads and mid-tempos, but truly worth your time.  4 shining stars.

Mikeisha's Top 5

1. ""Just Don't Have a Clue""

,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"Jaheim came out on the scene pretty strong, selling double platinum with his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghetto-Love/dp/B00005899K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghetto Love</a>&nbsp;and then platinum with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Still-Ghetto/dp/B00006WKYJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Still Ghetto</a>. And when his last album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghetto-Classics/dp/B000BJ7CCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghetto Classics</a>&nbsp;only managed to go gold, things looked a little troublesome. This is especially True since Ghetto Classics was just as good as its predecessors, but Jaheim didn't get the push he deserved from his label and failed to chalk up the numbers he used to get in his prime. Now with Atlantic Records as his new label home, Jaheim hopes to re-up and capture the attention of his original fan base and millions more with his new album The Makings Of A Man. He keeps the formula the same for the most part, resorting to mid-tempo grooves and slow cuts for the majority of the album. After professing his worth with the intro track ""Voice of R&B."" Jaheim lays it down with ""Hush,"" a song about keeping an affair with a homie's girl on the low. ""Have You Ever"" rides out with strong background vocals, simple piano work, and lyrics about speculating on what could have been and rethinking what has already been done. ""Lonely"" is a reworking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bobby-Womack/dp/B00004SATU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bobby Womack</a>'s ""If You Think You're Lonely Now,"" using the infamous hook for the song but changing the lyrics to reflect Jaheim's own tale of scooping up the next girl and her man is the one sitting at home all alone! ""Life of a Thug"" is a depiction of Jaheim's life in the form of an autobiographical song, describing all the trials and tribulations that he's faced over the years and his ultimate redemption from those trying times. He questions why a lover doesn't realize a good man when he's right in your face on the song ""Just Don't Have A Clue."" For the track ""She Ain't You,"" Jaheim borrows the melody and background from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Delphonics/dp/B000EMGJTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Delphonics</a>' classic ""La La Means I Love You"" for another reworking where he talks about his former girl still having his heart and wishing he could still be with her instead of anyone he's been with since losing her. Jaheim hangs up his player status for the love of his life on the album's lead-off single ""Never."" ""I've Changed"" features the dynamic rawness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keyshia-Cole/dp/B000VDDCHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keyshia Cole</a>&nbsp;alongside his ghetto bravado, but the ridiculously child-like delivery of the chorus ultimately kills the song. Jaheim gets real on ""What You Think Of That"" where he describes realizing the True essence of a woman who was disrespected and unappreciated by a fool who didn't know what he had. ""Make A Wish"" is a smooth yet simple song about giving his girl whatever she wants and dreams of having, something every woman wishes were True! The album closes with the tender cut ""Back Together Again,"" a tribute to his parents who are now reunited in Heaven. Jaheim took his time with Makings Of A Man, and it truly shows in practically every track. If this doesn't convince the masses that he is the real thing, then this will certainly prove that people don't know True R&B talent when they see it...let alone hear it."
,B001232NP4,1,1,5,"Now this is excellent urban music!  ""Never"" is one of the best love songs released in recent years.  The next single featuring Keyshia Coles called, ""I've Changed"" is a damn good urban slow jam, sure to be in heavy rotation on radio.  Other songs on the disc like ""Hush, Have You Every, and Lonely,"" fit in the category of other urban artist charting hits today.  This is a nice disc to put in your car and drive to, or share a romantic interlude with."
,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"It took awhile for Jaheim's 1st video to grow on me.  I would see ""Could It Be"" quite often on BET and finally after awhile the track began to grow on me.  Eventually, I picked up Jaheim's 1st CD entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghetto-Love/dp/B00005899K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghetto Love</a>.  My favorite tracks included ""Looking For Love"", ""Ghetto Love"", ""Just In Case"", ""Anything"" w/Next and ""Ready Willing & Able"".  His debut was definitely strong despite there being some filler amongst the 21 tracks.  His 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Still-Ghetto/dp/B00006WKYJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Still Ghetto</a>&nbsp;got a tremendous push because of the 1st single ""Fabolous"" that was an anthem dedicated to the young kids that are growing up in this crazy world.  My favorite tracks ended up being ""Diamond In Da Ruff"", ""Let's Talk About It"", ""Beauty & Thug"" w/Mary J. Blige, ""Long As I Live"" and ""Me & My B____"".  In 2006 Jaheim released his 3rd disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghetto-Classics/dp/B000BJ7CCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghetto Classics</a>.  The 1st single was ""Everytime I Think About Her"" w/Jadakiss and my other favorites included ""The Chosen One"", ""Like A DJ"", ""Masterpiece"", ""Conversation"" and ""Come Over"".

Just as review ""Musac Critic"" stated, Jaheim's 4th release, ""The Makings Of A Man"" has Jaheim playing it safe for the most part.  The 1st track ""Voice Of R&B"" is an introduction to r&b listeners who may not be too familiar with Jaheim's work outside of the singles that everyone has heard.  The track clocks in at less than 3 minutes and is a short but sweet track for Jaheim fans.  ""Hush"" is produced by R Kelly and has Jaheim describing a situation where he unintentionally started messin' around with a female that he knew was with a guy that he knew.  Jaheim blames it on having a couple of drinks but now that the 1st time was so good, he is trying to figure out how they can keep things going without the guy finding out.  ""Have You Ever"" is right along the lines of ""Fabolous"" as Jaheim is reminiscing to events that happened in the past when he was younger.  You hear the familiar Kaygee sound that you heard on ""Ghetto Love"" as well.  ""Lonely"" has Jaheim employing his own concept to the Bobby Womack classic ""If You Think You're Lonely Now"".  The chrous stays the same but Jaheim adds his own lyrics to the verses and the other parts of the song.  This is definitely one of my favorite tracks on this CD.  ""Life Of A Thug"" will be one of those songs that if you heard Jaheim's 1st 3 CDs that you have heard before.  However, you will still want to listen to the track in its entirety.  He talks about how his dad passed when he was 2 so all that he knew were the streets growing up despite having the guidance of his mom.  My personal favorite track on ""The Makings Of A Man"" is ""Just Don't Have A Clue"".  Babyface shows up to produce a nice midtempo jam using acoustic guitars and various other elements.  Jaheim is trying to tell the lady that he is with that she has no idea about the plans that he has for her in the future as long as she realzies that he should be the one and only one for her.  He states that he is better than the guys that she is use to so she shouldn't be afraid to give her all in the relationship.  ""She Ain't You"" has Jaheim talking about a woman that isn't girlfriend that treats him better than his actual girlfriend does.  He even says that the particular girl's love is like a Bentley Coup and his girlfriend's love is like a Mercedes Benz that's been used.  OUCH!..lol  ""She Ain't You"" is another nice midtempo jam.  ""Never"" is the lead single and serves that purpose well.  Jaheim talks about resisting the temptation of love before because he didn't want to turn in his player card.  However, after meeting this particular woman, that he is ready to burn the infamous black book.  Keyshia Cole, who is 3 singles into her sophomore disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Like-You/dp/B000VDDCHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Like You</a>, joins Jaheim on ""I've Changed"".  Kaygee employs a nice sample in Atlantic Starr's ""Let's Get Closer"" and creates a nice uptempo jam for the prince and princess of ""ghetto love r&b.""  If you are a fan of either artist then this just might be your favorite track on this CD.  ""What You Think Of That"" is another one of my favorites as Jaheim talks about how his ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" is making him feel.  He's not really caring about what the world thinks about the relationship and he is happy to have her in his life.  ""Make A Wish"" is a midtempo jam that has Jaheim wanting to treat his woman to a nice time since it's her birthday and ""Back Together Again"" is a nice song that talks about how his dad and mom are together again in heaven since they both left the Earth to soon.

If your purchased ""The Makings Of A Man"" at Circuit City then you were blessed with 2 bonus tracks in ""Roster"" and ""Keep It 100"".  ""Roster"" is the better track as the Kaygee produced track will remind you of ""Just In Case"" from ""Ghetto Love"" and ""Like A DJ"" from ""Ghetto Classics"".  ""Keep It 100"" isn't a bad track, but you will clearly be able to tell why it was a bonus track.

Overall, if this is your 1st introduction to a Jaheim CD, I wouldn't expect you to be a big fan of this CD.  However, if you have followed Jaheim since ""Ghetto Love"" then you will enjoy Volume 4 of Jaheim's ghetto classic series.  He has a nice voice and you already know the type of songs that you are going to get from Jaheim so you shouldn't be surprised by the material.  If you liked ""Ghetto Love"", ""Still Ghetto"" and ""Ghetto Classics"", then you should also own ""The Makings Of A Man"".

,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"First of all, I consider Jaheim to be one of the standout male R&B singers of our time.  Unfortunately for Ja, he hasn't found commercial success easily. Sure, GHETTO LOVE and STILL GHETTO went platinum, but it took time and airplay. Last year's GHETTO CLASSICS landed Jaheim in the top spot of the Billboard Chart yet it only went gold (and its chart stay was brief as well)and none of his excellent singles made a splash at radio.  Sad considering ""Everytime I Think About Her"" and ""The Chosen One"" were both fine songs, among Jaheim's most soulful. This time around, Jaheim lands at Atlantic and the difference is noticeable.  Sure, Jaheim sounds as refined yet soulful at the same time, but the production doesn't feel as bombastic or bright as it did on last year's GHETTO CLASSICS.  It's not a bad thing, but despite this album being as consistent as any Jaheim album, it at times feels too safe and reserved. Vocally Jaheim is refined and never overdoes melisma, but you sometimes wish Jaheim would give just a bit more.

The material is overall fine, but a bit safe. The opening ""Voice of R&B"" has a nice vintage soul feel to it with the horns and 1970s feeling production. Jaheim still possesses his street-savvy persona here despite the soulful underlying production.  On ""Hush"", Jaheim gets his R. Kelly on (literally), though it isn't a complete successin my eyes.  Sure, Ja pulls it off pretty good, but I think Jaheim is better suited with soul-samples and vintage production work - nothing against Kells. It's not bad though, just different. ""Have You Ever"" and ""Lonely"" start to really heat things up while ""Life of a Thug"" truly brings the heat with its wah-wah clavinets, strings, and synthesized horn production.

""You Just Don't Get It"" isn't bad, though the highlights that follow are incredible.  ""She Ain't You"" is absolutely beautiful and is my personal favorite.  ""Never"" is a bit subtle, but maybe it is the subtlety that makes it so great. Jaheim vocal control is phenomenal here.  ""I've Changed"" features an as of late ubiquitous Keyshia Cole and proves to be solid as does ""What You Think of That"".  ""Make A Wish"" and ""Back Together Again"" are solid as well, if not as exceptional as the aforementioned best (""Have You Ever"", ""Life of a Thug"", ""She Ain't You"", ""Never"", and ""You've Changed"".

Overall, THE MAKINGS OF A MAN is Ja's fourth consistent effort.  Again, the material is good but safe in a couple of cases.  This isn't a bland effort, but it is even less ornate than GHETTO CLASSICS and there is no ""Could It Be"" this time around.  With that said, there are enough solid numbers to make this album overall enjoyable. 4 stars Ja."
,B001232NP4,-1,-1,2,"Jaheim is a Cat with a top tier strong voice, problem is the lyrical content and the fact he doesn't have anybody to push his vocal boundarys. he aspires to be the Teddy Pendergrass/Luther Vandross, Johnny Gill  of his Generation, but alot of the material he gets is making him more closer to Christopher Wiliams a vocalist who had a good range,but was stuck doing generic watered down takes on songs that were out or just doing hooks. I like the R.Kelly Produced ""Hush"" and a Jaheim vocally brings it, but the material he gets is hurting him and he seems to be headed toward the same path as Dave Holister another strong Voice Soul Brother who never got the right songs to compliment his overall range."
,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"See with Jaheim, ive noticed the man can not make bad music. Every album he has put out has been at least good, and excellent at his best. And that continues with Makings of A Man. I think Ja made a good choice in switching record labels and going to Atlantic, because at Warner he wasn't getting any promotion. This was the first time i had to go to 2 different stores to find the damn album, because they were sold out at the first store. Jaheim is a breath of fresh air in the state of R&B right now. Because most of the R&B being put out right now revolves around Sex, partying, and drugs. And some of that is ok in small doses but to make a whole album around that gets old real fast. But Ja knows how to balance his albums between Love & Sex. He doesnt over do it on this album, along with any of his other albums. But the biggest thing that i think helped him in the move to Atlantic, was that it introduced him to some new and better producers. This is the first time a Ja album has actually had a more contempary feel to it. Like the stellar Babyface written ""Just Don't Get It"", this is totally different than the Ja we are used to. This song totally sounds like it could be on the radio. Excellent track. Like on the R. Kelly produced ""Hush"" where Ja reminices about how he had an affair with his best friends girl. This album is alot different sounding than his previous albums, but its a good thing. While ""Never"" could possibly be played at weddings, he can still do songs that the thugs can feel to like ""Life of a Thug"". And the other thing that i really like about this album (This might sound weird), is that he released it in December. Which in my opinion is the perfect time for him to release an album because in winter, i always find myself listening to his albums. I don't know what it is but during the winter his music just does it for me when i am driving around. Not that during the summer or whatever i don't like him, but during the winter i always make sure to have at least one of his albums in the car with me at all times. I think it could be his just smooth but jagged vocals that just warms the air during the winter that makes his music so attractive during the winter season. And we all know Ja can blow, unless you are new to Ja, now is the perfect time to introduce yourself. And this album will be in heavy rotation for quite some time because it is just as good as his previous albums, if not better. Another hit for Jaheim... as usual!

,B0012358GK,1,1,4,Rob Thomas has created another Christmas classic. Hope to see this song around for many years. Keep up the good work.
,B0012358GK,1,1,5,"Rob Thomas does it again, this is a great Christmas tune, that will be sure to be a new holiday classic."
,B0012358GK,1,1,5,"You've heard Dasher, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen, Rudolph, Frosty, Santa and his elves. You've heard it all, and then some. You've heard about Christmas trees, Christmas presents, Christmas breakups, Christmas chaos, and in fact, you've heard just about everything, until now. A charity single, and Rob Thomas' first solo work (a whole lot better than most of his later stuff), this song sings a hymn for peace and goodwill toward men, that's not up in your face, unlike Mr. Lennon, and also unlike Lennon, there's no anti-war message! Nope, this song is a sincere piece of work, and one of Thomas' best. And unlike his later work, it builds toward something grand, and when it comes to the chorus, it soars in a magical fashion that can only happen at Christmas.

Overall, one of the best modern Christmas songs I've ever heard. It's a earnest piece of work, and at least when it first came out, the proceeds went toward charity. A underrated song that doesn't deserve it, this holiday season, buy this, and hear a master at his craft."

,B001232BWO,1,1,4,"Only downloaded this because the guys in my band want to cover the song. For the type of music they play, they execute very well, and like I said it's a lot of fun to play this ""boogie"". Good barroom song for a rowdy Friday night for sure."
,B001232BWO,1,1,5,From the guitar at the start of this song you know your about to hear something special. Now if only more girls would follow the moral advice in the song.
,B001232BWO,1,1,5,An absolute classic rock track!

,B001232BWO,1,1,5,This is just a fun song to have in your collection.  It was a great crusing song years ago and brings back great memories.
,B001232BWO,1,1,5,this song download arrived in a timely manner and were in good condition. Exactly what I wanted and saved me hunting all over locally to find them. I love shopping Amazon! So easy.
,B001232BWO,1,1,4,This is a fun and rocking single.  Definitely a 1 hit wonder but loads of fun.  A must for any playlist.
,B001232BWO,1,1,4,I like country music that has a bit of rock to it and not to much twang. This is a good song and has the ability to keep your interest.
,B001232BWO,1,1,5,"What more can I say, no one has ever made better music, and amazon the best site to buy from ! John"
,B001232BWO,1,1,5,I have played this song many times a musician (I am a drummer) and have also dance my tookus off on the dance floor...this tune really makes people get out of their seats and sing along!  A truly great song!
,B001232BWO,1,1,5,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,Been a fan for a long time! Glad I finally bought album
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"Jackson Browne's 1973 For Everyman, his second album, helps Browne flesh out. Aided by friends from The Eagles, which Browne had roomed with and written for, Glenn Frey helps a young JB make his mark.

For Everyman truly is for everyman. Well, at least every man I know. This is a beautiful album with a lot of heart and some laughs."
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"Classic album. Jackson Browne is a underrated songwriter, he doesn't get his just due. 5 Stars without a doubt"
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,the is one of the best recorded records ever.. it is as if they are in your living room.
,B001230RCK,1,1,5,Shinedown has become a huge hit over the past several years and still rolling on. This is a great LP.
,B001230RCK,1,1,5,Another song that I can't get enough of. Shinedown is my favorite!!! The Band is AWESOME!!!  Number 1 in my book!!!
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"Jackson Brown, premier singer songwriter.  Lots of premium material on this album.  Hard to match JB.  Listen over and over."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Excellant
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Very nice
,B001235DTW,1,1,4,One of their best ever.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"It's a good recording, but I wish I could get a version of this song with the TSO ladies that perform it on their tour."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Great song!
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Great music! Wonderfully presented. Awesome Christmas music!
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Was exactly what i was expecting.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,love it
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Trans Siberian does what they do extremely well - so much fun to listen to their music
,B001235DTW,-1,1,4,It was not the version I thought it was.  I was looking for the rock version of it but it is still okay.  I put in the wrong song title.  I should have looked for Christmas Canon Rock.  My fault.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Great christmas song
,B001235DTW,1,1,4,I love this song!!!
,B001235DTW,1,1,4,ok
,B001235DTW,-1,-1,3,Needed it for a Christmas light display!
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Excellent Rendition!
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Beautiful wedding song instead of the traditional bridal march
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Wonderful music!! They are fabulous!
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Good music
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"very good quality, price & delivery, well done!"

,B001235DTW,1,1,5,excellent
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Great song
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"Jackson Browne / for everyman:  Jackson Browne is a great songwriter and singer, and this album contains ten of his great songs.  Highly Recommended.  Five Stars"
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,I like it
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"its music, what's not to love?"
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Love this song.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Very nice.  Added to Christmas collection.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"More than Christmas music...it just puts you in the mood to decorate your tree, address all your cards, make hot chocolate and remember WHY there is a C-H-R-I-S-T mas to celebrate."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"I absolutely love this song it is great and makes a good addition to my Christmas collection, I definitely recommend..."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,I love this song and would highly recommend it to everyone one of the best sounds played by TSO for christmas
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Great song and sounds great. This song is upbeat and great to listen to. This makes me feel Christmas joy.
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"A stunning, visionary album that encapsulates every one of Browne's several talents perfectly. Step aside, Abbey Road, this is my new favorite album. Miles ahead of its time, maturely written, and packed with classics even someone living on Jupiter will have heard, this is... ha! I fooled you, didn't I? This album really gets 2.5 stars. I just thought it would be funny if I ever gave anything by Mr. Browne the highest possible score. Anyway, this is slightly better than the debut, containing a whopping five good songs rather than four. I don't think you need me here to tell you that ""Take It Easy"" is better heard here than by the Eagles (Jackson wrote the damn thing); ""Redneck Friend"" is easily the best of his few rockers, and its sense of humor is a nice change of pace from his usual overtly-serious style; ""For Everyman"" is a bit overlong but has the best guitar solo Browne ever recorded; ""These Days"" (later covered by Gregg Allman) goes from country-rock to relatively full-on rock; and the slow-building ""I Thought I Was a Child"" is interesting too. But some of it's more of the same, just one turgid country-rocker after another - ""Our Lady of the Well"", ""Ready or Not"", etc. Better than the debut, at least. Nice cover, too."
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"And here is why. I will acknowledge that Late For the Sky and others are brilliant, but Sky and some of the others are a tad darker and do ask for a commitment from the listener. This album is user friendly and very accessible. Many classic songs here and it does harken you back to the Southern California thing of an earlier time. Of Browne's great realeases, I am partial to this one the most."
,B001235DTW,1,1,4,This is a great song just not all year long. It is perfect for your Christmas Mix.  Makes an excelent data disc!
,B001235DTW,1,1,4,"I sort of lump Mannheim Steamroller and Trans-Siberian Orchestra into the same pot...there's something there to enjoy and a lot that just doesn't interest me at all.  I've always felt I could take all of Mannheim's holiday releases and make ONE good album.  This Christmas Canon has been playing on a local FM station; that was my introduction to it, so I decided to buy it.  I'm pleased."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"Wow! The first time I heard this, I knew that I lived it and had to have a copy. What TSO is known for many of their Christmas tunes, for me, this one stands out. Listen to the sample to the end to hear the vocals that set this apart. Thank you TSO!"
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Trans Siberian Orchestra has combined the perfect blend of musical styles and make them work.  They will become a part of all of our Christmas's to come.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Love this music. Voices are amazing.  Beautiful in every way. Loved it from the very first time I heatd it.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Christmas Canon is a lovely song played by the Trans -Siberian Orchestra that not only will sooth your soul but will lull you into blissful relaxation as you listen to the hauntingly beautiful  strands of music that caresses your whole being and makes you glad that you are alive. Christmas Canon is a song that once you hear it you will want to listen to it again and again . It's a lovely song that makes the Holidays even more special.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"I love this group, they do a lot of Christmas music and they do it right. I have never heard a bad thing about them, Christmas Canon is one of my favorites from them. I love the beat the drama they put into this piece, it sure gets worn out on the radio around November/December. I know most people know this piece, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to hear great music, especially Christmas music done right.

THX,
Kris L. Cockayne"
,B001235DTW,1,1,4,"I am a casual fan of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and so I give this album a thumbs up. However, the one song, Christmas Canon, was the main reason that I bought it, and I think that it is the best cut on the album. Nice sounds, fresh and different."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"what could be better than Pachabel Canon in D and children's voices, this is a wonderful piece of music. I heard it on the radio every year and last year decided to find it to download. It was quite a search to find out what it was, who did it, the name....but I got it and I am soooo glad. Now it is readily available of course!! This is truly a peaceful, fantastic combination of gorgeous music and sweet children....a favorite."
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"""Saturate Before Using"", ""Late For The Sky"" and this album (and I suppose ""Runnin' On Empty"" too although I've yet to hear it - I can't imagine it would be bad, though) are ESSENTIAL albums to ANY music fan. EVERYTHING about these albums is perfect - the production, lyrics, musicianship, singing...etc. This makes perfect sense as Jackson was notoriously worried about getting everything perfect in the studio (and his producers rightfully got annoyed at him for that). This paid off in spades, however, as everything is crystal clear and perfect even though this was recorded in the late 60's! A cool little addition is that the first and second as well as the 9th and 10th songs flow into one another (very cool). The lyrics, as always, are extremely quotable, deep and meaningful - pretty much second only to Bob Dylan. Unlike Dylan, though, the lyrics are, like title of the album, ""For Everyman"". As opposed to ""Saturate Before Using"" and ""Late For The Sky"", ""For Everyman"" is the more consistent album - there aren't any ""bad"" songs (not that the other two had bad songs, a bunch just weren't as good as the highlights). Another cool addition is the first track, ""Take It Easy"", which is the original song which The Eagles then made into a monster hit with their cover version. If you were unsure whether you liked Jackson before, buy this album and you'll become a fan! For $9.00 this is a STEAL! Absolutely recommended!

Highlights include:
the entire album!"
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"FOR EVERYMAN, along with the self-titled debut, LATE FOR THE SKY, THE PRETENDER, and RUNNIN' ON EMPTY, is one of Jackson Browne's best albums. There's a bit more rock here, including his version of his Eagles co-write, ""Take It Easy."" This album is a must-own for any fan of California rock, Southern rock, or Midwestern rock. It's worth noting that Browne advocates sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's recent trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as increased funding for community policing, so this is a purchase that's essential for your conscience, as well as your ears."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Awesome. Loved it. Listening to this song was a wonderful way to celebrate the winter season and the holidays this past year. What a way to rock out to Christmas!
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"I'm not sure where (or why) I bought  'Christmas Eve and Other Stories.'  All I know is that it remains my favorite Christmas album to this day.  This song is not from that album, but like most of Steamroller's Christmas songs, I fell in love with it the first time I heard it.  Some day, I'll probably buy the CD as well."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"I, we, love this. It is also part of the Ghosts of Christmas Past video by Trans-Siberian Orchestra. This is one of those songs that is a must-have for the Christmas collection."
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"This was the first Jackson Browne album I purchased, back when it first was released on vinyl. A few years later I saw him in concert, opening for Linda Ronstadt. Quite an evening. Other reviewers discuss the songs in depth, so read them. I'll just say that 80 percent of this collection is deeply moving, wonderfully sung, and bears up well under many repeats. If you like Browne's later stuff, don't miss this gem, either."
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"This is an album for `everyman"", the definitive statement by Jackson Browne of his disturbing and apocalyptic view of contemporary society, and his hopes and fears for its future. It is also a lovely, stirring, and  evocative song cycle that illuminates Jackson Browne's unique vocal and  instrumental arrangements, and sends one running for the door to buy more  of the albums of the early ""JB"" variety. My personal favorites on this  wonderful album are ""Our Lady of the Well"", a interesting and fetching  suggestion of Browne's social and political concerns blended with a  celebration of the common rural peasantry of Latin America, ""Take It Easy""  written with Glenn Frye of the Eagles and recorded by both Browne and the  Eagles, ""These Times You've Come"" about an old pair of lovers who still see  each other romantically after parting, and of course, the combination song  cycle of ""Sing My Songs"" and ""For Everyman"", which like ""The Deluge"" on  another album, sets out Browne's fear of a pending eco-disaster and  apocalypse. Browne is still around, still creative, and still as socially  and politically outspoken, but this is one of his best early albums, when  he was one of the most talented and creative young folk-rock luminaries on  the popular scene, a superstar a long time in the making.  This is a  `must-have' album for any real fan of Browne's music and for anyone just  interested in top-shelf folk-rock music by one of the seventies and  eighties greatest popular artists."
,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"With his second album, Jackson Browne hit his creative stride.  There is not a bad song in the mix, but particularly strong are ""Our Lady of the Well,"" ""These Days,"" ""Redneck Friend"" and the  lengthy title track.  This is an album that you can listen to repeatedly  but will never get stale.  The first song, co-written with Eagle Glen Fry,  became a big hit for that band, but Browne's version is better.  Overall,  one of the best American rock albums of the 1970s."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"we wee married december 20th and I did not want to walk down the aisle to the typical wedding march, so the pianist suggested pachelbel's Canon in D--, the fact that it has become a popular christmas song is just a plus for us on our anniversary"
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,We have been listening to the song it was purchased and downloaded.  Highly recommend this song to anyone looking for a great Christmas song.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"this was a christmas gift TSO  was heard by my cousin and loved it , I have all there  cds and a dvd .THE Goast Of Christmas Eve we go to all there shows when town ,If you have not seen there show you are missing a great show."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"This is one of the most beautiful songs I've EVER heard!  The orchestral background makes it sound even more majestic and grandiose and elegant.  Truly, this song sounds like it belongs in Heaven!  Simply gorgeous!"
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"Great version to the already popular ""wedding"" song. Especially like the chorus with the young children singing in this song."
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,"Trans-Siberian Orchestra is always a great selection for Christmas parties, background Christmas music, and for playing while decorating for the holidays!"
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,like listening to this when in the cellar tinkering around and in the truck going places before christmas right after thankgiving
,B001235DTW,1,1,4,Great song...I would rather hear than watch this orchestra...the music for the most part is extra-ordinary.  Previewing the songs are really helpful and I'm glad for that chance when it is offered.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,Love it! Wish I could know more about the lyrics. I assume it's God's dream for us and not Santa Claus' dream.
,B001235DTW,1,1,5,This song is so beautiful it brings me to tears! I didn't know until I looked up the lyrics that it's really about Jesus coming on earth. Awesome!
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"It's TSO, do I really have to say more?  It's my favorite Christmas song ever.  I never get tired of listening to it.  This song is the best part of the concerts. in my opinion.

BEST INSTRUMENTAL CHRISTMAS SONG EVER!"
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Have made a mix and included it in with Mannheim Steamroller Christmas tunes.  This song is my all time favorite of TSO.
,B001237DT0,-1,-1,1,"I mean, doesn't Savatage as a band name and members ONLY deserve the credit! Why does it have to be TSO under the spot lights and Savatage left in the dark? Is it fair?

Don't get me wrong but hey whats fair is fair, i mean i know Savatage members are still in TSO. But let's review; 1. Al petrilli left Savatage in the middle of Poets and Madmen album to join Megadeth then Dave Mustaine kicked him out, why take him back Paul O'neil?
2. Zak stevens (Sang only in Beethoven's last night) left Savatage to be with the family and surprisingly came back and made CIIC band and being rude enough to come ask Jon Oliva for his help! Come on!

Overall, I say since Savatage members are happy we should be happy that at least they got the attention they deserve even under TSO name."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"A few years ago, I sat in the car around Christmas listening to a rock station or something, then I heard this track, and I was blown away. It was a rock orchestra with all the elements of a classical symphony, containing a great song structure that creates a great atmosphere. It starts off slow, then slowly starts into the marching beats of war, then launches into the all-out assault of battle. And best of all, it isn't classical music, it's rock. Pure rockin' blazin' guitars that leave you satisfied to the utmost.

A Christmas classic, and a True masterpiece from the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. If you haven't done so already, then check out a Christmas Eve in Sarajevo. You certainly won't be bored."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,I love this it is by far my favorite Christmas song
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Great rendition
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Great holiday song.
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Hands down my favorite Christmas song. I even enjoy listening to it when it's not Christmas. The notes are all powerful and gives me goosebumps each time I hear it.
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Beautiful song.

,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Love the music. Thanks.
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,This orchestra is the hardest orchesta I've ever heard. I love them. They have a very unique sound
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Perfect...Fast Shipping...No issues
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"Again, if you like the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, you may want to consider purchasing this for your collection."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Great Christ-mad song
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,I listen to Christmas carols all year long and this is a keeper.  It is powerful and moving and done in a modern way but keeping to the original.  The instruments used make it a powerful song that you can't help but want to conduct in the privacy of your own home so you won't be laughed at! LOL
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,I love this whole album for Christmas time. I would recommend it to anyone during the Holiday Season. Love it
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,You have to love the Trans-Siberian Orchestra...it comes to you like a present already wrapped. You just have to sit back and let the notes fall around you like wrapping paper and ribbons. Experience Christmas the way it should be...in your heart!
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"True to Trans-Siberian Orchestra's sound, Christmas/Sarajevo resonates with deep, rich musical tones tempered by tinkling bells, clarinets resonating back to deep drum beats and bass instruments. Fast paced. Exciting piece.

Recommended."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"One of my favorite groups.  They are quite talented.  Love, love, love their music. Would highly recommend them to everyone."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"This song gives me goose bumps every time I hear it, it is an awesome song to add to my Christmas collection and I definitely recommend to anyone who has to have Christmas music for the holidays..."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Wonderful music and a great buy.  It is must listen to music and just great.  It is a MUST BUY AND LISTEN!!
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,This is one of those tracks that is instantly recognisable now. I just didn't know who made it. Once I did I bought it. This is one of the TSO's strongest pieces and just marvellous at Christmas and with enough beat to be a good workout track all year long.
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,This song defines the Holiday Season and its real intense in its tempo.  The whole album is worth listening to and it gives you that sense of pride in the season.
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"For the most part, I hate Christmas music because it is so over played. The exception to this is the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. I bought this piece of music to go along with a Christmas slide show. The music quality is exceptional. I've received several complements on my music selection. I would highly recommend this song."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"TSO. The music you hear year after year and love!  You know the tunes,  you know the bands just never thought you would hear these bands playing this music. Metallica playing Carol of the bells! Amazing"
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,I have finally downloaded this song to my device. It gets me pumped and I almost always find myself humming or singing this song.
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Great song and sounds great. This song is upbeat and great to listen to. This makes me feel Christmas joy.
,B001237DT0,-1,1,5,"I love the instrumental songs of Trans-Siberian Orchestra, the singing ones are okay, some are a little much for me."
,B001237DT0,1,1,4,This is a great song just not all year long. It is perfect for your Christmas Mix.  Makes an excelent data disc!
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"Great, high energy instrumental Christmas song. Starts out nice and haunting and then kicks into a powerful, high energy rendition of classic Christmas music."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Trans Siberian Orchestra has combined the perfect blend of musical styles and make them work.  They will become a part of all of our Christmas's to come.
,B001237DT0,1,1,4,"I always liked the Trans-Siberian Orchestra as a young child and I have to say that their orchestrations have not lost their wonder. I was a little jolted as to how rock the songs are, however, when you get in the mood for it, the music is great.. You just have to be ready for it :)"
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"Trans-Siberian Orchestra, what could be more said about this excellent group of musicians and their music!!  It is abosolutely magical to listen to during the holiday season."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"Great song, I must have listened to this song a hundred times ... yeah, it gets a little old, but I put it down for a short time and boom -it's on again!"
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,I loved this and they play beautifully if you like Xmas music with a strong twist then buy this it will put you in the holiday mood.
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"This is a good song, I like this song, it is by a good artist, I would buy it again."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"As a person, and as a family, I and we love this song and have the Ghosts of Christmas past video - of which this song is a part of. We listen to it over and over. When my 5 year old hears it from the backroom she comes running."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,I could listen to this song all year-round. If you need that lift to get you going then this song is for you. It's a great Christmas song and a great rock song. I didn't even consider any other group.
,B001237DT0,-1,1,4,"Great Christmas music done in the rock opera style.
The Mp3 version seems to be really compressed (congested?).
Am waiting for the CD to get here to compare.
I've heard that some of their past recording mastering isn't the best, we'll see.."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"Trans-Siberian Orchestra is always a great selection for Christmas parties, background Christmas music, and for playing while decorating for the holidays!"
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"I really like this type of music and before I purchase an albumn I prefer to hear some of the previews - of course, I don't like ever song equally, but that is usually the case with anyone."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,Trans- Siberian is an amazing group and I would highly recommend their music. If you get a chance to see them perform you won't be disappointed.
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,"If you like Mannheim Steamroller, then you'll love this too. Beautiful arrangement.  Everyone I know who's heard this loves Trans-Siberian Orchestra too."
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,This was purchased to insure I was legal on a christmas light sequencing program therefore insuring there would be no issues later on with the music industry. Very nice song!
,B001237DT0,1,1,5,I really enjoy the total instrumental music of TSO.  Was quite happy with this purchase and likely to buy others.

,B001239GP4,-1,1,4,As described
,B001239GP4,1,1,5,I really like the remake they did with this song.
,B001239GP4,1,1,5,"Not normally a person who like remakes or re-recordings of classic songs. This song is an exception. Great vocals, many layers of electronic instruments...it's just about perfection."
,B001239GP4,1,1,4,Not a bad remake
,B001239GP4,1,1,5,A lot of their music is great! And this song does the exact same....great workout song! Listen to it everytime!
,B001239GP4,1,1,5,Puts a little different spin on a well known 80's hit song by phil colins. yup yup yup yup yup
,B001239GP4,1,1,5,"Love the nonpoint version... different, but not too different from the original... why change something that kicks but in the first place!"
,B00123BBSE,1,1,5,Remains me of  being at home on sunday morning listening to the radio or goin to a upbeat church gettin ur praise on..
,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.

1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  ""Reach"" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.
2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.
3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.
4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.
5) 2 Find U: Weak.
6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.
7) Doin' Fine: ""We are what everyone wants to be.""  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.
8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is ""spells"" the song title...).
9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.
10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.
11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.
12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.
13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).
14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own ""becoming"" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.

As you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to ""This Way"") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,Jewel seems to be going for a more pop image here.  I was surprised at how well it worked.  The songs have the energy and better music of pop but still have Jewel's lyrics with more depth than normal pop.  I liked this CD a lot.
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,1,"It's okay if artists want to change their sound sometimes, if they didn't they might get bored. But this album is awful. Notice how she never did pop again?"
,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Jewel was at the very tail end of her 20s in 2003 when her fourth album ""0304"" was released.  But the photos that adorn the CD's layout -- oh my!  She is more gorgeous and youthful in them than girls 10 years her minor.  She has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world in fact.  She is the living definition of ""young and smart and sexy,"" to use the catchphrase she coined for this album.

OK, so I've just now been open about my admiration for Jewel's looks, but the question is, does she have the music to back it up?  The answer is an unequivocal ""yes.""

Some reviewers considered ""0304"" to be something of a misstep for the Alaskan born singer/songwriter, but I believe this to be one of her best albums.  The opener ""Stand"" is a classic.  It always brings me back to the first times that I heard this CD.  One of her best ever.  It and the other songs here demonstrate Jewel's knack for making odd references in her lyrics (see also the one to Charlie Sheen in ""Intuition"") that put a smile on the listener's face and make for memorable songs.  Beyond that, I love ""Leave the Lights On,"" a slower and more laid back track.  One thing that was new to Jewel's sound on this release was the use of electronica to create numbers tailor-made for any dance hall, something some fans of her past, more folkish tunes didn't take well to.  I for one love it.  Some of my favorite tracks here are the lesser known ones stacked at the end that are great for dancing or exercising to.  I mean, you just can't get more catchy than songs like ""Yes U Can,"" ""U & Me = Love,"" and the rousing track where Jewel demonstrates her love for her home country, ""America.""  Excellent stuff.

There is actually not one weak track or moment of filler here though and Jewel sustains the listener's interest for the 53 minute duration of the CD, as only Jewel can, all the while proudly wearing her femininity and sex appeal on her sleeve.  The only reason I'm rating this album just shy of five stars is I liked the 2006 follow-up ""Goodbye Alice in Wonderland"" even slightly better.  Still, if you want to feel young and smart and sexy no matter what age you are, Jewel will show you how on ""0304.""  Highly recommended."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"As long as Jewel continues releasing albums with that wonderful, soothing and well-meaning voice, her music will continue to shine and stand the test of time.  You just have to admire the endless amount of beauty in the sound of her voice and her songwriting ability, which is simply unmatched.  Unless Jewel's voice changes for the worse, her music will always remain a really deserving listen."
,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Jewel's 0304 is a drastic change from the folk/pop singer we all know and adore. This album is not unlistenable like others have stated, it is just very different than her previous records. But change is good and well Jewel sure had the guts to try something fun and new. Standout tracks include: the gorgeous, Sweet Temptation, the rock-out anthem, America, the sensitive, 2 Find U, and the first single, Intuition. Some of the tracks obviously do not measure up like U plus me equals love, very silly and repetitive, Stand is awkward but has cool lyrics, and the closing song Becoming is just plain boring. But i still give this album a high rating because i love Jewel, her writing, and her raspy and lovely voice. The best song of the whole bunch is track number nine, Haunted. This song is classic Jewel. ""The fury of my conviction will cause your heart to quicken.."" Just a haunting song about a man stalking a woman. I would give this record a try if you like dance songs, it is a great summer record."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"It seems easy for people to critisize jewel for making such a big step when she seems to be on the right track with emotional ballads and sweet acoustic songs. Then why change? In my opinion a tallented musician should be able to combine different types of musical sounds, and be able to make a change in direction and still be in best form. To me jewel has done just that with this sassy peice of kwirky sophisticated pop. Each song on the album is a highlight with many different sounds. Intuition was the lead single with its accordian mixed with gentle pop/r&b beats, there are signs of soft rock material with ""2 become 1"" and ""America"". Each song has its own identity, a very meaningful, simple song called ""fragile heart"" has the butterflies going with its gentle vocals and basic drum beat. This album is most definately in my top 5 albums of all time. The lyrics are very clever and much thought went into writing them, i would recommend anyone to read the lyrics whilst listenning for the first time. Well done to Jewel for creating uplifting songs in pop style with no sign of cheese but perfectly wrote upmarket, styled music!"
,B00123B58U,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B00123B58U,1,1,5,"This absolutely beautiful song has a very powerful message, I literally was in awe when I first heard it. Let go and let GOD...when you do that you can sleep at night, you have a new energy supply, and a new point of view. GOD designed every obstacle we face to strengthen us in our weakest areas. GOD will never leave you nor forsake you. Yolanda is praising the HOLY, all powerful, all knowing, merciful, forgiving, loving GOD/creator/master I happily serve and I'm so glad I now have this song added to my personal gospel collection."
,B001237HCI,-1,1,5,"For former Jewel fans who don't like this CD, tough!  I've never heard anything like this, and my friends agree it's great.

""Stand"" (take a stand) is like some time tunnel idea from when music counted for something, set to a sleazy bar beat that holds the counterbalancing darkness.  We haven't had an artist who could popularize stuff like this in a while.

And there hasn't been so much hidden in lyrics since people tried playing Beatles records backwards.  Consider that ""Intuition,"" seems to be ""follow your heart"" inspiration, all mushy stuff you'd be proud to sing in church, when suddenly a stacatto vocal riff breaks in with ""just cash in, sell yourself.""

There are two striking examples of subliminal change of the apparent message by the silencing of a ""t"" at the end of a word.  In ""Leave The Lights On"" the rhythm makes it impossible to pronounce the ""t"" in ""can't"" so what we actually hear is ""you can try my love, you can buy my love"" instead of ""you can't buy my love.""

The second one is in ""Yes U Can.""  The first time the ""t"" in ""boots"" does come through, but after that it sounds like ""b"".  This one will get my review censored if I spell it out here, and maybe that's why she wrote the lyrics that way, to get past the WalMart censors?  The albumn does NOT have an explicit lyrics rating.  But the ""boots"" are bumpin'.  Apparently it worked.

Right on, Jewel.  Go for it!"
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,2,Very slick pop album. One notable exception is a great song about a stalker called Haunted. This song is a keeper. It's nice to finally have a CD burner.
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"Jewel Kilcher was always known for her meaningful lyrics and acoustic song stylings so it was no surprise that she would be labeled a ""sell-out"" once she switched things up at all. No one knows quite why Jewel decided to switch styles though many assume it was to crossover to the mainstream and sell more. Jewel's fourth album ""0304"" takes a more electronica/dance approach than its guitar-driven predecessors though the lyrical quality is still there. The even weirder thing was that at the time of this album's release, June 2003, the big dance-pop bang from the late 90's and even 2000/2001 was over which suggests that this wasn't exactly an attempt to ride the latest trends. Jewel was never known for doing what was trendy and this is no exception.

The album starts off with the social commentary song entitled ""Stand"". The song comments on numerous topics including policemen stealing and the mayor having no money because he spent it on ""hookers and hash"". The lyrics seem to be trying to say that we can make a stand against all these problems. Next up is the first evidence of Jewel's new style, ""Run 2 U"". Everything from the internet-style writing in the title (numbers instead of words) to the dance beat in the background takes listeners away from what they thought a Jewel song should be but to me, it still works. The song is catchy enough that it will stick in your head but still maintains Jewel's usual meaningful lyrics (""I need you for dark reasons, for greed and lust...""). Thirdly. We have the first single ""Intuition"" which seems to almost be a parody of the pop music scene. The lyrics are not quite as deep as people are used to from Jewel however it is one of those meaningful yet catchy songs that gives its message as it gets stuck in your head. While it is good to dance to, it still maintains the positive message of following your heart.

Next is ""Leave The Lights On"" which is the first lyrically poor song on the album. I love the way Jewel's voice sounds in the verses of the songs but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired especially since we know Jewel can do much better. (""If you want my love, you can try my love, you can't buy my love""). It's catchy and Jewel sounds good in it, but she can do better. The song after, ""2 Find U"" reminds me of ""Standing Still"" (especially in the chorus) but that is not really a bad thing. The chorus is vocally good but lyrically weak. The verses are lyrically much better. Next is ""Fragile Heart"", another love-themed song. It is probably closest to Jewel's former style, but while it is a nice song on its own, it seems very out of place on this album. Maybe it would have sounded better on an album with more songs of a similar style.  After that is ""Doin' Fine"" which is also quite poor lyrically as well as a somewhat clichd theme (that her and her man are doing fine). This song is average at best and fails to really stand out.

Then comes ""2 Become 1"", and it is quite obvious what this song is about. Lyrically, it is mediocre and could have been much better. Jewel sounds very sweet in this song and this is probably my favourite song vocally, however in the grand scheme of things it is mostly average. Next up is ""Haunted"" which is told from the point of view of a stalker (similar to Sarah Mclachlan's ""Possesion""). This song returns to the lyrical quality that listeners expect from Jewel though vocally it reminds me of Tori Amos. It is an essentially eerie-sounding song that is bound to creep out some listeners. Afterwards is ""Sweet Temptation"" which seems like a better version of ""2 Become 1"". They both talk about the same subject however ""Sweet Temptation"" is much better both vocally and lyrically. This song is also much more catchy and memorable than ""2 Become 1"".

The next song, ""Yes U Can"" is probably one of the weakest on the album and is merely a typical dance track that nearly any singer could have done. Lyrically, it is not even up to Jewel's usual standards (""Would you like to come along? Then shut up and sing this song""). While it is a catchy, danceable song, it does not seem like a song that Jewel would or should be doing. ""U & Me = Love"" is no better, either vocally or lyrically. I understand that Jewel is trying to branch out to a different style however she would be better off with quality songs like ""Intuition"" and ""Stand"" than this song or the one before it. After that is ""America"", which is obviously another social commentary. Unfortunately, while I appreciate what Jewel was trying to do with this song, it did not work out too well. The lyrics are quite weak (""The Osbournes and Anna Nicole are too freaky to tell"") and the vocals are fairly standard. Lastly is ""Becoming"" which has better lyrics but really does not stand out too much. It is not in any way bad except maybe it was poorly placed.

Overall Mark: 3/5

While most fans were outraged when Jewel released this album, she actually has some decent dance songs that prove she's capable of other styles. This album could have been really great if Jewel had stuck with infusing meaningful lyrics to dance beats (as with ""Stand"" and ""Intuition""). Unfortunately, towards the second half of the album, Jewel ends up using mediocre lyrics that any dance artist could have done. Up until ""Fragile Heart"", the album was exceptionally well done for what it was supposed to be (meaningful dance music) though it faltered in a lot of places after that. Generally though, it is a pretty good dance album and much catchier than anything Jewel's done before."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"I was hesitant to buy this album because I hadn't heard too many good things about it. For one, the Amazon.com review said, ""Why pick on a girl for taking a chance?"" Why would anyone pick on her? This is a great album that takes her Jewelness to a new level. Her lyrics, while mostly pertaining to love, are still hers in the sense that she puts poetic thought into them. She also has some great message-bearing songs, and then just some fun ones with no need for substance!
""Stand"" is the first song and is a great way to kick off the album. It talks about the sadness of the world we live in, how some poor people spend money on drugs and alcohol, there's a lot of violence, and other horrible things. She also mentions how we can come together and make a change!
I really liked ""2 Find U"" because it talked about the problems of relationships. Though there are mistakes that we make with our boyfriend or girlfriend, we have two choices when fights or things like that happen: 1) we can let the pain win and walk away forever, or 2) we can give eachother a clean slate & start over. Jewel asks for a clean slate in this song, it's very bittersweet.
Her voice is so cutesy in ""Fragile Heart,"" it's funny! She uses simple sentences and the childlike sound of her voice makes it amusing to me: ""If you want my heart, you have to promise not to tear it apart, 'cause my heart has been hurt a lot."" It's a cautionary song letting someone know she's had lots of pain in the past and doesn't want that now.
I must say that ""Haunted"" gave me goosebumps when I first heard it, and still does!!! Though Jewel's liner notes say it's about a stalker (which makes sense if you look at the lyrics), I like to think it's a very dark song about someone who Jewel wants revenge against. She describes how she will ""come to you in the still of the night"" and ""crush you with the burden of sight."" The music is very creepy and slick, adding to the frightful feel of the song. There's also a little clock ticking in the background, making it all the more paranoid and intense! Remind me not to make her mad! :-)
""Yes U Can"" is a song that really doesn't have much meat to it lyrically, but is very fun to listen to! It describes a club scene with cowboys and 'naughty girls.' It's tongue-in-cheek I think, kind of playing on words and stuff. Very good song!
I think ""America"" might be my favorite song on this album. It talks about the imperfections of our country, from the fact that our president wants us to 'shed blood in the name of liberty' to the deteriorating quality of TV shows. She doesn't just blast America, though, she admits that although she wants to change it she wouldn't leave it if she could.
Yes, Jewel's sound is altered here on this electronic album. But don't think it's crap because of that; like I said, in my opinion it enhances her greatness. Though there are some very computerized songs, there are also ones that are closer to her acoustic style on ""This Way."" I would strongly encourage every Jewel fan to give this album an honest listen! I think it'll be worth it!"
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,1,"poor mis-guided jewel...she had it all. the looks, the voice, the songs, and the money.  i guess she decided she had enough when she put together this crap all album.  the only good song on it is ""Run to You""  and a couple others but VERY few.  this cd might be good if she stuck with her original sound. if u wanna check out the real Jewel check out Pieces of You, Spirit, or This Way.  they're better than this cd in sooooo many ways.  but this cd DOES have potential.  if she kept away from the techno and dance sh** than this woulda  been a really good cd probly.  she's still got the writing ability.  but anyways.  hopefully this phase of hers won't last too long."
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,1,"I am mainly a fan of non-commercial types of music: heavy metal, bluegrass, western, rockabilly, etc. But when I am in the car with my wife I am stuck listening to the dreaded top 40. How a station can be profitable by spinning the 40 newest rancid pieces of excrement I will never know. So it was to my surprise about six years ago when I finally heard somebody different: a unique voice singing intelligent lyrics with acoustic accompanyment. The first thing I thought was how did this get through the commercial radio filter system that strains out quality and lets only contaminated by-product through? The second thing was - who is this? It was Jewel of the Pieces of You era.
Fast forward five years. ""Intuition"" is on the radio. I can understand selling out if you are pushing 40, working temp office jobs for $9.00 an hour, and playing the coffee house circuit every weekend. But if you have made it big doing what you like to do, why do you sell out to the vacuous fads of today's fleeting pop scene? I guess once you get money, all you want is more money and you forget what the ultimate purpose of making music was. What a pity."
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"Jewel Kilcher's recent musical and style change is perhaps the biggest public makeover in years. Once she was a guitar-strumming folk girl. Now she's reinvented herself as the American Kylie Minogue with ""0304,"" a catchy but overpolished collection of dance-pop songs.
The more philosophical side of Jewel seems to linger in the slow-paced ""Stand"" (""It's a shame there's no one to blame/for all the pain that life brings...""). But that vanishes with the wispy ""Run 2 U"" and pale ""2 Find U,"" both colorless dance tunes. Some of the necessary verve and power reappears with the catchy ""Intuition,"" bouncy USA-themed song ""America,"" and shimmying ""Yes U Can."" A more gothic sensibility surfaces in the distorted, ominous ""Haunted.""
Nobody expects dance-pop to be deep -- all it has to be is catchy. And ""0304"" isn't deep. It's just a collection of mid-level dance music, with mediocre lyrics, acceptable vocals and packaged electronic pop music. We've seen it all before, but Jewel's offering isn't bad. Instead, it just fails to be really good.
When you hear Jewel's voice, you can tell that all the flaws have been scrupulously polished out. In past albums, her voice had minor imperfections. No more. It's not an exceptional voice, but neither is it bad; it's suited for the dance music she produces here, which isn' too taxing.  Musically, it can't be denied that ""0304"" is very catchy. Jewel flavors the dance-pop with hints of jazz (the accordion in ""Intuition"") and replaces her acoustic guitars with electric and bass. Okay, the acoustic guitars are still there, but good luck finding them.
Unfortunately the songs are essentially empty. Jewel has a good ear for rhythm and rhyme, but there's nothing really interesting about these songs. They're just ordinary dance-pop. (""If u want my love/u can try my love/u can't buy my love/just take my hand"") The only exceptions to this are ""Stand"" and the sinister, stalker theme song ""Haunted."" Ironically, these two are the best of this album.
""0304"" may prove to be a mixed blessing for Jewel. It's catchy and danceable but essentially empty. Only time will tell if the folkie-turned-popster's new sound will take."
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"So I approached Jewel's ""0304"" album with an open mind, knowing full well that the days of ""Who Will Save Your Soul"" are long behind us. It's not the out-right ""bad"" album that I had feared, but it's also not a ""classic"" by any stretch of the imagination.
""0304"" (14 tracks, 53 min.) starts of nicely with ""Stand"", with its light-beat dance rhythms. ""Run 2 U"" and ""Intuition"" follow along the same vein, and then it starts to set it: the songs all sound pretty much the same! Oh no! That's the trouble with an album that goes on WAY too long, it all starts sounding the same. Admittedly, there are a couple of outstanding tracks: the dramatic (and non-dance) ""Haunted"", and the name-dropping and culture-referencing ""America"".
Overall, this is an average, somewhat bland album. What surprises me is that in the liner notes, Jewel writes that this album is ""the first record I enjoy listening to"", which in a way is a put-down to all the fans that have loved her earlier albums. It makes me ache for the knock-out punch of ""Deep Water/What's Simple is True/Hands"", from the Spirit album: Jewel was never better."
,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"Firstly, I am a huge Jewel fan.  She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever.  At first, I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering.  The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general.  But let's not give up on Jewel so quickly.  I admit, I don't like the first single from 0304 ""Intuition"" because it is rather forgetful pop (and won't go down as a classic), but you cannot deny that it appealed to many younger people.  The second single ""Stand"" really appeals to me, on the other hand.  It is a very catchy song, and while it is not traditional Jewel, it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there. And at the end of the day, isn't that what is important about a singer?  To be able to re-invent themself from time to time?  Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it.  I consider ""0304"" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different.  She never said she wouldn't go back to her traditional style in the future.  Unfortunately at the moment, folk type music isn't that popular ... so that's another reason why Jewel is trying something different.  In 1978, the Rolling Stones released a disco single (Miss You) because that's what the public were really into then - even though rock was their normal style. Going with the flow, in other words. Times will change yet again, and folk music will be what the public want.  Cycles ...
""0304"" is Jewel in 2003.  It's not the classic of ""pieces of you"" or ""Spirit"", but it's not as vile as many reviewers have stated."
,B001237HCI,1,-1,1,"so i read the reviews on here, which i rarely trust anyways, and i decided to get the cd.  (even though i HATE intuition) Lyrically, this IS a bit like her previous albums.  They COMPLETELY butchured her voice though, and made most of it a Dance album...that's what REALLY pissed me off about this album.  Jewel was PERFECT the way she was. and she sounds WAY better on her previous albums, and live.  what was ORIGINAL about her was how u could hear her putting feel into her songs with her vocal capacity.  this all sounds the same and no vocal range at all.  PLEASE all you newcomer jewel fans, pick up one of her EARLIER albums and you will see why us REAL jewel fans hate this cd so much.  she's throwing away good talent, and good looks.  i liked her look before, now she just looks like a hooker.
but all in all let's pray that jewel went through a phase, and will go back to her original stuff on her next album.  She is still the same old Jewel in concert though, which is good. so maybe there's hope after all!"
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,2,"this cd is PURE garbage.  stand was an ok song, so i thought i'd download the album, even though i hate Intuition.  there are only about 3 or 4 cuts that are GOOD on this album. the rest sounds like the latest britney spears album!! URGH! i can't believe it!! WHY JEWEL WHY. even the songs that sound like her older stuff, her voice still sounds more computerish. maybe her next album will be better"
,B00123B3CI,1,1,5,Great
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,1,liked her better before she discovered the wonderful world of hip hop.
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"I admit I was among those that were struck as if by a lighting when I saw the video for ""Intuition"" a while back: ""She sold out!"" thoughts crossed my mind... ""I'm so dissapointed!"" I thought, until a friend told me I had to really listen to the album, so I just did.
Though I am not terribly in love with the whole album (it's sure more pop than most of her past efforts, and it has no shortage of 'catchy' tunes), the nonconventional lyrics are still there, at times, hiding disguised behind songs with teenage-like names, such as ""2 Find U"". The truth is that after the fact, the whole album makes you think twice as to her original purpose with ""Intuition"", the song/video that has stigmatized her so much.
But yes! As a whole, it's not tough to see that most of the songs are geared toward a more teenage audience, rather than the one that grew through College listening to her earlier work, but there's a few songs for those of us that are in the latter category, such as the very Alanis-like ""Haunted"" (in fact, it's such an appropriate song to play out loud on a Halloween night like tonight) and the clever ""America"". Falling somewhere in between the preferences of the two groups lies the closing track, ""Becoming"" which I particularly loved.
All in all, this is an album mostly geared to a teenage audience with a little ""classic"" Jewel to offer for her longtime followers."
,B001237HCI,1,-1,1,"It's not so much Jewel sold out but Jewel shows on this CD that she has aristically sold-out.  This is simply a dull, lukewarm collection of machine generated songs that offer no reason to listen to again.  Where's that edgy young artist who said Bukowski was one of her major influences?  Her and Liz Phair should start a support group for aging thirty-something female pop stars who think they should be Avril.(Oh, Jewel isn't that old?  She sure acts like it...)  I have to re-evaluate her old stuff.
  ""If I could tell the world just one thing...that you're okay....""
  I think Jewel proves on this CD the True depth of her previous stuff."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"jewel is back in better this cd rocks here is list of the songs

,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Jewel has definitely left the slow, dramatic congs behind. I am so glad she did. Her first album was pretty good but the song 'Hands' and the bundle of others, were going a bit too far. Jewel is now appealing to a market that will get her much more sales. If i didn't like Jewel, the colourful album cover would persuade me too. I love this album and i think it was a much needed change from Jewel. Follow ur intuition but also the money."
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,I really enjoy the total instrumental music of TSO.  Was quite happy with this purchase and likely to buy others.
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,My daugther love it music.  She listen it over and over again.  Sometime she make me play in the and put it repeat.  She and I listen to it when christmas and after christmas.
,B001232CDW,1,1,5,great
,B001232CDW,1,1,5,I enjoy this song more today than when it was popular in the 60's.
,B001232CDW,1,1,5,The Doors seemed to have a unique ability to take a very dark subject and make it uplifting.  Here they take our common experiences of alienation and create something very special that makes us feel better about ourselves.  What a great song.
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"This album is the best of 2003!, I've been a Jewel fan since ""Pieces of You"" and I'm not dissapointed by this album, sure is not typical Jewel, but True artist reinvent themselves, like the BEATLES, MADONNA and many more.  At the beginning I was a little worried that I was goin' to hate this, but NO, this is GOOD!, all the way, all the cuts, IS A mix of rock, new wave and pop!.  Great album buy it."
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,"Awesome, big guitar and drums sounds remind me of the 80's big-hair bands. Great song, great Orchestra!"
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,"A staple for Christmas, especially for those of us who get tired of ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" and ""Feliz Navidad"" being looped endlessly over the supermarket speakers.  :)"
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,Christmas music with a modern twist. Lively and energetic.

,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,Perfect...Fast Shipping...No issues
,B00123B3S2,1,1,4,"Jumpy little tune. Not one I am familiar with but Trans-Siberian, like all their music pour their soul into this song. I like it but it is not in the top of my list. Short, sporadic bars with specific instruments flow into longer bars with full orchestra. Interesting rendition: definitely not your typical Christmas music.

Recommended if you like New, Innovative and modern Christmas music. Not for the traditionalists."
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,"I love music, downloads great, nice song and have a lot of  other songs by this artist, am a music lover."
,B00123B3S2,1,1,4,"This song will be remembered by many as the background music for a fabulous Christmas home lighting show seen on You Tube.  Close your eyes and you can visualize the light show while you hear the music.  As it turns out, this is also a great exercise song.  Try walking, jogging & running in place while listening to this instrumental."
,B00123D2FE,1,1,5,Excellent!!!
,B00123D2FE,1,1,5,I love this song!
,B00123D2FE,1,1,5,Love this song! Makes me cry every time I hear it & that's a good thing!
,B00123D2FE,1,1,5,If I never heard this man singing this song I might never know how to voice the excitement that truly truly exists belonging to our holy Lord.
,B00123D2FE,1,1,5,"love it, very inspirational!  Great to listen to on any computer (Amazon Cloud player) or on my MP3 player in the car!"
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,Great song and sounds great. This song is upbeat and great to listen to. This makes me feel Christmas joy.
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,Just phenomenal in how you feel as you listen to this piece of music.. Just feel the energy from this work of music
,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Jewel is back with a new album and a new look and sound. That is the only differences between this Jewel and Jewel of the past. The introspective songwriting is still here, it's just backed with dance beats and a more polished sound that her folk/country stuff from previous albums. Yes Jewel has gone pop, but her music still has substance. Many accuse her of selling out, but she hasn't, this style of music isn't what is all over the place right now. The first single ""Intution"" is a piece of pop heaven, that has proven to be a big hit for her, and people seem to enjoy her new style. There's so many good songs that could be singles like ""Stand"", ""Run 2 U"", ""2 Find U"", ""Fragile Heart"", ""Haunted"", etc. This is a great album, give it a try and keep an open mind."
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,"I've always loved the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.  This is on my must-have list for music during the holidays.  I notice lots of people doing big holiday lights productions tend to use their more popular songs.  Being a Tampa Bay native, I can't help giving a nod to Jon Oliva for contributing to the existence of TSO."
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,I bought this to insure I was legal for a christmas display where this track was being used. Recording was excellent.
,B00123B3S2,1,1,5,This song was performed by our church instumentalist and was great wanted the song so i could hear all through really just anytime i want.
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"This is a very cool album. Jewel has been taking a lot of heat for it and I don't really see what all of the fuss is about. It's not really all that different from the direction she had seemed to be taking with ""This Way."" Remember ""Serve the Ego?"" Remember ""Standing Still?"" The tracks from ""0304"" aren't all that different. The production is just taken up a notch. Obviously Jewel has done something right because of the first single ""Intuition"" has become her biggest radio hit since ""Hands"" back in '98.
""Inuition"" is definitely one of the star tracks of the album. Jewel has taken her lyrics and put them to a great pop beat and sound. ""Run 2 U"" is a stand-out also and is very catchy. My personal favorite *at least as of now* is ""Fragile Heart."" It's a light-hearted ballad and would make a great single. This is the Jewel I love! *who couldn't love that whistle?* ""Leave the Lights On"" and ""Haunted"" are the most unique songs and have a love/hate style about them. If you liked ""Standing still"" from ""This Way"" then you'll probably like ""Doin' Fine."" ""Yes U Can"" is definitely another potential single. Like ""Intuition,"" it's a dance track *originally written for Santana* but I'm glad Jewel got to do it. This would be a great club single. ""2 Become 1"" is a love song similar to the title track from ""This Way."" It's a beautiful song as are all of Jewel's love songs. ""Yes U Can"" is another fun dance track. ""America"" is a more serious track with some ear-catching lyrics.
Don't knock Jewel for wanting to lighten up and experiment with her music. True fans would respect her for wanting to try different styles. And who cares about her image change? So she's wearing a dress...get over it! She's hot, let her have her fun. The music's great. As far as her comparisons to the newly reformed teen divas, Jewel's talent in all its aspects *vocals, lyrics, song-writing*  makes them look like Milli Vanilli wannabes. Well done Jewel!"
,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Overall this is a good album, not superb or great, but very good. INTUITION the single is excellent, and the remix CD Single is also recommended. Being at the top of the dance chart means the majority think the same way.
The other cuts such as ""Stand"" and ""America"" are also very good.
For those that think (or don't think at all), that this is a ""sudden"" change obviously have not heard 'Serve The Ego' or its remixes from about a year ago. Another dance chart topper, this album CONTINUES the trend that was already beginning on her last album. Check out the ""Serve The Ego"" mixes, those are excellent.
I love to hear people say ""she sold out"", ""she has changed"" and other assorted basic critical comments. Does that sound familiar? Remember the Bob Dylan as he went electric? The Beatles going Sgt Pepper? Sheena Easton doing ""Strut"". Are we saying Madonna did not change???Toni Braxton? The list goes on and on. Even Nsync changed! Those who refuse to change or cannot accept change are living in the past.
I can accept opinions of those who just don't like the music, that is fine, ok, and thats an example of how people have differing tastes, but just to say 'Sell out sell out"" to me  means  ""Grow...change..that is life"". The only acts and artists that sound the same always are at oldie shows. I applaud her willingness to try to stretch her considerable range and talent. Its still there and shows on this CD,
The album is good, has a few outstanding songs, 1 great song in ""Intuition"", and is a 3 to 4 star CD.  Its is not ""Hands"" or ""Pieces of You"" but is not supposed to be. I think its worth a listen, and the opinion of how good it is is yours. Do not be steered by people who do not like change. Treat it as a ""new"" sound and listen. Its your money, and the choice is yours. Like art, there is no ""absolute"" just opinions. Good Listening!"
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"Enough with the negative reviews on this cd. It's too different for the hardcore fans, etc., etc. It's too much like Christina Aguilera or Britany Spears, which is inaccurrate. You know, there was a time when a female artist could jump genres of music and receive accolades instead of dismissals. Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner, Cher, Madonna, Annie Lennox, Sinead O'Connor--all were able to shift gears musically, and to me that's a sign of talent, not selling out. Sure, Jewel is finely airbrushed on the cover, the titles are written like Prince tunes (U & Me= Love, Run 2 U, Yes U Can), and the songs are polished to fine pop bliss. I, for one, find this cd to be one of Jewel's finest. She forgoes all the pseudo-serious folk preaching and gets down to business with a cd filled with upbeat tracks instead of her serious ballads. However, she is still writing about serious topics such as social issues in ""Stand"" and ""America"" along with other familiar themes of love such as ""Run 2 U"", ""Fragile Heart"" and ""2 Become 1"". She also deals with letting go and trying new things such as the first single ""Intuition"", which probably flew over most Jewel fans' heads. She even deals with lust on ""Sweet Temptation"", ""U & Me= Love"" and ""Yes U Can"". In fact, there are a number of hits on this disc: ""Stand"", ""Run 2 U"", ""Intuition"", ""Leave The Lights On"", ""2 Find U"", ""Fragile Heart"", ""Sweet Temptation"", ""Yes U Can"", ""America"" & ""Becoming"". The only True miss is the overlong ""Haunted"", which seemed out of place. This new direction is great--a breath of fresh air for Jewel. She sounds like she's having fun and the music represents that spirit. Too many reviewers are taking this cd too seriously. This could be Jewel's ""Thriller"" or ""Hysteria"" or ""No Jacket Required"". If you're looking for intelligent pop (which Aguilera and Spears are not), then pick this up (also if you like the 80's)."
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,1,"Let me just get this out of the way: I was never really a fan of Jewel. I never went out and bought her albums. Still, though, I gave her credit for playing her own instrument and writing her own songs, and being individualistic (at least more so than most of what has been plaguing the radio since the mid-1990's).
BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE???
This really depresses me. And this is coming from someone who was never into Jewel in the first place. Has the music industry really come to this? Where a fairly original artist has to sacrifice all integrity and brains he/she ever had and make meaningless pop drivel just to sell RECORDS!?!?! Talk about a sad state of affairs. I hate to throw around the word ""sellout"", but...
SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT!
If you must hear this album, just download it and burn it. Yes, it is possible - we're living in the future, my friends! Remember, we, the consumers, speak with our money. Don't waste it on this, and perhaps, just perhaps, the record companies will wise up. (*scoff* yeah, like that will ever happen...)"
,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Jewel continues to exist in that very small sector of recording artists who manage to musically better themselves with each new release.  Dispensing with the folk/pop/country undertones that often distinguish her music, but still lyrically on the same page, 0304 finds the singer beckoning us to the dancefloor.  Granted, this isn't the out-and-out club record that some seem to be mistaking it for--it's not even nearly as cutting edge as the forward-thinking remixes of 'Serve The Ego' that she so effortlessly breezed through.  But, it is different enough from her previous work to seemingly brandish her a ""sell-out""(other
new members of this club include indie-goddess turned power popster Liz Phair, but that's for another review).  Which is too bad, because this is indeed Jewel's best album--in fact, it's probably the best album Madonna DIDN'T make(and boy, she REALLY didn't make it with that folk-styled drink coaster otherwise known as AMERICAN LIFE).  First single 'Intuition' hints at things to come throughout the set, with a helping hand from Shakira producer Lester Mendez.  'Stand', 'Fragile Heart' and the future club smash 'Run 2 U' all bounce along with enough addictive melodies to forgive the singer for her still overwrought lyrical approach.  And even if she falters somewhat by placing identical-sounding songs in slots ten through thirteen, it overall remains a more than solid musical treat."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"Jewel is back with ""0304"" her most successful album to date.  Debuting at No. 2 on Billboards Hot 200 Album Chart, and 4 weeks later still in the Top 20.  Is her highest charting album yet.
With her first single ""Intuition"" in the Top 30 of Billboards Hot 100 Singles chart- Jewel has made the right career move.
This album is much more upbeat then her predecessors with ""Run 2 U"" which I think should be the next single to the upbeat Debbie Gibson-ish pop ditty ""Doin' Fine"" to my favorite ""Yes U Can"".
There is still Jewel on this album - however with more beats and rhythm.  This actually shows off Jewels fabulous voice even better.
I can honestly see her as the next dance diva.  However this album is not all dance - but just a great pop confectioners treat.
Its still in my CD car player after 3 weeks which shows this is a good sign.  Not a bad song in the bunch, a thorough well produced pop album which shows Jewel can ""Sell yourself, Just Cash In"".
You Go Girl!...at least you admit it and cashing in with an excellent album at that."
,B00123D0HO,1,1,5,"It's obvious Rev. Brunson and TCS had an annointing and you will be blessed by their gifts. I love anything by Rev. Milton Brunson & his Tommies, but especially when Kim McFarland is leading. When she tells you that God has power to make you live right, that there is love, joy, and peace in His house, it'll either affirm what your soul already knows is True or make you want to run out and get you some o' dat.  I love that their lyrics are scripturally based. The Word is powerful. The Word set to music is pure heaven and this is paradise."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"After hearing Jewel on the radio, I thought I'd had enough.  ""Foolish Games"" was as close to this little darling I'd got...until ""0304"".  Don't be fooled...this is the album you've been dreaming of.  Jewel perfectly combines folk and pop, creating an album that makes you like a the hottest Queen on the planet.  I could take the time to point out each song...but really do I need to?  I finally see what all the fuss was about..Jewel made me feel like Miss America!  And what else is there to be?  No tell me that darling!  The sound of the record is pop...and what's wrong with that?!  Nothing...stop reading and buy."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"I was never a real Jewel fan, I only had Pieces Of You and I thought it was alright.  I liked her singles after that but never felt like buying her BORING cds.  This si a totally different Jewel.  Although many are critisizing her I love it.  Not a lot of anyhting in here.  There songs are more movable which is good.  Do people really want Jewel to keep making boring music and people to pretty much get sick of her.  As for all the critics... well this album debuted at #2 on Billboards album charts and is the highest position she has ever been.  Therefor she must be doing something good.  I honestly say that I love every song on this album and I never thought I would say that about Jewel.  Also her sound is very ""Shakira""  this time around which  is interesting in a way.  She is going more rock/dance and every artist changes their style with every album but her words and meaning in songs stay the say.  I congratualte Jewel on an album VERY well done."
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,1,"I loved ""Intuition"" when I heard it, and I'm not a big Jewel fan!  So, I was hoping for a welcome change from her normal folk music when I downloaded this.  Hate to say this, but this isn't really pop.  It's mostly folk with a rock edge.  Think Michelle Branch here with some Natalie Merchant and modern Madonna influences.  Really, ""Intuition"" is as pop as it gets and to me, it's really the only good song on this album!"
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"Alright so there are many Jewel Fans who are dissapointed with the Change of image and musical style that has been put out on Jewel sixth album 0304 ,  I however am not one of them .  I like the fact that Jewel has transformed into one of the modern pop divas.
 The songwriting is still the same, The fact that She has put beats into her music is a good thing.
 Standout tracks include Intuition , 2 become 1, America..
  Give this one a chance,...."
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,This is one of the great sounds at Christmas with Music. TSO is great. It spices up the Holiday. Wonderful download from Amazon.
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,"My second favorite song of TSO (Trans Siberian Orchestra).  It's TSO:  awesomeness.  You won't be disappointed!  I saw them in concert, too.  Blows your mind."
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,"I have come to really enjoy their music. The addition of Metallica (I was told it is they who provide guitars and drums) was a stroke of genius. They have a lot of different types of music, from the lullabye types, the secular Christmas songs, ""long-hair"" music (Lizst, et al) to Wizards in Winter. First time I heard this one was in an email some years ago that was going around where an electrical engineer wired his house's Christmas lights to follow a pattern in the music.  Remarkable.  But I know anyone who likes Christmas music can find something in their music to celebrate with."
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,"A medley of Tchaikovsky's music in the ""Nutcracker"" with some rock accent to it. I like the various stages of the song."
,B00123D0CE,-1,1,5,Gets ya rockin' at Christmas time
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,excellent
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,Perfect...Fast Shipping...No issues
,B00123D0CE,1,1,4,"Starts slow ... piano chords then pops in the Orchestra. This rhythm continues through 1:14 when tempo become jumpy, toe taping True to Trans-Siberian MO. Around 3:25 tapers off then back to rambunctious at 3:42. Again, this is not traditional Christmas music but sounds certainly to keep Spirits high during a season that tends to bring depression.

Recommended."
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,"For the most part, I hate Christmas music because it is so over played. The exception to this is the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. I bought this piece of music to go along with a Christmas slide show. The music quality is exceptional. I've received several complements on my music selection. I would highly recommend this song."
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,"It just gets you going and moving your hands like a maestro would.
It energizes you! You just want to get and do something energetic"
,B00123D0CE,1,1,5,Still a rocking Christmas song that you can play around the fellas and stay cool. A song the ladies can also appreciate being that it's a Christmas song. This for me never gets old.
,B00123D0CE,1,1,4,"I'm a fan of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra (Thank you, Jon Oliva!)  This is one more song I just had to add to my Christmas song collection."
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,2,"I've never been that Big on Jewel&sure didn't think She would ever try anything different so I was surprised when I Heard Her lead single off this set. Vocally She is still the same. I See She is Pulling a Leann Rhimes in that She is trying for that Pop Cross-Over Appeal after being on the scene for a good while now.but the Music here&vibe feels like it passed Her by. Her trying to do what Celine Dion is doing now with a Brittney or CHristina type of Sound&Vibe just ain't happening but I give Her Prop points for taking a chance.but, Usher style Album titles just ain't in the cards nor the Sound for Jewel in the Long haul."
,B001237HCI,-1,-1,2,"For some reason, all of Jewel's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews. I actually liked her first three albums, but I wish I could say the same for her latest album, 0304.
I have no idea what's going on with this album. It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying, because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club. Such tracks include ""Run 2 U"" and especially the leadoff single, the R&B-ish ""Intuition"". The music on these songs isn't bad, but it just doesn't sound like Jewel. If she's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once, it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example.
And when I listened to the rest of tracks on here, I noticed they don't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other, thus making you almost wonder if you're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album. ""Becoming"" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first: you or Jewel, and I don't know what possessed her to come up with ""Haunted"". ""2 Find U"" is okay, but I liked it better the first time I heard it, when it was called ""Standing Still"" (or the second time, when it was called ""This Way"").
Another problem here is the lyrics. Songs like ""Fragile Heart"" and especially ""U & Me = Love"" could have been rewritten a few times. I don't know how a party joint got on this album, but ""Yes U Can"" deserves some serious fast-forward button pushing. And can anyone make any sense out of ""Stand""?
I don't know what Jewel was trying to do here, because the album is 54 minutes of confusion. Even the album title is confusing, considering it came out on 0603. Maybe that's not what it means, but regardless, Jewel dropped a major brick with this album. Hopefully she'll realize this was a mistake and come back to Earth for her next album."
,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"I have to agree with the review title from another author, ""Jewel as you've never heard her""!  This is True!  I was extremely pleased with the light-hearted, yet quality material on this album.  While listening to the very nicely constructed melodies and lyrics, I found my top tapping and head bobbing.  This album compels you to move!  The strongest songs on the album are: U & Me = Love (strange title, but excellent), America, Becoming, Yes U Can, Sweet Temptation, Haunted and Intuition.  It seems she really wanted to ""cook"" on the last half of the album because those songs have the best musical content, lyrically and musically, in my opinion.
This is a definite buy!  Much, much better than her last album, but not quite the caliber of Spirit."
,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"So this is Jewel. I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago. Slowly but surely ""Intuition"" grew on me, it's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism. I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to encorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music, showing that it is possible. It's not a sell out either, since this music isn't popular like it was a few years ago. Not to say it's bad by any means. The best track for me is ""2 Find U"", a nice love song. ""Run 2 U"" is another favorite. ""Leave The Lights On"" has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado. ""Haunted"" is another great track here. ""2 Become 1"" is a great love song. The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow's second album, picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics, and including odd pop-culture references and name-dropping along the songs. This is still the same Jewel, just with dance beats. And it is her most enjoyable album yet. Overall fans might be taken aback but with an open mind, people will be sure to enjoy this CD."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"Move over Britney, now there's something meatier - and I mean that in a good, tasteful way!!!  This album is HOT, plain and simple.  I heard Jewel's new and unique ""Intuition"" on the radio today, and my ears are still trying to adapt!!  Was that really a hip-hop drumbeat I heard?  And is Jewel trying to go the way of Britney, totally cool, totally dance and TOTALLY pop?  Looks like it!!  And I, for one, am enthralled that Jewel is maturing and reaching out to be different.  Let's face it, people, this is a pop world, and to not be pop is to not be cool.  Like the Spice Girls and Madonna of a different age, Jewel is coming to grips with herself and her music through pop, and I, for one....oops, sorry - I just said that...
Well, as I mentioned before, it takes True courage to be yourself and try a different sound.  From what I've heard of this album so far, there's lots of trip-hop, lots of dance, and totally lots of fun POP!!  I'm glad Jewel is no longer an Alaskan hippie, and is instead a girl with a new attitude!!
You go, girl.....the days of your white van are loooong gone!!!!
SEE YA' LATER!!!!!"
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,"One of my favorites. Nicole knocks it out of the park, in my opinion, on this one."
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,What can I say this the Music I grew up on. Try it You'll Like
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,Top of the line. Why did she stop singing?
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,Great!!
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,Take a listen and you will love it too!!!!
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11I LOST MY SON ON 3/10/2013 AND ITS THE LORD AND SONGS LIKE THIS THAT PULL ME THRU!!!!!!!
,B00123EF3C,-1,-1,1,"never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-

had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!

close to $100 worth of music never received!!"
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,"What a beautiful voice! Could listen all day...I will be looking for more of her in the near future,
Thanks!"
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,This has always been one of my favorite songs and I really like the idea of being  able to listen to it when I would like.
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,"The original vetsion by artist who made it famous. Classic and counterpoint with great bg vocals. Background vocals are so good here, get inspiration for your own bg parts."
,B00123EF3C,1,1,5,"Nicole C. Mullen's ""Call On Jesus"" is a perfectly worded and uplifting song! ""When I call on Jesus all things are possible..."" The music and the lyrics are spot on, along with the beautiful voice of Nicole. If you've not heard this song in a while or at all give it a listen and you will love it."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"I was so excited when I finished this album! She is not a sell-out! I still would like her even if she was, but she is not, and I'm happy I can tell everybody that.
STAND is the ultimate Jewel song, very reminiscent of WHO WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL? from those early days. RUN 2 U is a really cool upbeat dance track. INTUITION is that cool top 30 hit you've heard lately. Read the lyrics. It's classic Jewel. (I love Ms. J's big butt is boss-who do you think this is about :) LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON is a cool jazz-infused song. Ooh so good and Jewel-like! 2 FIND U is a beautiful poetic ballad. A great new kind of song for Jewel, she sings a beautiful ballad like Celine would only she writes her own. FRAGILE HEART is another beautiful poetic ballad more Jewel-like in the vocal area. DOIN' FINE is a cool upbeat dance record that uses the guitar in a really odd that's different and very interesting. 2 BECOME 1 is an excellent song very beautiful even better done live acoustic but excellent on the album; almost a sequel to 2 FIND U. HAUNTED is easily the coolest song she's ever written. It's truly haunting. I feel like I'm stalking Jewel as I hear it and I feel bad for her, but I can't help myself. SWEET TEMPTATION is a really excellent track, more a rock 'n roll record than a dance record. YES U CAN is a cool upbeat rock record she originally wrote for Santana but he decided not to keep. I'm glad he didn't, her performance is great. Such a cool song! YOU & ME=LOVE is another cool upbeat song. The title is the theme of the song. AMERICA is a thought-provoking dance record about what we do in America, whether it be good things or bad things. She mentions plenty of both, and quite skillfully. BECOMING is a great ballad about Jewel becoming, as she constantly becoming other things. She is young, and she is still a work in progress, and she intends to keep acknowledging that truth.
This is definitely her second best album to PIECES OF YOU. It is better than THIS WAY and SPIRIT only by a little but nevertheless if you get an album better than those two albums that's really saying something. Folks, Jewel is hear to stay, and so is the ever-present guitar on this album. She is blossoming and you can see it in this CD, and she still has her guitar at her side as she's blossoming. It's beautiful to see her blossoming! Get your copy of 0304 and experience the beauty of this CD and a glimpse at a special artist ever-evolving!"
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"Nicole C. Mullen has a brilliant voice. She sings with so much emotion, she makes you actually feel the words to her songs. She is amazing. This song is so masterfully sung. Nicole C. Muller is one fast rising star."
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,Great
,B00123F8Y2,-1,1,5,I purchased this for our dance team
,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"There's gonna be some mighty fierce debating going on about this album! The most important thing is to keep an open mind. Indeed, Jewel has traded in her acoustic guitar for a new dance floor sound. Indeed, she looks like an 80's Cyndi Lauper on the cd cover. Yet, the biggest thing Jewel has NOT done is sell out. She may look and sound different, but Jewel has remained True to her heart. She has proven that one doesn't need an acoustic guitar to make meaningful music. At the same time, she proves that rhythmic music can be very meaningful as well. Anyone who has listened to the lyrics of 'Intuition' carefully has already figured this out. Jewel is mocking commercialism and materialism! Or, making political and societal statements (if you will). Is this really so different from what she has done in the past? The 'Intuition' video is the biggest mockery of all! The video displays Jewel: The Actress. The songs 'U & Me = Love' and '2 Become 1' follow, lyrically, in the tradition of Jewel's 1996 mega hit 'You were meant for me.' 'America' is yet another song where Jewel discusses the many aspects of American society and makes poilitcal statements. Gosh, this sounds like the same girl to me! Although, despite keeping her lyrics True to heart, the dance beats heard throughout make this cd Jewel's most fun project to date. Heck, it's dance music! Meaningful lyrics or not, it's still fun to listen to! Be sure to listen to the lyrics of each song carefully. You'll discover that Jewel has not, in any way, created fluffy, mindless pop (which some people are accussing her of doing). It's rare to find dance music with a purpose beyond just making people feel energized and relaxed. This album proves that the very essence of Jewel will never change (even though the music has)."
,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"This is a pleasant departure from her folk rooted sound. Her fans will be surprised. The combo of songs on this compilation will re-introduce the delicate vocal sound of JEWEL to a new target audience. All the compositions from 0304 are lyrically intelligent as all of her prior work, yet the fresh approach in production (making her sound at times like a reincarnation of WILSON PHILLIPS) will surely place JEWEL back on the top 40 charts. ""Leave the Lights On"" emerges as a song that could become a huge TOP 40 summer hit."
,B00123FAM2,1,1,5,Wonderful song. Purchased it to play in my daughters wedding and it was the perfect song! They really loved it.
,B00123FAM2,1,1,5,I love music so I buy as much as I can afford as often as I can afford it. There ya go.

,B00123FAL8,1,1,5,"Love that song!  Everything about it just resonates with me - and the performance is fantastic.  This was a great addition to my collection.

Of course, when you add ""I love how you love me"", it really can create a mood.

Cheers,"
,B00123FAM2,1,1,4,"This song is a bit old fashioned, but it hits just the right cord between my boyfriend and I."
,B00123FAM2,1,1,5,Always have loved this song too.  Finally found the time to add it to my playlists!

,B00123FAM2,1,1,5,This is a great choice for a wedding song. It can be used for many different aspects of a wedding.
,B00123FAM2,1,1,5,Gave five stars and would have given more if available---love the guy and his music.  His voice his so smooth and easy to listen to---would recommend this song to everyone who loves a good love song.  Keep them coming Mr. Montgomery.  Love all your songs!!

,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,Great music
,B00123D088,1,1,5,excellent
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,This is a very upbeat song that is for the soul reason of praising our Lord and King and in my heart I felt it deserved a lot higher grade them this.
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"I cry from inspiration everytime I play this song. it goes right to my soul.
i recommend it to all."
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,I love this artist and I love her music she praises the Lord through all her music. Now I love to praise my Lord so I love this song.
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"What a beautiful voice! Could listen all day...I will be looking for more of her in the near future,
Thanks!"
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"He lives and yes, I know that he lives. Nicole's voice is awesome as she builds the right combination of praise and testimony."
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"Nicole C. Mullen is a brilliant lyricists! ""I know my Redeemer live... I talked with Him this morning..."" are just some of the lyrics from this song. When you are feeling down and out listen to this song and instantly you will feel the Lord's presence. The Lord is always with us, but while you are listening to the song you will not be able to help yourself. You'll get lost in the Spirit and feel His presence."
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,This is a love song to CHRIST and every time you hear it you can see HIM smile and hear the love for HIM in her voice...
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"This is probably one of my all-time favorite Easter songs. The words are so powerful. Buy it and, listen to the lyrics carefully. You will be praising the Lord our Redeemer who lives!"
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,This has good sound on my kindle plus a lot of great songs I really enjoy this would recommend it to anyone
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,Just a reminder that OUR REDEEMER still lives.  Very awe inspiring. Nicoles voice is beautiful and inspiring. Helps keep me on the right track!
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"Nicole Mullin is amazing, her music is great, I particularly LOVE this song.  Blessed me very much buying it, I listen to it most every day. thanks Nicole."
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,Just listened to it today while  on the elliptical &  repeated it twice  ..truly a great song of reflection  of his grace
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"Not sure how many people are into the gospel scene musically, but this song tends to strike a chord with most people of faith no matter what their musical preferences.  Moving and powerful, this tune is full of passion and love for the Redeemer."
,B00123F8Y2,1,1,5,"I saw Nicole at a Women of Faith conference and she can sing, and she sings with her heart so to have a song that I can listen to any time I want was just wonderful."
,B00123B5I0,1,1,5,"Nutini's best song. Had it on my iPod for years, now have it on my new Kindle Fire HD. Sounds great, too."
,B00123B5I0,1,1,5,"All the songs on this album sound so different! I liked this one, it has an ""up"" tempo and sounds the best to me."
,B00123BCKQ,1,1,5,love it
,B00123BCKQ,1,-1,3,I didn't mind this cd. Its got some mellow music and its not offensive...least I didn't hear anything offensive to me. His voice is different. I don't think I can think of anyone to compare him too. There's not anything on here that's going to get amazing air play on radio stations ...but I still think the cd has been worth a listen. I'm listening to it now and enjoying it.
,B00123BCKQ,1,1,5,"Very talented and versatile, and the love songs are so heartfelt.......wonderful!  Have both his CDs and anxiously await the new one that will be coming out soon! Some of the reviewers have commented that they didn't like that he mixed music genres, and they had preferred a particular style from him, but his versatility is one of the things that I admire.  I love all kinds of music, so to hear a wide selection, and all done so well --- WOW!  Some artists have the same ""sound"" on every song and every album, and some people have a preference for only one type of music.......for those people I'd say that perhaps they should just download the MP3 for the songs that fit their taste."
,B00123BCKQ,1,1,4,"Paolo Nutini is yet another person that I was introduced to as a VH1 You Oughta Know artist, and I was surprised to learn that a strong voice like that was coming from a guy that's only nineteen years old (well, he was when the album was recorded). Yes, I also didn't realize that this album, These Streets, was released over a year ago, but I'm glad I finally discovered it.

Most people are probably only familiar with ""New Shoes"", but there are plenty of other highlights as well, like ""Last Request"" and the title track. There are also some good acoustic selections, whether it be piano (""Autumn"") or guitar (""White Lies""). And ""Jenny Don't Be Hasty"" has some pretty interesting lyrics.

Even though the second (acoustic) version of ""Last Request"" (the hidden track after the hidden track) is unnecessary, Paolo Nutini still has the skills, so you shouldn't mind taking a drive down these streets.

Anthony Rupert"
,B00123BCKQ,1,1,5,"I bought the CD because I loved the 1st hit, Last Request.  I listen to the whole CD almost every day because I love the whole thing from track 1. Jenny... to the 2 hidden tracks on the end.  Paolo has an original sound that is not overly polished in production. His vocal is a little raw, a little gut wrenching and adorable all at the same time.  The music has a strong back beat and after about 3 times through is pretty much stuck in your head.  Treat yourself to some Paolo."
,B00123BCKQ,1,1,5,"Paolo Nutini makes a huge splash with his debut album, These Streets. Paolo displays a natural talent for singing and songwriting; and his voice is rich and full of masculine warmth. Just one listen to this CD proves it!

The track set begins with ""Jenny Don't Be Hasty."" Paolo sings with the style of a seasoned pro; this number about a woman he wants makes a strong start for this album! The electric guitar, drums and percussion make a good musical arrangement. ""Last Request,"" another highlight of this fantastic album; lets Paolo sing with great sensitivity of how he wants one last time alone with a woman who doesn't love him anymore. The melody charms me with its beauty; and I predict that you will enjoy ""Last Request"" very, very much.

""These Streets,"" the title track of this album, begins with some pretty awesome guitar; and when Paolo comes in this number takes off like a jet! Paolo laments losing his childhood because in retrospect he realizes things were simpler for him back then. The guitar works wonders for this number; and the guitar alone with Paolo's voice makes ""These Streets"" a True masterpiece!

""White Lies"" has another beautiful arrangement for the guitar; and ""Loving You"" lets Paolo sing happily of finding his one True love. Paolo also shows off his wide vocal range, sometimes singing a few words in Falsetto--flawless!

The album ends with ""Alloway Grove."" This number starts with the drums and guitar; and when Paolo comes in he sings this perfectly! Paolo sings of his disappointment that the girl he loves is no longer there for him. The upbeat melody belies the sadness of the lyrics; but it all works well for Paolo and his musicians. The lengthy number works well.

The liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs except for some of the lyrics to ""Alloway Grove;"" and the artwork impresses me. We get some good shots of Paolo, too.

Paolo Nutini's first album sounds like a tour de force of a very seasoned talent--which is truly phenomenal since he's still rather young and this is only his first CD. I highly recommend this CD for fans of comparatively mellow rock and pop vocals.

Great job, Paolo!"
,B00123BCKQ,1,1,4,"I really, really dig the song ""New Shoes"".  I generally am very hesitant to buy anything from new artists, because the music business has sucked for so very long (and I was never a fan of the 90's grunge and/or alternative scenes), but I really dig this stuff.  The song New Shoes is wonderful.  Catchy, poppish, and original without any trace of self consciousness.  Will Paolo be the ""next big thing""?  Who really knows?  I just want to hear New Shoes again and again.  It is the best song on the album, but the others are pretty good too."
,B00123BCKQ,-1,-1,2,"While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R&B."
,B00123BCKQ,1,1,5,I've been listening to his album all day today and man I love it. Every single song on this album is good and that's rare! He's just great!
,B00123F94Q,-1,-1,3,Okay
,B00123F94Q,1,1,5,Love this song. Downloaded easy to my kindle.
,B00123F94Q,1,1,5,This was a favorite back in the day. I found it while shopping around for music and knew I had to download it. Great tune.
,B00123F94Q,1,1,5,"I purchased this track as an MP3 from Amazon.
This track seems to perform quite well on either the Amazon CloudPlayer or the Windows Media Player.
I would DEFINITELY recommend this track to any fan of Classic Rock Music!!!."
,B00123FJM8,-1,1,5,Watch Meytal's Drum Cover of this.
,B00123FJM8,1,1,5,Great workout music! Really keeps me going in the gym!
,B00123FJM8,1,1,5,Disturbed has always been one of my favorite bands and this song has always stuck in my head when I hear it on the radio and at hockey games so I had to buy it for my phone so I would always be able to listen to it wherever I am.
,B00123FJM8,-1,-1,3,"Liked most of song, until the ranting started. I just skip ahead."
,B00123FJM8,1,1,5,Been using Amazon to download my favorite songs for some time would not change and have had not problems as with other sites getting virus' or malware.
,B00123EIGQ,1,1,5,My Mother sang this to me as a child and I now sing it to my children. I love that I could find it as an MP3 so I can play it for my kids!
,B00123B47C,1,1,5,"I wish all Christmas songs were like this, or there were more rock versions like this one.  I love the vocals also.  So awesome, it makes me want to  decorate a tree and head bang in the same time.  It's Glorious!!"
,B00123B47C,1,1,5,What a lovely song that just reeks of the joy of Christmas!  It's the type of song that you can and want to hear over and over again. A  beautiful song full of gorgeous music and joyful voices that make the Holidays  a happy time of the year. If your away from home it makes you want to be with your loved ones and if you are at home it makes you glad you are with the ones you love. Christmas Canon Rock  makes Christmas even more special for everyone as it wakes up the love for our most cherished ones and our Lord Jesus Christ.
,B00123B47C,1,1,5,TSO is awesome.. What more can I say... If you have a range in music you will love this band..
,B00123B47C,1,1,5,Awesome. Loved it. Listening to this song was a wonderful way to celebrate the winter season and the holidays this past year. What a way to rock out to Christmas!
,B00123B47C,1,1,5,"we were married December 20th and I didn't want the same old wedding march, so the pianist played this song, pachelbel's Canon in D.  the fact that this became a staple christmas song as the christmas canon is even better for anniversaries."
,B00123B47C,1,1,5,"Great music, I had been trying to catch the title for years.  Finally I was able to catch the title and then began searching the net.  Thank WAYR (Way Radio) Brunswick, GA"
,B00123B47C,-1,-1,3,"Great Christmas music done in the rock opera style.
The Mp3 version seems to be off in the high notes and really compressed (congested?).
Am waiting for the CD to get here to compare.
I've heard that some of their past recording mastering isn't the best, we'll see..."
,B00123FTSC,1,1,5,"When I was young I sang this song in Choir, I loved it so much but disliked that it was only sang at Easter time. 2nd chapter Of Acts really brings this song to life. I loved 2nd chapter Of Acts music and I am happy to beable to listen to their music once again."
,B00123FTSC,1,1,5,This is a group that I have purchased several albums of their music.  They do a great job on hymns.
,B00123FTSC,1,1,5,I first heard this song about 25 years ago and loved it then so I thought it would be a good one to add to my Kindle Fire music.  It's still a good song and is not just for Easter but anytime.
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,"Although this is an older song by Randy Travis,, it still brings tears to my eyes.  it is very moving and I would highly recommend it."
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,This is a song with a story and a lesson behind it. There is heart and soul held within it's lyrics. I am always a sucker in a way for sad but meaningful songs.
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,"I really like this song.  It tells a really good story and delivers a message within that story.  I like that it unfolds the story slowly, through the song.  It keeps me listening from beginning to end.  Of course, you have to like country music to like this song, probably."
,B00123FKKY,1,1,4,This piece was a part of a holiday sampler that I got and I like it.
,B00123FKKY,1,1,5,"I would add this light, upbeat version to play along side Johnny Mathis, Andy Williams and similar classic Christmas music, although this is a little more modern version.  The voices are very ""soft"" and perform in a gentle harmony.  Contrast that with other versions that may have richer or bolder harmony; this, however, stands well on its own merits.  There are some jazzy riffs here and there, some soft, jazzy hi hat/drum rhythm in the background.  I don't think any one voice stands out on this piece, but together they work very well. Not quite the Lennon Sisters (if you know who they are), but along the same vein.  Personally, I enjoyed this piece and am pleased to add it to my Christmas music collection.

If Lawrence Welk was alive today and continuing his show, I think you would hear this group performing this piece on his show. (Not an insult, just an observation of how easily this piece could fit into that genre as well as a jazz or other similar genre.)"
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,It's a beautiful song by Randy Travis.
,B00123FT50,1,1,4,"Love his voice and the storytelling theme in his music. God is all
over this one. Thank You Randy Travis"
,B00123FT50,1,1,4,Thank you
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,this song is great
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,"One of my favorites.  Randy Travis is his usual, which is great."
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,"Love the mp3 option, downloads automatically to your Amazon Cloud!"
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,Good Christian Song
,B00123FSQ0,1,1,5,Easy listening music.  I like easy listening music .  When I just want to relax and just chill at home.
,B00123FSQ0,1,1,5,"This is such a BEAUTIFUL LOVE BALLAD. The combination of Patti Austin & James Ingram, it couldn't b anything but a hit. If u r a stepper or if u want 2 slow dance w/that special person n your arms, this is definitely the song 4 u. It's an oldie but most definitely a goodie. It's timeless. It will bring back good memories. "
,B00123FSQ0,1,1,5,This is a song that every person can understand. It describes how a person feels when they realize they are in love. Great romantic song... I love this one. I would recommend it to anyone.
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,"Reminds me of a road that I traveled off and on for 40 years.  Past Laurinberg there were two memorible symbols, 1 was 3 metal crosses without a sign to denote the reason they were there and the other was a bill-boad of a beautiful missing girl.  The crosses were well maintained , while the bill-boad weathered wth time.  I stopped many times to learn the stories, but to no avail.  I like to think that Randy Travis has given me 1/2 the answer and I will always wonder about the bill-board.  Half of the story really does help, and Randy Travis does it best, my prayers are with him."
,B00123FT50,-1,1,4,I'm not to fond of Randy Travis's voice and have to put up with his nasal drawl to listen to the few songs he sings that I like.
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,"Randy Travis always has a good song for your mood, and sometimes one to make you think.  Glad to have it in my collection!"
,B00123FT50,1,1,5,This is one of those songs that sticks with you and makes a strong statement.  It is truly a country classic with God and twang mixed in.  Listen to it a couple of times and you won't forget it.
,B00123FXXS,1,1,4,"another one of those back in the day songs
good beat for dancing  nice melody"
,B00123FXXS,1,1,5,This song takes me back to high school.  Love this song and the memories.
,B00123FXXS,1,1,4,"Good music as usually. Heard it on radio and quickly purchased from Amazon. Great song that most would enjoy don't know why they charged so much for this song since its almost 30 years old however, worth every cent."
,B00123FXXS,1,1,5,"This is another great song from the disco era of the '70s. Besides some of Donna Summer's songs and, of course, Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive,"" this song by Candi still sounds great and has withstood the test of time. A great song!"
,B00123FXXS,1,1,5,"This song is awesome brings back wonderful memories of my younger days, 70's 80's 90's were the best years for music."
,B001237CUK,1,1,4,Love this song! It brings back memories to the first time I ever heard and I still love it just as much.
,B001237CUK,1,1,5,"This song puts into words the tragic, yet beautiful story of the walk Jesus took to Calvary.  Sandy's smooth and calming voice brings to life the epic story of Jesus' crucifiction."
,B00123FKUE,1,1,5,This is a beautiful song with words that have such True meaning. If we sang this song all day in our heads and chose Jesus for each situation our lives would be more fulfild and blessed than we could ever imagine. Fernando does a wonderful job with this song and once you hear it you will want copy of it.
,B00123FKUE,1,1,5,"Old hymn, made new and beautiful."
,B00123FPO0,1,1,5,"Played this at our wedding.  So happy it is the original and by the real group from that time in our history. An anniversary gift. for both of us.  Plays so clearly.  Should have gotten the album, for a better deal"
,B00123FMKM,-1,1,5,
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,Listening to this  will take you back in time.
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,"I like the Isley  brothers version, but remember this is the original."

,B00123FRMA,-1,-1,3,"As I have mentioned in my other reviews for songs from this era, these are listenable but not that memorable."
,B00123FRMA,1,1,5,i love candle box esp this song. i had no problems purchasing it and it sounds great. i love rocking out to it
,B00123FXLK,1,1,5,"The version of ""Strange Way"" isn't the irritating edit found on ""The Best Of Firefall"" but the album version which should never be edited ever!! The overall master is as good as if not better than Rhino's hits package and if you think you gan get this song at iTunes think twice."
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,Grest oldie
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,Another classic
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,"From my early teen years, this soft rock song has the energy to transport you back to a simpler time.  I love this song.  A must have for anyone who loves 70's music."
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,Awesome song!
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,"Not much to say about it other than I like it.  A good ""sing along"" song."

,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,The very first note makes me smile. By the end of the first chorus I'm bound to be in a better mood.
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,this is a cool song to listen to on lazy summer afternoons I think it's really cool and I love it anyone who loves his 70's will love this song
,B00123FMKM,1,1,4,Rock the way it was meant to be. Don't even make music like this anymore. Great time to be alive.
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,Forgot how great this song makes me feel. Wonderful words that describe coming home from work and shes waiting there not a care in the world!
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,"As a seventies hippie, I was glad to hear this song again after years. It brings back memories and sets a special mood."
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,"This song make an excellent collection to my mp3 collection.
Highly recomended for any music lover that loves music from before the 2000s"
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,"I know that most people may prefer The Isleys version of this, which is alright. But, for purity of song and tone, this version wins hands down. This is coming from a non fan of the group, at that! But, I can't help but love this song, because, quite frankly, it's so well done."
,B00123FMKM,1,1,5,"I always enjoyed this song, although I wouldn't consider it rock, more a gentle pop type song.  The harmonies are quite pleasant, and the intent seems nostalgic."
,B00123FXLK,1,1,5,A Great Recording And At A Good Price!
,B00123FXLK,1,1,5,Awesome!
,B00123FXLK,1,1,5,One of my favorite bands. Folk rock at its best.

,B00123FXLK,1,1,5,"I enjoying listening to this song. Now, I will enjoy it more in my own library. I own it, so thank you amazon for allowing me to purchase and download the album into my library."
,B00123FZ0O,1,1,5,"I know the men in the group had other jobs, but it was a wonderful collaboration of talented men. I wish there was more music from them. The song describes how you can be in love and the effects of that is shown on your face."
,B00123G210,1,1,4,"came quickly, item as described"
,B00123G210,1,1,5,"No review, thanks"

,B00123G210,1,1,5,One of my all time favorite rock and roll tunes. Back in the day al the ladies liked it when I put it on the turntable.
,B00123HF5M,1,1,5,"yes our gal from Detroit, with the new English accent go figure

Love the Madonna of the 80's

,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,excellent cd
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,.Good deal and quick delivery.
,B00123FVMQ,1,-1,3,"Heard this song as a kid, but didn't really like it until hearing it in Pulp Fiction. This is the song that got me to get sound track. Definitely I song to have on your playlist."
,B00123FVMQ,1,1,4,Decided to watch a Sinbad comedy program and heard the song on it.  Just had to have it as I had forgotten what the name was of the song.  Just a cute little number to enjoy on a calming day.
,B00123FVMQ,1,1,5,Miss Dusty left us way too soon!  She sounded so fabulous singing this.  There are a few more on the album I may get as well.
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,Thank You
,B00123D00G,1,1,5,Love this 80's style song I kept hearing in the Kohl's commercial Spring 2015. It does make e move my feet.
,B00123D00G,1,1,5,"Between the tempo and Jr's voice, this song is an instant ""pick me up"" for me. As soon as I hear Sr. say ""Don't stop, don't stop the beat. I can't stop, won't stop the beat. GO!"" I get excited and a smile plasters itself on my face."
,B00123D00G,1,1,5,"Which is a good thing because if you listen to this song walking down the street with headphones, that's exactly what you'll do."
,B00123D00G,-1,1,5,"If you don't move your feet to this, please check your pulse. Bubble-gum yes, but man does it ever feel good. Don't let your kids see you dancing to it. You'll be a dork forever."
,B00123FVMQ,1,1,5,Great classic song.  Love Dusty Springfield!
,B00123FVMQ,1,1,5,Love the ability to sign on and get the exact song I am looking for at a price I can afford.
,B00123FVMQ,1,1,5,Great song!  Bought it for back ground music while I work.  Will be back for more songs soon!!! Enjoy the great music of this generation.
,B00123FVMQ,1,1,5,"Having already listened to the song, I knew I was going to like it going into the purchase.  But the audio quality was fantastic, no issues there."
,B00123G6YI,1,1,4,ITS GOOD
,B00123G152,1,1,5,I always enjoyed this song when I was younger.  I heard it again on an 'Oldies' station and wanted to buy it for my MP3 collection.  I really feel the need to be 'Back On The Road Again' when I listen to it...
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,awsome cd
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,This CD is one you will love listening to.  If you are a John Michael Montgomery fan you will definitely want to add this one to your collection.  We highly recommend it.
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,Started getting back to Country Music and rebuilding my 'lost' CD collection. This is a MUST HAVE for any True country music fan. If only for the song 'I Swear' (originally recorded by Boyz to Men). Montgomery's version is a must have for any lovers.
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,"I like this song, it is worth buying and spending the money on.  Instrumentals and the vocals are great.  Good lyrics."
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,This was my first exposure to John Michael Montgomery.  I loved all of the songs and this is a long play album.  My husband and I are hopeless romantics and this was a nice addition to our collection.
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,I got this for my dad for Christmas. He is going to love it! :) John Micael Montomery is such a tallented singer. Can't wait to see what he thinks!
,B00123G6YI,1,1,5,A good cd with heart. I enjoy the songs on it while driving to and from work. It's soothing and relaxing.
,B00123G6YI,1,-1,3,This Collection is OK but it is miss three songs. One of the VERY BEST song he ever did BEER AND BONES is not on here. The other two are COWBOY LOVE and I MISS YOU A LITTLE. They can be found on his GH.
,B00123G6YI,-1,1,4,"From his debut hit ""Life's A Dance"" in late 1992 through the rest of the '90s, John Michael Montgomery (with his easy going baritone) was one of country music's most reliable hitmakers.  Over the past four years, however, he's had but one top ten hit, the chart topping heart tugger ""The Little Girl.""  With his recent singles struggling, a hits collection was the logical choice for Montgomery's next release.  A sequel to 1997's GREATEST HITS made the most sense, as Montgomery has ten top 20 hits not included on that first set.  Instead, Warner Brothers went with this career encompassing VERY BEST OF that contains 11 of the 14 recordings already found on the strong selling GREATEST HITS.
Among the hits not included on either collection are the engaging ""Ain't Got Nothin' On Us,"" ""Love Working On You,"" and ""Hello L.O.V.E.""  All are uptempo romps that would have contributed nicely to the ballad-heavy VERY BEST OF.  The sequencing on VERY BEST OF distorts the musical nonbalance even more, with three fast tunes leading off, followed by a slew of slow stuff.  The collection concludes with two new ballads: the paternal reflection ""Cool"" and the pledge of devotion ""One Day Less.""  While pleasant, neither track seems likely to reverse Montgomery's recent chart struggles.  Ultimately, while it contains more tracks and covers a longer period of Montgomery's recording career, this VERY BEST OF is not as enjoyable to listen to as his earlier GREATEST HITS."
,B00123G6YI,1,1,4,"The son of a Kentucky musician whose own Nashville dreams never came True, John Michael Montgomery kept a bit of his daddy's hometown grit, even as he put together an impressive string of Nashville-produced hit albums and singles. This generous compilation offers twenty tracks, and collects nearly every significant hit single that Montgomery's had in his twelve year recording career.

Montgomery's first hits, the ballads ""Life's a Dance"" and ""I Love the Way You Love Me,"" had a middle-of-the-road sweetness that hit an emotional chord with both record buyers and award givers -- the second single was the ACM song-of-the-year for 1993. The love songs continued in 1994 with, ""I Swear,"" as did the awards (ACM song-of-the-year and single-of-the-year). As with most of Montgomery's ballads, the country flavor is to be found almost entirely in his vocals. There's a hint of steel, but the drums-guitars-bass-keyboard backing could just as easily host a pop vocalist (in fact, the song was covered by the R&B group All-4-One and netted a grammy). It's the slight edge in Montgomery's voice, the phrasings, and the down-home sentimentality of the lyrics that brings his slow songs into the country arena.

Later in 1994 his singles began to capitalize on Montgomery's uptempo numbers, charting with the rowdy country-rocker ""Be My Baby Tonight"" and the mid-tempo ""If You've Got Love."" Both tracks kick up the twangy guitars and fiddle of a honky-tonk bred backing. His releases continued mix ballads and up-tempo tunes, including the lightning-quick auctioneer's cadence of ""Sold (The Grundy Country Auction Incident)"" and the contemplation of his father's death, ""I Miss You a Little."" The latter, unfortunately, is missing from this collection.

By 1996 Montgomery was mostly charting ballads, variously edging more towards the center and bringing a bigger dose of his country sound down-tempo. ""Angel in My Eyes"" is more contemporary pop than country, but 1998's ""Cover You in Kisses"" has a superb melody anchored by a strong underline of steel and fiddle. Montgomery's last #1 single, 2000's ""The Little Girl"" features Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski on harmony vocals.

In addition to seven #1s (seventeen top-5s!), this collection adds ""'Til Nothing Comes Between Us"" from the ""Pictures"" album, and a pair of newly recorded tracks: the waltz-time generation gap tale ""Cool,"" and the romantic ""One Less Day."" This is a terrific overview and introduction to Montgomery's hitmaking career. Though it's missing the top-5 ""Cowboy Love"" and top-10 ""I Miss You a Little,"" it's probably the more complete pick over his 1997 ""Greatest Hits"" LP."
,B00123FYLE,-1,1,5,"... I just wanted to download this to see if I could still download and add songs for ""no fee"" to however, i was charged the $1.29 for this song. After that, I originated a request about fees on music and my response e-mail began as such ""Amazon MP3 purchases are stored for free in Cloud Player and do not count against storage limits."" Keep in mind, the first 22 most at $1.29 songs I added, were for some reason at no charge, and Ironically that was all done the same day of the $4 credit they give you.
Now, after thoroughly reading the ""remainder"" of my assistance e-mail, it was explained later that was in fact only if I were a ""Cloud Player Premium"" member, there was no extra fee. Which as we all know require you to pay a monthly fee. Of course, another way to collect our money. No big deal, as I'm not going bankrupt over $1.29. Looks like You Tube is still the way to listen to your favorite music. No problem, just thought it was kinda funny. Great song though."
,B00123FYLE,-1,1,5,"Here is yet another husband introduction.  I vaguely remembered it, but The Cure were still pretty new back then and it didn't stick with me."
,B00123FYLE,1,1,5,"comes off pure and just as great sound quality as from any other recording, have it on a cd, just easier to have it available to listen to anywhere"
,B00123FP86,1,1,5,Great song.
,B00123FP86,1,1,5,Enjoyed it
,B00123FP86,1,1,4,Still popular today.
,B00123FP86,1,1,4,Wonderful
,B00123FP86,1,1,4,"to me this is a great song, by a great band of musical artists. it has a great feeling to it musically, the words are not just words but thought inspiring, and the arrangement is so creative. These guys were genius."
,B00123FP86,1,1,5,"I personally have met this group in the late seventies. David Gates and most of the members are from my wife's home town, Tulsa, OK. They are in indeed one of the greatest singer/song writer bands in history. The Best of Bread is a milestone album. Although they never have received the recognition they deserve, they if any band should definitely be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They along with other bands like Spirit and Quicksilver Messenger and Ambrosia contributed music forty years ago that sounds as good today as it did then.  Since I have other bread songs to review, i will capsulate my reviews with this one song. Great Band, great and memorable music, great music theory, and they always strike a cord with any generation."
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,BREAD WAS ONE OF THE BEST GROUPS THAT EVER WAS.
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,"Besides this being a great song already, it was especially moving during my husband's funeral.  ""I would give everything I own just to have you back again.""  Classic 70's song!"
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,I love this band and their music
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,Great song.
,B00123HUE8,1,1,4,Back in the day classic.
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,Enjoyed it
,B00123HTGM,1,1,5,"It's simple, elegant, True, and timeless. Richard Smallwood has always been a gem of True worship and praise gospel music. I love the lyrics (You are my music. You are my song)."
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,Love this album
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,"Music is music, and it's a personal taste as to what songs and genre one prefers.  This is just my kind of music that is unavailable in local stores."
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,Great price for quality music! Would be willing to and will continue to make music download purchases from this store. Thanks.
,B00123HUE8,1,1,5,"Download was instant and price pretty darn good, this is a terrific songs for those 70's memories. Thanks so much"
,B00123HTGM,1,1,5,Excellent song and very spirited.
,B00123HTGM,1,1,5,Great Gospel Music
,B00123HTGM,1,1,5,Great music
,B00123HTGM,1,1,5,"This song really needs no review.
it's  words from the heart and soul of us who have Jesus to be a part of our lives."
,B00123HWN2,-1,1,4,I remember listening to this song while travelling in the car. I grew up in the 80's 90's and 2000's so this R&B song reminds me of those times.
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,some one stole my copy and had to get another to complete my collection
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,Love this album
,B00123G5ZI,-1,-1,3,"Not going to lie. I'm a big Cher fan, but this album could have been much better. Aside from a few songs, this album is crap. The 3 stars are for the worth while songs found on here."
,B00123G5ZI,-1,1,4,"This music is good but not as catchy as her other ""CD""'s. Some of the tracks sound similar. I would recommend this CD but this one is not as good as others."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Thanks for having this available to buy.  I had forgotten how much I really loved hearing the songs on this album.  Thanks, again!!!"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"While the album ""Believe"" had a #1 hit that deserved to be so, it wasn't as good as her most recent album ""Living Proof.""  I like all the songs and I like the general feel of the album.  There are so many good songs like ""Rain, Rain"", ""When You Walk Away"", ""Love One Another"" and ""When The Money's Gone.""  She may have worked with the same producers as she did with the ""believe"" album but this one's so much better.  It could be possible that it's her best album period.  I like Cher so much and I hope she releases another album soon. It's been too long since this one!"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Cher's follow-up release to her blockbuster album ""Believe"" was ""Living Proof.""  It is another album in the dance/club music vein, though it is a darker and much more cynical collection than ""Believe.""  Cher pulls it off beautifully though.

Right before this album came out, 9/11 happened.  Cher dedicates the tribute song ""A Song For the Lonely"" to the ""Courageous People of New York"" who endured through the horrible event. When I last saw her in concert (Farewell Tour, 2005, Glendale AZ) and this video was shown in the ampitheater, I was struck by the WTC symbolism and how moving the song was.  This CD has a link to the video and it is definitely worth watching.

I think ""Believe"" was a much-more commercially viable disc than ""Living Proof,"" though I think that ""Living Proof"" is a more powerful recording. It also took me a few listenings for me to really start to like it.  It's packed with great songs.  I always thought that Diane Warren's ""Body to Body, Heart to Heart"" should have been released as a single.

The record company antics of releasing different versions of the disc in the U.S. and Europe are a bit tiresome: the European versions contained additional songs and short-changed U.S. fans.  The same company did the same thing with the ""It's A Man's World"" disc in the mid-90s.  It's all about the bucks, I know, but enough is enough."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"This is one of those albums, which i bought back in 2001 that still has no dust settling on it as it still gets played alot. A very energetic buzz that will send you into a great mood and have you dancing around like at your local nightclub after a few! unfortunately the success of this album was poor as it came out in the uk at the strong christmas rush in 2001 and no promotion was made due to cher touring. The single released in the uk was ""the music's no good without you"" which charted at no. 8. The best song on the album which was released in the states was ""a song for the lonely"". In the uk a date was given for its release but alas was scrapped due to no promotion! however a brilliant cd, better than ""believe"", if only these songs were on the ""believe"" album then it would have been an even more worldwide classic."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"In late 2001, Cher had released, yet, another album. No, this one is not a compilation; it is a studio recorded album. No, you did not read this statement wrong. This album is, indeed, another studio recorded album for Cher. The album is entitled, LIVING PROOF, and is her best album since that of  1998's BELIEVE. The album is jam packed with great songs, including four hit singles that were released. Read on to find out more.

SONG FOR THE LONELY

  The first single from the album. When I first heard this song, I was really amazed. I could not believe how incredible this song was. The lyrics are so strong and motivating, as Cher's voice is strong and powerful. I strongly recommend that you all listen to this song first because 1) It is the first song on the album, and 2) Cher has dedicated this song to, and I quote from her album thanks, ""...The courageous people of New York, Mayor Gulianni, Governor Pataki, and my friend Liz...""

A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG

  The third single from the album. This is a song that would be most popular on the dance floors at clubs and other get-together parties. This is definitely a kick-a** tune.

ALIVE AGAIN

  The fourth & final single from the album. Awesome tune.

THE MUSIC'S NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU

  The second single from the album. ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"" is not the only song that should be played in clubs; this song would also fit into that of clubs, where people can immediately get their groove on. This song has an edgier groove for anyone who wants to shake their a** on the dance floor.

RAIN, RAIN

  Not bad.

REAL LOVE

  Not bad.

LOVE SO HIGH

  Incredible

BODY TO BODY, HEART TO HEART

  Diane Warren has written so many songs for so many solo artists since I can remember. She has written such songs as, ""Who Will You Run To"" for Heart, ""Love Can Move Mountains"" for Celine Dion, & ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" for Cher. This was another one of Diane Warren's songs and Cher was happy enough to grace Diane's lyrics with her music and voice.

LOVE IS A LONELY PLACE WITHOUT YOU

  Great.

LOVE ONE ANOTHER

  Back in 2000, when Amber released her self-titled album, she had originally recorded this song. Cher took the courage to cover the song. The song is amazing in every way and I think Amber would be most proud of this version, even though her version kicked a** as well. If you listen to both versions, you'll notice that Cher had re-written the second verse for her version, as well as re-writing the last two lines of the song's bridge.

WHEN YOU WALK AWAY

  Not bad.

WHEN THE MONEY'S GONE

  Not bad.

  This is an album that I have enjoyed from start to finish and I do encourage each and everyone of you, who have not yet heard this album, to buy it and listen to it. I guarantee you all that you will enjoy every song on this album from start to finish. If you do not like it, than I've done my part, while receiving the wrong response."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Cher's last Long Play effort would be consider her most danceable to date.  Every track on this album is upbeat, so if you're looking for ballads forget about it.  The success of ""Believe"" directed this album to this music style.  To start things up the leading US single ""Song For The Lonely"" is an anthem dedicated to the people of NYC or anyone who ever felt lonely, the lyrcis on this song are really strong, but, the strong resemblence to ""Believe"" make this song sound a little bit dated.  The second single in the US ""A Different Kind Of LOve Song"" is another strong lyric song, with great definition, and more innovative beats than the first, one of the best tracks of the album.  ""Alive Again"" tranceable, cheesy lyrics, but understandable, the second single overseas, not a great result.  ""The Music's Not Good Without You"" this is the first single overseas, has an old feeling to it, dedicated secretly to Sonny, great deep lyrics, sad sounding, melancolic, great results, ""Rain Rain"", the more midtempo of the album, great feelin' put in this, ""Real Love"" the distortion of Cher's voice is overused here, not bad, but not great. ""Love So High"" filler, but it's listeneable, ""Body To Body, Heart..."" similar to Dove D LAmore, so you can tell, ""Love One Another"" cover of Amber's original song, this album do have strong message, and great beat, could easily be taken into your mind. ""When The Money's Gone"" well, last single release, great dance tune, but the message is a little anoying.  In conclution, this album is danceable, will make you stomp your feet, but, don't expect, some songs to deliver the full Cher we are used too, although the songs here were not promoted well, this album is one of Cher most easy to listen to."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"This album was released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. The main difference is the US version has a track called ""When You Walk Away"", and the UK/Canadian printings have a great song called ""You Take It All"" instead of ""When You Walk Away"", and vice versa for the US. LIVING PROOF is a great album that builds on the strength of BELIEVE, however this album never really lived to its potential, it didn't catch on as much as BELIEVE did to listeners. ""Song For The Lonely"" was a song that really resonated with a lot of people, with it's universal theme. In fact, a lot of the songs were like the ones on BELIEVE, with a message of strength and survival through life's difficult stages. As a whole, this album is better than BELIEVE. The only tracks I could have done without is the R&B tinged ""Rain Rain"" and the Diane Warren latin infused ""Body To Body, Heart To Heart"". The rest of the album is just great. I actually like Cher's version of Amber's ""Love One Another"", more than Amber's version. ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"" is like an epic ballad dance song, should have been a single. ""Real Love"" is a really funky Daft Punk sounding song, very european. ""Alive Again"" and ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"" are other highlights, with great positive messages. Other highlights include ""You Take It All"" (one of the best on the album) and ""When The Money's Gone"". Overall a really strong album from Cher! Can't wait to see what she does next."
,B00123G5ZI,-1,1,5,"shes living proof that she rocks this cd is so good is something new much better songs love/dance/songs in songs about money?
but still if ur a real music person u gots to buy this one"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Wow this Cd is Fabulous , I love the songs love the grace Cher put into this CD as well as others. Buy this Cd you will enjoy.
Thanks"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Cher's newest offering is 2001's LIVING PROOF, this is the version that was released in the UK before the US got a copy. The UK version features ""You Take It All"", which in my opinion, is the best track of the album. Instead the US version has ""When You Walk Away"", which is not available on this UK version. Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength, like ""Alive Again"", ""Song For The Lonely"", ""Love One Another"", which all have messages of love and acceptance and moving on. Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"". The only songs I couldn't get into are the latin influenced ""Body To Body, Heart To Heart"", and ""Rain, Rain"". The rest of the tracks are winners, however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than ""When The Money's Gone"". I love her version of ""The Music's No Good Without You"", which was the first UK single, a nice dark trance type track. ""Real Love"" stands out, it has a nice Daft Punk-ish sound to it. Overall LIVING PROOF is living proof, that Cher still has the goods!"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,This cd is Living Proof she still has what it takes to go to the top!  Usually in the cd's I buy I have at least one song that I don't like but not on this one.  I like this music because it has a dance beat to it but not so much as to be disco.  This is a great cd if you want to listen to upbeat music but not too upbeat.  I would definately recommend buying it.
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Living Proof is, among casual Cher fans, her greatest album ever: and whats better than the greatest version of her greatest album?  This Japanese Bonus Track edition not only looks amazingly cool with a Japapnses OBI strip running down the side and an exuberant pink sticker plastered on the front reading ""Y1980!"", but the album's music makes it all the more worthwile.  Anyone who is interested in purchasing the Living Proof cd i urge you to purchase this superb edition, as ""When You Walk Away"" (US ONLY track, which can also be found on he Alive Again german single)is a good song, but isn't missed."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"This is Cher's latest offering, first released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. UK and Canada had ""The Music's No Good Without You"" as a first single, whereas the US had ""A Song For The Lonely"" as the first single. LIVING PROOF continues the trend started by BELIEVE, her comeback album. ""A Song For The Lonely"" has a very upbeat message in it, many have used it to cope with the tragedies of 9-11, it's a universal song of acceptance that we've come to expect from Cher. There are other songs in this vein as well, ""Alive Again"" sort of mirrors the message of ""Believe"", just a song about survival and the desire to feel alive again. I really like ""Real Love"" which has a almost retro sound to it. The second single in the US is ""A Different Kind of Love Song"", which is also similar to ""A Song For The Lonely"", just a song of acceptance. She continues the trend with electronica. ""You Take It All"" is another highlight here. Other highlights include ""Rain, Rain"", and ""Love Is Lonely Place Without You"". The only songs I didn't care for were the Diane Warren penned ""Body to Body, Heart To Heart"" and the song ""When The Money's Gone"". Overall another strong album, nothing different but it should satisfy most fans."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Well now, she sure is experimenting, being a pure blond on the cover, a Cleopatra look in another picture, an Omigosh black & white look later on, and is that a hat, crown, or what the heck dyed contrasting hair in that next picture?
Okay, I'll stop reviewing her hair and get into the music!  This is truly evidence that rather than letting her more mature years slow her down, she continues developing.  Purists can say all they jolly well want about her voice quality deteriorating, but it just isn't so.  She's working with it and singing songs that reflect much of her perennial dramatic past, but mellower and upbeat.
No, there's no song titled ""Living Proof"" here.  But that title is a reference to the most outstanding song on the CD, ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"".
As a follow-up to ""Believe"", Cher is establishing herself as one of the musical legends with a lengthy career which keeps going.  Hopefully, more is on the way...."
,B00123HNS6,-1,1,5,This is my favorite Keith Carradine song.  I wonder if he is still singing?  It would be nice if he was.
,B00123HUKC,1,1,5,This was my all time favorite back in the day.  It sure brings back the memories.

,B00123HUKC,1,1,5,"I liked Bread when I was young (but often didn't admit it). Back then I took a little kidding for liking Bread when the ""cool"" people were into more edgy music.

When I recently I learned Bread's music was spoke to my brother and sister-in-Law's deepest feelings for each other I sought out the ""Best of Bread"" album. I'm glad I did because it renewed my interest and reminded me how much I liked their music. ""If"" is one of several favorites on the ""best of"" album,  ""If"" spoke to my late teen romantic heart. Hearing it now helps remind me of the feeling of those formative years.

For my brother and sister-in-law ""If"" is more than other Bread songs they like ""their"" song. Just listening she can't help but let loose a tear. This makes it even more special to me and I'm certain it brings up special feelings for many.

Bread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I like how much their music means to friends and family just a bit older than me too.

I'm glad I gave them another look. It was well worth it and ""If"" is well worth 5 stars to me.

Hope this helps someone!"
,B00123HUKC,1,1,5,"Classic, beautiful, relaxing, uplifting, smooth.  Just really an awesome song."

,B00123HUKC,1,1,5,"This is definitely a song that my bunny fell in love with!  She heard it on TV, gave me the look and the stomp, with her nose in the air (that means ""I want it and I will not look at you until I get it).  So, made a dash for my phone, found quickly, played her sample, got the nod & downloaded! Think she listened for over an hour, and now it is part of her nighttime ritual, and when I take her brush out and brush her fur while it's playing, she is so content and knows the brushing of her fur means its the final time she will hear it for that day! It really is a pretty song."
,B00123HUKC,1,1,5,Enjoyed it
,B00123HUKC,1,1,5,i love listening to this song when I feel I need a love hug... and feel better.  its a feel good song.
,B00123HUKC,1,1,5,"This is a beatutiful song from the 70's. Brings back a lot of good memories and it is so sweet to llisten to.  Once you hear it, you will want to listen over and over. Highly recommend to all...especially if you were in love and enjoying life in the 70's'"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"I just got back from Vegas and saw Cher's FANTASTIC show at the MGM.The legend told the audience she's retiring after this album,and we all booed. Its ashame,because the Women is looking and sounding better than ever,especially on ""Living Proof."" The first single,""Song for the lonely,"" is beutifull,and has helped alot of us after 9-11. My other favorites,""The Music's no good without you,and the last cut,""When the money's gone,"" but the entire album is a Wonderfull DANCE CD,even better than ""Believe.""After being a RockStar,TV Star,Movie Star,and the Top Pop Star to close the Century,She deserves to Retire,but ""The Music's no good without CHER"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Cher does a great job on the second dance album kicking major butt on many songs.  Once you listen to this cd like 3 or 4 times you will know all the songs.  Song for the lonely, a different kind of love song, and when the money is gone are sone of the best songs on this cd.  If you like popular dance music try this cd.  She also sings Ambers number one dance hit love one another and does a great remake."
,B00123G5ZI,-1,1,4,"It's not surprising that, what with her previous BELIEVE being such a monster, that eternal pop icon Cher would follow-up that set with another disc of like-minded material. What may be surprising is that she's managed to pick out an album's worth--well,almost--of songs that hold the listeners interest,something she failed to achieve with the mostly half-baked BELIEVE(the obvious exceptions being the title track and 'All Or Nothing'). Which is a shame,because,like her magnificently underappreciated IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, LIVING PROOF looks to be losing what little momentum it managed to garner from BELIEVE's success, going the way of WORLD with little to no fanfare. It's even more disheartening considering that the song and vocal quality is literally light years ahead of her previous set, thanks to such first-rate tracks as 'Song For The Lonely','Alive Again','A Different Kind Of Love Song', and 'Love Is A Lonely Place Without You'. The only real snoozer here is 'Body to Body,Heart to Heart'(Memo to artist--cross Diane Warren off your ""go to"" list--she hasn't written anything remotely interesting in ages). The only other quibble is the over-use of that annoying vocoder--it was cool on 'Believe'(the first half a million times),but it's used far too much for it's own good here. Otherwise,LIVING PROOF stands as one of the artist's most consistent collections."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"I believe Cher is Queen of Pop music. This is by far her BEST cd-there is a song everyone can ejoy on it and just like her first single (THE MUSICS NO GOOD WITH OUT YOU) I don't think POP music would be what it is now without her-CHER.
Cher is LIVING PROOF that if you BELIEVE in you music-it will become a hit."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"There are really two songs on this disc that are not on the US version - 'You Take It All' and the Latin-flavoured 'The Look.' While this import may be a little expensive, 'The Look' is totally worth the extra cash. Unlike many of the other songs on this disc, 'The Look' does not contain a lot of computer enhanced effects, like the 100% techno number 'The Music's No Good Without You.' 'The Look' is set to a funky Flamenco beat that would have really gone over well as a single in the US. The lyrics may be light weight, but it's just so much fun to listen to! I don't pernsonally own the Japanese version of 'Living Proof,' but I have heard 'The Look' a number of times. If you love Cher and Spanish-influenced music, buy a copy of this import. I can assure everyone that they will not be disappointed."
,B00123HFAM,1,1,5,"There were some great songs that came out of the 80s, and this is one of them.  This is a great little song that makes you want to dance.  Very upbeat, also very sexy."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Cher doesn't dissapoint her loyal following by continuing her success as a dance diva. Favs. include ""song for the lonely"", ""music's no good"", ""love is a lonely place"", ""rain,rain"", and ""love so high"". Dance and groove. Cher keep up the good work! Fans shd. also checkout her cd's - ""it's a mans' world"" and ""black rose"" to truly appreciate where this lady has traveled. She is amazing!"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Have critics grown to synical to appriciate Cher. This cd does have a lot of the same beats as her most recent cd, but Living proof still is a winner, with hits like song for the lonely- same writers as believe. This cd is very underrated outside of the amazon world. The cd is filled with songs that just pump joy into every moment of listening, and promises beats that just won't stop. Although these songs are from a variation of writers - I wonder why Cher chose a lot of the songs, with the messages like -"" I stillbelieve in love"". Is Cher telling us something? HMMMM.....inquiring minds need wonder."
,B00123HXG8,1,1,4,Great!...I had to listen to both versions closely to hear the difference. The remastered seems to have a fuller louder sound in the chorus lines. Amazon promt as always with no problems...(my favorite part).
,B00123HXG8,1,1,5,A great folsky kinda song - makes me want to sit around a camp fire. Can't go wrong with the Amazon DRM free downloads. Great price and great flexibility. I love it!
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Cher out did herself this time.  After ""Believe"", everyone expected a dance cd...but this one is amazing.  It's the best dance CD ever produced...Cher has said ""People have been listening to myvoice for like a hundred years""...""why cant i have fun with it?"".  She definetely...does with many, many tracks.  The pitch machine used to define Believe was back at it and roaring this time. ""Different Kind of Love Song"" is so incredibally altered Cher as said ""Its vocoded to death"".  But...that doesnt means it get old! The pitch machine makes every song inredibally easy to remember with solid beats and on-time voice alterations.  If anyone but Cher had done this album it would go down as the greatest of all time.  Unfortunetly, because people want Cher to die for some reason, they ignore her.  It's sad that someone who the great Madonna models herself after can be ignored.  Living Proof is the greatest album of Cher's career...which is tough to say about a diva with albums such as ""Believe"", ""It's a Mans World"", ""Cher"", ""Heart of Stone"", ""Take Me Home"", and ""Half Breed"".  Cher said it herself...""at the end of the nuclear hollucost they'll be cocaroaches....and Cher""...""So i think that pretty much sums it up"".  Long live the great one...remember...Her Farewell tour hits...soon."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"She is back, and never has this living legend sounded so good. Forget that the lyrics are not deep, just enjoy this awesome disc from Cher. Being in Canada, I bought the international version of Living Proof with 'You take it all' instead of 'When you walk away' last November from a local retailer. It has been in my stereo ever since! 'Real Love' 'Song for the Lonely' and 'When the money's gone' are the best of the best. High energy, fun, and radio-ready cuts to say the least. Cher has changed with the times, that is why she had such a long-standing career. Sometimes the computer effects on the tracks get to be a bit much, but I love every song nontheless. Be sure to listen to this disc from start to finish. I can honestly say that there is not one track that could be considered the 'worst' song on the album. Some are stronger than others, but each one is worthy of being a single. Cher, keep up the awesome work. Your fans want to hear more from you for years to come. Buy this cd now!"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"I purchased this terrific album because I wanted to see if Cher could possibly sound any better.  And you know what, she's topped (ha!) herself again.  The American version of Cher's ""Living Proof"" contains quite a few danceable little ditties and a lot of smooth production.  It also contains Cher's curious choice of song lyrics (she only wrote one of the songs) and her somewhat annoying singing voice (only topped (again! haha!!) by her annoying speaking voice and the insipid things she says).  The problem with that particular album is she sings in a language Hoppy can understand (English!).  This Japanese version is much much better.  I can't understand a thing the crone is saying, but I can still dance dance dance my pants off!  For those who love Cher's new dance beat, but don't like listening to her silly platitudes, this is the choice for you.  Well worth the extra expense.  Dance on Old Girl!!!"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Cher's new CD masters what ""Believe"" promised in 1998.  Cher's singing is confident and powerful; and the songs are consistently excellent.  This CD follows Cher's 2000 internet-only CD of self-penned tunes, ""not.commercial,"" that Cher released on her own Isis label.  For that CD, she lived in a castle in France and wrote some good songs like ""The Fall"" dedicated to Kurt Cobain and ""Sisters of Mercy"" that expressed her opinions on Catholic school.  While we don't see any saucy lyrics as Cher's classic, ""You're about as useless as Bob Dole's... arm,"" we do get the best commercial polish on ""Living Proof.""
""Song for the Lonely"" is a hot rocker, timely in the wake of the World Trade Towers & Pentagon terrorist acts, ""When heroes fall in love or war, they live forever.""  The drums fall hard on this comforting opener; and when Cher sings ""It'll be all right,"" her vocals fly angelically.  ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" is a cosmic rocker with a driving techno beat, ""We have living proof there's some kind of light that flows through everything.""  ""Alive Again"" is a pulsating midtempo song of renewal, ""I only want to learn to freeze the flame.""  Throbbing echo chamber vocals resound through the excellent ""The Music's No Good Without You.""  One of my favorite tracks, #1 on my own personal top ten, is ""Rain Rain,"" an addictive soulful track.  Keyboards and hot rhythm guitar lace ""Real Love,"" ""Time after time, you're bringing me up when I'm down.""  ""Love So High"" has more soaring vocals on this throbbing rocker.  ""Body to Body Heart to Heart"" is an amorous full-throated rocker where Cher uses a taste of Spanish guitar that she employed so prominently on one of my favorite songs from the ""not.commercial"" CD, the gorgeous ballad ""Still.""  ""I'll never love this way again,"" Cher sings passionately as the pace slows a tad on the beautiful ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You.""  ""Love One Another"" is great cosmic pop with pulsing rhythms, ""Try to understand, open up your heart, a fist is just a hand, it can come apart.""  Keyboards wash defiantly on ""When You Walk Away.""  The CD closes with Bruce Roberts' and Donna Weiss' ""When the Money's Gone,"" a funky rocker that is so endearing.  Cher's voice floats as she sings, ""What a fine life I give to you.""
""Living Proof"" is musically excellent.  Cher has fully moved into the genre.  We sense the woman behind the production.  She fashions some beautiful cosmic truths as well as just singing her heart out.  This CD is a VERY good time!  Enjoy!"

,B00123HXG8,1,1,5,Classic
,B00123HXG8,1,1,5,CSN at their harmonic best. One of their later hits shows they never lost their musical talent
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"When you have a hit as monstrous as the disco-tinged ""Believe,"" do you even dare change the formula, even slightly?  Cher doesn't, and that's not a bad thing on ""Living Proof.""  As with her last record, the diva gives us a platter of energetic dance tunes that may not be as memorable as ""Believe,"" but are catchy enough to find a home in both the radio and the clubs.  I wasn't totally wild about the first single ""Song for the Lonely,"" a 9/11 tribute that sounds less sincere than opportunistic.  She fares way better on ""A Different Kind of Love Song,"" ""The Music's No Good Without You,"" and the bouncy ""When the Money's Gone.""  But ""Living Proof""'s best track is the discocentric ""Love Is a Lonely Place Without You,"" a really good post-breakup song that's given justice thanks to Cher's distinguished delivery.  On her last album, Cher asked us to ""believe.""  This time around, she's given us the ""living proof"" to show that our faith wasn't in vain."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"I must say she is amazing...Every song on this C.D. makes u wanna get up and dance!! and thats what its all about..

,B00123G5ZI,-1,-1,2,"Cher is back with ""Living Proof"", after the highly successful ""Believe"" which catapulted Cher into superstardom once again with the single ""Believe"" going all the way to No. 1 in 1998 and making it the biggest single of 1998 according to Billboard.
So Cher shows in ""Living Proof"" that you don't mess with success and use the same formula as ""Believe"".  Though ""Believe"" was a good dance album, it also got tiring very quicky as does ""Living Proof"".
The songs are good dance songs my favorite is ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" which is definitely the strongest song on the album and should of been released as the first single in stead of the dismal been believed and done that before ""Song for the Lonely"".
However all the songs sound like the same vain of ""Believe"", and just get tired with the same dancebeats over and over.
I don't want to sound contradicting here, Cher is good, ""Living Proof"" is a well produced dance piece, however it would do better as a 12 inch vinyl single than 12 different songs.
The other strong cuts include ""Rain, Rain"" and ""Love One Another"" which sounds a lot like ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" which is a faster version of ""Song for the Lonely"" which is a slower version of ""Believe""....Get the picture?
There is no new trails taken here, no new ideas, or sounds.  Chers voice always the classic sound that Cher has is always in good form, and Cher is one of the best entertainers of all time, however ""Living Proof"" is just the same old ""Beliefs"".
Cher does dance good, however if you want a really good dance album get Kylie Minoques ""Fever"" which is sizzling hot."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"This cd is so chocked with amazing songs that I had to play it repeatedly. Yes there are too may effects, as Cher's vocals hardly need them, but in the disco halls it will be perfect. I heard the version of When you walk away prior to the effects, and it is very strong, stronger without effects. It is a ballad that soars and soars with feeling. The songs that scream perfection are The Song for the lonely, as well as Alive again,Love is a lonely place without you.. Cher is really expressive and gets these anthemic songs to where no other woman singer could. She has outdone believe despite how much her label only half supports her, this is pop music at it's zenith..and Cher fans will love it. Ney-sayers will be suprised.
Get the proof!!!!!Support the lady who does it all well! These are great efforts."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"What are you waiting for?  This is most certainly Cher's best and most remarkable album.  Why?  Well have you heard ""Song For The Lonely""-the anthem that just won't stop?  This album is so wonderful, Cher's voice soars like nothing else she has done before.  Check out the amazing ""When The Money's Gone"", it is so perfect that you'll have to listen to it over and over again until your are dead tired.  Clear the dance floor!  ""Different Kind Of Song"" blasts through your speaker with super sonic vocoder energy.  The hook is unreal, and ""Alive Again"" is a spiritual moment unlike anyother.  The US includes the tracks ""When You Walk Away"" and let me tell you-so good.  Much more upbeat then ""You Take It All""(on the international pressing), and fits itself nicely into the overall atmosphere of the album.  I believe that this is Cher's most thought provoking and fully put together album.  There is a heavy spiritual vibe that runs through the ablum, take ""Love One Another"" for example.  And obviously the afore mentioned ""Song For The Lonely"" is included.  ""The Music's No Good Without You"" is one of my favorite Cher songs ever.  Talk about fabulous.  It is by no means a typical Cher song but proves that she is forever invincible.  After months of waiting ""Living Proof"" is finally here, Cher is back."
,B00123HXG8,1,1,5,I have loved this song since it first came out.  The remastered is as good as the original which means it is awesome.
,B00123HXG8,1,1,5,I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music
,B00123G5ZI,1,-1,2,"Cher is at it again.  Now nearly 56 years of age, Cher is still fighting the inevitable tide of time.  This time, as with her last ""effort"" ""Believe"", Cher (with platinum hair--will it translate to platinum sales?  I doubt it) continues her foray into the world of trippy dance beats and nuevo-disco stylings as the listener is bombarded with studio wizardry and up-to-date technology (and Cher's unique voice).  The songs (as is usually the case with Cher) are penned by songwriters (i.e., not Cher herself although she did have a hand (ha!) in writing the first ""tune"") and Cher is backed by a slew of competent studio musicians and masterful, clinical, overproduction.  To me, this sounds like technology for technology sake and not for the sake of the music.  On the bright side, it does tend to obscure Cher's questionable ""talent"" somewhat and that can't be all bad.  If you go for dance music, stick with the experts and not some ""artist"" trying to stave off irrelevance.  If you're someone who digs Cher, you'll buy this anyway (and maybe even dance to it--ha ha ha!!!).  The bottom line:  Overproduced dance music that's been done better by many others.  Hippity Hop Dop!!!"
,B00123HL9C,1,1,5,Love Pastor Sapp. This song (although it's old) ministered to me just when I needed it. God always uses Pastor Sapp to minister to the hurting & the broken.
,B00123HL9C,1,1,5,THIS SONG GOT ME THROUGH THE HARDEST TIME IN MY LIFE....EVERYTIME I HEAR IT T GIVES ME STRENGTH AND HOPE! IT HELPED ME THROUGH SUICIDE... I THANK GOD I HEARD IT WHEN IT DID NOW I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT
,B00123HL9C,1,1,5,"I listened to this song on my television via my Roku today, and the song sounded great! This was definitely a great find!"
,B00123HL9C,1,1,5,I had this CD it was never returned. This CD encouraged me in many ways. It is worth the buy.
,B00123HL9C,1,1,5,I remember this song. I was always trying to get this song. Marvin Sapp is a very gifted gospel artist. There never is a time or place.
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Besides being an inspiration for the mid-age set (you don't have to be 21 and practically broke several ribs to like dance music), Cher shows that like fine wine, you do improve with age.
Check out ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"", which guarantee's you come away with a smile and the lyrics stuck in your brain. Other note-worthy's include the hot ""Body To Body"", the 70's feel of ""Love Is A Lonely Place"", the anthemic ""Alive Again,"" a great cover of Amber's ""Love One Another"", and ""Song For The Lonely.""
Acutally, the only cut that sounds like it should've been on ""Believe"" is ""You Take It All. Simply put - she's back and she rocks. If you don't own anything else from Cher, this is it!
Cherglamour"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"It's clearly obvious that no one has ever transformed themselves more or been succesful for as long as the supreme diva herself, Cher.  One Word that means so much.  This latest cd is her best yet.  ""Living Proof"" is the most appropriate title fore Cher shows in this dance-ethrusted cd that she can take on anything in her career and that she is here to stay.
""Living Proof"" is defintely the best produced dance cd EVER, with the following tracks...
""The Music's No Good Without You"" ~ The First European single, and the most unlike Cher song on the cd.  I you didn't know it was Cher you wouldnt know who it was.
""Alive Again"" ~ Cher goes from super vocoded in track 1 to a super powerful voice in track 2.  So powerful that a radio station in Germany has chosen it for their Olympic theme song.
""Song for the Lonely"" ~ The first Amerian single and the most meaningful song is also very powerful and unlike Believe has no vocodor (cherbot) recrdings o her voice.
""Different Kind of Love Song"" ~ Cher said it herself...its ""Vocoded to DEATH!"" haha...its awesome super dancy..will be big in clubs
""Rain Rain"" ~ Smooth Ballad...cuts the dance theme a little,but still miraculousely is dancy?!?!?! Only cher!
""Love so High"" ~ Excellent song...has to be heard
""Body to Body, Heart to Heart"" ~ Kinda like Dov'e La'`more.  Very latin and very upbeat
""Love is a Lonely Place Without You"" ~ Great Vocals, Cher!! Super good song.
""Real Love"" ~ Kinda like Believe...very vocoded...excellent
""Love One Another ~ Remake of Amber's dance song...very good.  Cher's is far better
""You Take it All"" ~ Very slow yet very well produced
""When the Moneys Gone"" ~ Great way to end the cd..one of the best songs on Living Proof.
Dont forget Living Proof hits he US Feb 26th!"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Frankly, I expected nothing like this cd. Actually, I didn't know what to expect after ""Believe"". I was on of those that had a ""wee"" problem with Cher going 'dance'. I wanted another ""Heart Of Stone"" or ""It's A Man's World. Believe showed Cher in great vocal form from previous recordings. The songs suited her to a tee (with the exception of ""We All Sleep Alone"", a real nightmare!) and the production was quite good.
My big surprise was the amount of careful work that went into this followup. The only reason this cd doesn't rate a ""5"" in my opinion is that she could have done it entirely without vocoder effects and it would have still been great. After all, I buy her music to hear HER.
""Song For The Lonely"" will be as big, if not bigger, than Believe. And there are several potentials for Top 10 to follow. Check out the infectious ""Different Kind Of Love Song"", the haunting ""Rain Rain"", anthemic ""Alive Again"", the 70's  disco ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"", and a great cover of ""Love One Another"". This cd tops Believe without taking away from it. If you haven't got it yet, wait for the february release of the US version which will contain an additional track (13). Yep, she's back, big time!"
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"I have had this CD for about a month now...Have had it in my Car CD player and have not removed since I got it. It makes me want to drive! This CD is a great dance album as well as a great driving album. I Certainly Recommend it. I have all of Chers music and all of it is feel good great. Go ahead its well worth the money , plus it will get a lot of mileage...."
,B00123I8HG,1,1,4,"I love this song, and recently saw Lauren HILL sing it on vh1, then they also produced Roberta. they both did a very good job singing this song"
,B00123I8HG,1,1,5,Old school song that has meaning and a good sound. A big difference from the songs of today! . I really like the song
,B00123I8HG,1,1,5,This  is  one  of my all-time favorite songs. I love Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway.  This has to be one of the best duets ever recorded! I think they should both be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"I believe Cher is Queen of Pop music.  This is by far her BEST cd-there is a song everyone can ejoy on it and just like her first single (THE MUSICS NO GOOD WITH OUT YOU) I don't think POP music would be what it is now without her-CHER.
Cher is LIVING PROOF that if you BELIEVE in you music-it will become a hit."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"I love Cher's music and I'm not embarassed to say that. Her music is a bit campy at times but nothing wrong with a bit of camp value. I was not willing to wait until spring of 2002 for the US release of ""Living Proof"". I was happy to shell out the big bucks for her new album. Needless to say, the results were positive. ""Living Proof"" is ten times better than ""Believe"". The material she chose to record is far better than most of the songs off its predecessor. Although I do think Cher overdoes it on the vocoder sounds on this cd, I was able to forgive her for that since every song on this cd is a winner in my book. I immediately fell in love with ""Alive Again"" which is one of my favorite tracks off this cd. I was completely surprised when I heard Cher cover one of my favorite songs from another dance diva Amber. Cher does a swell job at ""Love One Another"". Unlike ""Believe"", ""Living Proof"" is a stronger dance album. The songs are tight and the material was just right for Cher. I love this album."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"While her ""The Very Best of"", CD doesn't contain all great remastering, this song was definitely remixed for genuine remastering!!"
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,It was so fun to hear this song at our 40th Class reunion.  Being able to download song to iPhone was easy.
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"This song tore me up the first time I heard it, and still gets me. She has such a listenable voice, tonality and interpretation that you can't ignore it."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,4,"Lovely song by the great Roberta Flack. I've liked this song since the 1970s. I finally decided to purchase it and did so through Amazon, but unfortunately, I haven't been able to get it to download to my computer ( a problem I've never had with iTunes)."
,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"When I listened to this ""Son of Believe"", I was impressed with the offering, and decided it was really the better looking brother of ""Believe"". ""Believe"" was a hard act to follow, but need i say?, Living Proof is just that!
 ON Believe Cher seemed to be more passive to the producers. Her involvement on this cd is very evident. She is there for multiple background choruses, and works all the vocals superbly. It's great to hear a girl singer with a lower register, and a way with a lyric. The work is there and the power of the singer is up front. I personally find a few of the tracks her highest achieving artistially ever! ""When the Money's Gone"" is a wonderful rocking dance rock track that finds Cher earnestly questioning the fidelity of her partner when the riches fall! It is a terrific track. ""This is a song(for the lonely"" is an anthem dedicated to the Sept . 11th victims and families, and she shouts it in plaintive cry, in the feel of a real rocker. It is full of emotion and conviction.""Rain Rain"", has a hook that stays after one listen, and the depth that makes you glad you remembered it!
Cher's cover of Amber's hit, ""Love One Another"" does not become a brides-maid to Amber. She brings a low decible sincerity that only a mature woman can pull off. ""A different Kind of Love ""Song, is just that! AND....Cher universally dedicates it to everyone, acknowledging love in a universal way! Cher is no stranger to fame, and this cd will only add to her roster!!! I love it, and so will you. Cher sounds strangely youthful in 2001-2, and guess what..It's inspiring."
,B00123G5ZI,-1,1,4,"After staging arguably the biggest musical comeback this side of Tina Turner with her dance-driven project BELIEVE, Cher's back three years on to offer up more of the same with LIVING PROOF.Utitlizing many of the same producers, she attempts to build on the momentum experienced with the previous set, and the end result is an overall more consistent album.  Granted, there's nothing here that matches the instant pleasure of 'Believe' or 'All or Nothing', but there's also nothing here that matches the abundance of filler found on BELIEVE either. Lyrically, the tracks follow similarly in the vein of her eighties' corporate-rock albums than her more recent output. The set's first international single, 'The Music's No Good Without You',seems an odd choice, if only because it isn't one of the albums more ingratiating tunes.  Far better is 'Alive Again', as well as 'A Different Kind Of Love Song' and 'Real Love'. Also interesting is 'You Take It All', an electronica-driven track that sounds like Cher trying to channel Olive or Dido.  Among the very few missteps are the sole ballad 'Rain Rain', which is just plain dull, as well as a pedestrian remake of 'When The Money's Gone'. The only other minor quibble is the use of the dreaded vocoder on nearly all the tracks--it sounded cool the first thousand times we heard 'Believe', but has since been rendered just another tired, over-utilitzed gimmick--her voice is better than ever, and the heavy reliance on vocal effects just detracts from the album's overall impact after several listens. Though it doesn't match her underrated nineties opus IT'S A MAN'S WORLD as her best, it is a superior album to BELIEVE and reinforces the notion that Cher sounds best when she supresses the rock chick and unleashes her inner dance diva."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,Beautiful ....easy to sing with Roberta!
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,great music
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,Great song

,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"I love her music. I grew up listening to what my parents liked, as well as finding my own favorites."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"I Love this song, its beautiful written and sung."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"I like all my music choices, because I pick them out!"
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,highly recomend
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,Excellant
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,beautiful
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"This is one of the best singers that I have ever heard, and this is one of the best that she has done, These songs are the ones that stand the test of time. Back when music was music and Roberta Flack was and is amazing."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"Killing Me Softly With His Song - I have loved this song since it first came out. I find meaning in the lyrics and the music speaks to my heart. I'm glad to finally ""own"" the song and have placed it periodically throughout my playlist."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"Could very well be one of the best songs of all time. And although many people have tried it, no one has ever pulled off the emotional version that Roberta Flack did."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"I like the other songs on the original vinyl she had. Wore it out. I like the CD, too. I want the entire album on my devices. Well worth buying."
,B00123I8EE,1,1,5,"This is a BEAUTIFUL love song.  Roberta Flack makes it her own, and I don't think anyone can match her in this song.  The lyrics are beautiful and the music is beautiful.  It's one you will want to listen to again and again."
,B00123HX5O,1,1,5,"What a couple,  and what a production they create when they team up.  I can listen to them over and over."
,B00123JH08,1,1,5,"This track touches my soul. It's a message that we all should be praying on behalf of our love ones, colleagues, neighbors, and friends."
,B00123JH08,1,1,5,"I love this song! Beautiful song about hope and that GOD can reach anyone, but we have to be open to a one on one, deep, intimate relationship with our Heavenly Father. GOD Bless!!"
,B00123JIDY,1,1,5,this song has a great beat and good sound. Very good for two-step. It also has good instruments. I would buy it again
,B00123JIDY,1,1,4,The song downloaded quickly and easily and was priced fairly. This is a very Convenient way to make such purchases.
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,I bought this song because I listened to it all the time my son was growing up. He liked it and I do too!
,B00123JYR4,1,1,4,It's a good classic product that's as advertised.  It would've been five stars if it had a higher bit rate.  Perhaps someday they'll sell higher bit rate items for a little more.
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"One of the all time memorable openings, makes you keep singing it after you get out of the car.  Well made MP3 and easy download makes it easy to, as does the 99 cents.  Remember that its over 8 minutes long, so if you live close to work you might have to drive around the block once to finish!"
,B00123JYR4,1,1,4,Classic rock. Brings back memories of the late ' 70s. Rocks out at the end!
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Fog hat  Always liked them
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Good song
,B00123JYR4,1,1,4,Love it
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"Gotta love Slow Ride. My daughter reminded me of it lately when she was watching the movie Dazed and Confused. This song plays predominantly in the movie and I just thought, ""Wow, I never hear that song anymore! And it's such a great song!"" It Made me want to hear it again so I bought it. I love having new music because it helps me workout longer, LOL. Good stuff."
,B00123JYR4,1,-1,3,"This is the only song I like from the group Foghat. I guess it's because it has a  great background sound, plus it grew on me because my cousin would play it a lot so it grew on me."
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Great song for my mp3 on my Kindle Fire.  Love listening to the music.
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,nice
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Love Foghat!
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"You can never go wrong with good 'ol Rock and Roll from the Seventies, and this ""fits the bill"" perfectly!"
,B00123JYR4,-1,1,5,"Item delivered on time, was as described."
,B00123JYR4,-1,1,5,Slow Ride by Foghat is a standard for me.
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,great
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,love it!
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,saw Foghat live back in the day. and I love this song
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Excellent
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Wonderful
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"Such a classic! Not sure what else to say about a song. I love it; it's a great song. However, music is very subjective, so pick for yourself."
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"Slow ride. Take it easy! Easy...that is the operative word. Think about all of those songs that pop up in your head? And your like, ""wow...I'd REALLY like to hear that great song.""  Well, the cloud player and MP3 have made finding, downloading those great songs onto all my paired devices, and made it a snap. And very inexpensive. Love it. Just like this song. It popped in my head, and in less than five minutes I'm listening to it! Fantastic! SLOW RIDE (and Free Bird by Skynard) are the two greatest ""Slide Guitar"" songs EVER!!"
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"Another great Foghat song, we are going way back now folks."
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Foghat is amazing!
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"This song takes you on a classic slow ride back in time. This was not one of my favorite bands, but this is one of their best songs."
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"I ordered this for my tablet, and love having it available anytime I want to listen to it. Ordering from ""Amazon"" was a pleasure, as always....thank you."
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"Every time I hear this song, I want to get in my car and drive. Or I go back to the party days of the 70's and early 80's and the cool groove that filled my days with music like this. There is a reason this was one of the biggest hits of that era."
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Another great old rock and roll tune. Always played this song back in the day whenever there was a party going on.
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Had forgotten about this tune until I heard it on a classic rock station. Just had to have it so I could turn it into a ringtone
,B00123JYR4,-1,-1,1,Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Another awesome song I really like to listen to while in my car and you can't beat the single recording MP3 price!
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,Music review is based solely off of personal taste.  Just because I like it doesn't mean you will.  I love this one.
,B00123JYR4,1,1,5,"How  cool to be able to dl a song from the very 1st concert I ever attended  in 1970 something

Foghat & Slow Ride!

this song is a must on the 1st 60 degree day of spring , with the windows down..."
,B00123IADS,1,1,5,"Even when it becomes obvious that America wasn't The Fab Four, certainly the work that Sir George Martin made as producer of this ""Hearts"" album is outstanding.

The quality of the sound, as well as the careful instrumentation you hear in songs as ""Seasons"", ""Tomorrow"" and ""Company"", make this album an instantaneous ""Must Have"".
In adittion, you have very nice standard 'Radio' hits, like ""Daisy Jane"", ""Sister Golden Hair"" and ""Woman Tonight"".

I recommend this album to any serious 70s Pop Music collector, as well as to those far younger than myself, who are just discovering the musical treasures of that 'Marvelous Decade'!"
,B00123JUGE,1,1,5,"Song brings back memories from the good old days. Its one of those classic songs that stay with you over the years.
Sam Medina"
,B00123HF0W,-1,-1,3,"I really love this song but, this is not the version I like.  If you like country music you may like this more than I did."
,B00123HF0W,1,1,5,"I chose this rating because it makes me so happy to hear it knowing that it was mine and my husband song who is no longer with me, but brings so many wonderful memories back"
,B00123HF0W,1,-1,3,This song is about how a two people should love each other with all their hearts and not one sided.
,B00123HF0W,1,1,4,"Always enjoyed this song, nice to see it out there for purchase so I can enjoy it again today.  Thank you."
,B00123HF0W,1,1,4,The song downloaded quickly and easily. The Price was fair and this is a convenient way to make such purchases.
,B00123JUGE,1,1,5,this the real version how i remember this great song
,B00123JUGE,1,1,4,like
,B00123JUGE,1,1,5,I like it.
,B00123JUGE,1,1,5,I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.
,B00123JUGE,-1,1,4,My youth
,B00123JYNS,1,1,5,Another great tune from the past.
,B00123JYNS,1,1,5,"Good music, always has been & always will be. Love to listen on my player & makes you want to dance"
,B00123K8VA,1,1,4,Still a hit.  Can't kill disco. Like the beet.  The original is the best. The remakes and remasters are not as good.
,B00123JP8W,1,1,5,If you could have just one of their songs this should be it. A variety of styles in one song. Great harmonizing and fun lyrics.
,B00123JP8W,1,1,5,"Exact music file, no scratches or dropouts!! Great for creating your own CDs  This is the only way to get music!"
,B00123JP8W,1,1,5,"I heard this song for the first time while listening to the ""oldies"" radio station. It's fun and catchy. Definetely CSN at their best :-)"
,B00123JP8W,1,1,5,This was one of CS&N's first hits if I remember correctly.  It had a great melody and always made me think of Judy Collins.  These guys are very talented and are still making music today.
,B00123JP8W,1,1,5,Love the Memory!  and the Harmony!!
,B00123JP8W,1,1,5,A genuine classic folk-rock masterpiece
,B00123JP8W,1,1,5,great song
,B00123JP8W,1,1,5,Greatest harmonies ever. I just recently found out that a Suite is a song with four distinct parts so now it all makes sense. Was it really about Judy Collins?
,B00123JW9E,1,1,5,I was asked to sing this song at a funeral.  I bought this and played it.  I could never sing it like he did.  Simply wonderful.
,B00123JW9E,1,1,5,Excellent!!!
,B00123JW9E,1,1,5,This song is wonderful. It makes you feel good when you listen to it. Very humbling emotion when you sing along.
,B00123JW9E,1,1,5,"A sweet tender vocal reminding me of loved ones gone. I have shed a few tears, in a good way, while listening to it."
,B00123JW9E,1,1,5,"This is an amazing song, I was not familiar with this artist until KLove had a Tribute on their show how this song changed a life for the better and helped them through a very difficult time with losing their child."
,B00123IAVK,1,1,5,"Well it's official. This has to be the first/only 1974 and before album i have heard in the soul genre that i really liked---alot! This definitely inspires me to look for more soul albums from the earliest of the 70's. That being said, this one along with everything before their 1976 groove ""Ain't No Stoppin Us Now"" is on my iPod and high on the 'most played' playlist."
,B00123IAVK,1,1,5,"History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60's. Much of it heavily based in fact. Most of this is of the psychedelic rock scene of that city. But there were some important hybrids too. For Frisco it was Santana. For Oakland it was Tower Of Power. A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that,especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk. Based heavily in what James Brown was doing at the time,they had an approch that couldn't be more different if it tried.

  Right off the bat the album kicks off with ""Knock Yourself Out"". This along with the witty ""Social Lubrication"" and ""The Price"",""Back On The Streets Again"" and ""The Skunk,The Goose And The Fly"",with almost goofy lyrical exchanges are TOP before they were even closed to slick. The rhythm section is right out in your face,the horns are blaring right out and the vocals are as raw and unrefined as you'd hear on any Kool & The Gang and James Brown album you'd find during the period. Somehow or other though,there's a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing. Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs.

  The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer ""Sparkling In The Sand"". This is a very slow 9+ minute ballad that has much more of a jazz flavor with more prominant reed solos than anything else. It's surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970-with Sly Stone,Santana,War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions,that the music didn't overburden itself before it really got going. It's a testement to the enduring power and stylistic elasticity of funk that that never happened. This and all of those bands prospered greatly during the era. And laid the groundwork for what is sometimes called ""united funk""."
,B00123IAVK,1,1,4,"The SF Bay Area has been typecasted as Hippie central. Nothin' but Airplane, Dead, Quicksilver, jams that last way tooooolong.
So wrong!
Tower of Power was bred and born from the streets of Oakland,step brother of Sly And Family Stone from Vallejo. The CA. funk that still resonates to this day.
Late 60's, early 70's Nor. CA. bands were full of horn bands, Memphis/Stax influenced, i.e. Cold Blood w/ Lydia Pense, Mother Earth, and Loading Zone.
Tower of Power had the best musicians, a shoutin' soul singer, and the charts that made them high above all the rest.
This CD is their first. It is a template for Oakland funk; dirty horns, sweet harmony, and a bass that defines the Bay Bridge: tuff sturdy and don't mess w/ us.
This CD has some drop off in the ballad, ""Sparkling in the Sand"", but so did the LP. The main hit hard hurray of ""Knock Yrself Out"", still kicks out.
The LP is hard to find in good shape, it got played a lot. The  CD is kinda hard to find..but worth it."
,B00123IAVK,1,1,5,"TOWER OF POWER IS THE @#@#$%^%.WHEN THIS HIT THE STREET ,WE WERE BACK ON THE STREET BEATS AGAIN. A TOTALY NEW, AND IMPROVED SOUND MANY ARE STILL TRYING TO REGULATE IE...LIQUID SOUL COMES TO MIND,AND WHERE ARE THEY NOW?only lydia pense and cold blood comes close .If you don't have their stuff you DON'T have any clue. EAST BAY GREASE IS STILL A MONSTER ,THAT IS UNLESS YOU STILL NEED THE RADIO TO TELL WHAT IS HIP. ALL THESE TRACKS DO BELONG TOGETHER.and, SPARKLIND IN THE SAND IS STILL THE BEST SLOW PRE T.O.P. BALLAD. BUY THIS AND GET RE-EXPERIENCED.YOWSERS, THIS IS GREAT STUFF. GOD BLESS T.O.P. AND IT'S VANILLA SUBURBS. [...]  HOLLA IF YOU FEEL ME."
,B00123IAVK,-1,1,5,"A word of warning Tower Of Power's cebut album is NOT the

least bit smooth or soft! From ""Knock Yourself Out"" on 'East Bay Grease' is filled with smelly horns,gutbucket rhythm and very

sandpapery singing. It actually owes more to the mutant horn

rock grooves of Blood,Sweat & Tears,Electric Flag and even Chicago then James Brown or Kool & The Gang. But the rhythm knows

it's buisness and that makes this album a dirving slice of gritty,hard core east coast funk! The plaintive ""Sparkling In The

Sane"" is the slowest song on the album and it doesn't even come

close to being soft-rather like a longish psychedelic soul groove with fleeting vocals. Any way you take it 'East Bay Grease' is very impressive stuff!"
,B00123IAVK,1,1,5,"This album sounds very different than most TOP albums, so if you're used to that stickier East Bay Grease they'd develop once hitting the big WB you may have to listen with a different mindset.
The sound on this album *IMHO* is a big ""blacker"" a bit more late '60s/early '70s feeling, and definitely shows their ties to COLD BLOOD, another band DEFINITELY worth checking out.  In many ways tight, but not as tight as they'd come to be, yet they compensate with soul splattering ENERGY.  - - The closest you've probably heard TOP to this ""sound"" is on their BUMP CITY album, when they went back to a dirtier and grittier sound.
FUNKATEERS will love this album.  TOP fans (and their following of brass ensemble students turned on by hip instructors) will be split between Love It/Hate It... however, *IMHO* its one of their best and they still perform many of the songs in their show today."
,B00123IAVK,1,1,5,"Though their horn-heavy charts and funky soul had it precursors (Sly & The Family Stone, BS&T, etc.), few had taken it so far, and with such heavy grooves as this Berkeley/Oakland ensemble.  This debut album,  originally issued on Bill Graham's small San Francisco label, and out of  print for many years, nailed it all on the first try. The songs are  eminently catchy, the rhythms (especially Dave Garibaldi's drumming) are as  vital as heartbeats, and the horn charts blew away their contemporaries.  The vocals, always a moving target with T.O.P. came from Richard Thomas and  Rufus Miller. Many fans like their next two or three LPs better, as the  arrangements became more refined and the band tightened up a bit, but as  the founding document of funk city, I'll vote this one every time. The perfect soundtrack for wolfing down a messy plate of ribs from KC's."
,B00123JIYI,1,1,5,One of the few Madonna songs I like.  I think the songs in this era represented her best years before she went downhill.
,B00123KDZG,1,1,4,"I've been a fan of Old 97's for a while now, so it's easy for me to recommend ""Hit By a Train: The Best of Old 97's."" The only problem I'm having is trying to figure out exactly why this is considered a ""best of."" Quite frankly, each of their albums stand quite well on their own, and in many ways equals the overall quality of this collection. There are a few songs here that I personally would not have included, (""their rendition of ""El Paso"", for instance), while there are plenty of songs from each studio album whose inclusion would have been easily justified (""Wreck Your Life""'s ""W-I-F-E"" and ""The Other Shoe,"" and ""Too Far to Care""'s ""Streets Where I'm From"", for instance). Nevertheless, ""Hit By a Train"" is an entertaining listen from start to finish. In that sense, this is more of a sampler than a collection of their best hits.

Miller has a tendency toward song-title puns that don't do justice to the songs themselves (""Cryin' Drunk,"" ""Crash on the Barrelhead"" - not included here), but this only points out his self-consciously clever way with a phrase. The band has obviously mastered the two-step `train beat' (3 tracks here) and the hard-bouncing ""Texas shuffle"" (which accounts for eight of the CD's eighteen tracks), but it's Miller's lyrics that keep you coming back for more, even after repeated listens. Miller's albums as a solo artist certainly hold up well, but it's his work with Old 97's that is most effective, which is why this collection works as well as it does. How can you not love an album containing ""Barrier Reef,"" ""Lonely Holiday,"" ""Jagged"" and ""Victoria,"" all on the same disk? ""Hit By a Train"" encapsulates some of the band's best moments, and hardcore fans of the band will want this if only for the non-album tracks (the above-mentioned ""El Paso"" and ""Cryin' Drunk""), but casual fans would do well to continue exploring their catalog further.

,B00123KDBK,1,1,5,"A beautiful restoration with stunning bonus tracks of the strangely overlooked Peggy Lee masterpiece from 1974 capture the fascinating legendary lady in peak form, mesmerizing title song produced and arranged by Paul McCartney.  Fresh from a dramatic weight loss and looking like a million bucks, Peggy Lee was ready to go when she signed Atlantic Records to record a soulful set of great contemporary songs.  Peggy Lee went deep inside, laid down a stunning vocal on the great ""Let's Love"" which should have been a huge hit but shamefully received no airplay upon its release. Next is a spirited soulful version of Melissa Manchester's ""He Is The One"" with a thrilling background gospel chorus with Peggy leading the way with a superb vocal.  Sensuous and funky on a playful ""Easy Evil"", torchy and illuminating ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight"", clearly Miss Lee is in peak form and very inspired!  A fresh funky arrangement make evergreen ""Always"" a delight while ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" becomes a tour-de-force, making this the definitive version of this timeless soulful classic. Hot rhythm track sets gospel spiritual ""Sweet Lov'liness"" on fire while a haunting Peggy Lee original ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter"" is simply gorgeous.  Soulful seduction make ""Sweet Talk"" a quiet storm classic which should have been a huge hit and mesmerizing achingly gorgeous Henry Mancini ""Sometimes"" is a sentimental classic having a special feel all its own.  Bonus tracks are wonderful discoveries with ""I Am His Lady"" the best ever version of this soft-jazz treat.  A ragtime arrangement make the Peggy Lee original ""I Wanna Be Seduced"" great fun and another Peggy original ""The Nickel Ride"" is a stunning classic that is naked and haunting.  This unique original has Peggy brilliantly accompanied by piano only and the result is another great song that echos  Grammy Winner ""Is That All There Is?"". Peggy must have wondered ""Is That All There Is?"" when this great release was received with such shocking indifference, robbing public exposure to a great work and Peggy acclaim she clearly deserved. Closing is a great circus like arrangement for a stirring ""Let's Keep Dancing"" which was to be Peggy's last major studio production and a winner it is!  This great song featured in ""Sharky's Machine"" soundtrack should have been a big hit and would have been in better musical times than the musically directionless early eighties!.  Now if only Capitol Records would release the great 70's ""Where Did They Go"" and the classic ""Norma Delores Egstrom"", both featuring the iconic Peggy Lee in peak form, fans will be happy this legendary singer is finally given some justice for her great but sadly overlooked 70's work.  For those who enjoy great singers in a sublime setting in peak form, do not miss this classic collection, this level of greatness will never happen again...special Limited Numbered Edition & value will soar when no longer available...Thank You Peggy Lee for years of great entertainment and sublime vocals & classy lady RIP"

,B00123KDRE,1,1,5,"This album really has all you need from them. Candlebox is one of those bands that defiantly jumped on the Grunge band-wagon that conquered the early 90s in Alternative Music. The only problem is that they weren't as good as the bands they were most likely influenced from. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, and Soundgarden were just so much better and created a legacy in the trail they left behind. Candlebox just sort of had a moment where people enjoyed the sound of Grunge so much they were desperate for more and they heard ""Far Behind"" and instantly called it worthy. You could arguably say Candlebox is a one hit wonder, I disagree with that statement but its understandable why others might think that. What's included on this best of is really the best of what they put out. Everything here is really all you need to hear to truly see what they had to offer to music. Its a shame things didn't really work out for the band, but it probably wouldn't of mattered because its not like they put out anything that really defined a generation."

,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,2,"For such a ""much anticipated"" return to the recording studio by this legendary superband which dominated the radio in the 70's and 80's, this effort falls short of expectations.  While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic ""90 Degrees and Freezing"", a Motown-inspired, horn driven ""Come to Me Do"" and a catchy and powerful pop gem ""Feel"" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.
I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite ""King of Might Have Been"" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.
I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on ""XXX"". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on ""XXX"".
Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.
""Chicago XXX"" ""could have been a contender"" with a different approach to the CD's production.  We'll just have to wait for ""Chicago XXXI""."
,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,2,"I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue, but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right. Now this is not a comparison about old 70's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste, but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly. If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago, you might want to check this out, but I was dissapointed. There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album, but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs.  There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd.  I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on, but not that much.  I did not like the producer on this album.  Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards, drums, guitar, vocals etc that I felt cheated. I did not know who played on what track.  My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced.  It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious.  I don't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm, but it was way over the top!  The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance.  The back vocals on the song ""Caroline"" sounded like a straight keyboard sample.  Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop-machine?  They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it's painfully obvious.  I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person's voice.  Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with.  These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets.  I do not mind the loops, midi, sequencing, samples etc, cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster, and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine, but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed."
,B00123IBSC,1,1,5,"April 2006 saw the two great surprises from two great Chicago bands. One is Survivor's Reach album after 18-year break. And the other is this one. Full-length new material release from Chicago. I am not sure under what counting method could this one be their thirtieth. Probably including compilations and Christmas albums. I lost track of Chicago since Night and Day album in mid 90s(22nd release). But that one is sort of tribute. So the last album I FEEL Chicago is Twenty One in 1991. Yeah indeed listening to XXX is like meeting a LONG LOST FRIEND.

FEEL the first single from this album is static at first but from the mid section it turns dynamic. Reminding me of the Chicago during ""18"" album.

KING OF MIGHT HAVE BEEN is tried-and-Trued style of Chicago ballad during 80s. WHY CAN'T WE tries duet but unmistakably typical of Chicago styled ballad. Most surprising one is 90 DEGREES AND FREEZING. Just like Earth Wind and Fire and groovy and I hope Maroon 5 cover this one. So thrilling and my best song of the year so far.

Verdict: My favorite band returns stronger than ever.

Rating: 95 out of 100. One of the finest comeback efforts.

Recommended for: Wide range of pop rock fans."
,B00123IBSC,1,1,5,What can I say it's Chicago. Brand new tunes. I wished I could've seen the new tour this year. These songs are great. The CD is a must for the Chicago lover's collection.
,B00123IBSC,1,1,4,"I love this band and have for nearly 25 years (since I was in junior high school in 1982--when ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"" hit the airwaves).  While most artists get some criticism from me if they have too many ballads, this is one band that has been above that because they do the ballad so well.  I love all of their ""second career"" stuff from the 1980s.  I also have gone back to visit their earliest stuff--including listening to and enjoying their debut ""Chicago Transit Authority"" album.  Suffice it to say, I am a fan of all eras of this band.

So where to place this comeback effort?  After listening to it numerous times, my conclusion is that it nearly stands up to previous material.  I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that a couple of the ballads are a bit sappy even for them, and for sure the song order is strange with having all ballads followed by all uptempo numbers.  I also see no point to having two versions of ""Feel"" on the album--just stick with the trademark horns version.  Still, I am overall very pleased with the release of this album.

""Feel"" is an enjoyable track (whichever version you listen too)--very familiar but with a sound of modern production.  Good single, although I don't think it did too well chart-wise.  Ballads like ""King of Might Have Been"" and ""Caroline"" would fit right on such Chicago albums as 17-21 with their beautiful vocals and overall melodic sound.  Even the guest vocals on ""Why Can't We"" and ""Love Will Come Back"" are somewhat enjoyable and an interesting direction to take.  ""Long Lost Friend"" is a bit sappy but for sure very pretty.

I agree with those who say the second half of the album comes as a nice surprise in returning to the ""roots"" of the band a bit.  ""90 Degrees and Freezing"" is a catchy, fun uptempo number, and ""Come To Me, Do"" is a vintage-sounding Robert Lamm-sung track.  ""Already Gone"" has some cool harmonies that are not so typically straight-ahead as so many Chicago melodies are.  ""Where Were You"", ""Lovin' Chains"", and ""Better"" are also refreshingly uptempo and a lot of fun to listen to.

Some have called this a ""safe"" Chicago album, and to a degree I agree with that.  Many of the ballads in the beginning certainly fall into a familiar territory we have heard before.  While I have never heard a note of it, I am further intrigued by people's descriptions of the unreleased ""Stone of Sisyphus"" album and would love to have it see the light of day.  I also think of such albums as the amazing one that Toto put out this year and wonder what a Chicago album made in the same vein (i.e., totally doing what they want to do instead of perhaps pining too hard for a return to radio single ""glory days"") might sound like.  All that being said, for me this is overall a very satisfying release.  I have enough criticism here with the song order and ""safeness"" of the album that I can't quite give it a 5-star rating, but it is close.  Call my rating 4 1/2 stars for an album that should be very satisfying to '80s Chicago fans and also to plenty of career-spanning fans of this legendary band."
,B00123IBSC,1,1,5,"The Good

Hypnotic drum beats lead the charge on ""Feel."" A catchy melodic chorus and subtle guitar riffs will take you the rest of the way. Soulful and emotional vocals dominate the piano laden ballad ""King of Might Have Been."" You may make comparisons to ""Hard Habit to Break"" here, but the song does a great job of standing alone. It's the multi-part harmonies and warm brass that really draw you into ""Caroline."" When you read the lyrics the song seems a little cheesy, but when you here how Chicago presents it, it's quite encompassing. Rascal Flatts makes an appearance on the optimistic ballad ""Love Will Come Back."" ""90 Degrees and Freezing"" echoes the group's 80s high-end production and sound. ""Already Gone"" is loaded with plenty of pop-rock melodies and signature Chicago horns.

The Bad

I thought that the remixed version of ""Feel"" was unnecessary. I didn't really care for the blandness of ""Come to Me, Do"" either.

The Verdict

I really didn't expect this album to be so good. Chicago returns with their thirtieth album, after a ten year break, and shows that there's no rust on them. XXX is a powerful and melodic pop-rock experience. I never really wanted to listen to Chicago post-Peter Cetera, but after hearing this, I've had a change of heart."
,B00123LNRI,1,1,4,"This song will touch your heart,mind and soul if you are a believer in the Lord. Jaci has a silky voice that pulls you in as a listener waiting for more."
,B00123LNRI,1,1,5,"I loved this album when it first came out, but it was my sister's album. So im sure glad i saw it online for free!!! cant get enough of it!"
,B00123LNRI,-1,-1,2,"It won't play this song on my mp3 player! frustrating! I never would have bought it anyway, at least it was free. but still it is frustrating. I ended up just deleting it from my player, it simply wouldn't work. :("
,B00123LNRI,1,1,4,"For any one who appreciates a good singer and good music, Jaci has an excellent voice. You may like myself listen to nearly all types of music. If any of her other songs are equal to this I recommend anything she sings.

However.... keep in mind that this is also available on the ""6 Picks: Essential Radio Hits EP"". Don't dowload it twice like I did."
,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,3,"The one very noticeable feature of ""XXX"" is that Chicago seem frozen in time. To me, their last album was ""Twenty One"" back in 1991. ""XXX"" could easily be the follow up judging by the musical direction the band takes here. I'd say this album is most identical to Chicago 16 through 21. It has the streamlined, by the book, paint by numbers, manufactured syrupy saccharine assembly line power ballads and lite funk/jazz pieces you'd expect from 1980's era Chicago. What happened? It's as if the boys missed grunge/rap/hip-hop/hip-pop and have released an extremely American Idol friendly album.

That being said, the 12 songs are fairly homogenous and melodic. I don't hear any hits here because all the songs sound like they could be made by any MOR/AOR band right now. The guest musicians don't really add anything original to the Chicago sound. The horns seem more present with less keyboards. There isn't a truly awful song on ""XXX"", but it's just bland and banal pop, and nothing that could match Chicago 16-19. I don't believe ""XXX"" has anything that really resembles their 1970's output, which is a shame, because there are still fans waiting for Chicago to really kick out the jams like they used to and sideline this David Foster-cursed pop they've been producing for the past 24 years.

I also felt it a waste of space to have two versions of their first single ""Feel"". I listened to both and there wasn't any major difference between the two, so I'd go with the ""Hot Single Mix"" version.

It just seems to me that after nearly 40 years Chicago should be taking more chances with their music. They have absolutely nothing to lose at this point."
,B00123IBSC,1,1,5,"Have had this CD for less than 3 days, mind made up, best of this genre that I have heard this year.

Some die-hard Chi fans are berating this effort because it doesn't duplicate the sounds of CTA-II-V-VII-VII (Guercio) or the 17-21 (Foster) sounds.  I knew that Scheff and Champlin had the makings of giving this band new life, given the right production and management.

This band has finally, (under Jay DeMarcus production) with XXX, come into their own. Of note, checking the Rascall Flatts website, DeMarcus profile shows that Chicago and David Foster were two of his major influences.  It shows on this production.

The STRONG voices of Lamm, Champlin and Scheff, with the addition of TOTO members Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams, and the Rascal Flatts singers makes for as strong a vocal production they have done since Cetera's departure, breaking new ground for the band.  Instrumentally, the bands already strong skills are supplanted by  some of Nashville's best hired guns on guitar and drums.

Stylistically, they cover Trip-Hop-Pop, Power Ballads, Power Pop, New Country, Jazz Fusion, and Blues Rock.  This kind of diversity is unheard of in todays' music scene.

""Love Will Come Back"" with Rascal Flatts on vocals has the makings of a new country hit. Expect it to be the most added song to New Country playlists

""Caroline"" as the makings of a Power Pop anthem. Renegade rock stations stand the best chance of adding this to playlists.

""King of Might Have Been"" is another stand-out, Scheff power ballad.

""Feel"", the first single, has the best chance on the Adult Contemporary scene, with its updated beat and production values.

""90 Degrees and Freezing"" is a Lamm Jazz-Fusion piece which reminds you of the roots of the band back inthe 60's and early 70's. Maybe Jazz and Public stations will play this, too complex and tight for AAA, too hip and edgy for AC.

Other material is very good, not just ""filler"" but it's doubtful any of it will ever get airplay.

All in all, a very pleasant surprise to critical listeners.  No corners were cut on this production, and Warner/Rhino seems to be doing a good job at promoting it.  Just hope they can break them back into the spotlight."

,B00123JSAC,1,1,5,This song takes me back to my listening youth. She is great at taking people home to a better time then nowadays. Very happy with all the transaction.
,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,2,"(2 & 1/2 stars) In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure.  When I played trumpet back then, I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like ""Questions 67 and 68.""  I even enjoyed their more ""lite rock"" phase of the '80s.  But all of that was then and this is now.  Their new ""XXX"" is not so hot.  The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD, ""King of Might Have Been.""  It's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of ""You're The Inspiration.""  The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now.  ""Inspiration"" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera (no longer in the band); ""King"" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing.  The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus (who?); ""Inspiration"" was filled with shimmering, subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster.  ""King"" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune; ""Inspiration"" is a classic that was co-written by Cetera and Foster.  And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole.  It's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago's glory days, but the fact remains that it's a pale imitation.

A couple of thoughts regarding the CD's title.  First, the album count has gotten shakier over the years.  I don't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection (ex., ""Chicago Love Songs"") should count toward the total.  So really they are nowhere near 30 albums.  Second, the movie rating implications of ""XXX"" seem to have completely escaped them, as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art."
,B00123IBSC,1,-1,3,"Chicago XXX is the band's first straight pop record since 1991's Chicago Twenty 1.  Despite the fifteen year gap, the album sounds like it could have been released that same year.  Keying on the power ballads that were a staple of the late 80's and early 90's, the band plays to their strengths.  ""King Of Might Have Been"" is strong ballad that is faintly reminiscent of ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"", ""Caroline"" has some meaty guitar riffs and ""Better"" is accentuated by the classic Chicago horn sound.  Only the album's opener, ""Feel"" which has a spacey trip hop beat, strays from their tried and True sound."
,B00123LVQ6,1,1,5,Have always loved this song (over 20 years) and finally have it again! It makes you feel good even though what she's singing about is not necessarily something that would make you feel good.
,B00123LVQ6,1,1,5,This is an awesome reggae classic and I was happy to get it for my iPod.  I highly recommend that if you like this genre of music that you buy this song and add it to your collection!

,B00123LTP4,1,1,5,"Need I say more? This song touches my heart. I'm a writer and a song that can connect to so many different meanings and feelings, and yet still be so powerful, is perfect for inspiration. This will be on my playlist for just that for years to come."

,B00123LX7I,1,1,5,"An awesome tune -  I selected this one because honestly a lot of their work sounds a little too similar, but I do love this one."
,B00123LX7I,1,1,4,This is very good and fun.  I hope others enjoy it as much as I have.  the price was just right.

,B00123LX7I,1,1,5,Saw these guys in concert and it was pretty dang fun. A real 60s trip. A classic recording of a great song. This is the one you've heard on the radio or in the movies.
,B00123LN1E,1,1,5,I have always been an Alice Cooper fan and had may of his albums growing up. This song was popular when I was in high school and I still love it!
,B00123LN1E,1,1,5,"Alice Cooper is interesting. Although I am not a huge fan of his work, I do love this song. This song is dark to my hidden personality. That is why it is part of my library."

,B00123M9KI,1,1,5,"It was so good to finally find this on Amazon.  It seemed that I waited a good while.  This is just a great classic rock song, from a group that was very talented, and its too bad they didn't have more hits.  And its the original version too."
,B00123N7RM,1,1,5,"Adina is a Scorpio just like me. A one hit wonder that kept haunting me lately so I had an Mp3 credit for a download and decided to let that song that haunted me the last few days, into my digital music library. Naughty, naughty girl!"

,B00123M8ZY,1,1,4,Classic! Added it to my playlist!
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,"Roberta Flack's First Time Ever I Saw Your Face debuted on her first album FIRST TAKE in 1969 and took the radio waves by storm.  There wasn't a pop, soul, or even jazz station that was not playing it in regular rotation.  It rocketed Robert to instant stardom and her voice became one of the most recognizable ballad singers of the 70's.  One listen and you know there was a subtle and beautiful power there.  Modern soul/R&B singers have not a clue as to how to command a vocal like this.  Now it is all about ""runs"" and unrestrained power.  Take a lesson everone, this is how you deliver a beautiful ballad.  If you want more, lay your ears on her cover of The Three Degrees ""Trade Winds"" another Roberta Flack hit that utilizes gorgeous vocal delivery, subtle jazz and soul instrumentation, and a slow burn to building crescendo.  Be sure to check out Roberta's work with Donny Hathaway, simply incredible music!"
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,"Beautiful voice, enjoyable to listen too"
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,Pure desire.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,Absolutely wonderful song by a very talented song writer.

,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,Easy to download with free web archiving.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,This was an impulse buy of a very old favorite.  It comes from a time when you had to have talent and not just a 1K watt amp. A bit moody for boomers maybe.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,In my humble opinion one of the best love songs ever!  Just try listening to it without it making you close your eyes and bringing to mind someone you love!
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,Just beautiful. The remakes today don't cut it. Hers is flawless and full of love.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,ok

,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,One of my favorites songs.  She has such a great voice.

,B00123LUXA,1,-1,3,"...of Bread, but my ex-wife was.  Downloaded some of the old Bread songs for the memories of our younger days, before things went down the tubes..."
,B00123LUXA,1,1,5,"A great,straight-forward declaration of love in song form. Amazing how emotion or passion for someone can drive a person to create something so timeless."
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,"This is an old classic from Roberta Flack, arguably here greatest hit. How could it be rated anything less than five stars?"
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,"This is a beautiful song.  It really speaks to your heart.  The music carries you to a quieter place away from all the confusion of the world.  Roberta Flack truly owns this song, and I don't think anyone could make it better.  Everything about this song is good and beautiful... makes you really feel and think about what is most important in a relationship and what love is.  This is a truly beautiful song and is one you will want to hear over and over again.
Thank  you, Roberta Flack..."
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,The first time I ever heard this song was as a little boy laying on the floor listening to records my Mom was playing.  The song has haunted me my entire life... and the Remastered Version is Top Notch.  Roberta Flack is awesome.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,This is just a gorgeous ballad. Was used in Play Misty for Me with Clint Eastwood and it is so pretty. I have the movie and wanted the song. Terrific buy!
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.  So if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a CD of your chosing that expresses your love for her.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,"This is a rather old song (1950s) which has been  made contemporary as recorded by several performers. Each performance is superb, but Flack's version has more intensity than the others. A very moving performance."
,B00123LUXA,1,1,5,love oldies
,B00123LUXA,1,1,5,Great song.

,B00123LUXA,1,1,5,LOVE this music
,B00123LUXA,-1,1,4,Kind of catchy!  I couldn't believe the lead singer was a male when I first heard it!
,B00123LUXA,1,1,4,"One of those songs that sneaks up on you.  Soft Rock sung by a great lead singer.  Simple, pleasureful and smooth . . . just pleasing to listen to . . . recommend it . . ."
,B00123LUXA,1,1,4,"Great Song, what can I say... I needed that song for a party and it was easy to get, just downloaded it."
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,This Roberta Flack classic took my breath away the first time I heard it (in the mid-1070s).  It is incredibly beautiful and different from typical love songs.  Something I would recommend to anyone who had even a little bit of a romantic nature.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,This recording has excellent sound quality.  Sounds great on my MP3.  No one can sing this song like Roberta Flack!
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,I love this song. I recently heard this song thanks to Amazon's advice and I simply fell in love with the lyrics
,B00123M8ZY,-1,1,5,"i give it 5 stars because it deserves it roberta flack is an allstar in my book wasn""t anything i didn""t like"
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,"believe it or not, this makes me think of the first time I saw my son's face. I thought I had loved before, but I loved that little person so much...and I still love the man he has become more."
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,Love it.  Play it over and over.  Very soothing.  Easy to download onto computer.  Cost was very nice as well.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,Who can compete with the blues singer Roberta Flack? This song really grabs my heart since I fell in love with my husband on our first date. I dream of him as I listen to her throbbing voice echo in my brain.
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,This is my favortite song of all time it's so full of romance and love. I would recommend this love song to everyone I know
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,5,"This is a great collection of Roberta and I enjoy listening to her.  If you like her or this style, you won't be disappointed."
,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"Randy Newman has written many brilliant songs, but SAIL AWAY may well be his finest album.  The 2-minute ""Political Science"" is certainly one of his greatest achievements, and the song is just as timely now as it was in 1973.  What makes the lyric so great is that it distills exactly what so many Americans think about the world.  It could be your friendly next-door neighbor, who seems like a perfectly nice person until you stumble into a  political discussion, and then you realize that he is an immoral monster.  It seems to me that ""Political Science"" should be the national anthem -- it's what large numbers of Americans  really think, and if they disagree then they should be forced to change the attitude as well as the policies before they change the song.

 I would like to include the entire lyric, but here is a sample:

 ""We give them money, but are they grateful, no they're spiteful and they're hateful.  They don't respect us, so let's surprise 'em, let's drop The Big One and pulverize 'em.""

 ""Boom goes London, and boom Pay-ree, more room for you and more room for me.  Every city the whole world round will just be another American town, oh how peaceful it will be, we'll set everybody free ... They all hate us anyhow, so let's drop The Big One now.""

 Is Randy Newman being too sarcastic, too harsh?  Just look at the anti-French movement among the republicanus neanderthalis recently -- ""nuke France and gimme some Freedom Fries with my burger"" -- and it seems clear that if anything he is too kind.

 Thank goodness for Randy Newman in times like these.  Along with Mose Allison, Stan Ridgway (see my 7/29/04 review of his brilliant latest, SNAKEBITE), and a few other mavericks, he understands America's dark side well enough to deflate its pretensions and hypocrisy  with humor, from the inside."
,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"After a few albums of searching for a sound, Newman experimented and finally found his sound on ""Sail Away"". He experimented so much, in fact, that ""Randy Newman Live"" was released as a stopgap in 1971;it also previewed 2 songs from this album in stripped-down piano-only versions. The ""alternate"" take of the title track on this reissue shows just how much Newman experimented. Pounding anthemic rhythyms gave way to more lush but not overstated arrangements. The final release was very much worth the wait. Newman brings orchestra back into the fray after completely abandoning it on ""12 Songs"" (most likely the abandonment came as a result of the use - and sometimes abuse - of orchestra on his debut album). Newman's piano and the orchestra meld wonderfully in the mix. Some of the arrangements are downright amazing (especially on the title track and ""He Gives Us All His Love""). Thematically the album could not be more diverse: God, death, politics, satire at a Swiftian level, sex, and success. Newman's ability to communicate cynical satire in a way that takes itself seriously without seeming self-righteous is displayed all over this album. When he's funny he's also profound. ""God's Song"" is hilarious while at the same time chilling. The same could be said for the sadly still all too relevant ""Political Science"". In the midst of these songs, the serious numbers are almost shocking. There probably hasn't been a more candid song about death and belief than ""Old Man"". Newman claims that audiences have walked out on this one, so he's stopped playing it. It's a great song, but yes, an absolute downer. ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" evokes the era the song is set in complete with breeze and front porch swing. ""Memo to My Son"" is an absolutely hilarious song about parenting; the character in the song promises to show his son how smart he is, and then rattles off clich after clich. ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" has become a very recognizable song, maybe one of Newman's best known songs (even for people who have no idea who Randy Newman is).
The bonus tracks on the reissue are interesting: ""Let It Shine"" is an upbeat and happy song more akin to Newman's movie soundtracks of late. It was written for a sitcom that apparently never aired, which explains the mood. ""Maybe I'm Doing it Wrong"" was included on ""Randy Newman Live""; this is the studio version complete with orchestration. The rest are demos of songs on ""Sail Away"". All are good tracks that complement the album well.
It's no surprise that this album is considered a classic by many critics. It's one of Newman's best, and one of his best-sellers. A good album to introduce someone to Newman's music. It was the first Newman album I heard, and I've been a voracious fan ever since."
,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"I wrote a review for this album back in '03. At the time I was committed to the lush sounding music of Yes, Genesis, ELP, radiohead, etc. In comparison Randy Newman seemed like a scar to my prized music collection. Skip forward 5 years and I see how time has not only eased me into Newman's music but has made me an admirer. I have since realized that Newman stands among the great social satirists - and that's everybody, not just the singer-songwriters. Whether it's pollution/industrialization (Burn On), Religion (He Gives us All his love, God's Song), Death (Old Man), Fame (Lonely at the Top), Reminiscing (Dayton Ohio 1903, Last Night I had a Dream ), Perversion/Lust (Leave Your Hat on), American Ignorance/Racism (Sail Away) - Randy's craft is undeniably poinant, honest, and meticulous in it's disection of the human heart and our social practices."
,B00123M8ZY,1,1,4,"Love the song, and have done so since the 1970s. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get it download to my computer. Not a problem I've ever had with iTunes."
,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"This is easily one of the best CDs I have in my collection and that's saying a lot--I have a fair amount of CDs! Randy Newman really blew me away with these songs and ballads that hit the nail on the head with so much social and political commentary--not to mention satire--while managing to keep the tunes catchy and easy on the ear. Randy's use of major and minor keys enhances the songs all the more, especially in stellar numbers like ""Lonely at the Top"" which discusses quite frankly the price of celebrity; ""Sail Away"" about slavery in America from the point of view of a slave trader in Africa during the time of slavery; deep thoughts about God heard in both ""He Gives Us All His Love"" and ""God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind);"" the evils of potential nuclear warfare in ""Political Science"" while pointing out that the people dropping the bombs would be too ignorant to realize that they're ruining the world instead of making it a better place; sex in ""You Can Leave Your Hat On;"" ""Memo to My Son"" which shows how an older man really doesn't know all that much about life; the memorable ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" and more. Several of the songs are also quite amusing such as ""Memo to My Son"" and ""Political Science.""

Another thing I like about this edition of ""Sail Away"" is that we get some fine bonus tracks not found on the original CD release (and they certainly weren't on the original record album release, either). Listen for bonus tracks that are truly special like ""Let It Shine;"" a studio version of ""Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong;"" earlier renditions of ""Dayton, Ohio-1903"" and ""Sail Away"" as well as a demo of ""You can Leave Your Hat On.""

This is a must-have album for any Randy Newman fan and people just discovering Randy would also do well to get this so they can enjoy it as much as I do every time I listen to it! I highly recommend this excellent album by the great Randy Newman."
,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"Sail Away released in 1972 finds Randy Newman at his cynical and satirical best.  He skewers with a sharp knife such as on the title track when he sings from the point of a view of a slave trader, dreaming of making the world a better place for America through nuclear annihilation on ""Political Science"" or ranting against religion ""God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind).  ""Last Night I Had A Dream"" features some prime slide guitar work from Ry Cooder.  He looks back on a simpler time in ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"", while looking at the contemporary side of Ohio in ""Burn On""."
,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"Randy Newman / Sail Away (bonus tracks CD):  The tongue-in-cheeked one releases a Masterpiece of subtle social comic folk.  No one writes like Randy, and no one can sing um like Randy.  This is a Masterpiece album.  Five Stars."
,B00123NGNM,1,1,5,Great song.
,B00123NGNM,1,1,4,Bread was one of the best.
,B00123M3CW,-1,1,5,Memories
,B00123M3CW,1,1,5,I love this song! Excellent quality recording. And now it's a part of my music library.
,B00123M3CW,1,1,5,LOVE this song.  Love that I can purchase 1 or 2 songs I like from Amazon.  Doesn't take all my phone memory and I can hear what I want by sitting up playlists.
,B00123M3CW,1,1,4,Another of the great 1980's music collections that is great. A classic group of that era with some wonderful songs.
,B00123N8EO,1,1,4,A classic
,B00123N8EO,1,1,5,Perhaps the best CSN song ever.
,B00123N8EO,-1,1,5,"Another song about the Vietnam war. God Bless the soldiers that did not
come back alive and those that suffered from physical and emotional injuries.
The war mongers like the manufacturer of Agent Orange made their money
while poisoning and killing our soldiers.  I believe the manufacturer was DuPont.
Lets not forget that George Bushwacker normalized relations with the People's
Republic of North Vietnam.  To this day Hanoi has never acknowledged
the existences of POW's held after the war ended.  Bushwacker slapped every
soldiers face that served over in the Nam. Daddy got him exempt from fighting there."
,B00123N8EO,1,1,5,If you love 60's music this is a must have for your collection.  CSN had a lot of great hits and this is just one of them.
,B00123M3CW,1,1,5,My kind of music!

,B00123M3CW,1,1,5,Love this song :)
,B00123MBKQ,1,-1,3,"If you really want to buy this, get the remastered version instead.  It has nicer packaging, better sound quality and 30 minutes of bonus material.  To find it, search on History of Grateful Dead (it won't show up if look for Bear's Choice)."
,B00123MBKQ,1,-1,3,"The Bear's Choice Expanded Edition focuses on the Grateful Dead live in concert. Four additional tracks are added to the original seven and the late Ron McKernan(Pig Pen) sings on six of them.
The opening five acoustic tracks are warm and intimate if not overly spectacular. The Pig Pen sung Katie Mae stands out a bit from the rest. The Smokestack Lightning jams are a bit excessive even though they can be a bit mesmerizing if you merely have them on in the background. However, the highlights of this disc are Pig Pen's stylish singing on Big Boss Man and Hard To Handle. Old Piggie sure knew how to sing the blues.
Anyway, definitely like Jerry Garcia's interpretation of Sitting On Top Of The World. Again, Good Lovin' is another bonus track on this CD as it was on Europe 72. The jam is somewhat excessive although the drum solo is pretty captivating.
Again like Europe 72, several good moments and I like the idea of both acoustic and electric sides of the Grateful Dead. However some of the jamming certainly goes off the deep end. My only advise is know how much endless instrumental noodling that you can take."
,B00123LEUY,1,1,5,"As powerful today as when it was originally released. The melody is so captivating that you find yourself forgiving the guy who can't commit. :)

,B00123LEUY,1,1,5,A classic - can't go wrong with a little America
,B00123LEUY,1,1,4,One of America's biggest hits. All the cover bands played it. A good song to dance to.
,B00123LEUY,1,1,5,Great music!
,B00123LEUY,1,1,5,"This was one of my favorite songs when I was a teenager, and it's still in my #1 playlist today.  There's a real feeling of longing in this song that always touches me."
,B00123LEUY,1,1,5,"One of my favorite songs to sing along to driving down the road when I am by myself! Its one of the few songs on the album I like, so glad you can pick and choose songs by download, rather than buy the whole album."
,B00123LEUY,1,1,5,Sister Goldern hair was a song I rediscovered while looking at MP3s on Amazon. Once I heard and recognized it I added it to my collection.
,B00123LEUY,1,1,5,"This song is a great classic Rock song that can never be out of style , I dare you not to sing along ."
,B00123LEUY,1,1,4,"Love this song from yesteryear.  Always enjoyed the band America, and was happy to download an old favorite.  . . ."
,B00123NC8G,1,1,4,"...stands the test of the time. Go Your Own Way, Dreams, Don't Stop, its all been said before. If you haven't heard this album make it your mission to."
,B00123NC8G,1,1,5,"Although Fleetwood Mac was an established band at the time of Rumours release, this album made them eternal icons. This is by far their greatest album which they received recognition for from the Grammy's. I'm not sure about the ladies but all the guys definitely loved Stevie Nicks and followed her career after this one. I highly recommend it. One of the all time best albums I have ever heard and although much of the music of other bands and singers goes by the wayside with age, this one does not. You can't help thinking that the edginess of the band in a state of turmoil from broken relationships actually inspired them to write so many hits for one album. If you don't think so, you can ""Go Your Own Way"".

,B00123NC8G,1,1,4,"I heard this on the radio, and fell in love with the guitar riffs and the almost ethereal vocals. Not the usual Fleetwood Mac."
,B00123NC8G,1,1,5,This album brought back so many great memories. I loved ( still do) Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Knicks and the price from Amazon makes it a bargain all the way around.
,B00123NC8G,1,1,5,"Can remember buying my first copy of Fleetwood Mac's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rumours/dp/B00123NC8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rumours</a>&nbsp;as an LP in 1977 after hearing ""Dreams"" on the radio three or four times in one morning. Written by Stevie Nicks, it became the only U.S. number one hit for the group, and even today, so many years later, it remains one of their best known songs. That first LP went it's own way years later, but was replaced with a CD copy. That one still surfaces in my untidy collection now and then, but when I saw the MP3 version here, it was an instant no brainer to grab it.

That classic classic disc was the number-one album on the charts for over 30 weeks, and Rolling Stone named ""Rumours"" as the 25th greatest album of all time. Today it ranks as the 10th best-selling album ever, with more than 40 million copies sold to date, and it features four top 10 singles. ""Rumors"" won the 1977 best album Grammy, and even 35 years later, it today remains remains the band's most successful effort, and ready to be shared with yet another generation.

These are the album tracks on the MP3 version here:

1. Second Hand News (LP Version); 2:53
2. Dreams (LP Version); 4:13
3. Never Going Back Again (LP Version); 2:15
4. Don't Stop (LP Version); 3:13
5. Go Your Own Way (LP Version); 3:35
6. Songbird (LP Version); 3:23
7. The Chain (LP Version); 4:31
8. You Make Loving Fun (LP Version); 3:29
9. I Don't Want To Know (LP Version); 3:15
10. Oh Daddy (LP Version); 3:57
11. Gold Dust Woman (LP Version); 5:02

For this listener, the only other song that I would have liked included here is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Springs-Live-Album-Version/dp/B0027FZ1X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Springs (Live Album Version)</a>&nbsp;as it was on the 2004 remastered reissue of the album, but luckily for us, it's still available here as a single. The quality of the recordings in this MP3 version are excellent, and the carryover from the LP versions are excellent. Listen to the vocals and instrumentation and you'll see for yourself.

For newcomers to Fleetwood Mac, the group consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. This was their eleventh studio album, and the recording sessions were marked by quite a bit of interpersonal strife between members of the group; and these experiences showed up in some of the album's lyrics. There are plenty of postings out there on the 'Net about the background behind this album, so I won't add to them here. Needless to say, ""Rumors""  remains the group's most successful effort, and for many it's the best album they made.

As a side note, the front cover of album featured a stylized shot of drummer Mick Fleetwood and vocalist Stevie Nicks dressed in her ""Rhiannon"" stage persona. The photograph was taken by Herbert Worthington, a friend of Stevie Nicks for over 30 years, and he and Stevie have collaborated on thousands of her best photographs over the years.

He reveals the full story of what really went into making Rumours, from the endless partying and relationship dramas to the creative struggles to write and record ""You Make Loving Fun,"" ""Don't Stop,"" ""Go Your Own Way,"" ""The Chain,"" and the other timeless tracks.

,B00123NC8G,1,1,5,"""Rumours"" probably forever ruined the old tried and True maxim ""no dating in the band!"" Anyone fed that line today can simply respond, ""yeah, that so didn't work for Fleetwood Mac."" Arguably, dating, not to mention other things, in the band likely gave Fleetwood Mac an ineffable edge to help them attain unimaginable heights of popular music. An unanswerable question lingers as to how the album would have turned out had the band's relationships not gone sour. No one will ever know, of course. And that's very much OK. Because regardless of the emotional miasma, drama, drugs and whatever else went on, the late 1970s line up of the then nearly 10 year old Fleetwood Mac released a hugely acclaimed, and not often disputed, classic rock/pop album.

No doubt the ""real"" rumors in the press and subsequent documentaries detailing the band members' intimacies and the undoubtedly uncomfortable situation surrounding the recording of the album have contributed to this album's staying power. Everyone likes a good drama, after all, especially from a distance. This may have led to the creation of a new recording industy marketing strategy: take a collection of great songs, add interpersonal drama and a mega-hit will result. Struggling band managers may have started complaining ""Hey! Why is no one dating in this band?!? Come on! Start kissing!"" The trick, of course, remains writing a collection of great songs. And without the unquestionably great songs the drama behind the classic ""Rumours"" (spelled in the British manner for obvious reasons) probably wouldn't hold anyone's interest for too long. Many may have come to this album titillated by the drama or mesmerized by the sales figures and ended up staying for a direct emotional connection to the music.

And this much hyperbolized, mega-selling, nearly ubiquitous and archetypal album definitely includes plenty of great songs. They mostly speak for themselves. And surprisingly they don't sound bitter or vindictive apart from a lyric here and there. Almost anyone alive and within ear distance of rock and pop radio from 1977 to the present has very likely heard many of these songs willingly or unwillingly. The generations born after the 1960s probably didn't even know that they've actually heard most of this album until they put it on. Likely they repeat, ""Oh yeah, I've heard that one! That's Fleetwood Mac?"" throughout the first listen.

The album's galloping fade up beginning, ""Second Hand News,"" pulls in helpless cochleas with the distinctive layering of Lindsey Buckingham's vocals and the nearly addictive hooks and catches between the vocals. The brain almost doesn't have time to respond before the vocals begin. The beautiful contrast of ""Dreams"" lets hungry brains know that this album isn't blandly homogenous, but unpredictable and adventurous. And the folk-rocky mostly finger-picked acoustic ""Never Going Back Again"" just adds to the sonorous intrigue. ""Don't Stop"" picks up the pace again which continues through the grinding and angry-without-being-angry ""Go Your Own Way."" An interlude with ""Songbird"" (the only track recorded in an arena) sets the stage for the poignant and hopeful ""The Chain,"" one of the album's highlights. And that's only the first song of side two, in the language of 33 1/3 LPs. The rest of the album maintains the momentum, ending with the intense and brooding ""Gold Dust Woman,"" supposedly about the lure of the snort. Only ""I Don't Want To Know"" and ""Oh Daddy"" come close to subpar songs, but only in contrast with the rest of the album.

""Rumours"" will likely stand for quite some time as one of the pinnacles of 1970s rock/pop. It still hasn't gone away. Whether future generations not yet emerged from birth canals also fervently embrace it remains to be seen. But rumor has it that they just might."
,B00123KEGO,1,1,4,Ordered for another person  Thank You
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,Great cd.
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,Great
,B00123KEGO,1,1,4,"I'm an old school Chicago fan from way back and I honestly didn't know what to expect from this collection, but weirdly I liked it. It sounds like 70's Chicago and there are plenty of horn arrangements here to get into. Plus it's Christmas. Feel good and flashback, I thought it was worth it."
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,"The music of Christmas, the sound of Chicago and the clarity of good vinyl!  A great album!"
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,Totally Awesome!!!
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,"Hey, if you like Chicago, then all I have to say in this review is, you'll love this Christmas CD!!!"
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,"I have over 500 Christmas songs on my iPod. Every year, I purchase a few more Christmas albums to add to the list. This year, I bought three Christmas albums from the group Chicago. Good stuff!"
,B00123KEGO,1,1,4,"I got this CD a few years back. My favorite track by far is Jolly Old Saint Nicholas, a song you don't hear that often. Chicago takes it and rocks it to perfection. God Rest Ye Marry Gentlemen is also a favorite of mine. Chicago has taken their trademark horn riffs and harmonies and have put out one heck of a rockin' holiday album. There are slow tempo songs too that sound just as great. This is a CD to get if you want a rockin' Christmas."
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,"Rhino Records which has already released a dozen of Chicago's first albums as enhanced re-issues, has put out this 20 song offering.  Chicago : What's It Gonna Be Santa"" is a re-issue of ""Chicago XXV"" , a superb contemporary collection of Christmas classics with a Chicago original mixed in. This new release however, adds six newly recorded tracks to the 14 on Chicago XXV, making an already good thing even better.

The original selection of Christmas tunes is simply terrific. Chicago, following in the approach of ""Night and Day Big Band"" wherein the American supergroup re-arranged big band classics with an inventive and fresh variety of styles, tempos and grooves, takes a similar artistic path with their Christmas release.

Such holiday standards as ""White Christmas"" and ""The Christmas Song"" are done in an uptempo pop-funk style while ""Let It Snow!"" shows off Chicago's ability to really rock in a blues shuffle groove. Bill Champlin's soulful ""Have Yourself a Merry Little"" Christmas"" gives this moody classic a wonderfully original blues treatment. And, throughout the disc, the legendary Chicago horns play through trombonist Jimmy Pankow's melodic arrangements in their unique, warm and fat style.

The six new tracks really compliment the original CD, adding even more new styles and sounds. The disc's opener, Bobby Lamm's ""Winter Wonderland"" lays down an infectious rock groove with excellent vocal arrangements making great use of Chicago's arsenal of superb vocalists. Lead guitarist Keith Howland who covers some tunes in concert, shows off his first studio lead vocal with a quick tempo pop rock version of ""Jolly Old Saint Nicholas"". Bassist Jason Scheff's tenor has never sounded better than on ""This Christmas"", which has a wonderful 70's soul retro sound with the Chicago horns propelling the arrangement. Bill Champlin again shows why he is probably the greatest blue-eyed soul singer around with a gutsy, funky ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"". It sounds like an odd combination, but this track really works.

Following up to his terrific arrangement of ""Let It Snow!"", trumpeter Lee Loughnane pens a superb shuffle version of ""Sleigh Ride"". Again, he steps behind the microphone to tackle lead vocal duties and his deep voice, reminiscent of the late Terry Kath's depth and timbre lends itself perfectly to this classic.

""Chicago: What's It Gonna Be Santa"" is just terrific and certainly one of the most inventive and eclectic holiday CD's by any artist. There's something for everyone here to enjoy.

Essential holiday listening as well as essential Chicago."
,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,"I hadn't even realized that the powerhouse group Chicago had done a Christmas album.  This is a great album by one of the best bands in the world.  Their treatment of some of the classic Christmas songs is typical Chicago style.  Their muscial stylings are not at all hampered by limitations of the seasonal music as one reviewer suggests.  Track #18 ""A Childs Prayer"" is so sweetly performed.  You'd think a band like this wouldn't be able to play something like it without overdoing it.  The songs that Chicago chose to place on this album tell me that this is not just a performance album.  Rather, Christmas has a certain meaning to the members of Chicago.

I believe this should definately become part of your holiday music library.  It's Christmas music with a jolt.  Please treat yourself!"
,B00123LZT4,1,1,5,A+
,B00123LZT4,1,-1,3,yep !
,B00123LZT4,1,1,5,Randy Travis' rich voice lends itself to make this story song heartwarming.
,B00123LZT4,1,1,4,SATISFIED
,B00123MCL4,1,1,5,I love it!
,B00123MCL4,1,1,5,"This is one of the better compilations available. The re-mastering was done very well and doesn't seem to take anything away from the original flair; it does not unduly alter anything either. Good job. It sounds great. It really brings out Buck's and Don's vocals. Occasionally, I listen to it, my mind reaching to much younger years. In the late sixties, I had the good fortune to meet Buck and Don after a life performance I attended. What great guys they were. This CD does them justice. I love it."
,B00123MCL4,1,1,5,"I had this cd before but can't find it. I went thru a phase where it was 100% ole school country before work. It put me in the best possible mood. So I had a nice collection of cds, still do, but this Buck Owens cd I cannot find. So I'm repurchasing  it for my sanity... ;)"
,B00123NNO4,1,1,5,Good music from a good time in music.  Great tune to have in your Library.
,B00123NNO4,1,1,5,"The single was great "" lonely Boy"" not sure about the rest of the album. Brings back memories of the 70's"
,B00123MCL4,1,1,4,I like it!
,B00123MCL4,1,1,4,Good album for someone checking out Buck Owens
,B00123MCL4,1,1,5,"There is only one Buck Owens!!, I grew up in his hometown of Bakersfield, and I know all his tunes, used to listen to him at the Crystal Palace, in Bakersfield, all your faves are on this collection, even Tiger By The Tail!!"
,B00123MCL4,1,1,5,"I first heard of Buck Owens thru the Beatles' Act Naturally version back in 1965 or so. As time went on I began to appreciate Buck's remarkable band and talent. His records sounded so clean and featured twangy Fender guitars. His band leader, Don Rich was a model of restrained professionalism. Clean and accurate picking, not fast or flashy. Buck was an outstanding singer and his two part harmonies were his trademark. All these songs were No. 1s on the country charts and date from Act Naturally in 1963 to 1988's Streets of Bakersfield with Dwight Yoakum featuring Flaco Jiminez on accordian. WOW! What a great CD this is. There isn't a bad cut on it! If you only want one Buck Owens CD, this is the one! It's too bad most younger people only remember him as a cornfield clown on Hee-Haw, because Buck Owens was truly one of the greatest country stars in its history."
,B00123MCL4,1,1,5,"For starters, this is a great sounding CD BUT the only addition to it not found on Rhino Records earlier releases of Buck Owens ""Greatest"" (Volume 1 and 2 is the ""Streets Of Bakersfield/Dwight Yoakam""..if you want this cut in an elegant looking cover photo with less tracks than the earlier 2 volumes than this is for you.
The earlier releases of Vol. 1 and 2 both boast strong liner notes and the usual superb sound quality Rhino is known for.
You can't go wrong either way."
,B00123NB5K,1,1,5,The Words...the words...the words!!!  Lord I'm Available to You.  How True...how True...how True.  People buy this and you will be blessed.
,B00123NB5K,1,1,5,"This is an awesome worship song, make sure you are not driving while listening because you may take your hand off of the wheel in worship."
,B00123NB5K,1,1,5,AWESOME FOR PRAISE AND WORSHIP!!!!!
,B00123NB5K,1,1,5,This song sounds great on my Kindle and Roku! I am so glad that I purchased it! It was definitely a great find!
,B00123NB5K,1,1,4,I have loved this song for many years.  I am going to teach it to the young people I work with.  The message in the words to this song is wonderful.
,B00123NB5K,1,1,5,Love this song. I was glad to have found it at such a great price. Clear sound and instant delivery.
,B00123NB5K,1,1,5,Very uplifting and inspirational! The words express the True sentiments of my heart and helps to express gratitude to God.
,B00124209M,1,1,4,"Love the song.  It has a very personal meaning to me.  I hope the best for this group.  It's hard to come up with 20 words to review a song, but wanted to give it a thumbs up."
,B00124209M,1,1,5,A Classic!
,B00124209M,1,1,5,Love the song
,B00124209M,1,1,5,was looking for this song for a long time and didn't want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didn't want.
,B00124209M,1,1,5,".
...What a tough song! Gets me groov'in good. Wonderfully produced too. It's perfect. I think my favorite Motown tune."
,B00124209M,1,1,5,Truly the best of Sam and Dave.  Some of the songs I had never heard.  It is a True discovery of something old yet so fresh.
,B00124209M,1,1,5,I got a great quality song for free.  The amazon mp3 set up works well.  There weren't any problems with the song and it is nice to be able to download it and put on my phone or iTunes with no problems.
,B0012422HM,1,1,5,"Remembering songs I like from the past is a refeshing hobby. So glad this tune was available which combines the soaring harmonies from the 60's, the naive love  sentiments of the 70's and the chugging guitars from the 80's.  I wish Diesel had been around longer."
,B0012422HM,1,1,4,A classic piece of pop music.
,B0012422HM,1,1,5,"This song came out when I was in high school and I fell in love with it. I still love it. It's a very up-tempo song with a memorable guitar riff and fun lyrics that tell the story of a road trip on the California Coast in an old Rambler: ""I'll have a burger and a root beer. You feed the heap some other grade."" I don't know how this didn't become a bigger hit when it was first released. But, almost as soon as this song was released, it disappeared along with the band that recorded it. Hard to believe this wasn't even an American band! They captured the feel of the American road trip perfectly. This is one of those songs that belongs on everyone's Summer Vacation mix tape. Or flash drive."
,B0012422HM,-1,1,5,"This song could have been written for me,describes my 20s in California,I also had a Rambler,had great memories in that car.."
,B00124675A,1,1,4,"this was a good song , thanks for selling it to me, I really appreciate that , i am out of words to write about a song."
,B00124675A,1,1,5,"I'd never heard this song before Fringe set me onto it, but I'm very glad that it did. The emotive writing combined with the cautiously-tempoed synth sounds create a swelling sense of bittersweet love. The vocals and lyrics work exceedingly well together.
A quiet, unassuming song that packs an emotional punch, ""Only You"" is certainly worth the dollar."
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,"Betty wright really put the words together when she made this hit.  I like the melodies and I love the way she sang this song.  If you are having a party include this song, your guest will love it."
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,Not a big record in the 70s but the story in the song was just like Do You Think I'm Sexy by Rod Stewart.
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,I really enjoyed listening to the song.  It was of good quality.  I have no issues with the song at all.
,B001246D68,1,1,5,great stuff. I love all of the songs on their albums and now have put some songs into my phone while working out
,B001241XMW,1,1,4,"It's a timeless recording with a good beet and is fun to liaison  to.

It just get you moving.

The end"
,B001241XMW,1,1,5,. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great
,B001241XMW,1,1,5,A great song at a great price! I am glad that I have the option of buying individual songs when I do not want the entire CD.
,B001241XMW,1,1,5,"I've always loved this song and I love the fact that most of Amazon's songs are only .99 each, so I don't have to buy the entire album and get songs I either don't like or have never heard of."
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,I love my music and enjoy listening to Ole school classics
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,A song that expresses a particular time
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,Love it
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,"Oh Betty Wright, you put the right song out and if no one read the words to the song please do because listen to the beat and sound is not where you will find the most enjoyable moments it the words. I feel this song in my Spirit. Thanks for being in my life."
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,This is among my best songs ever.
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,Who doesn't love this song
,B001246EMG,1,1,4,good
,B001246EMG,1,1,5,IT SOUND GREAT WITH SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM. IT BRING BACK GOOD TIME CHILDHOOD MEMORIES. I CRANK THIS UP AT DINNER  BY THE FIREPLACE
,B00124675A,1,1,4,Another classic from the 80s. This group was always fun to listen to and made some great alternative classics.  Good song to bring back memories.
,B00124675A,1,1,5,"Love this song,  Berings me back to an easier type of life.  My girlfriend says it was from Yazoo, and I thought iit came from Upstairs at Erics.  Turns we were both right.  Wish more of this type of work existed."
,B00124675A,1,1,5,I've loved this song since the Chocolate War. It really gave such a heart wrenching mood to the movie. Its been one song that has inspired many in my family from the lyrics to the melody. May I always remember Yaz for this unique song.
,B00124675A,1,1,5,"I won't lie.  This is a bit of a generic song review.  But what I can say about "" Only You "" is that as an older consumer of classic rock from the 80's and such, (and a few other music genre's from then), I do find this piece a rather agreeable tune and enjoy it every time it comes up on my mp3 player!"
,B001246EY4,1,1,5,Compulsively catchy cover
,B001246EY4,1,1,5,Good Song!
,B001246EY4,1,1,5,What can I say............Love Talking Heads.
,B001246EY4,1,1,5,"What a great song.  I love the Talking Heads anyway.  I didn't care for many punk bands but some just hit the groove and they did in a big way.  Great song for your music collection and money well spent.  Your friends and pets will thank you for buying this one.

My cat Sammy is a jazz nut and she goes crazy when I play this she absolutely loves it who knew it would be such a big crossover hit?"
,B001246EY4,1,1,5,I love this song. Wasnt written by Talking Heads but I like there version better. As with all songs theres always memories attached to them. I would recommend this song to everyone.
,B00124259C,1,1,5,"George Benson.....what can I say, to me he is one of the greatest guitar players of all times."
,B00124259C,1,1,5,"This album's signature song  by one of the most under valued, talented artist in jazz --George Benson, represents his first excursion into singing with his own guitar accompaniment. It is still wonderful 30s later."
,B00124259C,1,1,5,Have always loved this song!
,B00124259C,1,1,4,Loved this song for 20 years.
,B00124259C,1,1,5,I love Jazz and George Benson is my favorite!!!
,B00124259C,1,1,5,this is one of my favorite George Benson songs. Just love the guitar playing and the lyrics to the song...they ring so True.
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,I fell in love with George Benson  back in the 70s with Weekend in LA after that I was hooked. Got to see him in concert once but the way he plays his guitar  is so moving.  Yes he sings too but the guitar is the best
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,Breezin is like my favorite instrumental songs by GB just love it and the whole cd and album he is the best
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,This song is so smooth and relaxing.  It brings a smile to my face each time I hear it.  You should enjoy it.
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,"This is a perfect theme song for my sons sailboat. I gave his boat the name ""Breezin"" because my sailboats name was ""Gust-o"". George Benson's Breezin is the perfect background music for sailing."
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,Beautiful song for work or driving. Excellent guitar. Nice memories.
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,What's not to love?
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,As good as it gets.
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,The greatest soft-core jazz instrumental ever.
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS. JUST TOP NOTCH. I MUST SHARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
,B0012468WC,1,1,4,"Simply beautiful, mellow and puts me in a relaxed mood, especially in the evening when I'm winding down after a long day. An old favorite that continues to reverberate even when I finish listening to it. You go, George Benson, cause you still GOT IT!"
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,I love this song! Excellent quality recording. And now it's a part of my music library.
,B0012468WC,1,1,5,"this is one of George bensons greatest and well known cuts,it is a laid back old school jam, check this cut ,you won't be disappointed!!!!!"
,B001244AOU,1,1,4,"If you want one Assoc. song, thuis is it. While Cherish and Windy were sweet and breezy(some pun intended), ther first hit
""Along Comes Mary"" is the best evidence of their talents. The opening bars are enchanting and the recorder solo in the middle a nice break. Of course, their harmonies were great, they just were a little too ""sugary"" for the times. I like this song better now than when it came out. I'd give it 4.5 starts if I could."
,B001248AOG,1,1,5,"This song still sounds soooo good, so smooth, and makes me feel like I'm ""breezin'""! Other artists have recorded this, but none have been able to touch this version. This is George Benson at his best."
,B0012464K8,1,1,4,"This song was the first song I ever saw on a music video back in the 70s . . . Chicago was just beginning their run of hits . . . still sounds just as great except now listening to it comes with a lot of great memories.  I think I'm gonna buy the greatest hits album.  I used to have it on vinyl, but gave it to #2 son.  MP3 is nice, but you can't beat the richness of the real stuff . . . recommend it to everyone."
,B001246G5G,1,1,5,i started one day thinking about my wife this song came to my mind.iwent to music on my kindle fire and found it.it brought back memories i have been listening to it since thanks tommy a.
,B001248ABY,1,1,5,LOVE IT
,B001248ABY,1,1,5,MY SECOND FAVORITE SONG EVER !!!!!!
,B001248ABY,-1,1,4,"Another remake!! And one I wouldn't have bought IF we had more time to preview before buying. If you're looking for the original, this is not the one for you."
,B001248ABY,1,1,5,I love this song. ;)
,B001248ABY,1,1,5,Love it. Alexa added it to my music. I love Alexa (Echo) she does everything I ask her to!!!
,B001248ABY,1,1,5,great song!!
,B001248ABY,1,1,5,golden oldie for those of us who appreciate the music of the 60s and 70s
,B001248ABY,-1,1,4,"Tommy James was co-writer on the song, as it wasn't a great big hit, it did receive quite a bit of air time on radios."
,B001248ABY,1,1,5,I remember hearing this song from when I was a child to a full grown adult. I never knew who sang this song until now. It is part of my library.
,B001248ABY,1,1,5,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tighter-Tighter-LP-Version/dp/B001248ABY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tighter, Tighter (LP Version)</a>&nbsp;I absolutely love this song. The band is tight and the mood is  right.
Whenever I hear it I remember Fort Sill, Oklahoma; my first posting after Vietnam. Many memories."
,B0012486CM,1,1,5,love it!
,B0012486CM,1,1,5,This is one of those songs I can hear over and over again and still enjoy it whenever I choose to listen.
,B0012444RI,1,1,5,"One hit wonder, but what a hit. Perfect top down road song."
,B0012444RI,1,1,5,"To my ""Drive Your Car"" playlistto date this one is over 10 hours longgreat on L-O-N-G Road TripsHit The Gas!"
,B0012444RI,-1,1,5,"to cruise by in the early 1970's.  I remember liking this song along with Chicago, BS&T and the Buckinghams.  Rock with Brass was the big thing then."
,B0012444RI,1,1,5,Perfect classic rock 70s song. I remember hearing this song as a youngster and falling in love with the beat!
,B0012444RI,-1,1,5,You are
,B0012444RI,-1,1,5,"This song STILL sounds great.  I wonder if any Blood Sweat & Tears and/or Chicago horn section guys participated during the recording session that made the final cut?

WFN

Las Vegas, NV  USA"
,B0012444RI,1,1,4,"Love this old classic rock song from... a long time ago. Still rocks in my mind. The lead guitar licks are simple and the lead vocals gruff, but that was a style, used more by Steppenwolf than this band."
,B0012444RI,1,1,5,"Wouldn't have got it if I didn't like it, right?"
,B001248CEY,1,1,5,"If you like music of this era, then you already know Ambrosia is a great group with good hits. Enough said"
,B001248CEY,1,1,4,Pretty oldie but goodie. Added to my collection. A nice song to listen to with your main sqeeze. Good one.
,B001248CEY,1,1,5,Heartfelt and romantic!
,B001248CEY,1,1,5,As good as an MP3 gets.
,B001248CEY,1,1,5,An amazing band and this song was one of their most popular songs. Amazing Harmonies and beautifully blended.  Strong and easy feel to the music...beautiful.
,B001248CEY,1,1,5,Great Music!
,B001248CEY,1,1,5,"This is my absolute favorite song from my youth. This remastered version retains everything I loved about my original 45. Yep, still my favorite."
,B001248AGY,1,1,4,"I was looking for this song in Record Stores but they only have un used 45rpm format and doesn't sound clean. Amazon has this mp3 version with oustanding quality. I totally recomend this song, if you're oldies lover you won't be disappointed."
,B001248AGY,1,1,5,"Despite being born in 1958, when Doo Wop was giving way to rock and roll, I've developed a fondness for it as I get older.  These guys knew how to sing, and they did it without any gimmicks using nothing but their voices.  You've got to admire that."
,B00124AI4Q,1,1,5,Love it!
,B00124AI4Q,1,1,5,Love song!
,B00124ACGA,1,1,5,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
,B00124ACGA,1,1,5,"I can't say anything bad about this recording.  It's one of those old songs that makes you say ""they just don't make 'em like that anymore.
First rate singing, and instrumentals.  I love the use of the musette (French accordion) in the background.  The tune is haunting, the singing effortless, my only regret is that the recording is in mono.  Definitely worth it."
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,great song great voice
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,"very gool. get it.

This harkens back to the golden era of country music for me. Mind you, Twitty didn't write this. But his rendition is up there with Pointer Sisters. This song just ooozes that divey western themed honky-tonk bar, smoke to the ceiling, steel guitars, lots of denim."
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,One of my favorite songs of all time - and I normally do not care for country
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,"great song, romantic"
,B001248CF8,1,1,4,One of Conway's sexy songs....
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,"For a not Twitty fan, I am sure giving him a lot of five stars. I once saw him in person, long story, but so funny I had to just go with it. Really like the song."
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,Love this song now as I did long ago. Just a memory that never left when it could have made all the difference. What an awesome song for so many women to hear the understanding of the needs of some of us when applicable to the age and time frame. Grateful to be able to add his songs to my music in the cloud. I am soft hearted and sentimental. A pleasure to hear.  SaraBeth
,B001248CF8,1,1,4,It's very wonderful!
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,a very good mood setting song which makes you feel touched by the singer. he has a good voice & catchy tune.
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,love his music and I will be purchasing more in the near future as long as my wife lets me order
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,"Pure Love, melts your soul when you hear him, always wishing it was you feeling his slow hand.  It would be a good lesson for all husbands to learn because it is what what wives want to feel."
,B001248CF8,1,1,5,"The wife picked this song and if it was up to her our kindle would be filled with all of Conway Twitty's songs LOL, this song is one of our favorites because it is the song we always pick to slow dance too, hey what can I say we rednecks like to slow dance!"
,B001248CF8,1,1,4,"I am a fan and love this type of singing but i also like metalica, miley cyrus, and kid rock, so go figure."
,B001248CF8,1,1,4,"He can put out a great song, so I had to get this one . Its nice to only pay for the ones you want. And this was a keeper!"
,B0012460GG,1,-1,3,really enjoy this song.  hadn't heard it in years.  saw it was on amazon.  ordered it and i love it being in my collection.  i will continue ordering from amazon.
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,I love the oldies and for the price it's a great buy. Some of these hits are hard to find but not here. I recommend it to all my friends.
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,It's one of my old time favorites. Takes me back to when I was a kid in Los Angeles. Barbara Lewis had one smooth voice.
,B00124AW9M,1,1,5,"As a teenager, two years ahead in school of my peers, I became a total introvert.  I first heard this song a couple of years out of grad school, and it flowed into a new life that had been forming for me.  I can still listen to this song and feel the empowering surge it gave me the first time I ever heard it.

The Talking Heads were not only a great band, but they understood the human condition far better than almost any of their time."
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,all time favorites
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,great
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,"This song showcases Barbara at ""her very best.""  Another one of those ""keeper"" songs from R & B/soul music's heyday from the early 1960s to the early 1970s."
,B0012460GG,1,1,4,This is called an Oldie but Goodie  It brings back a lot of Good Old memories. I'm glad I was able to find it.again.
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,Happy with Item
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,"My favorite all-time song since '63.  This is version (mix) suites me better than ""US Version"", which seems softer, or less edgy."
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,"My favorite all-time song since '63.  I like the mix on the ""Her Very Best"" album release better.  It seems louder and has more presence.  This version seems to have been ""softened"" up a bit.  Still good though."
,B0012460GG,1,1,4,like
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,great
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,Great music! Loved IT! Thanks A Lot!
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,A great CD.
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,Very Enjoyable
,B0012460GG,1,1,5,"Another excellent MP3 from Amazon.  ""Hello Stranger"" is the original version and it sounds great."
,B00124AW5Q,1,1,5,I really like some of this song and needed to add them to my collection after hearing them at a friends house.
,B00124AW5Q,1,1,4,"came quickly, item as described"
,B00124AW5Q,1,1,5,"There is a t-shirt that says, ""I may be old, but I saw all the great concerts"", including Talking Heads in Minneapolis. His music just FORCES you to dance."
,B00124AW5Q,-1,1,5,my friend started singing this the other day and couldn't get it out of our heads - she wasn't born yet when it came out.
,B00124AW5Q,1,1,4,"The Talking heads, they were not one of my favorite bands but this song to me was their best. When I first heard this song I thought the group was a bunch of pyromanic's. I do like this song in fact I think this was the only song that really hit the charts. I don't know why I liked this song except for the background music was really cool and the lyrics was something different. This song is mainly for 80's lover's but if your willing to spread your genre give it a try, you may like it.

THX,
Kris L. CocKayne"
,B00124AW5Q,1,1,5,DRUMS DRUMS DRUMS in this song are fantastic. A great track for any best of the 80's hits compilation mix
,B00124AW5Q,1,1,5,I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music
,B00124AW5Q,1,1,5,Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!
,B001249RDY,1,1,5,love it!
,B001249RDY,1,1,5,"One of the ""rock"" songs by this band. Very hard driving and one of their better songs but I have not listened to a wide range of their music. I just happen to like this song with the drum solo and hot little guitar riffs"
,B001249RDY,-1,1,5,"Too often performers do a remake of a popular song and don't add anything new to it creating a ""why bother"" situation(are you listening Phil Collins?). Chicago took an already excellent song and expanded it and just plain ""tore it up!"". An excellent addition to my road trip jams for my motorcycle riding."
,B001249RDY,1,1,5,"Early Chicago was great - lots of very good music - I'm a man remains my personal favorite. I have heard various artists perform it - all good, but this one is best."
,B00124AI1E,1,1,5,"I LOVE this song. When you in a relationship and you find yourself lost for words, after a misunderstanding with your significant other just put this song on and let it do the making up for you. If you anything like me it is Hard For Me To Say I'm Sorry...but this song has helped me on plenty occasions. I give it a five star and AMAZON delivered it in a timely matter. Thanks Amazon!"
,B00124AI1E,-1,-1,2,Great  song great band love their music cant say enough bout chicago wish there were more bands with this type music today.
,B00124AI1E,1,1,5,really great love all there music have most of there songs listening to them from day one love peter voice
,B00124AI1E,1,1,5,cool
,B00124AI1E,1,1,5,Love it
,B00124AI1E,1,1,5,Another off my favorite bands-you can hear the heartbreak in the lyrics.
,B00124AI1E,1,1,5,Loved it!
,B00124AI1E,1,1,4,Good oldie classic
,B00124AI1E,1,1,5,Hard to say I';m sorryis excellent
,B00124A5Y4,1,1,5,"Smooth, old school, reminds me of those old high school dances where, for the most part, good times were had by all. Love it."
,B00124A5Y4,1,1,5,The Drifters what an awesome group. Love this song  they are such a great group to listen to. Comes highly recommended.
,B00124A5Y4,1,1,4,"This song will bring back many memories for those who are old enough to have been young when it first came out.  I even remember the ""sock hops"" and the lovely Carolyn...."
,B00124A5Y4,1,1,5,My wife and I love it when this is the ending of a wonderful dance party. Highly recommend this one.
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,"it was easy to find, it was easy to download and one of my more favorite songs from the 70's-80's"
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,It reminds me of when I would drive home from work with the windows down....enjoying the Jersey shore night! Great classic!
,B001248CDK,1,1,4,I've liked this song for a long time and it still sounds good to me. I need five more words.
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,Great Job I hope that you keep up the good job for electronic selling of music. Keep it up OK?
,B00124BD7M,1,1,5,Good stuff
,B00124BD7M,1,1,5,Great sound.
,B00124BD7M,1,1,5,"This song came out just when I was going through a bad break up and it gave me a lot of strength to get through it.  This song has always given me a good feeling from the opening chords to the very end.  This is when Chicago was a good rock band, before they started doing only ballads."
,B00124BD7M,1,1,4,"It is a very good song from a very good group. I suppose I'm not exactly a music critic, but that's my opinion."
,B00124BD7M,1,1,5,"Classic song from Chicago. I've always loved how Chicago infuses a little bit of the ""big band"" feel into their music with the brass sections. Feelin' Stronger Every Day is no differenthas a really cool ""jam session"" at the end."
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,as sad as a country song. Beautiful too.
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,Love it.
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,One of my favorite groups!
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,I wouldn't have purchased the album if I didn't like ambrosia. if you haven't listened to them before you should definitely give them a try.
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,Love it
,B001248CDK,-1,-1,3,Just one of those schmaltzy songs that no one will admit liking but everyone knows the words!
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,"Long time favorite, what ever happened to good music like this?"
,B00124B5NY,1,1,5,"I'm not a big-time country western fan, but I've liked this song for many years. The lyrics tell a sad story."
,B00124B5NY,1,1,5,"This was one of my signature songs as an upstart aspiring musician. Yes, I've added that to my resume of accomplishments.
This song will stick to you, and pop up most unexpectedly, but delightfully so. Give it a listen if you like the oldie moldy goldies."
,B00124B5NY,1,1,5,You don't hear music like this anymore. Added to my Kindle music for enjoyment when in the car through Aux speakers.
,B00124B5NY,1,1,5,"This is the way I remember the song.  Just a great rendition of the story, I could feel the song writter's message."
,B00124AX3C,1,1,4,"Hard to believe that it has been 15 years since the tragic death of Michael Hutchence, and the saddened end of INXS. Musically the 80's have been very strong to them with Kick, and their opus, Never Tear Us Apart is still remained as a classic. While the song is short and simple, the grip from Michael's voice into the song still ignites. I honestly found this song to be one of their best, and it still is just as haunting today, as it was when it came out in the late 80's. While INXS has tried to come back with another singer, J.D. Fortune and with Switch, that didn't work very well. If you really are nee to INXS, and have never heard one single song from the rock group from ""Down Under"", than this song would be a fantastic song to to get.

Song: B+"
,B00124AX3C,1,1,5,"One of Australias"" best. This song was enduring with great music and great vocals from a singer that will never be forgotten."
,B00124AA2G,-1,1,5,Sleazy songs were numerous then
,B00124AA2G,-1,1,5,She used to be mine. People being dumped: we figure out how alone we are after a few nights in which we wake up with nobody like a terrible No Rain moment with a Blind Melon.
,B00124AA2G,1,-1,3,"This is a song that I can enjoy often. I particularly like the melody. 3 stars is my rating for good. 4 stars rates as very good and 5 stars rates as great. So, by my personal rating, ""My best friends girl"" is good and I enjoy listening to it. Anything less then 3 stars is something I'd describe as unrated for my taste. I like Best Friends Girl mucho amigo......Pete"
,B00124AA2G,1,1,5,"I've been building up my collection of music from the 70's, 80's & 90's.
The Cars are an integral part of that collection; love the group and this song.
Can't think of a better way of building up my collection than through Amazon."
,B00124AA2G,1,1,5,"This song congers up memories of the 'new wave' sound of the day. Probably the Cars' best-known hit. Everybody remembers ""dancin' down the street, with the sway-to eyes.."". A really great sound."
,B001248CDK,-1,1,5,Memories
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,I love this song! Excellent quality recording. And now it's a part of my music library.
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,Takes me back to my 13th year!  I loved this group as a teen and was so glad to down load this song.  Excellent vocals and harmonies.  They were awesome...and still are!
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,Nice Oldie
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,"When I was younger, Ambrosia's How Much I Feel didn't compare to their You're the Biggest Part of Me. But the more I listen to this bittersweet ballad, the more it touches me. This remastered version sounds clear and clean on the Kindle."
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,"Let's be honest, at my age, this is a song that brings back memories from high school through young adulthood. Those are usually very pleasant memories, and since I eventually married my high school sweetheart, well, I'm always happy when I hear this tune."
,B001248CDK,1,1,5,"Ambrosia won my heart with this song as the title is the slang during the time this song was released as people I knew were really getting in touch with their feelings, and the way it starts off, drew my attention immediately.

These blue eyed soul brothers has made my list of songs to play on my radio show and come to find out there are many who really like this song, even my station manager.

I believe this song may have touched a lot of people due to the honesty that is presented in the lyrics.

YEAH!!!"
,B00124B5NY,1,1,5,Excellent recording of a good old song
,B00124B5NY,1,1,5,One of the all times sad songs great for putting me in a reflective mood
,B00124B5NY,1,1,4,A classic blues/rock song that just isn't long enough.
,B00124B5NY,1,1,5,classic
,B00124B0MA,1,1,5,Good
,B00124B0MA,1,1,5,"I selected this one because honestly a lot of their work sounds a little too similar, but I do love this one."
,B00124B0MA,1,1,5,love love love this song gald to have it back and on my mp3 player listen to it all the time
,B00124B0MA,1,1,5,I purchased this song and downloaded it to my ipod! It was a great success! The price was great too!!
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,"All good--I've always been very happy with all my purchases from Amazon, and I'm STILL happy!"
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,Love the song..great beat!
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,great song even now
,B00124B8UO,1,1,4,"Good tunes, did I mention I dislike writing reviews ??"
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,good
,B00124B8UO,-1,-1,3,I liked the beginning of the song . Not very fond of the miss molly mash up.
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,Awesome
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,"Great item, just what I needed."
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,Loved this track.  It keeps me awake at work during the long stretches when there is nothing to do and people will insist on bugging me.
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,"Excellent sound quality, came in clear & loud, some tunes are not as loud as others and you have to turn the volume up right at the start!!  Rockin tune! Glad it was available as a single Mp3."
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,"I love this recording so much that I have inadvertently purchased it twice.  I don't recommend that you do that, but I recommend that you buy it."
,B00124B8UO,1,1,5,"downloading songs for my MP3 player to keep me walking, dancing, and moving through the day plus keep smiling all the time"
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,"Talk about reminiscing the 70's.  When my husband and I listen to it we always talk about what we were doing when we first heard them sing.  This is one of those ""good old"" memories"
,B00124B8W2,-1,1,5,one of my favs
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,Catchy tune and words. I enjoyed listening to this as I worked.
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,nice era music
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,Great song...
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,Love it
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,Bring back memories
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,"For the longest I have been searching for the artist for this song, this track is great and standing through the test of time.
The Young Rascals have proven themselves to be more R&B than pop."
,B00124B8W2,1,1,4,"This is the best Rascal song every.  Hal Jackson use to play it on The Sunday Classics, WBLS, New York. With the technology today I get to here magnificent music from yesterday.  I like this song because it smooth music with a nice beat one can chill with."
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,"I think The Young Rascals hit a home run with this Single. All about  Sunday, chilling listing to your favorite music your lade-back
or  riding in your car with the top down checking the sights. enjoying  the days delights. Peace out."
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,Brings back such fond memories so sad that the music of today is not this good but then again the young people of today will be saying that of their music when they are older so live for the moment and enjoy what you can.
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,We used to go for a drive after church every Sunday and it seemed as if that song always came on.  It was one of our favorites.
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,Love all the oldies I grew up listening to this one really brings back lots of old memories good ones
,B00124B8W2,1,1,5,One of the best POP/Rock groups of the sixties.  Groovin' is a nice and mellow tune that is just laid back and no doubt their best.
,B00124B4EY,1,1,5,"Other than ""Back on the Chain Gang"", this is the only other Pretenders piece that I hear often on the radio while traveling to & from work 5 days a week. Quite an original and ""catchy"" tune - the musical score is quite striking and seems to ""stay with you"" long after the song is over. Quite a voice this gal has, as well!"
,B00124B4EY,1,1,5,"Really good rock music and excellent female vocals. No body else has ever tried to copy her singing style and only she can do it right. She definitely helped Cleveland Rock. Yeah, WMMS!!!"
,B00124B4EY,1,1,5,Awesome song from the 80's.  Chrissie Hynde's voice is super as always.  I have added this song to music library and put it on a cd mix.
,B00124B4EY,-1,1,5,I needed the songs from this album to resurrect a compilation album fro the 80's.. called rock 80. An album put out by K-Tel records.
,B00124B4EY,1,1,5,Great little song. Down load very good. Sure would buy it again and again. Thanks for the really good song.
,B00124B4EY,1,1,5,Brass in Pocket is well worth coming out of pocket for.  Chrissy Hind understands what it means for one to be special and promotes the importance of  self-image through this tune.  Love it. It has and will endure the test of time.
,B00124BN9A,1,1,5,"This is a classic.  If you are a Cold Blood fan,  I just scored.  This seller sold me a near perfect copy."
,B00124ADVE,1,1,5,this is one that gets a lotta play on my mp3 player. it's a classic from a great rock band.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"This is an awesome bluegrass/traditional country album.  All the tracks reflect a sound which is unique to Dwight Yoakam.  He is an older country performer, but if you enjoy country you should add this to your country collection."
,B00124BFPM,1,1,4,"Like ""Under the Boardwalk"" this is one of those songs you just want to sing along with. Always fun to hear."
,B00124BFPM,1,1,5,"""When this old world starts gettin' me down""... I just have to listen to songs like this and remember how good it used to be."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Very Satisfied!  Larry Marshall Meadows
,B00124ADVE,1,1,5,i love this song it really lets the one you love know that they can count on you
,B00124ADVE,1,1,5,Love this version
,B00124ADVE,1,1,5,Amazing!  Love it!
,B00124ADVE,1,1,5,"Again, used this for a Firefighter video background music to the photo's of live scenes the non-profit community based organization for the community to see first hand what they did to protect and save lives and property.  No video was sold, just used as PR."
,B00124ADVE,1,1,5,This is a very meaningful song. Every time I listen to it I realize how much it means to have a mate who will stand by you no matter what.
,B00124ADVE,1,1,5,"a lovely soulful song, love the lyrics, The Pretenders do a fantastic job with it,  so glad i got it"
,B00124ADVE,1,1,5,"This is a timeless song, at least for me.  The record came out in my youth, but I think it would still do well in the present market.  I've always liked the Pretenders and the song has the best lyrics written, in my humble opinion."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,If you like Dwight this is a great cd.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Good Stuff
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,This is a great collection of songs.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"One of the best rockabilly songwriters around, great album."
,B00124D8TS,-1,1,4,Makes me miss the 80's and 90's.  Great memories... fast download and I like the U.S version better than the original.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,4,Good
,B00124D44C,-1,1,5,Great track from the 80's that I definately had to have for my collection. A real shame that they were a one-hit creator.
,B00124D44C,1,1,5,"When I first heard this song decades ago, it left a lasting impression upon me. I love the full sound of the music combined with the sweet harmonies of the singers. It was a haunting sound, one of those that imbeds itself in your mind and won't let go. I also have the country version by Little Big Town featuring Sugarland, and probably like it best, but The Dream Academy's original version still holds a special place in my mind. Find it online, listen to both versions, and then buy the one that you like best -- or buy both! I did!"
,B00124D44C,1,1,5,This song just has a great feel.  Some of the lyrics touch a cord for those who remember the years following JFK's assassination.
,B00124D44C,1,1,5,I downloaded this to add to a bizarre collection of music for a Christmas party.  Everyone loved the different genres offered.  Better than the reamake by Little Big Town.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,always will be a dwight fan!
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Can't go without Dwight.
,B00124DFKU,1,1,5,"Just saw Chicago perform and this is definately a sing to the radio

song.  Listen carefully to the lyrics and see if anybody really does

know what time it is."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,4,I think Dwight Yokum is an interesting country music artist. His material has held up pretty well over time. Sometimes he reminds me of Roy Orbison.
,B00124D44C,1,1,4,I remember this song from when I was growing up.  It brings back a lot of good memory.
,B00124D44C,1,1,5,The Dream Academys Life In A Northern Town is an all time great in our house we are just that I live in that northern town.
,B00124D44C,1,-1,3,"I like it very much, but the one done by Sugarland really is the best! But still a good group as far as I am concerned."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,love it
,B00124DB86,1,1,5,Some songs just catch hold of the imagination. These guys use their shore leave to deliver a timely tune to be enshrined in the heartbeats of lovers all over the States. How great to make a song about breaking up sound so right.
,B00124DB86,1,1,4,"This song is about a breakup, but the tune is upbeat, so it throws you off a bit.  It is a classic 50's/60's song and perfect for those who enjoy the oldies."
,B00124DB86,1,1,5,Every time I hear this song it takes me back to when I was a teenager.  It's a beautiful song.
,B00124DB86,1,1,5,I can't tell you anything that you don't know already about this song (it's great)!  I just wish it was recorded in stereo.
,B00124DB86,-1,-1,2,"I haven't seen ""Rhythm of the Rain"" in the oldies collections hawked on TV and this CD seemed the only way to get that song. The rest of the music on this CD is forgettable."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"I must say that Amazon has the best selection for Classic Rock, which will be here for all times. No music will ever compare to the music of that era. I have so far purchased 688 songs from Amazon over the years. Not all Classic Rock, for I do like Christian Hymns very much. But they always have a great selection no matter what genre you are looking for."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,It's Dwight with the sounds of Bakersfield. excellent.
,B00124AYE0,1,1,5,"If you love country music with a lot of emotion, I would recommend this song. It's a beautiful song and one of my favorites."
,B00124AYE0,1,1,5,"A great country song in the vein of old country as it should be, honest and gritty, real.  Great Lyrics."
,B00124DB86,1,1,4,OK
,B00124DB86,1,1,5,A GREAT SONG FROM A GREAT GROUP
,B00124DB86,1,1,4,good old songs
,B00124DB86,1,1,5,A classic oldie that I have always loved.  Sound quality is very good.
,B00124DB86,1,1,5,"I can remember this song as clear as yesterday but had not heard it in years. There are probably many recordings of this song, but in my mind, this is the group and this is the recording."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Best
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight Yoakum, when he was just a cool country musician, before the oddball film characters. Lol He has a distinctive voice & sound. I really enjoy listening to the music, and this was a pleasant purchase."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Very good cd.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,AWESOME
,B00124D1GS,1,1,5,This is a classic hit from two of the best in country music. This is definitely a classic worthy of being added to your collection.
,B00124D1GS,1,1,5,Nothing bad about this at all. It all rocks. Dwight and Buck do an awesome duet together. Highly recommend this one.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,One of the greatest country artists ever.  Can't beat his style and vocals.
,B00124BPBG,1,-1,3,"No surprizes, your collection of hits at a good value."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,This has every major hit of Dwight Yoakam - I'm a fan and couldn't be happier.
,B00124A4WM,1,1,5,"The concert version of this theme is pretty cool, I like it a lot."
,B00124A4WM,1,1,5,Great
,B00124A4WM,1,1,5,"I share with millions a continually growing love and respect for John WIlliam's awesome theme music. I wonder if we realize that the John Williams', the Howard Shores and Alan Silvestris and Hans Zimmers of this age will be the classical music of the future? Not that they aren't of that caliber NOW. The themes of Star Wars, Superman, Jaws, and others, are fast becoming synonymous with superheroes and scary movies. John Williams music is not only prolific and professional, it pierces to the heart of whatever the subject of the movie is. May his tribe increase! May his catalog increase! May his music live forever."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight is flat out one of the greatest country stars alive or dead. If you are into ""New Pop Country"" You should get at least this greatest hits collection and a real education on what a real musician is, plays and sounds like. We are rocking out to this collection right now at http://www. CirrusSmokeShop.com Check us out!"
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Some of his very best.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,A lot of good Dwight Yoakam songs in one album and a good price. High quality MP3s.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,awesome
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"This is one of the best albums I've purchased in a long time... Dwight isn't for everyone....but this album truly shows what a great songwriter he is.. ""Streets of Bakersfield"", ""1000 miles from Nowhere"", Elvis cover of ""Suspicious Minds"".. those three songs alone are worth the price of the album. I cover everything from Punk to Classical and this album really hits home. Real Music made by a real man. 6 stars."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Wish he'd put out another album. One of my favorite entertainers
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Love the music. Great selection of hits.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Great collection--I listen to it frequently.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Awesome
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,I love this man
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,I was surprised how many songs I knew. A great country cd
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,great
,B00124BPBG,-1,1,4,I am enjoying the album very much but it did not load into I Tunes correctly. It plays on Fire TV and Windows Media player just fine.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,GREAT MUSIC !
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight Yoakam deserves MUCH MORE credit than he gets.  Terrific singer, terrific songwriter."
,B00124DECO,1,1,5,"I loved this song when I first heard it over 40 years ago, now my Amazon and Macaw both sing it.  Don Ho is #1 in my book...."
,B00124DECO,1,1,5,"Recently our volunteer group visited a Senior Center for a fun filled Hawaiian party. We showed the participants how to Hula and they loved this recording! In fact, we played it three times and yes the danced to it each time as this is a simple and fun song. The funny thing is that the Senior Group wanted to dance their own way instead of the Hula--they taught us some interesting steps to this dance.

Very fun song - even if one just dances their own way and not the Hula!

Highly recommend this one!"
,B00124DECO,-1,-1,1,Should have only downloaded the song one time.  Don't like it that you couldn't sample the music first.
,B00124DECO,-1,1,5,Happy with download.  However I inadvertly downloaded the same song twice thinking it was a different version.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"I must say, FANTASTIC ! Great product, fantastic artist with a great voice. Recommended."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,A+
,B00124BPBG,1,1,4,I liked it
,B00124AY9A,1,1,5,Great album
,B00124AY9A,1,1,5,Frantic & Fun
,B00124AY9A,1,1,5,"Great energetic song.  If you want a fast pace song for power walking, add this one to your playlist."
,B00124AY9A,1,1,5,"I enjoying listening to this song. Now, I will enjoy it more in my own library. I own it, so thank you amazon for allowing me to purchase and download the album into my library."
,B00124AY9A,1,1,5,love it!!!
,B00124AY9A,1,1,5,"Great song, no need for all these words, great song says it all. Disco lives whether some folks what it too or not."
,B00124AY9A,1,1,5,"I remember in 1978 hearing this HOT song playing in a gay club in Athens, Ga. called Episode.  I was only 22 years old and just coming out.  For me, the music of that time will always be an anthem for our time of discovery.  Everything was fresh and new and even today, this music should be heard!!!!!  The title song, Get Off is one of the most unusual of the time.  ENJOY!!!!!  The original version and album are on MP3!!!!"
,B00124AY9A,-1,1,5,"If you don't get it get off. The words send a message to those who don't. Listen well, for those who don't get it should get off."
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,"I chose the rating because of the ease of the purchase and the excellent condition of the product. I like the product very much. I recommend to anyone looking for their favorite songs, pass or present, to follow my example and purchase MP3 music from Amazon.com."
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,I have been a BIG FAN of Chicago since I was in high school. I can listen to them all day and night.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Awesome!
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Great Album!
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,I like ROCK AND COUNTRY AND THERE IS NONE BETTER THAN DWIGHT YOAKAM.
,B00124BPBG,1,-1,3,A lot of you are saying this is the best single disc of Dwight Yoakam. I'm sorry I don't agree. They omitted The Heart That You Own and call this a The Very Best Of Dwight I think NOT!!!! The Heart That You Own was one of the BEST songs he ever did in the 90's.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,4,"Classic Bakersfield country.  Dwight is great. It's not the stuff you hear on radio today that is pop collaborative, it's a bit of rockabilly twang and he has a great Freddie Mercury cover."
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,quick download
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,Youre The Inspiration by Chicago is a very heartfelt song that appears to be about the singer expressing to their love interest that life is more meaningful and rich with them in it.  I admit that my spirit is guiding me to collecting this song as a playlist that I intend to create for both another storytelling music playlist but also another one for my husband in time for this Valentines Day (because  he knows that this uplifting song of Youre The Inspiration is only one part of the multiple happy ways/positive romantic aspects  that I feel about him).
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,From my younger days.  Still a good one.
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,"Takes me back to ""My Day""."
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,I loved it.
,B00124DGHM,1,1,4,Always loved this song
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,"Easily one of the best rock love songs of the '80s. Chicago is so good. When I get married, this song will be on the playlist."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,I haven't been luck enough to follow your music in the past - but now that's going  to change.  Thanks for your music.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,this is the best cd i have bought in a long time. i like every song on this cd. the classic ultimate dwight yoakam. recommend to any country or even even any other kiof music
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"I love this CD, it has to be my favorite Dwight CD  ever made. I play the CD, I listen to the MP3's when I'm using my Kindle. Just can't get enough of that man!  :)"
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,Love it
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,Strong meaningful vocals by Peter Cetera. Great music!
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,"Great song by Chicago, brought back memories."
,B00124DGHM,-1,1,5,Song was sang at my Wedding.  Means a lot to me.  Will be married 29 years .in January
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,Love it.
,B00124DGHM,1,1,5,"I purchase this song ""You're The Inspiration"" by Chicago as an mp3 (digital download) because it was one track which I had always liked, and I can recall hearing it on the radio often, while I was growing up.

I am not disappointed with it, the sound quality is top notch, and I am very happy with it!"
,B00124D8IY,1,1,5,I have been wondering who sings this song for a long time. This is a great Third Eye Blind song.
,B00124D8IY,1,1,5,I bought this MP# after coming across a CD my daughter made for me.  I listen to it in my car at full volume.  I am teaching my 8 year old the lyrics.  Everyone has felt like that song at some point in their lives.
,B00124D8IY,1,1,5,"Let's face it, suicide is all too painful reality in this world, especially in the world of teens. This song takes the issue head on, in an emotional heartfelt song that speaks for itself through its words. Sure the music might be a little to upbeat for the topic, but that problem is fixed on the Bedlight For Blue Eyes' cover of the song on Punk Goes 90's.

But overall, the modern standard on tackling tough issues through music. The lyrics speak volumes, and succeed where so many other songs like this fail. Maybe it's because the singer had first-hand experience with the subject (a friend who committed suicide), but the emotion shows. Again, an excellent song."
,B00124DUDM,1,1,4,A download for a freind. i do like crystal blue persuasion and mony mony and crimson and clover. definite classic.
,B00124D03W,1,1,5,"It's a decent song with a good beat.  I like music with a good, fast rhythm and good lyrics.  This fits."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,I love this song and was glad to have found it on Amazon. It's nice being able to locate favorites so easliy.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"I have listened to Dwight for many years and I just seen him live. This is real music. ""Can you turn it up, please?"""
,B00124BPBG,1,1,4,Good songs from days past. I never was a huge fan of his but these are definitely his best songs.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"If you are a Dwight Yoakam fan, then this is the ""album"" to have. I have already listened to it several times and it takes me back several years to when Dwight was more popular than today; however, the music is great and I would recommend this, especially if you can get the digital copy fo $5 as it being sold at today"
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"I have been a Dwight Yoakam fan for a long time. His music is still so great, and I'm  glad he is out there again."
,B00124B4TO,1,1,4,"This song is just as strange as I remember, and it has a permanent, happy home on my iPod. Lighthearted, fun, strange, and even moreso if you happen to remember Tiny Tim himself :-)"
,B00124B4TO,1,1,5,Wonderful version & sound. My show promotes happy thoughts & feelings. Perfect  for KGLP.ORG We need more positive fun songs less depressing & vulgar ones.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,If you are a Dwight Yoakam fan you'll likely love this cd. I had these songs years ago and love adding them back into my iTunes. Great cd!
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,A good variety of this artist's songs. I am able to listen to the songs on my phone via amazon app while I complete my daily walking.
,B00124A814,1,1,5,"Great Artist, He will be missed."
,B00124A814,1,1,5,I love this old song.  It will always be in style.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"The best cd, Dwight Yoakam is really a great singer, I was really proud to get it without waiting, I thank you amazon!"
,B00124FF4E,1,1,5,Loved it!
,B00124FF4E,1,1,5,Takes me back to the 1970's  ... Groovy Man ..Chicago's one of the Best bands of the 1960's-70's era when Music was MUSIC and not some joker spitting out jive crap.
,B00124FF4E,1,1,5,I wouldn't have purchased this song if it wasn't worth it. But it is! Great band and great music! Crank it up!
,B00124FF4E,1,1,4,A pretty nice song that reminds one of summer and celebratory times. Sort of a break from all the winter weather.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,This is one of my all time favorites.  Lots of great songs that make you smile and sing along.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,Oh yeah...and I sing along. This is sophisticated country. This CD will please your senses and awaken your imagination. If you think you don't like country music...listen to this one and you'll think again.
,B00124F2A6,1,1,5,A really underrated song by Chicago in my opinion.
,B00124F2A6,1,1,5,One of the great rock songs.  I love the use of guitars and brass instruments together.  And being a drummer from that period I often practiced to this song and this album.
,B00124F2A6,1,1,5,"Please give Chicago a chance, escpecially 25 or 6 to 4. This song is great. Although: I am not quite sure what the title refers to? time?"
,B00124F2A6,1,1,5,Takes me back to the 1970's  ... Groovy Man ..SD 25 = 25o624 the chemical equashion for LSD :-) Takes me back to the 1970's  ... Groovy Man ..Chicago's one of the Best bands of the 1960's-70's era when Music was MUSIC and not some joker spitting out jive crap.
,B00124F2A6,1,1,5,Same as the other review I wrote. I love Chicago. Music I grew up with and has fond memories attached.
,B00124F2A6,1,1,4,"It is fast paced, the trumpet play is excellent, the singing goes wkth the mood and tune, the guitar work is appropriate and brilliantly performed."
,B00124F2A6,1,1,5,Great version of a great classic song. Sound quality is exceptional. No distortion. Classic rock is better than ANYTHING on the radio today. Turn it way up!
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,Again I wanted a song that would remind me of my cruises and this is another one of those songs.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,4,"I'm not a BIG fan of Country Music now a days.  But when I listen to this Album, it's a different story.  Being from Kentucky Myself it's good to have a Country ICON from here.  If you like flat out Country Rock N Roll, please buy this album you want be sorry."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"This cd was my first introduction to Dwight. It made me buy every one of his studio albums. He is an amazing artist and has one of the greatest voices in the history of country music. I highly recommend his cds Long Way Home, Gone, and his acoustic  cd. Excellent album, excellent artist."
,B00124B6OW,-1,1,5,my Saturday morning song
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,Got to have those good morning songs. It's a bright new day!
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,liked
,B00124B6OW,-1,1,5,hit the repeat on this one
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,"A Good Classic, Takes me back something to start off the morning"
,B00124B6OW,1,1,4,Good song.
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Recently the music industry has begun to release greatest hits CD's with, well, the greatest hits for a change.  And usually filling up a CD.  So I have been back filling my CD collection with CD's of artists and bands from the 80's and 90's that I have followed in the press, but not purchased their music.  This CD is awesome.  I cannot think of a time that I have purchased a CD that I have enjoyed every song.  The musicianship on Dwight's recordings is Very, Very good as is the material.  And Dwight himself is exceptional.  I would recommend this CD to any Rock, Pop, or country fan that has not heard Dwight Yoakam.  I cannot decide whether to get the box set, or just get each original Cd."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight Yoakam & his incredible band played Baltimore live last night for the first time in many, many years starting off in high gear, went to overdrive then turned on the after burners driving fans into a Fender Telcaster/Honkytonk Heaven frenzy. He played his entire greatest hits playlist off this CD & many more. He's so hip, so ultra cool, so alternative country & so unNashville. Plus he's young alive & still playing on planet earth. Highly recommend this CD plus Dwight's Used Records CD. Look for Dwight's brand new CD coming out probably in June 2005!"
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight Yoakam is the reason I'm not embarrased to say I like country music.  When he broke onto the national scene with his debut album GUITARS, CADILLACS, ETC., ETC., he gave the country music establishment a much needed kick in the butt.  This twenty track collection hits most of the highlights of Yoakam's nearly two decades as a performer.  Starting with the Johnny Horton cover of ""Honky Tonk Man"" from his debut through two tracks from his 2003 release POPULATION: ME, Yoakam has had a major impact on country music.  If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to Rhino's 2002 box set REPRISE PLEASE BABY, this is a winner from beginning to end.  The only disappointment is that with a running time of just under 70 minutes, they could have added the only two top 10 singles missing from this set: ""Always Late With Your Kisses (from 1987's HILLBILLY DELUXE) and ""I Got You"" (from 1988's BUENAS NOCHES FROM A LONELY ROOM).  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  [2012 addendum:  The mp3 download version of this album has different cover art and eliminates the final two tracks from the 2003 album POPULATION ME, making this an all-Warner Bros. collection.]"
,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight's music is firmly rooted in traditional country, yet makes just enough concessions to progress so that it appeals to a modern generation. I guess a few purists will ignore him, but not many - there aren't many country singers now whose music owes so much to tradition while still selling in large quantities.

This compilation covers the whole of career to date, including eight tracks from his compilation of eighties hits (Just looking for a hit), eight tracks from his compilation of nineties hits (Last chance for 1,000 years), Things change (from A long way home), I want you to want me (from Tomorrow's sounds today) and two tracks from Population me (Late great golden state, Back of your hand). Thus, there is no new material here, but this compilation is the strongest single CD of Dwight's music so far released.

Inevitably, some classic songs have been omitted, one example being The heart that I own. Most of the songs here are originals but Dwight has recorded many fine covers, represented here by Little sister and Suspicious minds (both Elvis Presley) and Crazy little thing called love (Queen).

If you only want one CD of Dwight's music, make it this one."
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,Love it
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,Classic song from great artists - I like listening to this in my Ipod or Sunday afternoons (lol). It brings back memories. Good song if you're into music of this era or genre
,B00124B6OW,1,1,4,"The Rascals made two great songs Beautiful Morning is one of them.  Also, I have a co-worker that has been singing this song every morning; it better to hear The Rascals."
,B00124BPBG,1,1,4,"Overall this is a pretty good collection, and it includes most of what his two previous collections did. Included are many great early tracks like ""Guitars, Cadillacs"", ""Little Ways"", ""I Sang Dixie"", and ""You're The One"". Plus alot of his great later work like ""A Thousand Miles From Nowhere"", ""Ain't That Lonely Yet"", ""Things Change"", and ""The Back Of Your Hand"". Dwight also excells at doing covers, and ""Little Sister"", ""Suspicious Minds"", ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", and ""I Want You To Want Me"" are all on here as well. I do miss a song or two, but for the most part this is the majority of his best, and it's a perfect introduction for newcomers, as intended. I've liked him ever since I heard (and saw) him in the film Red Rock West."
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,I grew up in the 60's & 70's so this is the kind of music I enjoy.  Good Memories here
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,Brings back great memories of the 60's still sounds great for the times. Buy it and enjoy it over and over again.
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
,B00124B6OW,1,1,5,"This song, along with ""Groovin',"" are my favorites by The Rascals. A lot of people who don't have access to the album cover to see what they look like would mistake them for a African-American band. This is a great song that never grows old."
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,Another great oldie!!
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,Cannot beat the Cars Solid Rock
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,"It's a song track.  I like it, I wanted it, I bought it.  It is a quick way to get a single you want.  I use these as practice aids for band work.  The MP3 format is not optimum for real listening enjoyment.  In order to compress the data, a lot of tones are left out.  Even a good cassette tape outperforms this storage medium.  But it has its uses, and is inexpensive."
,B00124B4T4,1,1,4,Electronic download - plays fine.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,"A band that has achieved great success, with music style and song writing. This songs reflects good feeling and strong emotional connection."
,B00124B4T4,-1,1,4,oldschool
,B00124ASBE,-1,-1,1,This was a second song that I wasted my money on because there was too much static on this mp3 track.
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,"Up on the Roof, Under the Boardwalk---these songs are some of the best from their era.  I love this stuff."
,B00124ASBE,1,1,4,Still a great tune after all these years.  Quality of the file was in comparison as good as today's music.
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,"I love this song!  I grew up with this song in my head and continued to play it in my mind for years.  Forgot some of the words but never forgot that catchy tune!  Absolutely loved it! Now I have it and it is still as wonderful to me as it was over 45 years ago! I then also discovered that another of my most favorite songs was ""On Broadway"" - never knew that it was performed by them!  Absolutely love this song and cut.  I hope you do too.  I play it, along with others, all day long in my work and it makes my day go by so well!  Very uplifting!"
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,"Love songs of the ""80s""!"
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,Loved this band from the beginning.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,Good song.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,Love it!
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,A classic.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,A classic!
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,if you like the 80s and you're like the cars back in the 80s will love this song this is probably one of their flagship songs which will bring you back to the 80s and who didn't love the 80s
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,He is not the lead singer of the Cars. He leads this ballad with convincing emotion.  I am sure you will enjoy this song.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,Still the awesome song it was when it came out.  I heard it on the classic rock station and it brought back great memories!
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,Of course Drive by the Cars is probably the number 1 of Cars all times.  I can tell by the little higher cost of the Cars songs that they must be in great demand.  This one is definitely a winner.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,I always find this song inspiring. It's a song from the 1980's and still played today on the radio. I was watching the TV show Cold Case and heard the song and went straight to Amazon MP3's to get it.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs by the cars the best song on there album the Cars were a great group.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,"I've liked this song for about 20 years, after hearing it once !  Don't know what took me so long to buy it, but - glad I finally did !
Makes you think about the person you are and just maybe - how others perceive you."
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,"these songs brought back memories for me i enjoyed listening to them , play them just for romance to come back once in a while for husband , the song sounded great the download was fast"
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,I completely love the Drifters and I run a Carolina Beach music show on the radio.  This helped me fill out my collection.  Any Drifters fan should have!
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,love it
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,I love this Product! Arrived quickly. Will order again! Thx seller!
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,"This is one of the first songs that I ever shagged to at the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk, S.C.
Thank you"
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,"Marines at Phu Bai in Vietnam were entertained by a quartet of Marines practicing ""Under the Boardwalk"" over and over and over. They were getting ready to put on a show at the Army's 8th RRU installation that the Marines were helping to guard. This rendition by the Drifters was easy to download and use via the Cloud. Being able to purchase singles in digital mp3 format is great, and Amazon does it best."
,B00124ASBE,1,1,5,"I really like this song.  It makes me smile every time I hear it. Even though it came out well before my time, I enjoy listening to it and don't think I will ever tire of it."
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,"By far, this is my favorite Cars song.  They have quite a few others that I like as well, but I love a great ballad, and the late Ben Orr sang his heart out on this one."
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,I have always been a big fan of the Cars for years but I could never find this song until I a search on Amazon and they had so many choices for downloading it so it was worth the price.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,Tells the truth about what a relationship is all about. Has been a favorite of mine for twenty+ years since a student I worked with used it to give our youth group a lesson in life. The song asks all the important questions.
,B00124B4T4,1,1,5,May have moved on to adult mainstream contemporary by now. Nice song which I downloaded from Amazon.com MP3 store. That is it.
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,"Slightly funky, smooth, and eternally catchy.  I've never met anyone who can listen to this song without singing the refrain over and over for the rest of the day.  No one can resist Dr. John."
,B001248CGM,1,1,5,Melody just flows and flows!
,B001248CGM,1,1,5,"Another popular song from a great band.  Easy listening.  Like ""How much I feel"" by this band this is a song about love and how worry and self doubt puts a relationship in crisis.  Great song and lyrics...Takes me back to the late 70s and early 80s."
,B001248CGM,1,1,5,great song for romance
,B001248CGM,1,1,5,Great Music! Thank You!
,B001248CGM,1,1,5,They play this in my grocery store & I always enjoyed hearing it & needed to purchase. Love this classic oldie!
,B001248CGM,1,1,5,"WOW - Glad I bought this one.  I had this tune stuck in my head one day and I still don't know how it got there, but I thought ""Why not?"" and spent 99 pennies to see what the deal was.  Great vocals, music, harmony etc. and it was a buck well spent.  Another great quality MP3 purchased/downloaded from Amazon."
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,Classic
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,great old but good classic Dr. John tune
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,Great song
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,Really love this song! Definitely worth the purchase!
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,Great roots of rock song by a black group. Great lyrics!
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,"This song is a classic, and this recording does not disappoint.  The sound is great as well."
,B00124DBB8,-1,1,4,it's ok.
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,OK
,B00124DBB8,1,1,4,Awesome!
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,Dr. John - New Orleans piano and vocals - Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!  Good oldie and worth more than the .99  I paid.
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,I love the rock/blues sound of the guitar. If you suffer from foot in mouth disease this song tells your story. Just a great can't quite get right song. Gotta love it.
,B00124DBB8,1,1,4,For those who are just learning of Dr. John.  Yes this song is at the beginning of Sahara.  What you didn't know is the song has been around for over 30 some years.  Dr. John played with some of the best music artists such as Eric Clapton and The Band both I highly recommend as well.
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,Cool song from Dr. John!!! :D Great to hear it played. Reminds me of days gone by. Funky and Fun!
,B00124DBB8,-1,-1,3,"Certainly the tight song but the recording is missing a drive to it in both music and dong.  No highs or lows, no depth to the music."
,B00124HA7E,1,1,5,"They did a fantastic job on this one! It's almost as if someome asked ""can you come up with something for this jogger""? She really needs something to keep her going!
  Yes, it's at the top of my playlist and I'm wondering who will be the artist to kick it off the top of the mountain : )
Thanks so much for all the good tunes!"
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,music choice allowed me to know the artist and the name of the song. i have always loved it since i  heard it years ago
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,"This is a great song to listen to as you cruise down the expressway, drinkin, smokin, reloading your Glock. remindes me of the old days."
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,This songs brings me back to my childhood when it was always on the radio. Dr. John's voice is so distinctive that it can't be replicated. He is an original for sure.
,B00124DBB8,1,1,5,"he is very musically talented ,,, go pick up his other stuff and other songzzzz ,,, he's good . . . dr john is DAA BOMBBB"
,B00124DBB8,-1,1,5,"For only $0.69, you can't beat it!!! Aye-tunes (or similar mp3 websites) have never offered a major
artist at these prices. it STILL costs $1.29 over there."
,B00124H7FY,1,1,5,Classic!
,B00124H7FY,1,1,5,One of my favorites.
,B00124H7FY,1,1,4,"By the stars given I will tell you if it was the original recording. Beware, just because it says it's a master, does not mean it's the original release of the record. They recorded them several times, or even rerecord the song years later."
,B00124H7FY,1,1,4,Good old song if you like old songs I don't know why I have to write a review for everything I bye
,B00124H7FY,1,1,5,All these albums I rated are excellent. Great music they bring back memories of my child hood days. Listen to them see if they get you motivated.
,B00124H7FY,1,1,4,"""Draggin' The Line"" is another great classic song not just from the 60's/70's music era but from Tommy James. Song about irony way before Alannis tried."
,B00124H7FY,1,1,5,Always great to listen to the music from the best days of my life. Tommy James never disappoints his fans.
,B00124F7YW,1,1,5,"Not much in vocal (I love understatement), but great guitar work and overall sound.  It's an easy song to listen to, different and pleasant.  (It ain't hard rock, baby.)"
,B00124DFYG,1,1,5,Good stuff
,B00124DFYG,1,1,5,Great sound.
,B00124DFYG,1,1,5,"This song came out just when I was going through a bad break up and it gave me a lot of strength to get through it.  This song has always given me a good feeling from the opening chords to the very end.  This is when Chicago was a good rock band, before they started doing only ballads."
,B00124DFYG,1,1,4,"It is a very good song from a very good group. I suppose I'm not exactly a music critic, but that's my opinion."
,B00124DFYG,1,1,5,"Classic song from Chicago. I've always loved how Chicago infuses a little bit of the ""big band"" feel into their music with the brass sections. Feelin' Stronger Every Day is no differenthas a really cool ""jam session"" at the end."
,B00124F7YW,1,1,5,"I enjoying listening to this song. Now, I will enjoy it more in my own library. I own it, so thank you amazon for allowing me to purchase and download the album into my library."
,B00124F7YW,1,1,5,I always like this song so I bought it . I have had very good luck with all my amazon songs they sound great.
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,Went to get it...forgot along the way...what can I say?  If you get into that type of music at all you really should have this album in your collection.  It's smooth and sets a nice mood.
,B00124HN8K,-1,1,5,"It's all my mother's fault, really.  She couldn't help it if she had a weakness for soul ballads (and 40s and 50s music in general). Plus, Percy Sledge's voice could make angels weep.

It's odd to contrast songs like this (in which the man pines for the woman who's left him and talks about how he'll do anything if she says that's how it ought to be to todays rap music, in which women are essentially disposable commodities useful for only one thing, and then discarded.  I'm sure there's a deeper meaning to this, but I'm just a woman who knows what she likes, not a sociologist. (and yes, I know ALL rap music isn't like that, but the majority I've heard of it seems to be)."
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,Excellent song from the movie the big chill. A classic you will never forget. This is pure soul And then some.
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,"This MP3 sounds good to me. As for the song what more can be said. It's sad that no one sings love songs like this anymore, it's all music pornography now days."
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,Download easy
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,Outstanding!
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,Favorite Percy Sledge song
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,"A classic love song
This beautiful song will go on forever what more is there to say
Nothing more to say"
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,"Michael Bolton NOT.  This is the original, the one and the only. Not some remake, this is the one you want to dedicate to your better half, so if you have a choice on which version/artist - Pick This One."
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,"Great song, lyrics and from the heart.and mouth of a TRUE man and his feelings for someone he loves and, making a statement."
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,"I asked my father one time, ""dad, why do people get married and make children together?"" He said ""son..."" and then put on this record for me to listen to. It all made sense."
,B00124HN8K,1,1,5,"Music for my Kindle was easy to locate, very fair price for one song and much easier to download to my Kindle."
,B00124FG02,-1,-1,3,Song is alright.
,B00124FG02,1,1,5,Love it
,B00124FG02,1,-1,3,Love Chicago and all of their music...
,B00124FG02,1,1,5,Love the song!
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,Another favorite song of mine Chicago has been around since the 70s and still rocks with their hard rock melodies for the past 30 years and stil  going strong today
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,LOVE this song..reminds me of younger days..and my 7 year old daughter enjoys harmonizing with me on it! So awesome to download onto my phone via amazon mp3 app..with a touch of a button I'm listening to my favorite oldies.
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,Excellent!
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,best song ever
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button."
,B00124JENM,1,1,4,excellent!
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,Great classic
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,Love Chicago!
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,I love it. This song is now in my music library. Thanks.
,B00124JENM,-1,1,5,I remember listening to they're 8 track
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,Loved it!
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,Classic
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,Love song!
,B00124JENM,-1,1,5,Memories
,B00124JENM,1,1,4,Nice old music
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,"A love like ours is very hard to find, how could you leave me this way.  We've come to far to leave it all behind, the lyrics. the beat, the angelic sound is just so calm and relaxing and at the same time cool.  I just Love Love Love Chicago classic songs anyway.  I remember this tune way back when at least 30 years ago and its still relevant today."
,B00124JENM,1,1,5,"I don't like most Chicago songs, but I've always loved this one. I bought the 45 when it came out. It's still a great song."
,B00124HVBO,1,1,5,"Just in time for Valentines Day the good folks at Rhino have released Chicago: Love Songs, an 18 track compilation of some of the beloved groups most romantic tunes.  As always Rhino has done a fine job putting this package together.  Obviously, this collection is not really aimed at collectors but rather is being marketed as a neat alternative or supplement to flowers and candy.  The set features nice mix of remastered hits from both the 70s and 80s.  In my view you can never go wrong with the music of Chicago.  Heck, I wouldnt mind getting one this myselfhinthint.  Recommended."
,B00124HVBO,1,1,5,Awesome.
,B00124HVBO,-1,-1,3,Too many love songs all at once. I would have preferred a different album with more of a mix-up. .
,B00124HVBO,1,-1,3,"After Rhino released the near-definitive 2-CD collection THE VERY BEST OF: ONLY THE BEGINNING in 2002, I was a bit confused by the title.  ""Only the Beginning?"" Hey! Chicago hasn't had a top 40 hit since 1991's ""Chasin' the Wind."" But LOVE SONGS makes it perfectly clear.  That album was only the beginning of repackaging Chicago's material.

There's really little new here if you already own THE VERY BEST OF.  ""If You Leave Me Now"" is a live version with Philip Bailey. Another live version is ""After the Love Is Gone"" featuring Earth, WInd & Fire.  ""Never Been in Love Before"" is from 1975's CHICAGO VIII.  And ""Here in My Heart"" is a Lenny Kravitz-produced song from 1997's anthology THE HEART OF CHICAGO.

So what other creative ways can Rhino repackage this material?  The Terry Kath years?  The Robert Lamm-penned songs? Songs from albums whose titles don't contain a Roman numeral?

Don't get me wrong. If all you're looking for is Chicago's love songs--and ONLY their love songs, this is a solid collection.  My only problem with this is that it presents the group as a bit too one dimensional."
,B00124HVBO,-1,-1,3,"The song selection here isn't bad, save for the two live tracks. Philip Bailey has always been a whiner and just because ""If You Leave Me Now"" is a Chicago classic doesn't mean that any version outside the original is accecptable. For me, this live cut just sucks. Sorry, can't really articulate any other word or ""ism"" to describe my feelings abot this and the other live track, ""After The Love Is Gone.""  The latter isn't a Chicago song at all and is present on this collection because of Bill Champlin. I would have liked to see unedited versions of the ""singles"" on this collection but we are dealing with Rhino, the edit kings.  Aside from the live sides, this collection is a nice round-up of positive love songs from Chicago. Lots 'o' luck with the new album, the face of music has changed since their last successful chart entry."
,B00124HVBO,1,1,4,"There are just so many hits collections that realy seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists. That has always been the case with love songs collections as well, because there are just so many of them that really don't seem to showcase enough material that really reflects the best of those love songs. That just isn't the case with Chicago, and their great music collections, because they definitely hit the nail of the head very, very well. Their music has endured extraordinarily well for over thirty-five years. There have been a few successful hits collections that really reflects Chicago, and this one is just no acception.

Chicago's 2005 Love Songs collection, consists of their most well recieved love songs from thier long-time career. The album conists of 18 tracks, and a couple of live rendidtions of classics never before released on any Chicago album as well. The collection contains a lot of great tracks inclding You're The Inspiration, Will You Still Love Me, Beginnings, as well as classics like Colour My World Hard Habit To Break, and Hard To Say I'm Sorry. The album also includes a couple of live recording with Phillip Bailey from Earth, Wind & Fire fame, on versions of If You Leave Me Now, and the Earth, Wind & Fire classic, After The Love Is Gone, which really sounds delightful and lively.

While there love songs albums that really don't sell very well, or just miss out on a lot of great songs, Chicago's Love Songs really displays very, very well within not just its price, but the vast number of classic Chicago tracks here. While many not at all be interested in this collection, it really is a good reflection of Chicago's best ballads.

,B00124JDW4,1,1,5,A two fer. Superb. Early Lloyd.
,B00124JDW4,1,1,4,"You know, I have been listening to a lot of 1965-67 Coltrane lately, and as essential as this is to my system, I need a break.

And maybe that was part of the idea Charles Lloyd had when he put out Forest Flower in 1967. Coltrane, Shepp, Taylor, The Black Panthers, protest vs. revolution. All this had taken over jazz that year. So Charles Lloyd comes along, and Forest Flower says--""This is all supposed to be fun. Chill for a second. We'll make the demonstration tomorrow. Let's play some tunes. RELAX!""

Not that these ""tunes"" leave subtance lacking. Lloyds sense of harmony and melody is increadible. Listening to is chord structres, I feel as if a Beatles or Brian Wilson has been channeled into a jazz man. His chords are so tuneful, this music is just a joy to listen to. Fresh and clean now as it was the day it was born.

I don't have to tell you about the skill of Keith Jarret or Jack Dejonette--there is a reason Miles inducted them--and proof is right here.

There was a lot of great jazz like this during this era, and unfortunately, it gets hidden in the shadow of giants like Coltrane, Miles, and Archie Shepp. Listen to them always, but dig on this sometimes, too."
,B00124JDW4,1,1,4,This is a great cd not only charles lloyd but also keith jarrett in their early years the live section is so well recorded this is a cd worth having in any jazz collection it is five star value
,B00124H9PW,-1,-1,2,It's terrible when FM radio plays out a song that was average to begin with. it makes it even more lackluster to the discerning listener
,B00124H9PW,1,1,5,remembering lots of good times!
,B00124H9PW,1,1,4,"I'm using this track as a reference for learning the keyboard parts for a band.  This song is what I would consider a ""standard"" nowadays."
,B00124H9PW,-1,1,4,"4 stars only because it takes something absolutely awesome for me to rate it 5 stars.
Building up my collections of 70's, 80's & 90's."
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,I love George Benson
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,Would recommend
,B00124DTBK,1,-1,3,"it's more ""smooth jazz"" style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound. features his famous cover version of leon russel's Masquerade"
,B00124DTBK,1,1,4,Satisfied.
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,old favorite especially the title Breezing
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,Excellent disc from benson a classic must have
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"excellent, the sound 5.1 is perfect, a very good product"
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"Great album sounds better,"
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"But I'm finally glad I did. I had forgotten just how much I like the
Smooth Jazz sound of George Benson."
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"So much controversy has been generated regarding the creative merrit of this album that I truly believe it's many enjoyable qualities have been forgotton. Not only that but their are many excellent creative elements to this music as well that are even still ignored to this day for the same reason. So instead of concentrating on this album for what it isn't I'll focus this review on what it is. Throughout his career it's important to understand that George Benson was always on the cutting edge of vocal soul-pop/jazz. Even his earliest albums such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-George-Benson-Cookbook/dp/B0012GMW5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The George Benson Cookbook</a>&nbsp;featured Benson singing pop songs of the day so I am not going to criticize him on this album for doing what he'd always done. The main thing that makes the difference here is that George Benson is modernizing his poppy funk-jazz here for the mid 70's and in terms of music,song selections and just his renowned playing and singing this album certainly takes the cake there. It's not very long in it's entirety but the fairly long cuts that are here are all excellent each in different ways and aside from two one vocal number the instrumentals that dominate this recording give enough time for everyone,especially Benson to strech out instrumentally. No matter how many times I've heard the title song of this album,as far as I know one of only a select few instrumentals associated with Bobby Womack and aside from the rather pretty melody these days I actually really enjoy the bluesy sort of licks gets on the final verses of the song. After having heard the original of ""This Masquerade"" on Leon Russell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carney/dp/B000002U04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carney</a>&nbsp;it gives new meaning to this one. Leon's had a deep bayou flavor to it wheras George Bensosn presents the song as something of an American pop standard with the darkness of the melody baught up to the surface even more along with George's guitar-scating signiture almost making the song into a Benson original as opposed to an interpretation. In fact the only Benson original here is the instrumetal ""So This Is Love?"" which,much like ""Lady"" and the Jose Feliciano cover ""Affirmation"" all get a great balance between soul-jazz,funk and R&B with a tempo and rhythm that variates enough to keep it really interesting and involving. ""Six To Four"" is a great pop/funk that's a bit more uptempo and upbeat than the rest of the album and provides a nice change of pace. This album,all and all is not altogether as pop oriented as you might expect despite Claus Ogerman's flowery string arrangements and the upfront melodies and it actually serves it's purpose very well in that regard. There are plenty of very musical licks from George,Phil Upchurch and everyone else involved in the making of this album so it's not just a commercial triumph for Benson but he didn't totally compromise himself artistically either."
,B00124DTBK,1,1,4,"Benson's best known and greatest commercial success.  It has the necessary hits, and stands the test of time.  I am still looking for a copy of Benson ""Burner"", which is his definitive work."
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"This is still one of my favourite George Benson CDs. He won a 'Record of the Year' Grammy in 1976 for ""This Masquerade"" and rightly so. It's a fantastic vocal performance and the only vocal performance on this record.

He also won a 'Best Pop Instrumental Performance' Grammy that same year for ""Breezin'"" and this was the song I remember being all over the radio back then. But the guitar work on that particular song is nothing compared to what he throws down on the excellent (and proper jazz) songs, ""Affirmation"" and ""So This Is Love?""

But those two are just my favourites. All six tunes are great and this is another of those CDs I put on repeat anytime I play it. One listen is very rarely ever enough. Great production by the celebrated Tommy LiPuma with the orchestra arranged and conducted by the equally legendary Claus Ogerman. It rarely gets any better.

If war or flooding (or something equally disastrous) was on its way and I had the opportunity to take 100 CDs from my collection before I fled, this would definitely be one of them."
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"I have always been a blues guitar fan.
The guitar has always been my favorite instrument to listen to.
Over the years I have not listened to a lot of Jazz. I do appreciate a good jazz musician though, and Benson is one of them.
The first time I heard the CD, years ago when it first came out.
I could not believe my ears. The Sound was incredible and the guitar was exquisite. i Truely wish there were more jazz guitar players with this kind of talent. If there were I would probably listen to jazz as much as I do the blues.
George Benson has come up with a very fine album.
This is one of those albums you play at night while you are in bed and listening to music. I often listen to music at night and I love the mood this artist gets you into.
This Masquerade which was written by Leon Russel and was a major hit for Benson. This to me is the classic Jazz album of all time. This is the master with his grammy winning album. Need I say more?
The album is very good from the first note to the last note.
We simply do not have enough jazz guitar players around, and an album like this proves it................."
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"This album is simply  great Music. I do not know why some people  have to label  everything. Whatever you call it, this material works, its  is smooth, it is great to listen to. The very fact that this music is timeless, and it continues to sell is testimony to its quality. From the regular  listener, to the top guitarist, they all can feel the quality in this album. Worth its weight in multi-platinum."
,B00124DTBK,1,1,4,"This is a wonderful pop/soul album with a light jazz influence. I put it this way because it's not a True jazz album. George Benson proves he is a master at vocal interpretation. The title cut ""Breezin'"" is the album's strongest track. ""This Masquerade"" is also a classic. Although I do prefer the Carpenters' recording of ""This Masquerade"" far more (you just can't beat Karen's deep rich voice)."
,B00124DTBK,1,-1,3,"This is the album that made George Benson a pop superstar. ""This Masquerade"" was a light jazz easy listening hit and ""Breezin"" was a hit too. ""This Masquerade"" had the unique distinction of hitting number one on the jazz, R&B, and pop charts; I wonder if any other tune has performed that trifecta. Jazz players will be very familiar with this tune and having the original version for library was the main reason I picked up a bargain version of the album. I did not realize, however, that the new remastered version has extra versions of some of the tracks as well as a version of ""Down Here On the Ground"" a very Donny Hathawayesque tune that I dig off of the ""Weekend In LA"" album.
""Breezin"" sounds like easy listening light jazz but it's a pleasing chart that I enjoy with its flute hook but it's got a nice groove to it as well and . This stuff drips with 70s production values and has a Bob James kind of sound. If you like that kind of light jazz than ""Breezin"" is an excellent album. I find it to be pleasing light jazz that doesn't wear as well as his ""Weekend In LA"" album, where the live performance brings out more fire for George Benson. This album was one of the blueprints for smooth jazz and folks that dig smooth jazz would be wise to look at Benson, with his soulful jazz chops and breathtaking Hathaway like voice before they dig into the latest thing playing on light jazz radio.
3.5 stars"
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"George Benson's Breezin' was a landmark album in jazz music.  It introduced a style of jazz that was inflected with r&b stylings that made it appealing to a mass audience who necessarily didn't like the genre.  The album hit number one on the Top 200 & r&b charts and stayed at number one on the jazz charts for over a year.  The album was spurred on by Mr. Benson's smooth and elegant cover of ""This Masquerade"" which peaked at number 10 and went on to win the 1976 Grammy for Record of the Year.  But in addition to that great track, the album had five other gems including the appropriately titled title track which has a light, airy Latin vibe, the straight jazz of ""Six To Four"" and the sophistication of ""Lady"".  The remastered version contains three additional tracks including a great song, ""Shark Bite"" and the single edit of ""This Masquerade"" which palls in comparison to the full length version."
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,this is one of George Benson's Greatest Albums.his Playing&vocals are Incredible. Breezin'&this Masquerade still shine.a must have.
,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"This cd is non stop pure soul/jazz.  The project that put George over the top.  George was no newcomer to music, but to the average non-jazz person, this project opened their eyes to the talent of George Benson."
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,WOW !!! This is quite good and should be as well known as some of the Rolling Stones or Beatles LP's. They were quite young but there song writing ability was beyond there years. This is a classic album that should be heard by more people like Sgt. Peppers etc. 180 gram vinyl was awesome. Priced right and shipped fast.
,B00124OEBY,1,1,4,"I've been a fan of the Bee Gees since the 80's.  At that time, they were a 'singles' band, the 'baby Beatles' because of their influence.  After the success of the album 1st, which was more of a compilation of singles, their albums were hit and miss.  So when this album came out, in all it's velvet splendor-it sported a velvet cover, but no single to back it up.  After 45 years, I finally downloaded and listened to it, and there were some songs that could have been singles, although they departed from the 'formula' because they went in a slightly 'country' direction, an idea from one of the non brother members of the band.  Country and symphony, who knew?  The 5 piece band was disintegrating with Robin leaving the group after this release/  They would come back stronger in the 70's, but they kept on recording up until the death of the twins.  The only song that may be familiar is First of May, but the music and lyrics are top notch.  The boys were finding their own voices and style.  But when you consider all the good music coming out in '69-Abbey Road, The who, the San Francisco sound was coining to flourish on the charts, this one, probably also because of it's cost' was ignored.  Maybe that's why it's so endearing now, considering that the guys were Justine Beiber and Miley Cyrus's age when they produced this.  It's an inexpensive download for the original album, and money well spent."
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"""Odessa"" is a totally opulent & progressive ""pop-rock opera"" late sixties musical masterpiece from Barry, Robin & Maurice...music from this magnificent period achieved a level of greatness gone & sadly not happening today, thankfully this tremendous Bee Gees masterpiece has been lovingly restored to its deserved glory in this sublime 3-Disc Box Set, packaging first-rate as is the exalted content. Bonus Disc on its own is a fascinating addition, showing a work in progress while holding its own as a great addition to a satisfying musical journey. Super-groups from this taken for granted miraculous musical era rose to the top, achieving legendary status and to this music lovers ear, Bee Gees remain at the top of this stellar list. ""Odessa"" is an impressive staggering work, this hauntingly glorious set of mesmerizing gems flows, giving total listening pleasure and complete satisfaction...vocals are stunning, arrangements grandiose & richly varied, creative musicians throughout give their all are best of the best! Music lovers don't miss this wondrous & adventursome musical treasure...greatness like this won't happen again, ENJOY!"
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions. This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period! This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original. As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment! From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being ""Tommy"" by the Who and ""White"" album as it's called by the Beatles.

Although never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the ""British Invasion"" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc. This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of ""statement"" album. The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving. The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.

Barry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon/McCartney or Townshend/Entwhistle or Jaggar/Richards and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be. The epic title track shows their strong ability to ""story tell"" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean. Then you have songs with a country fell such as ""Marley Purt Drive"" to the folk sounding ""Melody Fair"" to the bouncy ""Suddenly"" amongst others. Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.

This album really showed that the ""boys"" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19. Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him. Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers. That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later."

,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"ODESSA IS A BEAUTIFUL CD. THE FIRST CD WAS IN STEREO AND WAS FANTASTIC, THE SONGS WERE VERY DEFINED LIKE A STORY. THE SECOND CD WAS IN MONO AND WAS GREAT TOO. THE THIRD CD WAS A BONUS WITH UNREALEASED MATERIAL ON SOME OF THE SONGS. I AM A BEATLES FAN AND LOVE SGT. PEPPER,S AND IN MY PERSONAL OPINON ODESSA IS BETTER THEN SGT PEPPER,S.THIS CD SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE NOTICED. THIS 2 CD SET IS THE BEST THE BEE GEES EVER PRODUCED. THE PACKAGING IS SUPERB. THE OUT SIDE OF THE BOX IS RED VELVET. BOOKLET INSIDE WITH INFORMATION ON THE ALBUM. THE PRICE IS WHY I GOT IT.., MY RATING ON THIS BEAUTIFUL CD IS 5 STARS."
,B00124OEBY,1,1,4,"Can we finally blow this myth about every ambitious rock album being compared to the Beatles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band/dp/B000002UAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>. There was orchestral rock before this masterpiece, and most rock albums using strings and horns from 1967 or 1968 sound nothing like Sgt. Pepper.

Odessa sure doesn't. Where Pepper was really, on one level, about applying any type of music to rock--making it a limitless expanse, Odessa is extremely consistent in sound.

Odessa shoots for an almost Spectorian, Wagnerian sense of orchestral pop. Huge strings, huge echo on the voices. Listen and the Beegees seem to sing out of the funnel center of the bigness they crate.

You'd better get used to this  sound if planning to sit through Odessa, because it runs through what was a double album. (Young? Call mom and she'll explain.) If you like this sound, it is like being stuck in orchestral mud honey. Just surrender and drown in it for the next seventy minutes. There are deviations: some silly sixties light pop, and some country tinged experiments that really work.

But what there is not is a grinding guitar like on Pepper's ""Getting Better,"" rock and roll stomp like""Good Morning."" You would barley know guitars plugged into amplifiers listening to Odessa.

I understand why Pepper is used as a bench mark, and in the sense that rock bands were more free to ""experiment,"" after Pepper, this is accurate. But if Odessa does not actually sound like the Fabs benchmark, that is ok. This massive red string thing sounds fine on it's own"
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"Odessa was the Bee Gees' fourth internationally released album, and their first double album. It was by far their most ambitious release and was had a red-flocked cover and included a poster and sticker. At a certain point the title ""Masterpeace"" was considered.

The band was still a 5-piece band at the beginning of the recordings, but before the release of the album in 1969, guitarist Vince Melouney had left the group.

Though not a direct concept album there are themes about the ship Odessa that runs though the songs. Apart from some long, mostly instrumental orchestral pieces, the music is not really that different from the group's previous releases.

To be regarded as a real classic I find the album too uneven, with too many average songs. There are of course a lot songs, too, that ranks with the very best of their early works.  I have always liked their music best without the big arrangements that often burdened good songs too much.

Simple songs with great melodies like, ""Sudddenly"", ""You'll Never See My Face Again"" and ""I Laugh in Your Face"" are still my favourites. I also used to like ""Marley Purt Drive"", but it seems the songs hasn't aged that well.

Among the classic ballads ""Lamplight"" is outstanding, and ""Melody Fair"" and ""First of May"" are both great songs.

This 3 CD version contains both mono and stereo versions of the original album, and the third CD contains some very interesting alternate versions along with some previously unreleased songs. Many of these are almost as good as the well-known versions, and a few maybe even better; I especially like the alternate mix of ""You'll Never See My Face Again"". The song ""Barbara Came to Stay"", is the same tune as ""Edison"", with different lyrics, and also one of the great additions. For fans of the group, this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums, of course is must.

Great reproduction of the original cover and a fine informative booklet too."
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"After forty years, the Gibb Brothers have finally re-released their most classic and eclectic of albums, ""Odessa"".  Released at the height of their first popularity and the start of their ultimate eighteen-month breakup, these three musicians, barely out of their teens, produced their only double studio album.  Originally coated in a red velvet cover, this is one of the most extravagant re-releases to date.  Originally seventeen songs, varying from the near operatic, ""Odessa (City On The Black Sea)"" to country flavored tunes like, ""Marley Purt Drive"" and ""Give Your Best"", the Gibbs cover nearly every style of pop music available, including rock, orchestral, country and R&B.

Originally slated to be titled, ""An American Opera"" or ""Masterpeace"", this double album epitomizes the height of talent of the Bee Gees boundless creativity.  In addition to two new studio songs, ""Pity"" and ""Nobody's Someone"", there are alternate and demo mixes that will surprise in their originality, beat and alternate verses.  ""Edison"", ""Lamplight"", First Of May"" and ""Whisper, Whisper"" all are given special treatment, sometimes twice.  ""Whisper, Whisper"" is actually Part Two, a welcome addition to a song that originally ended too quickly on a fast, rock driven pace.

Of the three discs (57 songs), the stereo had been remixed/remastered to absolute, crystal clear perfection, bringing out all the muffled sounds that the original LP contained.  The Mono mixes present the songs with emphasis on different vocals and instruments, while the third disc contains all the previously unreleased material.

Fan Joe Brennan of website ""Gibb Songs"" has this great explanation of Stereo vs. Mono recordings:  ""Odessa was recorded on 1-inch 8-track tape reels.  Each of the 8 tracks can be played separately, and each might have the input from one or more microphones.  Each of the 8 could be recorded at different times and places (like New York and London), or erased and re-recorded.  To make stereo, you have to mix down to 2 tracks, and for mono, mix down to 1 track.  While doing this you get to decide how relatively loud each track should be.  That's where the differences come from.  The source is the same 8 track master.  Mono was for old record players, and for AM radio, which was where you heard the latest tunes on your transistor radio or car radio"".

With three discs, a poster, extensive liner notes, photographs of the group, handwritten lyrics, single covers and reel-to-reel listings, a T-Shirt and a sticker all enclosed in a nifty red velvet covered box, this limited edition is a fan and collector's dream."
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"First off, the packaging...in a lovely, luxurious red velvet BOX, not a slipcase as I originally thought it would be...with the title gold embossed.  Open it up and the treasures flow out...first a round red Bee Gees sticker, then a huge poster (double-sided), then a great photo-packed booklet (love the B&W cover, and Robin's buggish sunglasses...he looked downright alien-ish...a precurser to Flaming Lips head genius Wayne Coyne!!)...with incredible, informative liner notes that said what we've always known...prior CD issues were crap (abridged, bad sound, etc) and this was an opportunity to give ""Odessa"" the full glory treatment, and info on EVERY song...all versions.

Now, the songs, oh man, THE SONGS!!!!  There are 3 CDs (as I guessed it would be when I first heard of this deluxe (an understatement if there ever was one) release...CD1 is the 17-track album in stereo, CD2 is the album in MONO (first time released in the US) and CD3 is the REAL treat, the 23-track ""Sketches For Odessa""...cool and fascinating demos, alternate takes (sometimes both), 2 UNRELEASED tracks and a promo spot for the album from some record stores, not the radio.

I won't go into the riches of the songs TOO much, but the lovely folks at Reprise/Rhino must have known about how grand this album is (possibly the Bee Gees' best album ever, a True masterpiece) and how crap prior issues were, so they pulled out all the stops and made this clearly the best-sounding CD version of the album.  I don't know what is better, the stereo or the mono...they both sound great.  I love the songs on ""Odessa"", exquisite orchestral pop with killer melodies & 3-part harmonies and excursions into alt-country/rootsrock a la The Band, and orchestral interludes...it works best playing from beginning to end as one piece, yet each track coulda worked as a killer single (except the 3 instrumentals of course).  Faves are def ""Melody Fair"", ""Marley Purt Drive"", ""Give Your Best"", ""Never Say Never Again"" (ESPESH the CD3 alt version with the fuzz guitar, AWESOME, it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain!!!), ""I Laugh In Your Face"", the awesomely cool Maurice-led ""Suddenly""...on and on, one of THE great pop/powerpop albums EVER made, and that's an understatement...

Now, the REAL treats are the TWO unreleased tracks, ""Nobody's Someone"" & ""Pity""...those songs are AMAZING, and it's wild to know they were in the vaults for 40 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!  They could have been hit singles easily, they sound finished and complete, with great hooks and harmonies, just killer.  Another thing is the album was not done justice by the choice of single released, ""First Of May""...nothing against the song, it's lovely, but it would NOT have been my first choice of first single...""Melody Fair"" or ""Marley Purt Drive"" or the title track would have caught people's attention, and the album would have done better, not widely forgotten except for collectors, hardcore fans and powerpop freaks...

NOW, with this GRAND 3CD reissue, people will realize what they truly missed, the treasures in store for them.

So far, best reissue of 2009...nothing will top this."
,B00124OEBY,-1,1,5,"This album was the ultimate expression of the 1960's Bee Gees sound which Robin Gibb called ""Symphonic Pop"".  Don't overpay for a used copy of this now-deleted disc, because I've got some great news for you fans: on January 12,2009, Reprise Records will release a Deluxe ""40th Anniversary"" 3-CD edition of the album, including the original album in both its' stereo and (unreleased in America) mono mixes, plus a 3rd disc containing 23 previously unreleased selections, including demos, alternate takes,alternate mixes,two unreleased songs(""Nobody's Someone"" & ""Pity"") and a promotional radio spot. The new set will reproduce the original ""flocked""(I.E. velvet-textured) album cover of the original 1969 L.P."
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"Best remembered (and justifiably so) for disco anthems like ""Stayin' Alive"" and ""Night Fever"", The Bee Gees had actually been recording for at least a decade prior to that. This album is more of a pop-rock album, but with some unusual instrumentation and deep, dark, and profound subject matter not often found in mainstream music (even during that time). Songs like ""Edison"" and the title track are dark and haunting, while ones like ""Melody Fair"" and ""Suddenly"" are somewhat less lyrically profound, but all of the songs are extremely well-written and performed."
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,Any True Bee Gees fan and collector wouldn't be caught without this one.  Their music in this one has an up tempo.
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"ODESSA,released in 1969,was a 2 LP set,now available on a single compact disc. My late uncle,a huge Bee Gees fan,never owned this album. My copy is second hand,because I got this at a garage sale years ago. The only hit from the album is FIRST OF MAY which would appear on 2001's THEIR GREATEST HITS-THE RECORD. The LP jacket was beautifully crafted. I love the solid red velvet. It was at this point in the history of the group that brothers Barry,Robin and Maurice Gibb carried on as a trio. This would last until Maurice's death in January 2003. There are three instrumental tracks on this album. They are SEVEN SEAS SYMPHONY,WITH ALL NATIONS and THE BRITISH OPERA."
,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"This is still the lushest of all the Bee Gees' albums, unless you count the late, great CUCUMBER CASTLE.  That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my, oh my- -those songs.  I don't know what the rift was over the band's direction that temporarily broke them up (a family affair, you see), but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious, inglorious Sixties.  It was their last of that decade, and everything they'd done previous to it, great as it may have been, was merely prelude.  In England ODESSA was released as a red-velvet two-LP box set; in the States as a red-velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster-at-sea insert.  You could put the thing on your coffee table (or floor, or kitchen counter) and let it speak for itself, or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean.  Or both, with or without headphones.  Okay, that may be overstating it, but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers' finest compositions, ranging from the story-telling prog-rock of the title track (the cello solo is an ingenious touch) to the lighter-than-air, lovely 'Melody Fair' to the oboe-chugged, acoustic 'Suddenly' (Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor) to the desperately haunted 'Sound Of Love'.  Heck, they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one, the prescient globalists!!  And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot!  And- -'Lamplight'!! You want goofy instead?  Okay, 'Give Your Best', and 'Never Say Never Again'! There! These guys are awesome!  Now, stop me before I start raving about how incredible CUCUMBER CASTLE is!!"
,B00124OEBY,1,1,4,"Yes, this was the Bee Gees 'white' album, only this doubled LP had a red velvet cover and a 'Titanic'-like illustration in the gatefold.  Now available on a single CD, it marks the end of the sixties period for the Bee Gees.
The music?  This was an important time for the Gibbs' who were maturing (at ages 19 and 21) and already millionaires.  The music was conceptual and starting with the title track, it delivers with powerful orchestration and emotional, lyrical simplicity.  It is a skewed look at a fabled seafarer lost at sea and emotionally destitute.  At least, that's what the project started out to be.
Somewhere during the recordings, egos flared and tempers snapped, so what you ended up with is a collection of half Bee Gees conceptual songs and half individual Gibb contributions.  It is still a remarkable recording!
Stand-out cuts are ""Marley Purt Drive"" that could have been recorded by ""The Band"" and ""Melody Fair"", a single in some countries and a well covered track.
Most of the other tracks deal with period issues like, drugs, sex, rock 'n roll, psychodelia and why not?  Producer Stigwood unwittingly fueled the tensions by choosing ""First Of May"" as the A-Side single instead of B-Side ""Lamplight"", which was just as strong.
Regardless, the final outcome is a conceptual album filled with an orchestrally sweeping moodiness aligned with perfect harmonies and lyrics envied by everyone. This is one of the few albums of the period with orchestral solos with the Gibbs providing the chorus.  It is monumental."

,B00126SGA2,-1,-1,1,It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.
,B00126SGA2,-1,-1,2,I understand the urge of trying to make kids music into classical music but this kinda takes away the kid friendliness. My two year old daughter gets bored by this music very quickly.
,B00126UVH8,-1,-1,1,It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.
,B00126UVH8,-1,-1,2,This has to be one of the worst versions of the song I have ever heard. Even my two year old Wheels on the bus expert had issues signing along
,B00126UVH8,1,1,5,"I got a few of the songs from this CD as a free download and they are great for putting your kiddo down for a nap, bedtime or just some quiet time. I would highly recommend this CD!"
,B00126UVH8,1,1,5,My kids love it
,B00126UVH8,-1,-1,2,It's alright
,B00126UVH8,1,1,5,Enjoyable !
,B00126UVH8,1,-1,3,Adequate for preschool age children
,B00126UVH8,1,1,5,Great nostalgic music!
,B00126UVH8,1,1,5,Great products
,B00126UVH8,1,1,5,Great little tune sung by a grand singer (Hollie Steel of Britain Got Talent fame).  She has a grand voice--an only  11 at the time--now  16 and still giving her best.
,B00126UVH8,1,1,4,"The song is a bit long and as a classical/orchestra piece I had no idea what I was going to hear, but I think it sounds really well."
,B00126UVH8,-1,-1,2,"I think I got this album for free. I thought my nephew would enjoy, but he doesn't listen to it much. Now it just sits around on my computer....

This is my least favourite track on the disk..."
,B00126UVH8,1,1,5,"My child enjoys this song very much! I am so glad that I found a ""Wheel On The Bus"" song for free!! It is so hard to find good songs for free!!"
,B00126XM9C,1,1,5,"My young daughter is just loving it! She won't stop playing all the tracks on the ipad (amazon cloud app).... As a parent I am pleased to have her listening to ""age appropriate"" music. But the person who uses it, seems VERY pleased!! So the mom is too! :)

I would recommend this to anyone looking to get music for their children!!"
,B00126XM9C,1,1,5,"My child enjoys this song very much! I am so glad that I found a ""Frere Jacques"" song for free!! It is so hard to find good songs for free!!"

,B00126SG6G,-1,-1,3,It's alright
,B00126SG6G,1,1,4,Very nice version.  Relaxing.  Thanks for the free song!
,B00126SG6G,-1,1,5,AAA
,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,Good song
,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,Great products
,B00126SG6G,1,1,4,"This whimsical version of the classic lullaby does lull and soothe, with its jazzy side. Strangely, the instruments ""wake up"" toward the end before settling down."
,B00126SG6G,-1,-1,1,"even as a freebie, this was a total & complete waste of my time to listen to. fit only for the trash."
,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,"This song is outstanding and truly has a dual purpose: 1) To relax a child and help the child fall asleep. 2) To help an adult who is stressed and wants to relax in about 4 minutes.
For me, I turned this on and closed my eyes so I could relax and I was so relaxed, I fell asleep in my recliner!
So next time, I will play this song before bed and I know I will drift off to sleep.

Highly recommend this song."
,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,"song was great daughter and daycare kids love it
dance and sing to it all the time that we can."
,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,music and I don't even have children to put to sleep anymore!  I just enjoy the softness and since I downloaded it on my Kindle I can listen to music while I read.  Instrumentals are preferable for me when I am reading.  It also brings back wonderful memories of when I rocked my babies long ago and sang to them.
,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,"My young daughter is just loving it! She won't stop playing all the tracks on the ipad (amazon cloud app).... As a parent I am pleased to have her listening to ""age appropriate"" music. But the person who uses it, seems VERY pleased!! So the mom is too! :)

,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,Its a classic. Just the instruments playing me to sleep. I love it. I would recommend this song to you
,B00126SG6G,-1,-1,1,It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.
,B00126SG6G,-1,-1,2,good concept however the song turned out rather boring and my kids do not enjoy listening to it at all.
,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,"I got a few of the songs from this CD as a free download and they are great for putting your kiddo down for a nap, bedtime or just some quiet time. I would highly recommend this CD!"
,B00126SG6G,1,1,5,Perfect when you want baby to sleep... or you want to sleep like a baby!
,B00126SGAW,1,1,5,Enjoyable !
,B00126SGAW,1,1,4,Good for the children
,B00126SGAW,1,-1,3,kids like it
,B00126SGAW,-1,1,5,Hey not my favorite but the grandkids like it so I keep an assortment of children's music to hopefully quieten them down. Sometimes grandpa just needs a break
,B00126SGAW,1,1,5,"The song is a bit long and as a classical/orchestra piece I had no idea what I was going to hear, but I think it sounds really well."
,B00126SGAW,1,1,5,My two year old grandson loves to listen to music. This is his favorite tune to listen to before he goes to bed.
,B00126SGAW,1,1,5,"It was a lot of fun listening to all the songs in this album, even as an adult. Hearing old kids songs in classical format was great!"
,B00126SGAW,1,1,5,"My child enjoys this song very much! I am so glad that I found a ""Twinkle Twinkle"" song for free!! It is so hard to find good songs for free!!"
,B00126SGAW,-1,-1,2,My two year old was very unimpressed with this song. I think they could have made the songs more child friendly
,B00126SGAW,1,1,5,"I got a few of the songs from this CD as a free download and they are great for putting your kiddo down for a nap, bedtime or just some quiet time. I would highly recommend this CD!"
,B00127785A,1,1,5,Nice and relaxing.
,B00127785A,-1,-1,3,"Not bad, but there is better available.  If I had been able to preview this, I may not have purchased it.  Amazon is not very Linux friendly."
,B00127785A,1,1,5,very relaxing
,B00127785A,-1,-1,3,"Appropriate for Intermediate or beginner level meditation or just to use as a relaxer.  Some might like it as it is a nice piece but contained way to much obviously contrived ""music"" in an attempt to lead one's thoughts.  Composed by someone who does not seriously understand what meditation needs.  Suggestive little ""ditties"" in an endless chain does not make for or assist meditation, on the contrary it is actuality a hindrance.  Meditation is a journey to endless personal simplification. Motionless, silent, unhindered, unending, evolving inner space where love, compassion and understanding permeate.  The second piece with passive waves and resonant tones would have been much better except for the interjection of vocals that are identifiable as a human mostly female voice.  In places the voice is almost acceptable but for most of the time it has to much personality and attitude.  The brain wave sync track is great.  The heavy breathing is ridiculous and distracting.  It does a fair job as introductory mind control music and is very relaxing."
,B00127785A,1,1,5,"As an Energy Healer, I use this with my clients during sessions.  Very relaxing."
,B00127785A,1,1,5,Truly a relaxing piece of music for de-stressing and relaxation. I will definitely use this to help with my sleep.
,B00127785A,1,1,5,"Very nice music for relaxing and quiet times in general.

I couldn't tell you if I have ever listened to the entire track, I generally
put my earbuds in and ""Drift"" off to sleep.  It is that soothing."
,B00127785A,-1,-1,1,"This is the worst sleep music I have purchased from Amazon. It is just the same 5 minutes of music, cycled a dozen times. And the music is too intense for a sleep aid."
,B00127785A,1,1,5,"this music is excellent, so moving, so peaceful, and tranquil, the artist is by far excellent i love it as do my clientele"
,B00127NS3Q,1,1,5,Her vocals and the beat are just fabulous together. This is definitely an R&B / Disco Classic. Will play this at many of my Old School gigs!
,B00128B65C,1,1,5,"As a 31-year old fan of music, I wasn't exposed to this music as a kid (unfortunately). So picking up this album was more a discovery trip for me. I was gladly impressed by the harmonies put together by these two brothers from Nashville, a sound that would later influence the early sound of The Beatles and other acts such as Byrds and CSNY. There is a very large number of awesome songs as a part of this hit compilation, but the ones I enjoyed the most were ""Wake Up, Little Susie"", ""All I have to do is Dream"", ""Love of my life"" and ""Take a Message to Mary""."
,B00128LDD2,-1,-1,3,Not that great in sound quality. Had to have it though.
,B00129HN62,1,1,5,"This is one of those songs where a line from one of the verses pops in your head and you find yourself singing the song to yourself :) The more familiar line I'm talking about is: ""We had it all/Just like Bogey and Bacall/Starring in our own late, late show/Sailing away to Key Largo."" Another great song that can be considered timeless :)"
,B00129HN62,1,1,5,The melody and background instruments bring the feel of the Keys for me.  A smooth melody and voice carry the tune and take you to the islands.  It is another timeless classic that has been overlooked by many.  Most people remember the turn when they hear it and the tune has a way of sticking in your head.  Very nice ...with scenes of Bogey and Bacall and late night movies.  The good ol' days...
,B00129HN62,1,1,5,I think it's the tune and the beat that makes this song appeal to me.  Good version.
,B00129HN62,1,1,5,I love this song! Excellent quality recording. And now it's a part of my music library.
,B00129HN62,1,1,5,His famous one hit. So romantic.
,B00129HN62,1,1,5,"I thought this was a superb purchase
it is a favorite and I Would purchase over
and over again, a must buy!!!!"
,B00129GB8I,1,1,5,"I remember being in my best friend's living room listening to this song on American Bandstand.  Every time I hear it, it takes me back to those times, and I always enjoy the trip."
,B00129GB8I,1,1,5,. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great
,B00129GB8I,1,1,5,Great song. This song is part of a compilation I play my daughter when I get her ready to sleep.
,B00129GB8I,1,1,5,I purchased this song to play for a co-worker of mine who says she enjoys eating alone. Just a bit of ribbing in good fun. Really a good song though.
,B00129GB8I,-1,1,4,"I think the snarl is because of the old recording. It is clear through most of the song, but when the louder parts play it is snarly. Otherwise I am happy with the song."
,B00129GB8I,1,1,4,Good slow ballad
,B00129GB8I,1,1,5,Love it!
,B00129GB8I,1,1,5,"I was 16/17 when this song came out...LOVE it and am a fan of Eric Carmen, especially when he was lead singer for The Raspberries!!"
,B00129GB8I,-1,1,5,One of the greats!
,B00129GB8I,1,1,5,"THis song is sad, but beautiful.  The vocals are amazingly beautiful. The lyrics are so True.. ""don't wanna be ... all by myself""..  The music is one of those tunes that sticks with you in your heart and mind and carries you along."
,B00129WK1K,1,1,5,This song takes me back to when I would sit with my grandmother and she would teach me the hymns.
,B00129WK1K,1,1,5,This man truly sings from his experience with God and his love for music.  His has left a legacy of music for the generations.
,B0012ABHWC,1,1,5,This song takes me back to when I would sit with my grandmother and she would teach me the hymns.
,B0012ABHWC,1,1,5,This man truly sings from his experience with God and his love for music.  His has left a legacy of music for the generations.
,B0012AHAXW,1,1,5,Outstanding
,B0012AHAXW,1,1,5,Put it on my KindleFire so I can have it at my fingertips where ever I am.  Wonderful songs and piano playing
,B0012AHAXW,1,1,5,"this is one of if not his best albums. this man boes not play strictly by wrote but puts his stylistics and musical heart in everything he plays. you can't help saying ""that was lovely""."
,B0012AHAXW,1,1,5,"Premium piano playing, I think this is Emile Pandolfi's best piano album as it contains the music that I know and love.  Mr. Pandolfi has the ability to play the piano that I've not seen in other performers."
,B0012C0CJE,1,1,5,"Just good listening (and maybe even sing-a-long!).  The Sugarhill Gang has the knack for music and lyrics that appeal to most everyone.  A quintessential tune!  Try it, you'll see what I mean."
,B0012C2A62,1,1,5,I loved the song!  I'm a follower of many types of music!
,B0012C2A62,1,1,4,but I like this song. But it's not for the kids. I first heard the song in that Keanu Reeves movie Hardball.
,B0012C2A62,1,1,5,This SONG is one of my favorite by Notorious B.I.G....I miss the good old days of rap ....This definitely one of my jams ;)
,B0012C2A62,1,1,4,"I love this song! It brings back some good memories, I really like Notorious BIG sorry that he's gone.... :o)"
,B0012C2A62,1,1,5,"If you like the song, here is a convenient and portable version of it.  That's all I have to say about that."
,B0012C4G8M,-1,1,5,Carl Thomas rocked it with this one. He said what we were thinking as we sit back and watch that shorty go thru tough times but theres nothing we can do about it except be there to soften the fall
,B0012C4G8M,1,1,5,I love Amazon Cloud! it plays well on my Samsung G3 phone and on my PC.  Its so easy to find and purchase songs or albums.
,B0012C4G8M,1,1,4,Carl Thomas is actually an r and b artist with REAL talent and apparently Bad luck...Since his label changes he hasn't really gained the popularity that he deserves...this song stood the test of recent times and still receives ample sways when it hits any radio waves.
,B0012C9HFO,1,1,5,"I don't care where you from you have to respect the man. He came from nothing and became a rap legend. The Ready to Die album is a classic itz like a story book of his life. IDK why people hate big but they can hate all they want but he was the  G.O.A.T. I love 90's hip-hop and B.I.G. is my favorite 90's rapper. Top 5 songs Juicy, Gimme The Loot, The What, Big Poppa, and Warning."
,B0012C9GKU,1,1,5,This is the easiest review to write. AWESOME. One of my favorite Stevie Nicks songs.if you like Stevie you know this song.
,B0012C9GKU,1,1,5,This is one of her best songs.........Stevie Nicks has many hits by herself as well as with the group Fleetwood Mac. Leather and Lace is one of my favorites.  This version is done with the great Don Henley. They sound terrific doing this song together.  Love it.
,B0012C9GKU,1,1,5,"I had such a hard time picking a wedding song when I got married a few years ago. I waffled between Leather and Lace, and Edwin McCain's ""I Could Not Ask For More."" If I could have picked both, I would have. Either way, this song rated highly enough in my book to be considered for the song that I walked down the aisle to. It's a truly beautiful song!"
,B0012C9GKU,-1,1,5,:-)
,B0012C9GKU,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B0012C9GKU,1,1,5,Great duo
,B0012C9HBI,1,1,5,"Great song, well done and with good instruments. Good for a listening in the car on a nice drive. Will always buy music from this artist."
,B0012C9HBI,1,1,5,It's rare that I find a snoop song I don't like.  I actually think this is one of my favorites from all his songs.
,B0012C7DPU,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012C7DPU,1,1,5,Stevie is always a favorite of mine. Such an incredible singer!
,B0012C7DPU,1,1,5,"If you like Stevie, this has to be in her top 3 ever."
,B0012C7DPU,1,1,5,"Stevie Nicks, what else do you need to know."
,B0012C7DPU,1,1,4,"Like a white-wing dove, Stevie Nicks has been a vision of beauty and grace.  Her voice may be ""rough"" to some, but it tells me that she has been there and back like the rest of us, and can still look great."
,B0012C7DPU,1,1,4,I been trying to purchase this song for quite sometime and thanks to Amazon. I play this song over and over again.
,B0012C7DPU,1,1,5,"This song make an excellent collection to my mp3 collection.
Highly recomended for any music lover that loves music from before the 2000s"
,B0012C5NXY,1,1,4,"Black Rob has been in the rap industry for awhile before releasing his own work, mostly he wrote and did beats for the BadBoy label....this will be a classic in years to come."
,B0012CCO68,1,1,5,I have followed Pastor Phipps music career since was singing with the Aolieans Choir. His warm voice and the songs he has done over the years has been great. I look forward to seeing him in concert.
,B0012CCO68,1,1,5,great
,B0012CCO68,1,1,5,It was a present for my wife.  I made BIG points for the gift.
,B0012C9GGY,1,1,5,LOVE IT
,B0012C9GGY,1,1,4,"This song was a fairly big hit for Stevie Nicks. I saw earlier this year that she was given an award. She was also one of the ""DWTS"" episodes and performed her latest song."
,B0012CCOGI,1,1,5,"I love Michael Card's music and the messages he has are very well done.  However, sometimes I think his lyrics seems more like prose than poetry/lyrics and his voice can get a bit annoying.  But I do like his music overall."
,B0012CR22E,1,1,5,Good....as expected
,B0012CR22E,1,1,5,Very pleased
,B0012CR22E,1,1,5,"As another fantastic classic singer, Carly doesn't ever disappoint.  A must have addition to everyone's classic easy listening music collection."
,B0012CS3YU,1,1,5,Great purchase.
,B0012CS3YU,1,1,5,Great!
,B0012CS3YU,1,1,5,great
,B0012CS3YU,1,1,5,My mother asked me to find this.  She'd heard it done recently at an outdoor concert.  Now If i can just figure out how to get it onto a cd...
,B0012CXKYI,1,1,4,A classic
,B0012CXKYI,1,1,5,great
,B0012CXKYI,1,1,5,"This is one of those great ""easy-listening, songs for reflection"" kinda things! A warm fire, a little brie, some red sherry or a nice vintage rose', and Carly Simon on the stereo - an unbeatable combination - timeless music and a great singing voice."
,B0012CXKYI,1,1,4,"This is one of those songs you want to listen to over and over again in either your cassette player, CD player, or watch the music video.  It's great for parties, or for just being alone and listening pleasure.  There's nothing like a great Carly Simon song to make one's day brighten up just a little bit more."
,B0012CXKYI,1,1,5,It was so fun to hear this song at our 40th Class reunion.  Being able to download song to iPhone was easy.
,B0012CXKYI,1,1,5,"This Carly Simon mega-hit is especially interesting with her hard to get-it-hooked-up ending. With a tempo switch and lyrics change, the ending says so much to so many: ""These are the good ol' Days!"". Great Carly!"
,B0012CEQFA,1,1,5,Love Stevie Nicks
,B0012CEQFA,1,1,5,Seemed to be original artist and good quality.  It was  addition to my Ipod.  Thanks amazon.  I get all my music here.
,B0012CEQFA,1,1,5,What can you say but: Prolly the best duet in Rock history.
,B0012CEQFA,1,1,5,a ok
,B0012CEQFA,1,1,5,GREAT COLLABORATION BETWEEN STEVIE NICKS & TOM PETTY
,B0012CEQFA,-1,1,5,That's my girl
,B0012CEQFA,1,1,5,GREAT PRICE FOR SOME GREAT MUSIC
,B0012CEQFA,1,1,5,Great
,B0012CEQFA,1,1,5,Great duet performance of the classic Fleetwood Mac song.
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,This is hands down the biggest hip hop song that was released in 2007. It has a great catchy tune and is a huge hit in the clubs. Not to mention the popularity of the ring tone. Get this one if you don't have it already.
,B0012CDBBU,-1,-1,3,My dogs did adjust to the noise fine but it didn't seem to make that much a difference for bringing baby home.
,B0012CDBBU,1,1,4,This CD has real baby sounds that can help to prepare your pets for a newborn. I found it to be very helpful!
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,Like
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,Good Song
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,Just a catchy beat!

,B0012CCO0E,-1,1,5,"Got this for our MP3 players, we hear it at the bar all the time. And my husband wanted it"
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,"Music is all very personal and I'm not sure why I'm being asked to review it.  What I may love, another person will not, but I'm tired of seeing it on my ""Review Purchases"" screen, so I really love this song."
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,4,"definitely a club song, but doesnt have like that stupid techno beat or anything to it. very upbeat and fast paced. T-pain is a good extra in this song"
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,Met or exceeded my expectations. What is shown is what I received. I to use as often as I can. Great.
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,GREAT SONG TO DANCE TO.  VERY GOOD IN THE MOVIE WITH ANIMALS.  THE APE & MAN DID WELL IN MOVIE SINGING THIS SONG.
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,heard it on the chipmunks movie liked it and had to have it. good song to drive to too lol
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,Love the beat and lyrics. First purchase out of my usual genre on Amazon and I really like it. Thank you.
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,"Some songs I just have to have them...!!!  And this is good to dance, and play.  Good price, easy download, easy pay...!!!"
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,Great song with a great beat done by a great singer. I hope he makes more songs like this. I like this kind of music.
,B0012CCO0E,-1,-1,1,this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,4,"I have never been a big fan of rap, but I actually love this song.  I have wanted to purchase this for quite a while and finally found it on here."
,B0012CCO0E,-1,1,4,My 3 year old son heard this somewhere and kept asking me about the 'low' song. I didn't know what he was talking about.  But I finally found this and it was the correct song he wanted. It's a decent song I guess. He likes it so that's all that matters to keep him calm and quiet while I'm driving.
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,4,"my son downloaded this to his kindle fire, I have not heard it but he seems to have liked it.  He listens to it with his friends."
,B0012CCO0E,-1,-1,1,There are a lot of versions of this song out there. This is not the right one to download. It's taken from a compilation album and starts and ends ubruptly because it was very sloply hacked from the original album.
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,"Finally, some rap that cuts it! Unique sound that changes dynamics and doesn't make me want to gouge out my own eyes after 30 seconds! He brings it. Don't know if I would buy the rest of the album... guess it's fear of disappointment."
,B0012CCO0E,1,1,5,"HOT - check out his homie Devin the Dude&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smoke-Sessions-Vol-1/dp/B00142RX4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1</a>- track 3 getting high is something to smoke to - whoah - this is the first album since Rapalot Days and the first album of Devin's to hit the Billboard Charts - Congrats"
,B0012CCO0E,-1,1,5,"Dope track - if u feelin this u have to check out Devin the Dude -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smoke-Sessions-Vol-1/dp/B00142RX4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;Da Real Thang is off tha chayne"
,B0012DJSZC,1,1,5,Love this recording as I can listen to it for any length of mediation time.  The bowls are played beautifully and help me stay focused during meditation.
,B0012DJSZC,-1,-1,3,"Sometimes when you ""fight"" a drone it just gets more annoying the longer it lasts, while if you harmonize yourself with the drone, you end up being disappointed that it ever ends.  For whatever reason, I find this particular drone one that I tend to fight.  It doesn't give me the relaxation I am looking for.  If you want something that sounds a bit similar but it WAY more relaxing, try:

Peter A. Guala, Sounds of the Gongs and the Crystal Singing Bowls"
,B0012DJSZC,1,1,5,"This is one track, a little over an hour long. It is very relaxing and is one of my favorites to use for meditation."
,B0012DJSZC,-1,-1,2,"I assumed this would have some variance in it, but it is the same bowl being tapped over and over, no overlapping or changes throughout the whole, very long piece. I wonder if they just recorded one gap, then repeated it again and again. There must be better meditational ""music"" (and I use the term loosely there as it is nothing but the ringing of the bowl -- no other instruments, no melody, no chanting, ... nada) than this. I was very disappointed."
,B0012ECGKA,1,-1,3,"Fantastic, cannot get enough of 80's hair bands! You will not regret this purchase. Takes you back to a time where music actually made sense and was worthwhile to listen to."
,B0012ECGKA,1,1,5,"LOVE DAVID AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ROCK SONGS OF THE PAST,,,BRINGS BACK THE GOOD MEMORIES OF ROCK .WHEN ROCK WAS  REAL ROCK, AND HAD TALENT....great song!:)"
,B0012ECGKA,1,1,5,"I got the song to make my own soundtrack of the movie ""Rock of Ages"" with the original version of the song."
,B0012ECGKA,1,1,5,"After seeing Rock of Ages, we had to make sure we had a copy of the original song.  Great for parties, too."
,B0012ECGKA,1,1,5,"Dave does not get enough credit in my opinion. His solo hits, including this one, are on par with his VH hits and I think he's one of the top ten Rock 'n Roll frontmen of all time."
,B0012ECGIC,1,1,5,"Without a doubt, pne of the hottest 80's videos ever and a vintage David Lee Roth peice to say the least."
,B0012ECGIC,1,1,5,"With Katy Perry's ""California Gurls"" on the airwaves all the time nowadays, it makes me nostalgic for the ""California Girls"" of the past... and this MP3 satisfies."
,B0012ECGIC,1,1,4,It's not the Beach Boys but a pretty cool rendition. I like it. It's really close to the original with a (rougher) David Lee Roth sound.
,B0012ECGIC,1,1,5,a peppy song thats perfect in the summer time It was a perfect song to add to the summertime play list
,B0012ECN4Y,1,1,5,Great song...  Canadian reggae!
,B0012ECN4Y,-1,1,5,The version I remember hearing on the radio!
,B0012ECN4Y,1,1,5,"This is one of those classic 90's unintelligeble rap songs to which you simply HAVE to have access. Pandora is great if it comes up, but make sure you have a copy of your very own. And then go find the lyrics online somewhere and giggle to yourself as you attempt to keep up."
,B0012ECN4Y,1,1,5,"I love this song! Reminds me of when I was in high school hanging out with my friends, cruising town. ;)"
,B0012ECN4Y,-1,1,5,See if you can pull off this song a Karoke you will become a legend. Informer you know say daddy me snow me gonna blame.  A lickey boom boom down. Tective man he say me daddy snow me stabbed someone down the lane. A lickey boom boom down.  Haters cant even hate on this.
,B0012ECN7G,1,1,5,It was so fun to hear this song at our 40th Class reunion.  Being able to download song to iPhone was easy.
,B0012ECN7G,1,1,5,I love this song and pretty much everything Tower of Power has made.  This song takes me back to another time and place.  I love the beat and the lyrics.
,B0012ECN7G,1,1,5,"This is one of those timeless classics that almost makes you want to cry. The lyrics are thoughtful and they stop in your tracks when you hear them. After you hear the words of the song, the voice of the singer and his interpretation of the song you suddenly realize how important relationships and loved ones are and you shouldn't take them for granted."
,B0012EEHO8,1,1,5,"If you're a movie buff you heard this in ""Michael"". In fact a lot of his songs turn up at romantic or wrap-up moments in movies where you desire an uplifting end. It's a great tune and comes from a singer as classic in his own way as Tony Benet or Nat King Cole."
,B0012ECMAE,1,1,5,I love this song and have heard it growing up but never knew the name of it. Great song to listen when doing something epic.
,B0012ECMAE,-1,-1,2,Okay song
,B0012ECMAE,1,1,5,"Really good song been looking for it for awhile and could not find the darn song but thank god I found it and it's great.

all n all great

recommend to anybody into this stuff"
,B0012EEL58,-1,-1,2,Where have all the flowers gone? Hmm I would say they wilted and died from this boring song. Why I purchased this one will always amaze me? I guess it was just a blue day and this song certainly did not lift my spirits.
,B0012EEL58,1,1,5,"In my opinion, Peter, Paul and Mary are the greatest folk singers ever.  I've attended their concerts several times and I've seen their televised concerts and have a lot of their music but somehow I missed this one.  Sadly Mary has passed on so there will be no more original music coming from this wonderful trio."
,B0012EEL58,1,1,5,"I was a little girl when this song came out, and all I could remember was a couple of lines that my best friend and I sang together. Those were happy memories, with a friend that I lost track of decades ago. I wanted to travel back in time, so I bought the song.

Absolutely beautiful! I'd forgotten the message behind the song."
,B0012EEL58,1,1,4,There songs are so moving and seem still so relevant.
,B0012EEL58,1,1,5,"This song was another one I heard when I was in the fifth grade.  A older class sung it with a WWll slide show, though it may have a Vietnam War protest song which may bring back memories to older fans and listeners.  While I knew the words, the meaning took a while to seek in.  Girls pick the flowers to give to young men, only to see them go to war, they die and are buried in cemeteries, only to see them go to seed and grow flowers that girls pick.  When will we ever learn?  Fans old and new will probably like this song and its message."
,B0012EEL58,1,1,5,"Music is music, and it's a personal taste as to what songs and genre one prefers.  This is just my kind of music that is unavailable in local stores."
,B0012EEL58,1,1,5,THIS SONG IS A MEMORY FOR ME OF THE 60'S.  PERFORMED AS I REMEMBER IT BY PETER PAUL AND MARY.  LUV KINDLE FOR THIS TYPE OF MUSIC LIBRARY THANKS AGAIN
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,Just What I Was Looking For! Needed a couple of tunes from this cd to complete a compilation of tracks. Download process super easy. Transaction went smooth!
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,great version
,B0012EFV4I,-1,1,5,One of my favorties
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,It is fine
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,great
,B0012EFV4I,-1,1,5,Plus plus plus
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,Chris Cross is great.
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,"had this on music compact disc,can't find it anywhere"
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,Excellent!
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,Great song for a road trip playlist!
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,love it
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,Just a great 80's song.
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,Another Classic!
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,Great song!
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,the song was perfect and we had no difficulty with the download
,B0012EFV4I,1,-1,3,I used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out riding my bicycle. Great ass lyrics: I was born the son of a lawless man Always spoke my mind with my dick  in my hand Lived nine lives Gunned down ten Gonna ride like the wind. I heard CC wrote this for Lowell George of Little Feat.
,B0012EFV4I,1,-1,3,Rock the way it was meant to be. Don't even make music like this anymore. Great time to be alive.
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,"This is such a fun song when your driving out of town, especially at the spur of the moment. It puts a smile on my face each time I hear it."
,B0012EFV4I,1,1,5,"This in my opinion a song of someone riding on a motorcycle with the wind on their face feeling free! Yet for me, it is much more than this. As I do not ride a motorcycle, I can listen to this song and feel free while going for a speed walk, on a picnic or just to relax listening to. It is the kind of song that when I listen to it, it revives me and I feel great. So to me, this is a feel good type of song and recommend for any age to listen to it. And from 4 to 94, it is for the purpose of feeling young of heart and free.

Very highly recommend this song!"
,B0012EELIK,1,1,4,"Used at my daughter's wedding. I am a  Trio fan. For those who remember those days, Kingston Trio advocates did not cotton to PP&M. Still like this one."
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,"I absolutely love this song, and this is an excellent recording of it."
,B0012EELIK,-1,1,5,Genesis 2:44 and Eccl 4:12 all wrapped up in the dulcet tones of Paul Stookey ...
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,perfect
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,"While it is hard to believe that so many people have listed Christopher Cross as a one-album wonder. But, his music has been very melodic and intmate, that it is worth taking a listen too each and every time. His classic 1979 standard Sailing is just as melodic and souldully deep as it was when it has came out over 30 years ago. While he was never a part of the MTV era, his music is still just a great escape to, and honestly still holds up better to all the crap music that has came out over the past several years. If you've loved Christopher's opus, it is worth downloading all over again. While his latest Dr. Faith isn't bad, truthfully Sailing is the one you'll always keep coming back to.

Song: A-"
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,awesome
,B0012EELIK,-1,1,5,ANOTHER OLDIE BUT A GOODIE
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Excellent!!
,B0012EASVO,-1,1,5,bvgrftf
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,I love Christopher Cross he's one of my favorite artist from the 80's and Sailing is one of my favorite song by him a song I would love to have played at my funeral.
,B0012EASVO,-1,1,5,;-)
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Excellent product.  Excellent service. As described.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,It's a wonderful song of getting away to another fantasy place. It really does take you away.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,One of the most peaceful songs ever written.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,This song is unwavering. Just as good now as it was when I first heard it.  Love it.
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,Great song at my Grand daughters wedding.
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,"This is a song for the ages and has been used at many, many weddings.  A great song to listen to while reminiscing."
,B0012EELIK,1,1,4,"Have heard the ""Wedding Song"" in the past & it was time to add it to my music library.  Have enjoyed PP&M's music over the years!!"
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,great
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,great song
,B0012EELIK,1,1,4,SATISFIED
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,"Music is music, and it's a personal taste as to what songs and genre one prefers.  This is just my kind of music that is unavailable in local stores."
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,"I love Peter, Paul & Mary and this song is something I have always wanted but never bought, now I have.  It is perfect for weddings or just listening to while relaxing."
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,"I had the Wedding Song sang at my wedding 20+ years ago.  I absolutely love this song, you will not be disappointed."
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,great version
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Classic
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,It is fine
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Pleasant song that I've always liked.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Classic!
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,great
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Chris cross is great.
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,"...which I'm sure is used at many weddings.  We had it sung by a duet prior to the beginning of our wedding ceremony.  I always liked the song, but I never realized it was sung by a member of Peter, Paul, and Mary..."
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,This has been a favorite song of mine for years. Finally decided to get in on my playlist. Beautiful song.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Great song.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,One of his best hits. High quality download and sounds great
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Love It!
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Sailing by Christopher Cross is a very tranquil adult contemporary pop song that to me appears to just be going with the flow of life and feeling free.  I do enjoy how the peaceful music goes along with the theme of sailing in life through this song.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,I bought this song to put on my thanksgiving day dinner party playlist.  It is so smooth and mellow to listen to in the background.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,4,"As expected
Fast arrival. Good price!"
,B0012EELIK,1,1,5,"Being married over 43 years, it is great to remember everyday that Jesus is the third partner in our marriage."
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Avant and the original!!
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,"The original, very mellow"
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,"Relaxing song. I can see the scenery in my head of sailing on the ocean. Just need to close my eyes and imagine it. Make another great video as well. About as good as any Beatles, Bob Dylan, or Smoky Robinson song."
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Cross' vocal style is unique in pop music.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Listening to great music is a joy and Christopher Cross is one of the best.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,4,An unusual song about the thing that washes all his troubles away.  It is very pleasant
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,wonderful song
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,classic.
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,well produced.
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,great tune
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,Probably one of my favorite songs of all time.
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,love it
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,Love love love it!!
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,I like the song alot
,B0012EASVO,-1,1,4,"I got this song to put on a mix for an ex girlfriend, now when I hear it I am haunted by her BS, totally 80s synth song about as girly as a girls dream of wedding day."
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Love this song.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,I love this love. This song will NEVER get old. The music is great. The singing is great. This is a C-L-A-S-S-I-C that you have got to have in your music collection.
,B0012EESZG,-1,1,5,xlint
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,Awesome
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,The song that broke this band into the big time. I believe they opened Woodstock 2 with it.
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,"A matter of a great new sound and beat when musical competition was at its highest. This was their first but not last excellent cut. I have all of their albums/cassettes and eventually will have it all in digital. Although they haven't released much lately their body of work is still a cut above most other Alternative bands of the last thirty years. All dedicated music listeners should have a collection of selected Collective Soul cuts. The period from about 1990 thru 2005 was probably the greatest influx of new, innovative music in history. In my humble opinion C Soul along with REM were at the top of that period."
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,It's good to know people are still making good music after the '80's!
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,Christopher Cross sings  SAILING beautifully.  This song never fails to relax and cheer me.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,I love this song! Excellent quality recording. And now it's a part of my music library.
,B0012EASVO,-1,1,5,This song has been remade by several artists but I always go back to the OG.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,This is a classic.  I had a choice of buying the original song by Christopher Cross or remake by Nsync.  Both were done well.  But I decided to go with the original version.
,B0012EESZG,1,1,4,Good.
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,great song!
,B0012EESZG,-1,1,5,let the light shine down
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,Great Song!!
,B0012EASVO,1,1,4,Cross's best song.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,4,"This song has a soft, pleasing melody. The music flows forth in pastel colors. But when you try to pin it down, it seems to drift away from you. It is more atmosphere than substance."
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,You can never go wrong with Chris Cross. I grew up on this song so I had to download it to my Amazon mp3 player.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,4,This is a really nice song and the quality is very good. I like this particular artist but to me the song is kind of sad.....but that's just me.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,"Really great song, love 70s music and 80s, it's all good and great and dandy ah ah Keep on rockin"
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,"Heard it on the radio, just had to buy it! Part of the soundtrack of my youth. Buy it now!"
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,"This is one of those songs that I never got to purchase it and soon forgot, lucky me, heard it in a friends radio and used my sound hound to ID it, and this time I wasn't going to forget."
,B0012EESZG,1,1,4,Collective Soul often goes unnoticed as a great band.  I think the original 'Shine' is better than the remake by Pillar.  Amazing what good musicians can do with a 1-4-5 progression in G.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,I love the Amazon Cloud!  Songs download in minutes and are available to listen to.  I like being able to purchase one song and not the whole album.
,B0012EASVO,1,1,5,I purchased this MP3 and downloaded the music into my computer and found that the quality of the sound was incredible and the price was within my budget. I gave this song a FIVE STAR rating! Thank Amazon for the great service and ease of the transaction in whole.
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,"I recently moved all of my music from ITunes to Amazon and I'm glad that I did.  I downloaded the Amazon mp3 player to my phone, which connects to Bluetooth and plays in my car as soon as my phone connects to my car!!! sweet!!! ... the best thing that I have found is the price for mp3s on Amazon seems to be cheaper than ITunes.  Always a plus!"
,B0012EESZG,1,1,5,"GReat song! I love these old '90s songs. It's like a more pop version of grunge, but still totally awesome."
,B0012EESZG,1,-1,3,"It's a great song. I've liked this song ever since it came out back in 1993. The only problem I've had is when I play the song in my car, certain parts of the song cause my car speakers to unpleasantly vibrate. I've downloaded dozens of songs from Amazon and this is the only song that causes a vibration."
,B0012ECKYC,-1,1,5,"Good sound quality but the volume is a little low.  It did have a quick download speed.  Anyone that likes Peter, Paul, and Mary should get this song."
,B0012ECKYC,-1,-1,1,"I just don't like this song. She sings weird in a few parts where she gets real loud and when you're getting into it, she scares you with her loud parts."
,B0012EFZR6,1,1,5,"Another of George Benson's classic hits that is fun to dance, enjoy, and listen to. He sounded like he had fun with this song, and to think, it was only included on one of his early ""The George Benson Collection"" album to fill out the album!!"
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,Tevin Campbell was meant to sing this song. I love the words and how it talks about the way a woman and a man feel that are attracted to each other.
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,"Reminds me of myself as a shy teen trying to talk to someone I had a crush on.  I play this song on repeat and sing some, listen and reflect back. Tevin Campbell at his best!!!"
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,I always loved his music.
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,Great!
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,"MAKE YOU MISS YOUR BABY, YOU LOST"
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,"Great song, dopeness!"
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,Great songs
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,Love the song.
,B0012EJILK,1,1,4,Still a great song.  Not too many 'made by a kid' or 'kiddie group' songs that can cut the mustard once we reach maturity.  I was a child when this was released and it still sounds great now that I am an adult.  There are other songs by kids or kiddie groups that I loved when I was a child but I've outgrown them.  I'm glad I can still enjoy this.
,B0012EJILK,1,1,5,Tevin Campbell has a great voice. It's one of my favorite songs from that period and he was an up and coming singer.
,B0012EFZR6,1,1,5,"Gotta love George Benson. Awesome song, great sound quality."
,B0012EFZR6,1,1,5,Great!
,B0012EFZR6,1,1,5,great song
,B0012EFZR6,1,1,5,I Love The Blues Effects!
,B0012EG1YC,1,1,5,Old School music -- can't help but enjoy it.
,B0012EG1YC,1,1,4,love this song
,B0012EG1YC,1,1,4,"This was a great song tune on an album I wasn't crazy about. Now I can add this to ""favorite Chaka Khan"" disc."
,B0012EG1YC,1,1,5,love  this  music
,B0012EG1YC,1,1,5,Very Enjoyable
,B0012EG1YC,-1,1,5,"No reproduction can equal the original. Never was it afforded the title of a Great Disco Era Hit. She was on target with this one. Even the reproductions lack ""something"" that is present in her voice and the original production."
,B0012EG7D2,1,1,5,"My favorite band, I was raised in the 70's during high school and I love hearing anything they have.  Legs is one of my favorites and will never get tired of hearing it that is why I purchased it, I listen to it every day!"
,B0012EG7D2,1,1,5,"Will definitely down ALL of my favorite music instead of buying the album, CD etc.  Very easy to download with click of a couple of buttons."
,B0012EG7D2,1,1,5,I got this song for my mother (as a joke) but zz top is a great band and this is a real great song

,B0012EJPCM,1,1,5,I remember when this song came out. Holds up well over the years.

,B0012EJPCM,1,1,5,"Come on, it's ZZ Top. They can't make a song that isn't bad-a-freakin-awesome. I usually say that music is subjective, but if you don't like ZZ Top you're wrong! jk"
,B0012EJPCM,1,1,5,Always

,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"I loved this song from the first time I heard it. Though the ending is a little sad, it has a great message about the importance of having True friends."
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"I was a little surprised that I did not have this tune in my collection. Essential to any Peter, Paul, and Mary fan. Glad to finally have it."
,B0012EJGRG,-1,-1,2,"What were they smoking when they wrote this? Probably the same thing I was smoking when I bought it.!
This song should have been put out before it started. The only thing I liked about it was... nothing."
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,Although those who chose to acquire chemical enlightenment tried to make this a drug song it really is a children's song.
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"Peter, Paul, and Mary's song ""Puff, the Magic Dragon"" is a great easy folk song that several of us hear first when we're young.  I remember hearing the song in some equally classic cartoons when I was a kid.  It's also simply a soothing, great song for any age."
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,puff the magic dragon - lol - folk song if you like old school folk music from the 60's and early 70's then this is for you. peter paul and mary are a great folk trio of singers and this is one of there classic folk songs
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,One of my childhood favorites. Catchy novelty tune.
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,perfect
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,Great
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,One of my all-time favorites by the original singers.  A folk song with a story.
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,4,I have been listening to that since i was a toddler.  Great
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,Too cute
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,Grandson and I love this song!
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"I recently purchased the song ""Puff, The Magic Dragon"" (by Peter, Paul and Mary) as a digital download (mp3 file), from the album ""The Very Best Of Peter, Paul And Mary"" and I am very pleased with it.

A long while ago, I can recall owning this song (on a vinyl record at that time) when I was very young. I am not sure as to who sang the version that I had.. all those many years ago - it might have been Peter, Paul and Mary or perhaps it was not them at all.

But I always loved this song!  The mp3 version of the song sounds very good!"
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,great
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,I remember this song from my youth.  The kids and grandkids love it.
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"A children's favorite.  Whoever hears this classic song can't help but sing along or so it seemed when I went to one of their concerts.  Anybody who is familiar with TV
this song know the story of Puff, who liked playing with Jackie who considered Puff to be his favorite friend too.  But, when Jackie outgrew playing with him, Puff was very sad.  But, Puff has new friends now and they all play and have fun.  Fans of this group and of songs for children of all ages will enjoy this personal favorite."
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,Brought back a lot of memories when I had listened to this as a kid.
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"Easy download, excellent quality"
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"Sometimes this tune makes me tear up!  Quality of the music is pretty good since this is an old recording, but it brought back nice memories."
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,5,All 5 of these songs were well known 1970s songs.  They remind me of my working with my father delivering Arnold Bread.  They were the songs on the radio back then.
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,5,These types of songs remind me of great times and bring back wonderful memories. I am so glad that these type of songs are still available.
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,5,"the best old time music to listen to, just the songs from these guys I want and no more, Love it"
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,5,"England Dan & John Ford Coley ""were an American pop rock duo composed of Danny Wayland `England Dan' Seals and John Edward `John Ford' Coley. Native Texans, the duo released eleven albums and nine singles in their career and are best known for their 1976 single, `I'd Really Love to See You Tonight,' a number 2 pop hit and number 1 Adult Contemporary hit. After they disbanded, Seals began performing as Dan Seals and launched a country music career through the 1980s which produced 11 No. 1 hits."" Another reviewer writes that England Dan & John Ford Coley's music was along the lines of ""light pop"" with ""a touch of folk;"" and I agree!

These five tracks are some of their very best music; I love the way they performed so well! England Dan & John Ford Coley could harmonize flawlessly and their melodies were easy on the ear and memorable as well. ""I'd Really Love to See You Tonight"" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and it still sounds great in our time! ""Nights Are Forever Without You"" is a little masterpiece that is timeless; it has great electric guitar work and the arrangement overall is very strong. They cover Todd Rundgren's ""Love Is the Answer"" so well that Todd would surely approve and ""It's Sad to Belong"" is very poignant. The track set ends with England Dan & John Ford Coley performing their awesome ""We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again;"" this is yet another evergreen classic that I could never tire of hearing!

Big fans of England Dan & John Ford Coley will probably have most if not all of these songs already, so I think this music is best geared toward more casual fans and people just discovering their artistry. True, it's very sad that Dan Seals passed away all too young; but he does live on through his music. I highly recommend the beautiful songs of England Dan & John Ford Coley."
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,4,"In the 70's, groups like Bread, Seals & Crofts and England Dan & John Ford Coley made immaculate light pop, and this is a near perfect selection of their main hits. There was a touch of folk to their songs (with both men meeting in Texas, not too far off) and they made one of the best Todd Rundgren covers ever (""Love Is The Answer""). The other four songs are beautifully harmonized top tens from the late 70's, and to this day ""Nights Are Forever"" and ""I'd Really Love To See You Tonight"" hold a certain simple innocence.

I read today that Dan Seals has passed. These songs and his eventual starring turn as a country artist show how much talent the man had and how underrated his work has been."
,B0012EJGRG,-1,1,5,I HAD THIS MUSIC ON LP AND WORE THE RECORD OUT SO I AM REPLACING IT WITH A DIGITAL COPY WHICH I CAN BACK UP AND SAVE. YOU HAVE TO LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC TO REALLY LIKE IT AND ENJOY IT OTHERWISE YOU WILL HATE IT AND CONSIDER IT A WASTE OF MUSIC AND YOUR MONEY. YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE BEFORE YOU BUY. I AM REPLACING ALL OF THE 45'S AND LP'S WITH DIGITAL MUSIC.
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,ALL MY FAVORITE SONGS FROM THE FOLK DAYS IN SCHOOL LUV THE ARTISTS AND THEIR MUSIC.  IT WAS GOOD IN THE 80'S AND IT IS GOOD NOW
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"omg haven't heard this song in ages, when I was a little girl, it was my favorite song in the whole wide world, maybe that's why I love dragon type books, who knows, but it's now in my collection"
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"This brings back some real memories as I grew up watching the cartoon.  Great song, relaxing and always a classic."
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"I love all of Peter,Paul and Mary's music and songs. They inspired me all the time as God inspired me to sing too!"
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,Who doesn't know the words to this song? At least those of us of the older generation. A sing-a-long song.
,B0012EJGRG,1,1,5,"It was only a couple of years since the 'Camelot' days had passed and only a year before a decade of troubles that this clarion-voiced trio sang one of their most iconic songs.  'Puff"" is, of course, not a children's song, but a song for adults about childhood.  When we first heard it in 1964, we went nuts over it.  Now years later when I heard it again, I had trouble suppressing my emotions.  Where are the song writers and singer like them today?  I only bought the single, but I might go back and buy the album."
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,5,Good old tunes that take you back in time.
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,5,Probably not a good choice of album covers but great music.
,B0012ELM8W,-1,1,5,"Mediocre but, most of the music from that time was."
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,4,"They had a nice mellow '70s vibe and although it's hard to hear them on most oldies stations, England Dan and John Ford did well and the Rhino collections are almost always very well done. Price is great, too."
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,5,This is great!!  It is so good to download some Oldie but Goodie tunes.  Worth every penny.  I love them.
,B0012ELM8W,1,1,5,Great album. So had to have it for my music collection. Find it on Amazon and downloaded it for a nice price
,B0012EHIXK,1,1,5,Excellent
,B0012EHIXK,1,1,5,"This is a great tune from Peter, Paul, and Mary during the 60's. It is a nice addition to my collection. I highly recommend the song."
,B0012EHIXK,1,1,5,"Somehow I thought for years that it was really the Mommas and the Pappas that sang this song. I guess I should have realized they were mentioning the Mommas and Pappas in the song, but Pete, Paul, and Mary's vocals for this song sound so much like the Mammas and the Pappas it has me wondering if that was really their intention. I was creating a playlist of the Hippy music for myself and this song had to be added to the list. It is an all time best and will really get you moving."
,B0012EFYDQ,1,1,5,"This song was played during the IMAX film Rocky Mountain Express and I fell in love with it so I bought it and play it several times while working on my laptop.  I love Peter, Paul & Mary so this fit in to all the music I have of theirs."
,B0012EFYDQ,1,1,5,"I love all of Peter,Paul and Mary's music and songs. They inspired me all the time as God inspired me to sing too!"
,B0012EFYDQ,-1,-1,2,"500 miles, 500 miles, 500 miles. Didn't take a rocket scientist to write this song. I'm just happy I was not with her on the 500 mile journey. I think I would have been forced to stick my fingers in my ears so I could not hear her singing, otherwise she would have put me to sleep. Depressing song."
,B0012EG21Y,1,1,5,OMG!  This is old school jam at it's best.  Who doesn't like Chaka Khan!  Love this song.  And for the price you can beat it!
,B0012EHIOE,1,1,4,"I love all of Peter,Paul and Mary's music and songs. They inspired me all the time as God inspired me to sing too!"
,B0012EHIOE,-1,-1,3,"I don't know where they got their lyrics from but I guess the answer is blowing in the wind. It's an okay song, I could do without it. Sorry I wasted my money on it though."
,B0012EHIOE,1,1,5,great
,B0012EHIOE,1,1,5,Love this group.
,B0012EHIOE,1,1,5,Great old song .... perfect sounding
,B0012EHIOE,1,1,5,Who doesn't like this song? It's great!
,B0012EHIOE,1,1,5,"This is a song I have known for a long time, but got the lyrics mixed up as time went by.  Now I can sing along correctly and hopefully not too badly off-key.  I like the challenge it sends to the listener about making the world a better place for future generations.  Fans of this trio should like it, and new listeners may like it as well.  I think it may have been an Anti-Vietnam War song, and if so, it may bring back memories of that era."
,B0012EHIOE,1,1,5,Perfect.  Exactly as described and delivered promptly.
,B0012EHIOE,1,1,5,"Bob Dylan's poetry together with Peter, Paul, and Mary's exquisite harmonies equal perfection.  This song is just as relevant today as it was in the early 1960's.  Beautiful."
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,"Leaving on a jet plane that is. I did not know that she had an affair and that was why she was leaving on a jet plane, but hey ya gotta do what you have to do."
,B0012EFZWG,1,1,5,"Between this magnificant song and ""My Woman From Tokyo"", these two great songs from the early '70's put Deep Purple on the map. Timeless, great ""foot-stomping"", hand-clapping music which will go on forever!!"
,B0012EFZWG,1,1,5,"""Smoke on the Water,"" originally from the great Deep Purple album ""Machine Head,"" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat. This somewhat extended version, recorded live in Japan, has, if anything, even more energy than the original. Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record ""Machine Head"" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.

The song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood,"" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I love live music, and highly endorse this version, and I also recommend ""Machine Head"" (the ""Best Hits"" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price.) One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple."
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,perfect
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,Great download quality. Needed this for flight school students.
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,"I recently purchased this song, ""Leaving On A Jet Plane"" by Peter, Paul and Mary and I am very satisfied with it.

I have liked this song for a while now. So when I noticed that it was ""on sale"" right now, I figured it was probably a great time for me to go ahead and pick it up.

Plus since I had already purchased another song (""Puff, The Magic Dragon"") from this very same album (""The Very Best Of Peter, Paul And Mary"") ..I guess it made even more sense for me to also get this song too.. from the same album.

In any case ""Leaving On A Jet Plane"" sounds very nice.. and I may end up getting some of the other songs from this album someday."
,B0012EJH16,1,1,4,"As expected
Fast arrival. Good price!"
,B0012EJH16,1,1,4,Old school.
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,Brings back memories from my Gov't sponsored tour of Asia.
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,I've loved this song for a LONG time.  So excited to finally add it to my music collection!
,B0012EJH16,-1,1,5,Memories
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,Great Purchase
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,"Wonderful song from my youth (5th grade, to be exact, Fall 1969!!!).  Haunting, melancholy yet beautiful ... Great song by John Denver, terrific interpretation by Peter, Paul and Mary; they really hit this one out of the park."
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,One of my favorites
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,"Great version of the John Denver composition , who could do it better. Hope some one gives it a try"
,B0012EJH16,1,1,4,"By the stars given I will tell you if it was the original recording. Beware, just because it says it's a master, does not mean it's the original release of the record. They recorded them several times, or even rerecord the song years later."
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,"My primary desire to play this song again and again is the angst expressed with people leaving a loved one - just this one more time. It is supposed to hurt, and hurt it does to our singer - hopefully enough that they take their loved one wit them from now on. Besides, life is too short to hurt.
Everyone who has had that door/email/castle gate slammed in their face, who has begun a day or five years and still misses that one at the end of that time, can relate to this mildly complex, woven song."
,B0012EJH16,1,1,4,"Honestly, I can't say that anyone anywhere would like this song.  I was a teenager when Peter, Paul & Mary were topping the charts, and I loved, and still love, their music.  It's folksy.  I find it very pleasant to listen to but not sure people from different eras would appreciate it.  Listen to a sample.  If you like it, I recommend trying their other songs."
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,"This is classic Peter, Paul & Mary. It is as good as any song they performed and is well worth having on kindle"
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,"This is my favorite song of all time. When it comes on my mp3 player, I go to town singing it!! I love it!!!!"
,B0012EJH16,1,1,5,I'm leaving on a Jet plane. Don't know when I'll be back again ..... O babe I hate to go .... Great tune!
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,"What can you say about musical genius? Todd Rundgren is one of my all-time favorite artists. Great song, too. This LP version is, I think
totally awesome."
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,"This was edited for the single version,this is the complete full length version of Todd Rundgren's classic! Essential!"
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,"This song is definitive and covers are desperate and redundant. No one covers Todd, not even Todd himself. The remastering is excellent and I love the included studio chatter."
,B0012F6LL4,-1,1,5,
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,I think that this song is an OLDIE but a GOODIE which was my main reason for adding this song to my large library of music.  I remember hearing this song on the radio quite a bit when I was growing up!!!.
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,Great song quality.  It was almost like listening to original LP
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,great song
,B0012F6LL4,-1,1,5,This song tugges at my Heart
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,4,"Something I remember when I was younger, that today I still embrace. This is just one of many songs by Todd, that reflects the mans unique and creative songwriting talent."
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,Great classic
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012EHIJ4,1,1,5,"I remember hearing this song by Peter, Paul, and Mary when I was a teenager back in the late '60s.  It brings back good memories to me, not to mention I love hearing them sing this song!!

OSSlady"
,B0012EHIJ4,1,1,5,"I remember the 60's, Junior High, High school and the Viet Nam war.  Folk music as it was called moved to the forefront on the music charts.  It was, if you will, the alternative to the horrors we heard and read about every day and watched on TV every night.

Peter, Paul and Mary put out some of the best music in this genre.

While Trini Lopez also sang ""If I Had A Hammer"", my preference hands down is Peter, Paul and Mary's version.  Mary's earthy voice collaborated beautifully with Peter and Paul's harmonies.  Each brought out the best in the other and a truly great song was born.

This song along with ""Where Have All The Flowers Gone"" are must haves for any folk music collection."
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,A Great Recording And At A Good Price!
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,One of favorites from back in the day.
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,"Loved this song, and voice in the 80's, love it today"
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,Love it!
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,I love this song. It is now in my video library. Thank you very much.
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,4,This was a song...based on a real event...that I used...to rejoin life.
,B0012F6O2K,1,1,5,ZZ Top what can I say still like it ... just could not find a my CD of the song ..
,B0012F6LL4,1,-1,3,Not a bad song at all. Just brings back the good ole days.
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,Todd Rundgren is an amazing singer/songwriter.  Always loved his work!
,B0012F6LL4,-1,1,5,Memories
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,"It still sounds as good, and as relevant, as it did years ago, when it was first released. And you?"
,B0012F6LL4,1,1,5,One of those songs that you will always remember upon hearing it but you may not remember the artist he is great
,B0012EHIJ4,-1,1,5,A+++
,B0012EHIJ4,1,1,5,great
,B0012EHIJ4,1,1,5,Still relevant.
,B0012EHIJ4,1,1,5,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.
,B0012EHIJ4,-1,-1,2,Yeah give me a hammer so I can smash this song. Oiy Vey! I use to listen to this song when I was a punk but now I am an old lady and this song just nauseated me...
,B0012F6O2K,1,1,5,Good song
,B0012F6O2K,1,1,5,Love this song!
,B0012F6O2K,1,1,5,Great item
,B0012F6O2K,1,1,5,Pure Texas boogie. Enough said.
,B0012F6O2K,1,1,4,This is great... love this five stars
,B0012F6O2K,-1,1,5,what can I say?  ZZ ROCKS!
,B0012F6U5Q,1,1,5,this was one of the bigger hits for Ricky Lee.  never heard much of her after this song.  good to find it on download to digital.
,B0012F6U5Q,1,1,5,This was her first hit and is one of her best songs. Although she has lots of other great songs as well.
,B0012F6SL2,1,1,5,I CHOSE THE RATING DUE TO THE SONG IS AWESOME AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS THAT GIRL WHAT IS SHE LIKE. I LIKE THE MOVIE AND LIKE SOME OF MADONNA'S SONGS. I GREW UP WITH LOTS OF MID 80'S SONGS CUZ I WAS BORN IN 81. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS FAN OF MADONNA AND EVEN THE MOVIE
,B0012F6SL2,1,-1,1,"Madonna's ""Who's That Girl"" sets a much faster pace than her ""La Isla Bonita"" which goes at a slow pace.  The song is marked by spanish motifs and words, obviously her favorite culture.  This song makes me feel good to be a girl.  This song has intrinsic value in my life."
,B0012F91L6,1,1,4,One of the quintessential songs of the era.  I purchased it as an essential part of my collection of songs I remember from back in the day.  My children laugh of course.  :)
,B0012F6QM8,-1,1,5,There was a book entitled Killing Me Softly. Now there is a movie out starring Brad Pitt called Killing Them Softly. But nothing can top this song or the artist. I give it 5 stars.
,B0012F6QM8,1,-1,3,Dated but mildly enjoyable.
,B0012F6QM8,1,1,5,A Great Recording And At A Good Price!
,B0012F6QM8,1,1,5,Whoa I love this song.  Buy it you will love it.  LOL
,B0012F6QM8,1,1,5,"Gorgeous recording, she's so well captured in this moment. Incredibly intimate song...about music."
,B0012F6QM8,1,1,5,"This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs ever.  Ms. Flack, who at the time was a professor of music professor at Howard University in DC, delivers one of the best performances of her career with a story that anyone who has attended a musical performance and felt something for the performer could readily identify with.  The words, the music, and the singing come together perfectly.  Bravo!"
,B0012F6QM8,1,1,5,Roberta flack what else needs to be said she great the songs great and this song is the epittamy of her songs
,B0012F6QM8,1,1,5,I fell in love with this song the first time I heard it a few weeks ago. I really enjoy listening to it over and over again
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,I bought this version because it is longer than the one I originally bought. Can't listen to this song enough!!
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,a ok
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,Have heard this song a lot over the years and have decided that I needed to own it. I plan on enjoying it a lot. There are some days that no words is the way to go.
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,A classic and always a good listen. If you like funk then you'll like this.
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,Great!
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,"Like I said, this is one of my favorites, next to Stevie Wonder.  The music is pure funk, which is so much more preferable to rap. Especially TODAY'S rap!"
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,Great sound great artists! This is classic music at it's best. I recommend purchasing for your ipod. Great for listening at work or get togethers
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,"Classic Average White Band...music is a throw back to the sixties beat, easy listening that will get your feet moving..."
,B0012F8RKW,1,1,5,Absolutely love this song. Use to play the saxophone (alto & tenor) back in high school. Just love the sound of the sax and they play them well.
,B0012F93D2,1,1,5,"this is truly the ORIGINAL VERSION.  sometimes on itunes they put in ""sound alikes""  this one is really Maria!!!!!  great song from 1970's"
,B0012F93D2,1,1,5,"Maria Muldar laid down this classic soft rock track in 1974.  ""Midnight at the Oasis"" is a song I've always liked, but for some reason I never owned it.  I came across this track recently and I snapped it up.

The tune and lyrics are fun, sleek, romantic, and sexy.  If you haven't heard it lately, treat yourself.  It's fun to dance to, and fun to listen to.

5 stars for nostalgia and fun."
,B0012F93D2,1,1,4,"At a time when everything seemed SO serious, this was a pleasant diversion. I was in college, and it looked like I wasn't going to get drafted after all. We stood on the edge of disco and the '70s (gas lines, Ford, Carter, etc.). Just a little escape."
,B0012F93D2,1,1,5,Love this song
,B0012F93D2,1,1,5,First heard this song years ago . Still love it .
,B0012F93D2,-1,1,4,Memorty Lane
,B0012F93D2,-1,1,5,"The thing I like least about this song and version, is that it gets stuck in my head after hearing it once!  I am a Singer and since the Lyrics are catchy and the melody easy to sing, I have fun with it.  Does anyone know what happened to Maria Muldaur and this was here ONE HIT Wonder?"
,B0012F93D2,1,1,5,Great song. Takes me back! Get the original 70s mix.
,B0012F93D2,1,1,5,always loved this song
,B0012FAPQG,1,1,5,THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.
,B0012FAPQG,1,1,5,"Great song! Crystal clear when playing on my thumb drive connected to my aftermarket stereo USB connection. I love music, it is my life, so I don't mind paying for a few tracks here and there to ensure clarity in the music!"
,B0012F8U40,-1,1,5,Reliving the 70's.
,B0012F8U40,1,1,5,I love the instrumental in this song. Always one of my favorites to belt out in the car along with the CD.
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,5,I only chose one song because it brings back memories that I experienced years ago and I also like the melody.
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,5,Malo's greatest hit remains timeless. I could listen to it everyday.
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,4,like
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,4,GREAT OLD TUNE And MP3 QUALITY RECORDING SOUNDS GREAT :)
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,5,LOVE IT!
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,5,Nice
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,5,"I've loved this song since I first heard it, so very long ago. Ok, I'm not ancient, just getting older. My brothers were very influential about the artists I love today, Malo just happens to be one of them. Who can ever forget ""Suavecito""? I sure can't..not even years of not seeing an actual lowrider can diminish that..."
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,5,"Like Santana music it was played at wedding I attended all the time. Good time, special times, love, peace and happiness"
,B0012FAZRK,1,1,5,I absolutely love this song!!!  I am a child of the 70's and this is when the song was released.  I would play it over and over again.  I was happy to have found this album version.  I have added it to my favorites mix.  Malo what an awesome group!!!
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,I love this song and was glad to have found it on Amazon. It's nice being able to locate favorites so easliy.
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,"Great lite rock ballad. Sedate and melancholy at first and then building into an assertive, almost defiant piano line. Multiple layers of vocal harmony and emotional push."
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,love the song and it is clear the sound is very good get up the good work thanks you much
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,4,Another Ambrosia song that you can still feel.  This is little more moving than a lot of their stuff but the lyrics are timeless.
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,"Memories, oh sweet memories.  The songs of the 60's & 70's are unbeatable by far, I'm sure a lot of people would agree."
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,"Another wonderful smooth sexy Ambrosia ballad.  They had lots of hits, but I like the smooth ones the best.  I had the album once upon a time but seeing as I couldn't play it anymore I sold it. Then I heard this song on Pandora and jumped at the chance to buy it.  I love that we can buy just one song from an LP.  What a deal!  Now I just have to use self discipline a lot!"
,B0012FANR2,-1,-1,1,This was some useless version with a bunch of crap that had nothing to do with the original song. Frankly I was cheated!
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,Brings back memories of clubbing days. I used to dance to this song and it still sounds current.
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,love it.
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,loved this song-had to repurchase it
,B0012FAUV6,1,1,5,Still great songs.
,B0012F6U38,1,1,5,I loved them back then and I love them still!  They put on a show in my town a few years ago and it was great!  Just to hear those good old songs live was unbelievable after all these years!  And it was a free concert!!
,B0012F6U38,1,1,5,Great song
,B0012F6U38,1,1,5,Great hit. I simply love  it.
,B0012F6U38,1,1,5,"love this song,over & over again"
,B0012F6U38,1,1,5,Still love the 70's.
,B0012F6U38,1,1,5,This structure has relaxed borders. His voice comes into the light and soars like a golden Phoenix. Love makes it possible.
,B0012F6U38,1,1,5,This song makes me feel good and expresses the best thing about being in love.  Love to listen to this when I a driving.
,B0012FC65O,1,1,5,Great
,B0012FC65O,1,1,5,Great
,B0012FC65O,1,1,5,I DJ'd a party they were from Trinadad so I got the music they wanted downloaded it from the digital download area. They wanted these particular songs.
,B0012FC65O,1,1,5,I just had to get this song to bring back memories from my childhood. On my phone and computer so I can listen to it while cutting grass or snowmobiling!
,B0012FC65O,1,1,5,"WOW, I heard this song on the oldies show on TV. I loved it because it has my name in it."
,B0012FC65O,1,1,5,I Love the beat.  The voice isn't the greatest but the beat makes up for it.  Nice recording to have.
,B0012FC65O,1,1,5,I really like the way he has done this song.  It reminded me of the oldies but goodies.  Well worth a listen.
,B0012FC65O,1,1,5,"From the 1983 ""Swingin'"" is a great song. Doesn't matter that it is considered as ""Country"". We went thru a ""Country"" phase probably due to the popularity and carry over of the movie ""Urban Cowboy"". However, it is impossible to NOT tap one's foot and want to move when listening to list song. As a bonus, Amazon encoded this song at 256 kpbs for a great audio sound. I thank John Anderson for this enjoyable song and for his talent. Great song from the early 1980's. You will enjoy it. Listen to the preview and buy it!"
,B0012FC7NA,1,1,5,"Always liked ZZ Top, but this is one I hadn't heard before.  Very nice piece.  I've found myself playing it a lot lately."
,B0012FC5PA,1,1,5,Great song. Love the band.
,B0012FC3WK,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorite Ray Charles songs. It is the same studio recording (as heard on the Cosby Show, if you're my age) and the remastered version gives it a better sound. It is not a live or concert version."
,B0012FC3WK,1,1,4,"Could not find the single anywhere, but then I came to Amizon.com!!!!! I was certainly pleased with convience to able to download and play."
,B0012FC3WK,1,1,4,"I heard this song on the Bill Cosby show, and it brought back my childhood. It is a True example of the rythem and blues music of the 1950's. The remastered version is probably better than what I would have heard on the radio way back when."
,B0012FDK5E,1,1,4,great song
,B0012FCIZ2,1,1,5,"the best old time music to listen to, just the songs from these guys I want and no more, Love it"
,B0012FCIZ2,1,1,5,"Seals & Crofts ""were a band made up of Jim Seals (born James Seals, October 17, 1941) and Dash Crofts (born Darrell Crofts, August 14, 1940). The soft rock duo was one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. They are best known for their Hot 100 No. 6 hits `Summer Breeze,' `Diamond Girl,' and `Get Closer.'""

These five tracks are an excellent introduction to the magical artistry of Seals & Crofts. Their music is awesome! ""Summer Breeze"" has a terrific soft rock flavor to it; this mellow tune couldn't have been done any better and it remains a classic song. Like ""Summer Breeze,"" ""Get Closer"" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and just one listen will tell you why--this sweet tune is catchy and very well performed by Seals & Crofts. ""Hummingbird"" is easy on the ear and ""Diamond Girl,"" as mentioned above, was one of their biggest hits ever. The five tracks end with Seals & Crofts performing the poignant ""We May Never Pass This Way (Again);"" it's very impressive!

This is not only an excellent introduction to Seals & Crofts; it's also great for the rather casual fan who may not have all of these tracks already--this music is here for download! I highly recommend the fine music of Seals & Crofts."
,B0012FDSCY,1,1,5,"I just love those/this old tunes from back in the day.
No problems with downloading.  Very easy. Sounds wonderful on my HDF"
,B0012F6NAS,1,1,4,I'm not to sure when the song was released but it is a sweet tune. Larson has one of those country/ folk tunes kind of voice.
,B0012F6NAS,1,1,5,This has been one of my favorite artists and songs since the 70's  I downloaded this into Cloud.  Convenient and easy.  I will buy songs like this again.
,B0012F6NAS,1,1,5,"I have bought some songs that were huge disappointments because of lack of quality in reproduction, cheap re-dos, and karaoke renditions that weren't made clear as to what they were.  This one, though, was excellent.  Larson's 'Lotta Love"" was superb and I love it."
,B0012F6NAS,1,1,4,just love the oldies instead of some of the songs they call music today.
,B0012F6NAS,-1,1,4,I get it
,B0012F6NAS,-1,1,5,Memories
,B0012F6NAS,1,1,4,I have always liked this song so I found it on Amazon and bought it and am still enjoying it. Great song
,B0012F6NAS,1,1,5,I remember when this played on the radio in '79 or '80.  Brings back memories of my younger days.  Highly recommend.
,B0012F6NAS,1,1,5,"Loved hearing this song when I was younger and Nicolette's voice was amazing.
This will go into my favorite collection."
,B0012F6NAS,1,1,5,"I've always loved this song and I love the fact that most of Amazon's songs are only .99 each, so I don't have to buy the entire album and get songs I either don't like or have never heard of."
,B0012FC5B4,1,1,5,"I admit, it took awhile for the song to grow on me.  The more I heard it on the radio, the more I liked it.  I was making a compilation for my wife and this song wasn't on any of the compilations we already had in our collection.  I bought the download and am very satisfied.  It sounds just like the version I hear on the radio today.

This is a very nice Motown-style song.  It's just wonderful music."
,B0012FE454,-1,-1,3,"The last three concerts of the Monkees summer 1967 concert tour were professionally recorded, with the idea of assembling a live album from the tapes.  Also, two weeks before those concerts, a member of the Monkees touring crew recorded one of their concerts, probably for his own use.  As far as I know, these four concerts are the only recordings of Monkees concerts from the 1960s that exist.  Unfortunately, the exact same songs were played in the exact same order at all four shows.  Which is not to say that the concerts are exactly the same.  The Monkees make different mistakes at each of the concerts.  Sometimes they sing the wrong lyrics, sometimes they play the wrong notes.  And there are often technical problems with the microphones and instruments.  Probably the major difference other than the mistakes is in the ad libs that the Monkees say during the concerts.  They even occasionally ad lib a few lines from songs like ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" and ""Act Naturally"".  So, is it worth owning copies of all four concerts?  Not really, unless you're an absolute Monkees fanatic.  Of course, I own this collection, so I guess you know where I stand."
,B0012FE454,-1,-1,2,"When I was 11 years old(1967) I attended a Monkees concert on this tour,and certainly,these 4 concerts are True to what I remember hearing at The Miami Beach Convention Hall(yes,I was at one of the 6 shows where Jimi Hendrix was one of the warmup acts).What you get in this 4 disc set are 3 concerts professionally recorded on 4-track by RCA engineer Hank Cicalo and one mono soundboard tape from Mobile,Alabama recorded by one of the group's roadies. The Mobile tape sounds somewhat better here than on bootleg editions. The primary fault is with the group's performances. As we all know,the Monkees were singer/actors hired to portray musicians,and on the group's first 2 studio albums,98% of the instruments were played by sessionmen. Even if Mickey Dolenz(Drums),Mike Nesmith(guitar),Peter Tork(Bass,electric piano.organ) & Davy Jones(tambourine) had been better players,they were in a no-win situation,trying to play songs from the first 2 albums,which featured up to 10 instruments per song. Typical Monkees fans would be best advised to buy Rhino's ""Live 1967"" CD,which creates one ideal set from the three professionally recorded shows(all the shows had the same song line-ups).For those who do purchase this 4-CD set,you'll note that none of the selections in the 3 professionally recorded shows match exactly with the recordings as heard on ""Live 1967"".I suspect that on ""Live 1967"",that Rhino engineers(who had access to 3 renditions of each songs) spliced between renditions,used sampling,or (perhaps) had The Monkees come into the studio to overdub/correct the recordings. What you'll get if you buy this set is the REAL(not particularly listenable!) ragged/amateur/garage band sound of The Monkees circa 1967,albeit lovingly packaged by Rhino Handmade. But ""Live 1967"" is much more listenable."

,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Listening to this  will take you back in time.
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"I like the Isley  brothers version, but remember this is the original."
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Love this song.
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Great song and this is an excellent recording.
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Great old 70's song.  I still love it.
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"Seals and Crofts, always takes me home"
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,4,VERY GOOD
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Great old favorite.

,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,good song
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,one of my very favorite songs glad i have it on amazon music on my roku 4
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"OH SO GREAT !!!!! THE WORDS ARE TIME-LESS, AND SPECIAL TO ME, FOR I KNEW A SPECIAL GIRL NAMED SUMMER."
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Love it.

,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Another classic
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"From my early teen years, this soft rock song has the energy to transport you back to a simpler time.  I love this song.  A must have for anyone who loves 70's music."
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Awesome song!
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"Not much to say about it other than I like it.  A good ""sing along"" song."
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Makes you remember summers of old.
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,4,good
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,The very first note makes me smile. By the end of the first chorus I'm bound to be in a better mood.
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,this is a cool song to listen to on lazy summer afternoons I think it's really cool and I love it anyone who loves his 70's will love this song
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,4,Rock the way it was meant to be. Don't even make music like this anymore. Great time to be alive.
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,Forgot how great this song makes me feel. Wonderful words that describe coming home from work and shes waiting there not a care in the world!
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"As a seventies hippie, I was glad to hear this song again after years. It brings back memories and sets a special mood."
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"This song make an excellent collection to my mp3 collection.
Highly recomended for any music lover that loves music from before the 2000s"
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"I know that most people may prefer The Isleys version of this, which is alright. But, for purity of song and tone, this version wins hands down. This is coming from a non fan of the group, at that! But, I can't help but love this song, because, quite frankly, it's so well done."
,B0012FDNHY,1,1,5,"I always enjoyed this song, although I wouldn't consider it rock, more a gentle pop type song.  The harmonies are quite pleasant, and the intent seems nostalgic."
,B0012FC3IY,1,1,4,"This is such a great pop vocal and lyrically written song. Out of all the versions i've ever heard, Delaney& Bonnie nail it without sounding too country. And i'm not complaining about country music, but their version can go either way. Another great one for the music library"
,B0012FCG0Y,1,1,5,Great music from when I was a kid.
,B0012FFPDE,1,1,5,This is a small little collection but it was cheap and you get Firefall's three big hits. Every classic rock fan should have these in their collection.
,B0012FFPDE,1,1,5,"Firefall ""is a rock band that formed in Boulder, Colorado in 1974. It was founded by Rick Roberts, who had been in the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Jock Bartley, who had been Tommy Bolin's replacement in Zephyr. The band's biggest hit single, `You Are the Woman,' peaked at number 9 on the Billboard charts in 1976. Other hits include `Just Remember I Love You' (# 11 in 1977), `Strange Way' (# 11 in 1978), `Cinderella' (# 34 in 1977) and `Staying with It' (# 37 in 1981) with female vocalist Lisa Nemzo."" (Wikipedia).

These five tracks are some of Firefall's best music. ""You Are the Woman"" has a sweet melody and Firefall does this really well--it's a classic that got lots of airplay when it was originally released! ""You Are the Woman"" still sounds good today. ""Just Remember I Love You"" also was a big hit for the band; just one listen will tell you why! The guitar is well used in the musical arrangement and this couldn't have been done any better. ""Strange Way"" features Firefall singing and playing at their usual very best; and ""So Long"" is an excellent tune. The track set ends with Firefall performing ""Livin' Ain't Livin';"" it leaves me wanting more from this awesome group!

Firefall biggest fans will probably have most if not all of this great music already, so I think this music is best for the more casual fan or newcomers just discovering Firefall's incredible artistry. I highly recommend their music."
,B0012FCKUK,-1,-1,2,Ambrosia Anthology had the same songs plus many more so it was a far better deal. I thought I might get a better quality sound but it was the same.
,B0012FCKUK,1,1,5,"Ambrosia ""is an American rock band formed in southern California in 1970. Ambrosia had five Top Forty hit singles between 1975 and 1980. The ""founding members included guitarist/vocalist David Pack, bassist/vocalist Joe Puerta, keyboardist Christopher North, and drummer Burleigh Drummond, fused symphonic art rock with a slickly produced pop sound. The group was discovered in 1971 by Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor Zubin Mehta, who featured Ambrosia as part of a so-called All-American Dream Concert. However, it took them four more years to get a record contract; Ambrosia was released in 1975 and spawned the chart singles `Holdin' on to Yesterday' and `Nice, Nice, Very Nice.'""

These five tracks by Ambrosia give us just some of their best; this is great for casual fans and people just discovering their beautiful music. ""Biggest Part of Me"" was a big hit and it still gets airplay in our times; Ambrosia performs this with a lot of genuine passion and the music fits in perfectly with their vocals--great! ""How Much I Feel"" was another hit for the group and just one listen tells you why; this is a charming tune. ""Holdin' on to Yesterday"" is yet another awesome song by this band and it all holds its own very well. ""Nice, Nice, Very Nice"" is easy on the ear and the track set ends with Ambrosia performing their fine ""You're The Only Woman (You & I)."" Now THIS is great music!

Ambrosia fans should download any tracks here that they don't have already; but as I wrote above this is best geared toward casual fans and newcomers to their artistry. I highly recommend the singularly beautiful music of Ambrosia."
,B0012FFLME,1,1,5,Great music.
,B0012FFLME,1,1,5,Love this band
,B0012FFLME,1,1,5,"Wouldn't have got it if I didn't like it, right?"
,B0012FAV74,-1,1,4,"Needed it on my phone the other day, and instead of finding my cd, just downloaded it. Oh well, just lazy, but KC is the disco master, so why not?"
,B0012JQVT2,1,1,4,"This is a great album. Every song has something to offer, some more than others. Only wish there were a few more tracks and less interludes."
,B0012JQVT2,1,1,5,"If this album doesn't make you think, have someone check to see if you still have a pulse. There are some amazing lyrics here. My favorite song right now probably makes sense because Easter is tomorrow. The Cross. That song may choke you up, because I personally never considered how much Christ was taking on to himself for our sakes. It is crazy! Jesus! I thank you so much my Lord! Wow!"
,B0012JQVT2,1,-1,3,"As with Shai Linne's previous joint&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solus-Christus-Project/dp/B0007WLBM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Solus Christus Project</a>&nbsp;The Atonement, as can be judged by the title of his sophomore CD, is a weighty subject based CD that you'd do well to listen to over a cup of coffee or tea.
The Subject matter The Atonement, relates to God' great love for us, personified through the Live, death & resurrection of God's Only Son, Jesus Christ, and includes songs relating to the death of Jesus (Were you There,& The Cross) celebrating the fact that he is alive & living today( Jesus is Alive) among other topics.

Pros: As with most Lampmode CDs this is a very useful tool for strengthen your walk with Christ. Whilst I might not bump these tunes in my ride, I do listen to them on my Hi-fi system and bible in hand.

Cons: the interludes, whilst interesting on the first or second play, become items that you fast forward on further plays. Whilst I can't criticize the subject matter on display, some of the production/music doesn't live up to the great lyrics on display (In Adam all Die, Were You There? The Cross)

Favourite tracks: School Daze, Mission Accomplished, The Gospel"
,B0012MZ71C,1,1,5,"I got the see Colin Hay live in Michigan in the summer of 09 and his solo music has been all over my phone and mp3 player since.  Can't get enough.  If you think you know him from Men at Work... you only know a small, small part of who Colin Hay is."
,B0012MZ71C,1,1,5,Great acoustic version

,B0012MZ71C,1,1,4,"This guy was in an episode of Scrubbs and he played this song throughout the episode.  It was stuck in my head soo bad that I shazammed it and downloaded it.  It was the main song that I listened to for about a week.  I just love the track, it has great flow.  His voice is calming, the guitar sounds great.  Anyways, I have not heard any of his other music to my knowledge, but I highly recommend this song :)"
,B0012MZ71C,1,1,5,"A song that seems to fit no matter the year - timeless.

TO AMAZON: Even though I didn't feel like saying anything else about this song and because you ""required' me to title my rating and ""required"" a minimum of 20 words in this description, I don't believe I shall rate ANYTHING ever again. Ratings are voluntary; they should not have ANY ""requirements"". Amazon has been where I buy my books, Kindle books, mp3's, camera accessories, and more for many, many years!!! I also paid for your MP3 Cloud (Premium) year subscription even though there are a lot of FREE cloud players. But if you continue barraging me with ""rate"" emails, I will leave and find another place to purchase what I want or even need. Additionally, since I now have a tablet, I didn't need my Kindle Fire anymore so I gave it away. Therefore, I don't even really need ""Kindle books""; I can get ANY ebooks from anywhere. And I added all this in because of your ""requirements"". You weren't satisfied with my initial 11 words that were all I REALLY wanted to write."

,B0012P6MX6,1,1,5,"After seeing the movie I knew that I just had to have the soundtrack as well.  Love it, love it, love it!!!!!!"
,B0012QHVEE,1,1,5,The jazz inspired drumming is fantastic. As are the keyboards & guitar.
,B0012QHVEE,1,1,5,This is seven minutes of mind blowing music unmatched.
,B0012QHVEE,1,1,4,"overall, a good song-one of the Doors best. .More appealing for those who like a special dying breed of music(60s psych mvmt)"
,B0012QHVEE,1,1,5,"I recently moved all of my music from ITunes to Amazon and I'm glad that I did.  I downloaded the Amazon mp3 player to my phone, which connects to Bluetooth and plays in my car as soon as my phone connects to my car!!! sweet!!! ... the best thing that I have found is the price for mp3s on Amazon seems to be cheaper than ITunes.  Always a plus!"
,B0012QHVEE,1,1,5,"This song captures the once and mythical atmosphere of Los Angeles as perfectly as the very best black and white ""Film Noir"" private detective movies from the 1940's and 50's.  Again, the Doors have created an essential American classic."
,B0012QLMLM,1,1,5,"I chose to give this a 5 star rating b/c I love this song. I purchased it and it went stright to my kindle fire and works and sounds fantastic. If you love 90's music, this is a must for you."
,B0012QLMLM,1,1,4,"This is an older classic, and I discovered it on Pandora. Decided I liked it enough to buy it. Wording is somewhat ambiguous, though the words do make some sense as opposed to tireless repetitions of one line which you see all too often these days. I ended up finding the full CD in a used store a few days later and am really starting to enjoy exploring this group."
,B0012QLP5K,1,1,5,"I remember this one from the record, and from Apocalypse  Now.  Great on it's own, and added a very haunting quality to the film."
,B0012QLP5K,1,1,4,"I purchased this track to add to a CD I was making to put in my car(s) when I travel.  I wanted a variety of songs from ""my time"" and added this one to the track.  It's a good track if you like the Doors."
,B0012QLMIU,1,1,5,fun song to sing to
,B0012QLMIU,1,1,4,Classic!
,B0012QLMIU,1,1,5,Another great 90's song. It's really fun to jam out to in the car after a long day at work.
,B0012QLMIU,1,1,5,"This catchy tune, despite its topic, is an instant pick-me-up for an otherwise rainy afternoon.  Of the mid-90's weekly top ten hits, this is among the most enduring--just try to listen to this tune without singing along!"
,B0012QOZQQ,1,1,5,"Takes me back to the Yes Concert I attended when I was 18yrs, totally wild, love it!!  I will definitely be buying more music from Amazon!"
,B0012QOZQQ,1,1,5,"This is not only an excellent song, but the MP3 file is excellent quality.  I have liked this song since I first heard it in a jeans store in the Paramus Park Mall in New Jersey."
,B0012QOZQQ,1,1,5,I never owned a copy of this song but always liked it.  And when I found out that is was a long song (over 7 minutes) I decided to download it.  Glad I did.  The remastered versions of these songs sound so much cleaner.  YES produced some great music in the 70's and 80's.
,B0012QOZQQ,1,1,5,"Do I really have to review this? For many, this is the only Yes song they've ever heard - well, this and ""Owner Of A Lonely Heart"" - but it's arguably the best distillation of everything good about Yes. As was the case with the Doors' ""Light My Fire,"" many of us first heard the edited 45 rpm version back in '72, only to find there was a version twice as long on the album. Come to think of it, ""Roundabout"" dashes through the door ""Light My Fire"" had opened five years previously. Both employ a prominent Classical-sounding organ riff along with Spanish guitar scales. However, next to ""Roundablut,"" ""Light My Fire"" sounds positively earthbound (not that that's a bad thing). Maybe the Doors and Yes should have swapped lead singers, just as an experiment. I can imagine Jon Anderson singing ""The End,"" but I can't imagine Jim Morrison singing ""Roundabout."" There, have I typed enough words for this to qualify as a review?"
,B0012QOZQQ,1,1,5,Yes
,B0012QOZQQ,1,1,5,"For us baby boomers, they just don't produce songs of this caliper.
deluxe edition well worth it! Just one taste of this album you will want it all!"
,B0012QOZQQ,1,1,4,Classic Rock song. Every guitar student should learn the slide part of song easy to play and sounds good. Cool
,B0012QOZQQ,1,1,5,"I played this song so many times at home, and in my 1966 VW squareback. It can only be played loudly! My Dad used to say he could hear my car before he could see my car. And no, no hearing damage! :))))"
,B0012QLX1Q,1,1,5,These songs never get old. This is still one of my favorite decades in music due to groups like Third Eye Blind.
,B0012UX108,1,1,5,I concur with ALL of the previous reviewers!  This is a work of musical art that NEEDS to live on for future generations!!  This is an open message to Don and Susan... PLEASE re-release it on CD!!!
,B0012XA6MG,1,1,5,A great picture that capitalizes on a great tune. This version is well done especially in the concluding up tick in orchestration.
,B00130JN72,1,1,5,Some songs from your younger years were great back then but when you here them today you could take 'em or 'em. Loved this one when it came out and still do.
,B00130JN72,-1,1,4,What to say.  This seems strange to write a review for one song.  This is the type of song I would hate if introduced to it today.  I do love the song though due to the memories of youth and a less heavy world.  The beat and song are just light and fun.  Good for a walk down memory lane.  Can't say I care for anything else by T'Pau but this song hits the spot.
,B00130JN72,1,1,5,GOOD
,B00130JN72,1,1,5,Love this song
,B00130JN72,1,1,5,sweet
,B00130JN72,1,1,4,"good song to listen to
classic
great to find on mp3
hard to find elsewhere
very good quality and bit rate"
,B00130JN72,1,1,5,We used this for our Home Coming in High School Pep Rally Basketball game back in the late 80's.  You could feel the energy and great to be able to find it at Amazon.
,B00130JN72,1,1,5,"I always liked the 80's musik mainly I just buy the singles or one or 2 songs from a album,"
,B00130N6B6,1,1,5,"MP3 file was purchased, downloaded and updated in a timely manner.  I purchase all my music from Amazon and really like the cloud features and functions."
,B00130N6B6,-1,1,5,What a voice
,B00130N6B6,-1,1,5,it's ok
,B00130N6B6,1,1,5,how can you not love Faron Young!
,B00130N6B6,1,1,5,Great.
,B00130N6B6,1,1,4,Great song
,B00130N6B6,1,1,5,I am divorced so a lot of the sad songs I was listening to was sad songs back then now I just enjoy listening to the old music.
,B00130N6B6,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorites, of course I have a lot of old country favorites but love Faron Young and just love this song."
,B00130N6B6,1,1,4,"How does it get any better than this? Hello Walls is one of the classic, twangy, corny CW songs from the 50's. Tells a great story of heartache in just a few verses."
,B00130O50M,1,1,5,"The lyrics really portray a sense of helplessness without God, which I think is a great message. The beat is also really cool, although it reminds me of ""Camisa Negra"" at some points, which is another good Juanes song."
,B00130NNJ6,1,1,5,"Good bachata dance song...This is being played at Latin dance locations, and
most of the Bachata people seem to love it."
,B00130PR54,1,1,4,"This is a great classic rock/bluesey rock band with a piano thrown in for some southern-fried swagger.  Kind of a bluesy, gospel-ey sound with heavy guitars.  Their sound is hilighted by the strong, heavy, and  soulful George Ratzlaff vocals, man does this guy have some pipes!!

Includes mostly faithful covers of Red Rooster, You're No Good and a nice slowed-up cover of The Beatles Lady Madonna.  Mostly a bluesy, 70's rock vibe with good guitars.  A great listen for fans of Humble Pie, Stones or Faces.  The band had three albums so someone at the label obviously recognized some potential.

Also worthwhile from the 70's blues/psych/rock cannon, check out Head Over Heels, Black Cat Bones, White Chocolate, and the awesome smokin hot guitar album Totty!!!"
,B00130PR54,1,1,5,"I remember hearing this back in the 1970's and thought it was great. I have been looking for this on CD for several years. Never thought it would ever be made available. Purchased it, Love it, Glad to have it to add to my collection."
,B00130PR54,1,1,5,"This is a great classic rock/bluesey rock band with a piano thrown in for some southern-fried swagger. Kind of a bluesy, gospel-ey sound with heavy guitars. Their sound is hilighted by the strong, heavy, and soulful George Ratzlaff vocals, man does this guy have some pipes!!

Includes mostly faithful covers of Red Rooster, You're No Good and a nice slowed-up cover of The Beatles Lady Madonna. A real bluesy affair, a 70's rock vibe with good guitars.

Also worthwhile from the 'Lost 70's blues/psych/guitar rock' cannon, check out Head Over Heels, Tin House, Stray Dog, Blue Goose, Jeronimo, Black Cat Bones, White Chocolate, Jericho, and the awesome smokin hot guitar album Totty!!!"
,B00130MG3A,1,1,5,I  Love The Artist And The Lyrics To This Song. I Would Purchase More Songs From This Artist Again. Thank You.
,B00130MG3A,1,1,5,We heard this son on Hottest Party 3 and wanted it in our collection.  Always easy to get mp3s from Amazon and it is a trustworthy site.

,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"I have been familiar with this song for years and loved it's thought provoking effect it had on me. It will be a part of my Celebration of Life when I leave this earth. Then along came the movie and I was fortunate enough to see it the first day it was here. This made the song come alive for me in a tremendous way! The movie is memorable, emotionally exhausting but inspiring and I urge everyone who reads this to try to find the time to see it."

,B00136J7OA,1,1,5,Love Michael Jackson!  Great song!

,B00136J7OA,1,1,4,Good song not much else to say.
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,Digital music is the best thing since sliced bread. Choose the songs off each album you truly love. Best. Thing. Ever.

,B00136J7OA,-1,1,5,to bad michaels not here.
,B00136J7OA,1,1,5,"please understand, that as what I wrote in an earlier review, I believe that there is more than enough room in this world for women who choose to be childfree and those who choose to become and stay mothers  (regardless of their age).  For some reason, I have heard billie jean by Michael Jackson on the radio enough times for the song to grow on me. Im taking it that billie jean by Michael Jackson symbolizes the journey of a man coming to terms with being the father of a woman who became pregnant at an extremely young age (Im guessing a teenager) due to the lyrics she is just a girl. He does not want to believe that he is the father, but he sees that he probably is due to singing about looking at the babys eyes that remind him of his own eyes. From my humble opinion, Billie jean by Michael Jackson still does touch on a relevant issue today because the common societal message that is still being sent is that every woman who is someone becomes a mother, and I do believe that many teenage females subconsciously take in this message and internalize it. I just happen to have made my own decision on what I was going to do after my teenage years when I was tasked with helping my adoptive mother look after the younger children in her care.  I have an open mind when it comes to teenage mothers because I myself was born to a woman who had just turned 16 8 days before my entrance into this world. However, that is all that Im going to say for now for a compelling song that touches on a topic that is not going to go away anytime soon."
,B00136J7OA,1,-1,3,Good song
,B00136J7OA,1,1,5,Michael at his best.
,B00136J7OA,1,1,4,Another Classic!

,B00136J7OA,1,-1,3,I listened to this tune many times when this was released.  I listened to it again and found it must be listened with video. Dancing is an integral part of this music.

,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"Awesome Song for two reasons...  One, First and most important, Jesus! Two, it makes a perfect dedication to a young woman I dated over 30 years ago when we were both 17.  She left such a profound understanding of the depth of real love and how powerful love can be.  If can only imagine if I could stand, speak, or any of the other things mentioned in the song because of powerful of a love she possesses!"
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"Perfect song, favorite by Mercy Me.. Easy download"

,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,I love this song from the melody to the words. A beautiful song that gets you thinking about how you might feel when you finally meet our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ. That experience is beyond our imagination. Get this song! You will love it too. I highly recommend this song to all who believe. 
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,very uplifting

I Can Only Imagine

By MercyMe

I can only imagine what it will be like
When I walk, by your side
I can only imagine what my eyes will see
When you face is before me
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

Surrounded by you glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or in awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence
Or to my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

I can only imagine when that day comes
When I find myself standing inside
I can only imagine when all I would do is forever
Forever worship you
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

Surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or in awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence
Or to my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine
I can only imagine hey ya ah

Surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or in awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence
Or to my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine
I can only imagine hey ya ah

I can only imagine yeah yeah
I can only imagine

I can only imagine ey ey ey
I can only imagine

I can only imagine when all I will do
Is forever, forever worship you
I can only imagine"

,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"Before I heard ""I Can Only Imagine"" years ago, I never thought about how I'd react when I see Jesus. This song helps me to imagine that moment (although I pray it'll be a long time before I'm there). I believe I will be in awe and then fall to my knees. MercyMe sings the Original Version and I love theirs best. Such a beautiful song that touches my heart and helps me to feel the love of Jesus.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Can-Only-Imagine-Album-Version/dp/B0013ASJP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Can Only Imagine (Album Version)</a>&nbsp;- LaShell Griffin - is also nice to listen to (my second favorite has more of a Gospel sound), and there's also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Can-Only-Imagine/dp/B00FPZRJSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Can Only Imagine</a>&nbsp;- Tamela Mann.

I can only imagine what it will be like
When I walk by Your side
I can only imagine what my eyes will see
When Your face is before me
I can only imagine
Yeah

Surrounded by Your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for You, Jesus
Or in awe of You be still
Will I stand in Your presence
Or to my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

I can only imagine when that day comes
And I find myself standing in the Son
I can only imagine
When all I would do is forever
Forever worship You
I can only imagine
Yeah
I can only imagine...."

,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"To me, this is one of the greatest songs of all times.  Just the thought of meeting Jesus in Heaven and wondering what I would do is such an uplifting tenant for a song.  Plus there is something about the quality  of the voice of the lead singer that is so sincere, it leaves no doubt that one day, many will be meeting Jesus and wondering, ""Should I dance for You, Jesus, or in Awe of You, Be Still?""

The song is so tender and gentle and at the same time, so powerful, that I recommend listening to it as a wonderful contemplation of the reality of being with Jesus some day.  I know it will affect you greatly in a most positive and touching way. It brings hope, joy, and tears."

,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"I played the song of my mother's funeral and there was just a sense of peace that came over me knowing that she had passed on at the age of 60. And I occasionally listen to the song because it reminds me of so many things that Christ is done in my life that I never realized, I also adore Christian music. I truly believe that sometimes Christ will use the song in order to reach you and this song does reach people at so many levels."
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,I love this song because it truly expresses how l feel. Beautiful you can only imagine how you could feel if that is possible.

,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"For me, I had heard this song I Can Only Imagine on a local Christian Radio Station several times and always liked it. So I was so happy to discover that Amazon carried it on MP3 and the album. The group sings I Can Only Imagine from their hearts and with such love! Since I lost some family members, this song is such a comfort to me each time I listen to it.

Highly recommend this song!"
,B00136J8K8,1,1,5,Music review is based solely off of personal taste.  Just because I like it doesn't mean you will.  I love this one.
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,This song is absolutely beautiful.  I first heard it at my Bible Study class and was amazed at the beautiful lyrics.  After I heard it I knew I had to buy it.  Mercy Me does is so beautifully.  It's one of my favorite gospel songs.

What a glimpse into the day we stand before the Lord and see God in all His Glory.  What will we feel?  What will we do?  Will we just stand in awe or bow down and cry?  We can only imagine.  I love this song and Mercy Me delivers a performance that will give you chills and leave you  wanting to cry and praise the Lord too.  Amazing, Amazing song."

,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"I love this song, it's a great Christian song. I've heard others sing it and nobody comes close to MercyMe. It really is good."
,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,"I've been buying Amazon music for a while now and I love how Amazon offers low cost music and even free music from new artists. I listen to radio mostly and frequently I get tired of the same stuff and definitely tired of the over-played stuff (even if it's a great beat like Lady Gaga's ""Poker Face""). I've never heard of Franz Ferdinand and I first heard ""Take me out"" on Amazon. The more I review songs the more I'm aware of my alternative music tastes (especially alternative music reminiscent of 1990's alternative).

For me, good alt-music has a rock beat with a twist--something different, unexpected, experimental even. I think this can be subtle or obvious and very subjective definitely (in the eye of the beholder or the ear in this case). Sometimes a repetitive beat is annoying (one reason modern country music doesn't do it for me); but sometimes it's classic (like Elvis Costello's ""Pump it up,"" Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode,"" or Elvis Presley ""That's Alright Mama"" and even some old-skanky-country like Hank Williams' ""I'm so lonesome I could cry""--old-skanky-country is a term of endearment made up entirely by me). By no means am I comparing ""Take me out"" to the classics, I'm trying to explain how I base my reviews.

What caught my ear on ""Take me out"" was the initial repetitive rock beat (it's fast with a hint of punk) guitar and drums dominate; it's a great mix with the singer's voice (is he singing or screaming--it's hard to tell, there's an angry sound to his voice which is fitting with the punk aspect of the music). A minute into it, the beat transitions to a slower, deeper, harder rock sound (hm, interesting choice of words yes? If good music doesn't make you think sex, maybe it's not good music. Anyway, a very sexy transition IMO). There are hints of 70's disco in the cymbals in the chorus (or what I think is the chorus). There isn't much variety in the lyrics or rhythm for that matter; but sometimes that just doesn't matter. The beat keeps the song moving along. The lyrics do borderline on the monotonous but it's an easy song to sing to--maybe Franz doesn't have much to say. It's the only song I've listened to from Franz Ferdinand. I like it, a lot.

With Amazon's 20 million songs, there is so much to listen to! I rated this song 5 stars because I am very happy with my purchase. I love songs that are a change from the mainstream."
,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,"There are so many great elements to this song, it's amazing it's not listed as one of the greatest modern rock hits ever. First off, the structure is awesome, starting a little slow, then building to it rockets off, and never looks back, with amazing riffs and hooks. The catchiness is also amazing, as well as how it is so infectious, and toe-tapping. From start to finish, you won't want this amazing rock ride to end.

So overall, an underrated modern rock classic with amazing hooks and riffs that'll have you keep coming back for more, and will invite you to let loose for three amazing minutes."
,B00136J9U2,1,1,5,I absolutely love this song!!!  It makes me smile every time I listen to it!  Totally is a blast from the past.
,B00136J9U2,1,1,5,Coconut is an all-time favorite. It is fun to listen to but difficult to get out of my head. LOL
,B00136J9U2,1,1,5,Just a good ol' tune frommy yesteryear that makes you want to sing along. The sound quality of the download is very good.
,B00136J9U2,1,1,5,I got this song to share with my 5 and 6 year olds. they love it. takes me back to the good old 70's
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"Again a wondrous song. Because until we get to heaven, we can only imagine what it will be like to see Jesus face to face."
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"I love this song, inspires me everytime I hear it. God had to inspire the writers and musicians when creating this."
,B00136JBBY,1,1,4,good stuff
,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,Love this song
,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,"I rated this particular single, because I like the song! The album was not all that wonderful to me, but that is just my opinion. I would suggest this to whom ever likes this type of music."
,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,"If your fan of the band than you like it all. If your fan of a well done song, this is the one. The rhythm and meter is perfect. It was the single off the album for a reason."
,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,"This song makes you want to get up and dance. Great beat and an infectious guitar riff.

Take Me Out!"
,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,"This song reminds me of the 80's. It makes me want to put a can of mousse in my hair, pour myself into a pair of lycra/spandex leopard print pants and an off-the-shoulder, cut-up T-shirt, and dance in my 4 inch high heeled boots."
,B00136JBBY,-1,-1,3,It's got a catchy sound and lyrics so it's okay. Would I DL it if I had to do it over again?Prolly not.
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,Beautiful song that even my husband says is really powerful.  Puts into perspective what your reaction would be when you first meet the Lord.  I highly recommend this song.
,B00136J7ZE,-1,-1,2,"This is supposed to be an accompaniment track (no voices).  However, it's the original song.  I previously purchased the original, and was looking for the version without voices for a memorial DVD.  Ended up with an adequate version from another company (Christian Rock, the Best of. . .)."
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"This song is beautiful in its simplicity and powerful in its imagery.  It gets us all imagining about the hereafter, and that is a powerful message for the here and now."
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,I don't usually purchase mp3 tracks hoewever I love this song and it was a good price so I downloaded it from Amazon's cloud directly to my phone's music player and have been listening ever since. Highly recommend this song.
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,The product was exactly as advertised. We will buy again next time we need it. Thanks for the quick shipment.
,B00136J7ZE,-1,1,5,"Everything stops and I just listen as ""I Can Only Imagine"" by @mercyme comes on...It takes me to a place I've been promised - a place of course, that ""I can only imagine""..."
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"I gave this download a five-star rating because 1) MercyMe is my all-time favorite Christian rock band, and this particular tune is one of my favorites by them, and 2) I had no trouble downloading it to my p.c. or syncing it to my mp3 player."
,B00136J7ZE,1,1,5,"This is one of the best songs I have ever heard, it makes you want to sing it out loud and raise your hands to heaven.  It also makes you wonder and imagine.  Beautiful voices and beauitful songs is what you get from Mercyme, I just love this group."
,B00136J9U2,1,1,5,Great
,B00136J9U2,1,1,5,great song!
,B00136J9U2,1,1,5,I've always liked this song and decided to download it onto my MP3 - glad I did.  It's one of those songs that make me smile and slightly move my shoulders and head when I'm listening to it.  Makes my walks and work day easier to take.
,B00136J9U2,1,1,5,my kids and I enjoyed dancing around when they were younger now it brings a lot of memories not that they are older
,B00136JDEO,1,1,5,I chose this song for my son's high school graduation slide show.  It worked out very well!  I like it!
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,"he was and still is one of the best composers out of NY in quite some time.  what do i like especially in this one?  it is a history lesson in somewhat rhyme and kind of attempts to settle the ages past argument that each generation blames the current problems on the generation previously past.  mr. joel sings his way through a neat package of  memorable  lines, a catchy tune and  actual historical events thrown together as only he can (and he can and does  in a most excellent way).  if history can be taught through song, this would be a great way to start."
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,I needed this for a class project for my students.  It was easy to download and had provided great listening pleasure.
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,This song is easy to listen to as you pound those miles down the road. Good beat and a good song under any circumstances!
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,"This is a Golden Oldy for students of the late 80's early 90's. My kids today love to listen to it and it has quite a bit of history, enough to wet your appetite to do some research."
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,Great song from my time.
,B00136JD9Y,-1,1,5,Another one for the Music Collection
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,This single is one of his greatest hit..
,B00136JD9Y,-1,1,5,brings back memories
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,"Still a great song after all these years.  It's funny to hear the ""Russia's in Afghanistan"" line.  Kinda the whole point of the song, but it reminds you that everything has been and always will be changing."
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,a True classic!!
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,Excellent
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,4,Another great song by Billy Joel.

,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,thanks
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,"This song from start to finish is history good and not so good.
Fast upbeat tempo, there is just something about this song.
I can relate to some of the things as I have survived during those times and can remember them."
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,4,Good song. Classic Billy Joel
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,You gotta love all the the things Billy Joel works into 1 song.  Great tune!

,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,great
,B00136J9TS,1,1,4,There are several longtime favorite pieces of music I have purchased recently. This one is one I have as an earworm frequently. Just flat out love it.
,B00136J9TS,1,1,5,Classic Scaggs!!
,B00136J9TS,1,1,4,Love it.
,B00136J9TS,1,1,5,Great singer and musician
,B00136J9TS,1,1,5,"Yes, Yes, Yes, the song to do the New York Hustle to with style and class.  Love it"
,B00136J9TS,1,1,5,This song takes me way back. I can remember the good time I had listening to this song and this singer. Great song.
,B00136J9TS,1,1,5,Love this song
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,Pretty good
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,4,"Great album, would highly recommend to fans"
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,"When I first saw the video, I was mesmerized. When I listen to the song I think about the video and think about times gone by. I recommend this to anyone who loves American history."
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,love this song
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,"Billy Joel has to be my favorite artist of all time......I bought all his albums (yes as in vinyl albums) and belonged to his Fan Club!  He can still rock it!  Even though he says this isn't his best melody, the words are hard to beat!  Really take you back in history and reminds you that time has so much to say if you really think about it!  Thanks Billy Joel! You're AWESOME!!!!!!"
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,This is one of those songs that is just fun to listen to because it mentions so many things.  It conveys a serious message with a beat that forces you to listen adn try to sing along.
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,This is a song from when I was younger and it had a catchy beat. I just happened upon it one day and got a copy.
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,5,This song is one of the best by one of America's best performers.  He just keeps getting better and better.  One of his best.
,B00136JD9Y,1,1,4,"There are some musicians that don't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is. For Billy Joel, who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years, his song still sound just as vibrant and distinctive as they did when they first came out back in the 70's, the 80's, and even the 90's. Sometimes the distinctive and classic style of a great songwriter still can deliver better than the joke artists of today. That has shown with Piano Man, New York State Of Mind and the classic We Didn't Start The Fire. The song still lights up the flame 25 years later after it originally came out and it still sounds just as driven as it did years ago. I still never get tired of the rhythm and rhyme into a great history lesson through time, as Joel pointed out into the song, and it still is better than the wasted acts of today. Maybe they should try and make a fire that still works like this song shown all this time.

Song: B+"
,B00136JCWC,1,1,5,"This piece moves me to tears. What genius! Yo-Yo Ma is amazing. I like the vocal version too, but this is the one I get lost in. It soothes and lingers long after it's finished. I listen to it often.
My download ends abruptly, as if a bit is cut off, but I still recommend it."
,B00136JCWC,1,1,5,"A haunting, elegant, and emotional work that moves me to tears. Nella Fantasia is a beautiful derivative, but this is the masterwork. Yo-Yo Ma and Ennio Morricone have created a classic that should last forever."
,B00136J966,1,1,5,"Another great ""Survivor"" piece - like most of their other stuff, this one is destined to become a classic with time!"
,B00136J966,1,1,4,I got this for a workot play list to give me a boost of energy. WOW it still rocks with me.
,B00136JCCW,1,1,4,"Classic rock. Just a great song with a great beat, excellent for keeping the pace during my morning walks. Go!"
,B00136JCWC,1,1,5,Yo-Yo knows how to blend his brilliance but not eclipse those he accompanies like few others. Take a listen and you'll understand.
,B00136J9GQ,1,1,5,"Nice version of this song. Either you like his voice, or you don't. Listen to sample to decide if you don't know song."
,B00136J9GQ,1,1,5,Heard this song on the radio and didn't know who sung it.  I had to down load this because of loved the song.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"I could not believe the news of hearing that Whitney Houston has died. I am deeply deviated beyond what words can even express. Her voice is always going to be a eternal and beautiful gem. But when it has came down to covers, none have been as definitive as I Will Always Love You. The song is still just as impassionate and intimate as the voice that had made the Dolly Parton cover beyond all her own. I couldn't stop crying hearing the news of her death, but this is the definitive song in my opinion that the sweet voice will always be recognized. No matter whom comes around, and tries to sing this song, no one will ever come close to her voice. We Will Always Love You Whitney Houston, and that is the definitive truth.

Whitney Houston August 9th, 1963 - February 11, 2012

,B00136J9GQ,-1,1,5,"If I am forced to a specific number of words in rating songs, I will no longer leave a rating or a response. If I paid money for the song that should suffice that I wanted the song anything beyond that is not for my benefit. After payment that should be the end of my obligation. The rating system should be the stars only without having to leave comments."
,B00136JDTY,1,1,5,I love songs that tell a story!  All I have to say to explain the heart of this song is Manilow!
,B00136JDTY,1,1,5,"I LOVE this song. I have an obsession with show tunes (I think this came before Land of the Lost, but it was DEFINITELY cemented after I fell in love with that movie). This song is SO much fun! I sing and dance to this during my morning commute to work; did I mention I LEAVE for work at 6:30am?! LOVE Lola!"

,B00136JCCW,1,1,5,"This is probably Leslie West's most famous song and it'll last forever, I suppose. I believe I read where Randy Rhoads listened to this song for inspiration and motivation when he started learning how to play the guitar. A blues-based tour de force!"
,B00136JCCW,-1,-1,3,OK song.  Got it for my kids as they had heard it on the radio and liked that it was an Old song being played today.
,B00136JCCW,-1,1,5,I thought this was my comments  but this thing requires a certain amount of words (20) to give feedback. Stupid!!! what do you think?
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,As always this is a really good song by Whitney Houston. Sandra K.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,Dolly could only hope to sing it this good.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"It was such a shame to lose Ms. Houston so young. She had one of the best voices ever, and this song highlights her talent beautifully."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,Best Whitney song ever!!!! A ABSOLUTELY GREAT BUY!! If you love Whitney and if you don't this song is still awesome and worth the money.
,B00136JF8I,-1,1,5,as expected
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,Enjoy the song.
,B00136JBJG,1,1,5,I bought this one because it's differ from the orginal one. This song is very good Both of them are so buy it and you will see.
,B00136JBJG,-1,1,5,"Plus I have to have 16 more words to be able to submit which I am forced to do, they don't like me to just rate the product with 6 stars. What a bunch of bull."
,B00136JBJG,-1,1,4,"I was looking for some interesting songs for my wedding and saw on one board that this was used as a entrance song.. Nah, exit song seemed more appropriate and that is what I used after they announced us as husband and wife.
Don't ask if we dance down the isle cause I plead the 5th... my husband has 2 left feet and can't dance to save his life... LOL"
,B00136JDTY,-1,1,5,Going through a oldies stage. I can dance to this all the time.
,B00136JDTY,1,1,5,You'll be shaking and grooving.
,B00136JDTY,1,1,5,Who can't sit still when Barry is singing??
,B00136JDTY,1,1,5,The longer version of one of the songs that made Barry a star (in the early days of course).  He has remained a star because he is an awesome artist with beautiful music.
,B00136JF8I,-1,-1,3,Good song but not good enough to keep in my playlist.  But that's just my humble opinion.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,A wonderful song!  What an amazing remake of the Dolly Parton song.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"this has been one of my favorite songs, And it went to my mp3 perfect."

,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"Whitney may have left us all too soon.  However, i feel this song will always be attributed to her.  While others have sung this song and Dolly Parton wrote it, Whitney somehow made this hers."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,Just what I was looking for.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,This is one of the most beautiful and popular songs sung by Whitney Houston. this song should be in everyone's collection.
,B00136JF8I,-1,-1,1,i don't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of Dolly Parton's song. She oversang and it's just kind of an annoying song to sit through...what a drag...
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,Satisfied
,B00136JF56,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136JF56,1,1,5,What can one say about Whitney...she was the Voice...truly amazing  vocals.

,B00136JB3W,1,1,5,"This is a tune for people who don't really care that much for this particular genre of music.  It's C&C's best, in my opinion, and it allowed me to sample this group's music without having to buy an entire CD."

,B00136JB3W,1,-1,3,I really like this song but I listened to it too much. The sound quality is good. The song starts where it should and ends where it should. Doesn't have an awkward cut off. No complaints.
,B00136JB3W,1,-1,3,"A piece danced to, during many late night benders with my Love. Lost to illness, the song brings back good memories of after work, late night dancing."
,B00136JB3W,1,1,5,If you love dancin' then you already know that this is a must have for you.  Great for a collection or just to work out by.

,B00136JCOU,1,1,4,I am not a huge fan of Leonard Cohen but I really like this song and I like the way he sings it.
,B00136JCOU,1,1,5,"Honestly I can say that I have never listened to anything by this guy. I knew his name and that was about it.
This is a song that comes along with every other generation and its message would keep on ringing through."
,B00136JCOU,1,1,4,"I have enjoyed this song since seeing it on a movie.  I wouldn't mind finding an instrumental version.
I have not heard any of his other songs that I like."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"Anyone who has heard Whitney sing this knows how extraordinary this is. If you haven't, one time should convince you this is one of the finest renditions of any song ever recorded."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"Whitney Houston is the love of my wife's life.  Not mine.  This  record isn't my cup of tea, but my wife rates it a Five Star...."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"IMO Whitney had the most pure yet powerful voice that I have ever heard. Her rendition of this song is very moving and it will make you stop and pretend you can sing like her. I was driving down PCH when Rick Dee's debut this song for the first time on KISS FM. It was so breathtaking the first time and just as breathtaking now. It so brilliantly done, what a gift. Love"
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"Whitney did the remake well. Both Whitney and Dolly did a wonderful job. I have both, and I like both. Listen to both then decide which to purchase."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,This fine artist has always settled in my heart with her outstanding voice and lovely music. She has my heart.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"Hard to believe it has been 2 years since the world has lost an iconic legend, Whitney Houston. But nevertheless, her voice will always soar past mostly all of today's female artists because the most important asset any female singer has shown, speaks for itself, beyond what any of today's artists have shown like Beyonce' or Rihanna, where many of today's female R&B singer have lost themselves in voice and soul, and have had to be more products than voice through legacy. But Whitney Houston's voice and spirit will always live on not just with her fans and family, but through the legacy of heart and soul she had left behind. I Will Always Love You, her rendition of the Dolly Parton song is the definitive example. The song from the Bodyguard soundtrack is still just as iconic and bold today, as ""The Voice"" had done the song over twenty years ago. The song still gives me shivers and emotions heart and sincerely from the soul within. This is a great download for anyone who had never hears a Whitney Houston song before, and I definitely recommend for your music library.

Whitney Houston 1963-2012: Whitney Houston, we will still always love you from the beauty your voice had shown to the world.

,B00136JF8I,-1,-1,1,"I can not download this music to my Media player.  Had I known I could download, I would not have purchased."

,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"I just love this song by Whitney Houston, she brings back memories of the past, thank you amazon for making it possible to download this great music!"
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,Nothing can match the soul in Whitney's rendition of the Dolly Parton classic.  See if you can get through it all without crying and cursing her for leaving so soon.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,REST IN PEACE WHITNEY. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. AND I KNOW YOU ARE UP THERE I HEAVEN SMILING DOWN ON US. BECAUSE SOME ONE WITH A VOICE OF AND ANGEL LIKE YOUR.

,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"This is ad was a great song and a great singer wo I wish was still with us, She put heart into her songs,"
,B00136JF8I,1,1,4,Whitney has an amazing voice and does a beautiful job with this fabulous song. I happen to like Dolly Parton's rendition better. But I'm still glad I own this!!
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"IT WAS A SAD LOSS TO HEAR OF WHITNEYS PASSING , I LOVED HER AND HER MUSIC..I SAW HER MOVIE, LOVED IT AS I DID THE MUSIC.. I ALSO WANTED TO SAVE SOMETHING OF HER ON MY KINDLE TO LISTEN TO FROM TIME TO TIME..THE SONG IS GREAT AS WAS THE MOVIE...A+"
,B00136JEVQ,1,1,5,THANK YOU
,B00136JEVQ,1,1,5,Good wholesome song for the soul. The song tells the story of life for most of us. I love it!
,B00136JEVQ,1,1,5,This song reminded me of my three girls when each one left home. Brought tears to my eyes the first time I heard this song. Also a great video as well.
,B00136JEVQ,1,1,5,"I got this one to practice singing for Karaoke and just love the song. It's really pretty and it'll make some daddy's in the audience get a little misty-eyed. Then again, my singing might be hurting their ears and bringing tears to their eyes. But even if they don't like my singing, I have a soft spot for songs about parents and children."
,B00136JEVQ,1,1,5,I love how Kenny flips the meaning of the words later on in the song. The video is great too! Awesome love song! Beautifully sung.
,B00136JEVQ,1,1,5,"One of my favorite songs by Kenny Chesney.  There are many hits by him, but this one tops my play list."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,Again I just love her music and I just had to have it so I bought it to play forever.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,SHE IS ONE OF A KIND AND WE WILL NEVER GET TO HEAR THAT BEAUTIFUL VOICE AGAIN. REAT IN PEACE
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"Best CD ever.  I so miss Whitney.  I do plan to buy more of her CD for my Kindle Fire.  Whitney Houston is Buried in New Jersey, not far from where my mother & brother are.  Thank you"
,B00136JF8I,1,1,4,Who wouldn't love this recording.  Greatest voice and terrific song.  Sound is a little scratchy. Still searching for more songs.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"I love this song so much and I love the movie ""The BodyGuard."" Whitney us Unique and Beautiful and I miss her so much."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,It sounds awesome on my Kindle Fire. I have really enjoyed listening to the song. This is a great quality.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"I have loved this song since Dollyy Parton did it way back when.  When I heard Whitney's version, I loved it too.  They are unique in how they present the song and each is powerful."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"It is hard to believe that today is the first anniversary since Whitney Houston's saddened death. While the music industry has seen dramatic changes, what it has not been able to show is a clearness and depth of someone and their beautiful voice. Whitney Houston showcased more bravado and simplicity in her songs that still withstand the test of time more than any of the songs that today's acts could reach. That stands with her biggest template, I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard, and off of her hits record I Will Always Love You: The Best Of Whitney Houston. The song still is just as majestic as it was when it first came out 20 years ago, and just the strike of the notes that Whitney had delivered is still with brilliance. This is a must download for anyone whom has never heard a brilliant note from Whitney Elizabeth Houston. She will always be loved.

Whitney Houston 1963-2012

Song: A"
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,I really enjoyed listening to the song.  It was of good quality.  I have no issues with the song at all.
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorite Whitney recordings.  Her voice is amazing, and comes thru loud and clear in the version."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"Used in a photo slide show of my father in laws life made on his 67th birthday as a gift to reflect on the wonderful journey he has made!

Great song!"
,B00136JF8I,1,1,4,"I had heard it many times over the years and I have to say it is a good song, I bought it only recently because it is a good song and in honor of the life of a good artist."
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"Whitney Houston was a gift to mankind.  I am sorry she is gone, but she left behind such beautiful music.  This song is one of her best and my favorite. She and Dolly Parton hit a home run with this one.  The recording is perfect.  It does justice to a great voice, one of the greatest of all times!"
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"There is no doubt of hearing of the tragic death of Whitney Houston, I was deeply heartbroken beyond whatever words could ever say. Musically, she showcased being the world's great soulful singer, whom not only made covers brilliantly, but songs all her own. The biggest example is I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard. The song is just as intimate and beautiful from her soulful heart and voice alone. Something that stands taller beyond the tests of time. The song is honestly the biggest movie song of all time, and definitely is the most classic cover she had ever done in a lifetime. Her Dolly Parton cover even stands taller than any song that anyone has made within the past several years. This is a must have for your music library, as well as anyone whom is a longtime Whitney Houston fan, or new to her music because of her sad passing.

Whitney Houston 1963-2012, The World Will Never Stop Loving You

Song: A+"
,B00136JF8I,1,1,5,"..this the hands-down-no-further-debate required winner. And with Whitney Houston gone far too young, and our knowledge of the personal struggles that were brewing at the time this tune was released, the pathos of this song augments its power even more. From its a cappella opening to the pained warbling of its crescendo, to its mournful sax: this is the one Whitney Houston song to have when you can have only one.

If you want to listen to Whitney Houston with a smile, consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Wanna-Dance-With-Somebody/dp/B00137T4WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Wanna Dance With Somebody</a>&nbsp;instead. But it you want to remember somebody who offered us a soulful soundtrack: get our your tissues, reflect on her issues..and choose this one."
,B00136JF74,1,1,4,"as soon as I saw her singing this on vh1, I fell in love with this song, see has many that I like,  but I have purchased it before"
,B00136JF74,1,1,5,This song sounds great on my Kindle! I have really enjoyed listening to it! I am glad that I purchased it!
,B00136JF74,1,1,5,There's not much more to say than that.  She will always be one of the best song birds of our time.
,B00136JF74,1,1,5,"Nice buy, sweet music. I usually purchase all of my music from Amazon because I am able to use it on my computer and my cell phone. Amazon's ""Cloud Player"" is absolutely awesome!"
,B00136JF74,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs by Whitney Houston.  It's like an updated torch song!!  I love it!  Thank you Amazon.com for having this song available!
,B00136JGNM,1,1,5,Love me some Stevie Ray Vaughan
,B00136JGNM,1,1,5,"Great classic tune. I love this musician. He was a great artist that I grew up listening to. Had to have a song of his in my player even though the radio stations, around my area, play his music alot. He was from around the area I grew up in."
,B00136JGNM,-1,1,5,"I bought the album for one song, ""Crossfire."" I've heard various televised concerts by Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble, so I'm pretty sure this album is fantastic, but I've never listened to it."
,B00136JHEK,1,1,5,When John Anderson sings this song you can almost feel yourself being there to live the experience. You will enjoy this one.
,B00136JHEK,1,1,5,A GREAT SONG.
,B00136JHEK,1,1,5,A great song to add to my MP3 play list.
,B00136JHEK,1,1,5,"Just an awesome all around song. You can feel the warning about protecting our natural resources in the lyrics. Music is well played/produced. One of Anderson's best, (& he has a lot of good ones)."
,B00136JFA6,1,1,5,"My dad passed away nearly 2 years ago. He was my dad, he was all I had left of parents. He went to be with his sweetheart my mom on Valentines day evening 2/14/07

He was the greatest even for a stepdad, there was noone else who could have filled his great shoes in raising me and helping me, guiding me and loving me as a dad could.

To my Parents:

I am all alone and it hits me All At Once
1 day I will see you both again, thank you for everything."
,B00136JGC8,1,1,5,I really love this song.  R. Kelly is very talented.  I look for more inspirational songs coming from him in the future.
,B00136JGC8,1,1,5,"This mp3 has a nice sound, I love this track. If you're looking for some good tracks to add to your collection try this one."
,B00136JGC8,1,1,4,"It may not be the greatest song of all time but still, it's a beautiful song with deep, meaningful lyrics and R. Kelly's voice really pulls it off."
,B00136JGC8,1,1,5,"Some may believe this to be just another R&B favorite, it's more than that.  Listen to the lyrics, they truly can provide inspiration! Regardless of your circumstances this song reminds that one can rise above taking life to the heights."
,B00136JHEK,1,1,4,Good story tune
,B00136JHEK,1,1,5,I like song that remind me of the way things used to be and this is one of them.  Enjoy
,B00136JJ3Y,1,1,5,"I have been looking for this item and finally found it, I appreciate it. I love it, I love it. Thank you"
,B00136JJ3Y,1,1,4,"She says so much in this song, that you can apply to your own life..the title speaks for itself!!!  Free yourself!!!"
,B00136JJ3Y,1,1,5,The song has a great beat and I like listening to the lyrics.  The lyrics has a nice meaning to them.
,B00136JJ3Y,1,1,5,"This is another one of my all time favorites...the words are so True to heart, and like no other I've heard.  If you love listening to that ""no nonsense"" time of music, this is the song to listen to...download it today!"

As a young man finding my way in New York City there were what the residents called public baths. This was a very long time ago but as a music fan even then, I remember a young, explosive female entertainer named Bette Midler who would entertain at these baths accompanied by her pianist, Barry Manilow. Of course they would later break away from each other to become each outrageously loved and successful show business personalities. There were definitive differences with Barry Manilow becoming a much more  conservative recording artist whereas Bette is the nouveau Lucille Ball with a comedic lasciviousness that generations have enjoyed immensely. My wife and I waited in an endless, serpentine line to see Barry Manilow do a show at the Garden back in 1981. Once inside, we immediately noticed his engaging smile and friendly persona which is nothing short of contagious. His material, as evidenced by the classic Weekend in New England ranks amongst the finest songwriting in American music. In Barry's case, whether another classic of his I Write the Songs classifies him as a 100% singer songwriter is irrelevant. We appreciate him as a captivating singer who is an authentic charmer. That is exactly how Barry Manilow can credit his gargantuan success since the days of playing the piano and appearing with Bette Midler in New York's public baths. I would have to say that his vocals and keyboard playing are indeed highly professional. His strength is to light up any room he walks into and then you have have to add one of the most highly regarded song catalogs music fans have ever appreciated.

,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"Good download with the amazon cloud player. Had issues with first downloading product, but they fixed it right away. Thanks"
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"This song is timeless! ""Black Betty"" from Ram Jam is flat out 'd*mn thing gone wild' and it's no wonder it made it onto the Dukes of Hazzard movie as it fits the Hillbilly genre. The guitar work is punchy and the drum beat is just freakin' hypnotic. I played this song for my kids recently and they loved it the first time they heard it. It's rare to get them to say, ""Dad, could you replay that song, please?"" Typically they don't like their dad's OLD MUSIC! But as I said, Ram Jam's ""Black Betty"" is a hard hitting, foot thumping tune that just gets your juices pumpin'."
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,",,`` EXCELLENT `,,,,*I HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,Excellent
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,1967 I'm riding into Haight Ashbury at daybreak with a VW bug full of acid heads and Scott is singing on the radio.... perfection.
,B00136JCGS,1,1,4,"As expected
Fast arrival. Good price!"
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,Remember this one! And lucky that I remember anything!
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,One of my favorites from the 60's.
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,"This is True old a school. ""Can You Feel It"" gets you grooving at any time! This is a must have!"
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,One The Most Heart Pounding Beats EVER Made By One Of The Worlds Most Prolific Musical Groups Of ALL Time... you WILL feel it. LLP
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,What can I say?  Michael Jackson will live on and on.  I love this song.  It makes me feel good to know Michael thought of everyone this same.  And I do too.  I hope you do too.
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,"If you were between 12 and 25 when this song was released, it has likely become part of ""who"" you are - your very DNA. In a brief moment it crosses over from rock to folk to bring forth a message of hope, peace, and caring to time that had none of it. Scott McKenzie will likely be remembered for little else but this song; but WOW! Isn't it worth it!"
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,Good
,B00136JCGS,1,1,4,just oldies brings back old time :-)
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,"I searched for this song for a while because I'm getting to old to remember who sings them all. The song always takes me back to that trip to San Francisco when all the Hippies were singing and dancing in the parks with flowers in their hair. It seemed everyone was so much happier then, there was so much fun in the air. To bad there aren't any Hippies around any more."
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,"Definitely written and sung during the heyday of the hippie movement. A song that defines that movement. One of the great, one hit wonders. Makes me think of groovy things like flowers, headbands and reefer. Oh yeah, and Make Love, Not War."
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,Product is very high quality. Chronicles the journey through the sixties and early seventies in the San Fransisco area and the mood of our country.
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,"Wherever you were in the sixties, you couldn't escape Scott McKenzie's iconic song.  This recording will forever be the song that defines the sixties era--from flower-power, to the Peace Symbol, hippies--you name it!  Those days are long gone, but just listening to this songs will always bring them back!"
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,A few days after I heard this song Scott McKenzie passed away. I was in San Francisco an the late 60's and early 70's and this was still a popular song. There were a lot of high hopes for life and the country in this song. Same the politicians have collectively ruined the dreams.
,B00136JCGS,1,1,5,"Scott McKenzie ""(born Philip Wallach Blondheim, January 10, 1939 - August 18, 2012) was an American singer. He was best known for his 1967 hit single and generational anthem, `San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)'...John Phillips wrote and co-produced ""San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair)"" for McKenzie. Phillips played guitar on the recording and session musician Gary L Coleman played orchestra bells and chimes. The bass line of the song was supplied by session musician Joe Osborn. Hal Blaine played drums.""

""'San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)' was released on 13 May 1967 in the United States and was an instant hit, reaching #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also a #1 in the UK and several other countries, selling over seven million copies globally.""

And what a great song this is! True, the others did a great job helping Scott with this number; but I'm particularly impressed with Scott McKenzie's unforgettable treatment of this song. Scott sings with great sensitivity and captures the musical essence of ""The Summer of Love"" flawlessly.

Sadly, Scott McKenzie passed away just 3 days ago; he will be remembered for quite some while to come. This song is the perfect introduction to Scott's artistry; we are better off because he shared his gift with us."
,B00136JDTE,1,1,5,"Wow.  I want to find the used LP for this now too.  How did I not end up buying this as a kid?  I guess you have to appreciate it when the time is right.  Love their approach, and also their less popular song, Don't Answer Me.

If you like ELO, I find this to be a less electronic but somewhat similar ""project."""
,B00136JDTE,-1,1,5,"If I am forced to a specific number of words in rating songs, I will no longer leave a rating or a response. If I paid money for the song that should suffice that I wanted the song anything beyond that is not for my benefit. After payment that should be the end of my obligation. The rating system should be the stars only without having to leave comments."
,B00136JDTE,1,1,4,"This is another cool song from this band, I loved hearing this song when we would warm up before basketball games. It's great background music is powerful and makes you ready to move. It is truly a one of a kind song.

Kris L. CocKayne"
,B00136JDTE,1,1,5,"Described as a love song, I have to wonder about that; nonetheless, it is a great ""toe-tapping"" song and has an excellent beat. Not sure if these guys were considered ""one-hit-wonders"" or not, but this song is what put Alan Parsons ""on the map"" as far as contemporary ""easy"" rock is concerned! A great ""sing-along"" song!"
,B00136JDTE,1,1,5,This is diffenitly a classic for me and fills out my music libary.  I love the sound of this band.  A little old but a classic.
,B00136JDTE,1,1,5,Remastered excellence!  I heard this in a grocery store one day and remembered how much I liked the song many moons ago so I decided to search it out and maybe get the download on MP3 to put onto my phone/player.  WOW - sounds great over my car stereo and makes me appreciate APP more than I did previously.  Amazon's MP3 have yet to disappoint!
,B00136JDTE,1,1,5,It has an excellent quality sound where you can hear all the instruments and voices clean and crisp. Great buy.
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,Classic mindless tune :)
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,Good times =)
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"Again, appreciation of unique quality is my source of joy in this song."
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"I admit that I first heard Black Betty by Ram Jam accidently over 6 years ago when it came on one of my alarm clock radios when my husband and I were still living in Florida. I say over six years because I had first heard this song either when my husband and I were living in Mayport Naval Base Florida or Orlando Florida. I have also heard a version by Tom Jones before on one of his greatest hits collection. Around 2015,I then heard it on iheartradio and this version of Black Betty by Ram Jam grew on me after hearing it enough times on my personalized favorites radio station especially because of the guitars and the well timed lyrics with the music. This song could best be described as hard rock/classic rock."
,B00136JJM0,1,1,4,"good song, Classic rock rules, period!"
,B00136JJM0,1,1,4,great song
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,Love this song
,B00136JA6K,1,1,5,"""Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)"" has taken on a life of its own in the career of Bruce Springsteen.  Despite never being released as a single, it may well rank as his most popular and beloved song.  It was the show closer from the time of its release in 1973 until 10/19/84 on the Born In The USA tour when it would never be played to close a show again.  What was once considered an absolute in a Springsteen concert is now a cherish gift if he plays it in a show.  The song is the second song in row on the album that deals with forbidden love.  This time it's Rosalita's parents that don't approve of his daughter's suitor's playing in a rock & roll band.  The song opens with the familiar guitar jangle and is carried throughout by Clarence Clemons blazing sax."
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,I love this song!
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,Great dance song
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,One of my favorites.
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,What can I say...another great Jackson song...never tire of it....just reminds me how much Michael is missed.....
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,This song gets you moving and singing along! And I Love it! Love it! Love it! And the video is inspiring!
,B00136JKZ6,1,1,5,I'm so very happy that Amazon MP3 has a really good selection of music that I've been looking for! I hope that Amazon will come out with a lot more music that is hard to find and I will keep expanding my songs in the cloud!
,B00136JHHW,1,1,4,I had heard this song before and knew it was exactly what I was looking for at just the right price
,B00136JHHW,1,1,5,"Love his music, but share only with love ones - ok?  Not for hormone laced teens at a party serving alcohol....please"
,B00136JHHW,1,1,5,"This is R. Kelly at his best. I love this song and had to put it on my Ipod. This song ""Bump N Grind"" is a classic and True R&B music. This is love making music and for grown folks."
,B00136JHHW,-1,-1,2,I remember this song be a lot better then it actually is. Maybe because I was pretty young when it came out.
,B00136JHHW,1,1,5,I had this song on a cassette tape with 4 versions and it died but I was surprised when I seen it on Amazon but they have supplied a lot of great songs for my tastes.
,B00136J7XQ,-1,-1,3,I love the song and really wanted to play it for my daughters graduation party I had and add to her DVD  I made her but couldn't. because it wasn't as easy to down load like i was said so it didn't get used on either but just played on my home computer for her so it was a waste of money and time.
,B00136JJFW,1,1,4,The disco era was a get up and shake your body. This does that and gives an opportunity to take a stroll down memory lane on what your hair style and outfits looked like...leading to a good old belly laugh.

,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,Great song love it classic
,B00136JB8W,1,1,5,This song by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes is a great song titled The Love I Lost. TEDDY PENDERGRASS  voice was wonderful.
,B00136JB8W,1,1,5,"This is that oldie but goodie--that explains why a relationship went sour, the man messed up-he probably realized it right after he did it and now she's gone. And all he he can do is think about the love he lost..and wish he hadn't screwed up so badly. If you are or had a relationship that ended badly or just ended you should listen to this--it might help!"
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"I like all my music choices, because I pick them out!"

,B00136JB8W,1,1,5,Brings back a lot of memories from the past I just LOVED it tacked me back when life was much easier.
,B00136JB8W,1,1,5,"Many people cite The Love I Lost, from late 1973-early 1974 as the first disco song. It has all the elements from the disco beat to the use of strings. I would say the Trammps with Zing Went the Strings of My Heart had all the disco elements down including the strings, and that was in late 1972, over a year earlier. But the Trammps song was minor and The Love I Lost was a huge mega-hit, so it's known to far more people. Disco evolved out of the Philly sound of Gamble and Huff, and taht's who Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes recorded for.

But forget labels like disco anyway (some people don't like the term), and what you've got is a smooth orchestra, a driving rhythm and Teddy Pendergrass singing his heart out. It's a great R&B classic and is as fresh today as it was when it was released. There was a long version on the album, but that just had an extended interlude for dancing because dance music was expected to be more than a three minute AM tune. But for just listening I think the single is better as the dance interlude gets a bit repetitious on the long version if you're just listening. It deserves to be in this collection."
,B00136JB8W,1,1,5,I would recommend this CD to anyone that loves that sound of the seventies.  Will order more of this fabulous group.
,B00136JLGO,-1,1,5,"Been there, terrible when someone cannot call you by your name or someone eleses. Great song for those who understand what it has to say."

,B00136J7MW,1,1,4,Michael Jackson was one of the most gifted talents in the world and his selection of songs and rhythm made him the King of pop music.
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,Brings back such memories of when I was a teenager & this is one of the songs that we would slow dance to.
,B00136J8C6,1,1,5,"I was already familiar with the song because I originally heard it by Kate Bush. Maxwell is one of a few artist with a tremendous vocal range. I am surprised that a male vocalist would take this song on. Maxwell took this song and delivered it flawlessly, with unique sensitivity. This song by Maxwell is now one of my two favorite songs by him.
I was really glad that Amazon made this song a mp3 available for purchase."
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,"This song brings me back to the day of the attack on the US. It is beautifully written, and Alan Jackson never disappoints when he sings from the heart. I would recommend this to everyone."
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,"Alan Jackson really hit home with his rendition of how people out side of the twin towers felt an also made them remember where they were, an how they felt when they heard the new's of the planes hitting the towers an what they did even in as little of a thing as going to church to pray for the families that lost their loved one, or giving blood to help those that had gotten out but where hurt in the process,  WE LOST SO MANY POLICE MEN, FIREMEN AN OFFICE WORKERS THAT REALLY NEVER KNEW WHAT HIT THEM....."
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,This incredible song will always be special to so many people that lived through the tragedy of 9/11/2001.  My world stopped when I heard the news on the radio.  I was at our new house cleaning and didn't have a TV.  I will never forget that horrible day and will always remember exactly where I was that day and what I was doing.  Only Alan Jackson can deliver such a touching ballad!
,B00136JJ8Y,1,1,5,"huge kevin bacon fan, saw shes having a baby on tv a few days ago and had to download this song"
,B00136JJ8Y,1,1,5,Heard this song years ago performed by Sonnor - a winter color guard from Canada.  One of the most memorable shows and so exciting ... just love the words to this song and the way it ebbs and flows ... a Kate Classic
,B00136JJ8Y,1,1,5,"Everytime I have heard this song , it was playing as a song in the background of a movie or television show when someone has just given birth to a baby. From when I heard it from the very first time i thought it was the great Cyndi Lauper.  Kate Bush I must commend you on  such a touching song to my heart. Its beautiful and breathtaking."
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,Very awesome song to have and to listen to. Really like the lyrics and the whole beat and tune of the song.
,B00136JJM0,1,-1,3,I bought this album back in the day.  Because of the awful solo & I was pretty busy when I was in college I never put it on a mix tape.  MP3 editing software is cheap and plentiful and it isn't too difficult to cut out the part of the solo I don't like.  It's not a great song but it got a lot of airplay in the Houston area back in the day and a classic rock station started playing it recently so I decided I just had to have it.  Check out the wikipedia entry for this song.  The long history of this song is 1uite an eye opener.  This version reached #18 in 1977.
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,great song by a great artist
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,"great song that should be sung (played) everywhere, everyday... Just to remind folk what happened that fateful day."
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,Great Alan Jackson song.
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,This is an amazing song.
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,"I love Mariah, the song is so beautiful and touching, she is also a great singer and I love her music."
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,She sings this song so beautifully.  This song really makes you think about the little things in life that really are the simple things
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"I've heard this song a few times and it makes me feel good, every time I hear it. Never heard of Floyd Cramer, but this particular song makes me think he should be alittle better known."
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"Add this to your collection ASSP!  This song has been re-recoded and re-mastered.  Awesome quality, depth, and channel separation.

P.S.  Don't forget to push the REPLY button!  It's that good!"
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,This is an amazing song.
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,This is an amazing song.

,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,I love older country Music
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,It's Great
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,"Loved this song from the beginning and I still cry every time I hear it. His music is always so beautiful, but when it came to this song he wrote and what this country was dealing with, there is no way anybody can forget this song. It was how we all felt, we all hurt and we all cried.  One of the most justified and beautiful song I have ever heard.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being able to put into words what every American felt on that day.  God bless Alan Jackson."
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,"I am now able to get songs that I used to have on vinyl, cassette or eight track. Easy to download from Amazon."
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"kick ass rock n roll. There's a couple of different versions out there, I like this one the best. Vintage, never gets old."
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"The lyrics and nature of the song is quite appealing.  When the song reaches the improvised part towards the middle, it can become a little tiring.  However, just listening to the first few chorus refrains is a lot of fun and I would recommend buying the song just for that."
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"One of the best songs ever, period, and I am a die hard metal head.  This is one of my favorite songs to jam at the pool."
,B00136JJM0,-1,1,5,"i have no idea what this song is about. that's not True. i could guess: lead singer wrote a song about a girl who made him say ""whoa."" ps, amazon should rule the world."
,B00136JJM0,1,1,4,I really like it when I just want one song and that's all I have to buy. The song quality was very good. Amazon cloud player is also nice and easy to use.
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,"I loved this song and it DOES help that Alan Jackson sings it, .OHYAY  Very emotionly moving as we remember that day"
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,He took a sad horrible day in our country and with a few simple words make it bearable and gives hope.
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,Our grandson suggested this to us.  He is a junior in high school and says it brought tears to his eyes the first time he heard it and he doesn't react to anything like that.  I am proud of him.  I am proud that someone wrote this with such compassion and truth and patriotism.  It should be played be every one old enough to understand the lyrcs often.  Where were YOU when the world stopped turning on September 11?Thank you Alan Jackson.  You are a hero.
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,This is a great song...Super easy download...Great song to cure the insanity of the long drive home in rush hour traffic. Just love Alan Jackson.
,B00136JGZU,1,1,5,"The 1st time I saw Alan sing this, tears ran down my face.  I still can't listen to it without a swell of emotion.  The song is filled with Love and Hope.  We need more of that.  I hope America can be that close once again."
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,Outstanding piano playing by a True master. Smooth as silk.
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,Great
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,perfect
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,This was one of my Dad's favorite songs and when he passed away we had that played for the visit.  I also love the sound of the piano.
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,This is one of those laid back musicals that you hear in commercials or in movies or even on the radio but you can't quite place it.  I stumbled apon this one while sampling this album.  Glad I did.
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,love it.
,B00136JJH0,-1,1,5,I love this song but it would not play in my program. I think it was the file type so it was a waste of my money.
,B00136JJH0,1,1,4,Beautiful song.
,B00136JJH0,1,-1,3,excellent!
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,Very good song loved it. no words to say
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,Glad I bought it. The song is exactly what I wanted and I didn't have to buy the whole album.
,B00136JJM0,1,1,4,"Everybody who loves Southern rock or blues rock should have this cut. For a long time, I had no idea who the artist was. I love the synchopated odd rhythm of this track. Glad I bought it."
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,one of our favorite songs and it is a classic it is on every play list that we make great song
,B00136JJM0,1,1,5,"This is a must-have for any classic rock collection. The title downloaded fine, converted easily to a WAV file, and played well in the car CD player."
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,I am happy with my recent purchase of hero from amazon music. the sound quality is very good and was easy to stream to my phone.
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,"Love this song, it was played when 9/11 happened for the first res ponders and the rescue dogs"
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,good
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,"I despise Carey's singing normally but this song is very pretty and a great inspiration. The producers toned down her ""showing off"" her 7 octave range, which involves a sound just like squealing like a dolphin. Great voice if she knew the right thing top do with it, like Whitney Houston, RIP."
,B00136JJH0,-1,1,5,AAA
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it...
,B00136JJH0,-1,1,5,Oldie but Goodie
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,Uplifting song.
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"One of best instmentals I have heard, don't ever get tired of hearing it, grew up on this kind of good music"
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,It was one of my mother's wishes to have this played at her funeral service.  I was glad I could download it and include it in her slide show presentation.  It was beautiful.
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"Even if you don't typically love to listen to piano music, it's hard not to LOVE this classic!  It's been a favorite of mine since I was a little girl.  It will ALWAYS be in my music library.  LOVE IT!"
,B00136JJH0,1,1,4,"Great album, would highly recommend to fans"
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,"I have always liked this song, and Mariah Carey. This song speaks to the heart. It speaks of courage and belief in ones self."
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,This remains my favorite Mariah tune.  I was happy to find it on my kindle and will get much pleasure listening to it.
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,"This song sounds great on my phone, my television (via my Roku), and my computer! This is a great find!"
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,"this song was dedicated to me by a friend I do not see or even know where she is, but now I can listen to it anytime and see her in my thoughts and my heart always and forever"
,B00136JJH0,1,1,5,"This song I listened to a few years ago and loved it. Decided just recently I had to buy this for myself. So glad I did. This is the kind of song that is very inspiring as each one of us can find a hero within ourselves in that we are stronger than we think. When I am in a situation where I must find strength within myself to solve a problem or be of assistance to someone, I listen to this song and it is very uplifting - the words ring True!

This is a highly recommended song to every age and great for any playlist!"
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,Love it
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"Oh so soothing

Regardless of  what ever mood you are in,
this a beautiful instrumental song to listen
to, it will sooth the most savage beast."
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"This is the real deal and in my opinion, the original recording (re-mastered) on Last Date as performed by the late Floyd Cramer. The song Last Date was originally on the album Last Date (Floyd Cramer). There have been several re-releases since that time, however, I think that this one is the best!  This instrumental song is performed so well by Mr. Cramer, who had such a heart and soul for playing the piano!

If you are a Floyd Cramer fan or just love great piano, then I highly suggest Last Date. It is a classic OLDIE BUT GOODIE and it is a song that I believe is timeless!

Highly recommend this song!"
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"While I prefer Floyd Cramer's upbeat hits, I can't buy his music without picking up Last Date. It's a classic, beautiful song, and if I never do anything more than use it to expose children to his talent, then it is well worth my money."
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,The double notes for which Floyd Cramer is very apparent here. A great rendition and has become a piano classic.
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"A must for your classic early rock insturmentals.  This is a cross-over hit from ""back-in-the-day."" Well worth the listen. An added gem in my play list."
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"What can I say about Floyd Cramer and his music but GREAT, WONDERFUL, and the best!!!  The song Last Date is one I have loved for many years.  To look for it and be able to add it to my Kindle was a happy day.  I had almost forgot it, and am so happy it is back in my life to enjoy.  Thanks Amazon!"
,B00136JH5Y,1,1,5,"If you love Pearl Jam you already have this song, it was a good download and essential for my collection"
,B00136JH5Y,1,1,5,i have heard a lot of their music and this is the only song that i have heard that i like
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,My parents had some Floyd Cramer records when I was growing up.  We used to listen to them often and this is one of his best.  It's been about 50 years since I heard this song and just a few days ago I heard it on an oldie station.  His passing left a hole in popular piano music.  He is missed.
,B00136JF9M,1,1,4,This is a perfect example of country piano of that era. I picked this version because the piano is more upfront in the mix and not covered up by the strings as with some versions.
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,Through the years I have continued to enjoy Floyd Cramer's music and this is very definitely a favorite of mine!
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"I feel so very fortunate to be able to purchase and include this version to ""my Favorites"" Playlist on my tablet.  I have the CD album but wanted just the one song  as part of my ""Cloud Favorites"" list"
,B00136JF9M,1,1,5,"This is what we danced to right after we were married.  Now, we listen to it and sway in memories."
,B00136JN0S,1,1,5,What a great song! The voices of both men are just perfect and flow together really well!
,B00136JL5K,1,1,5,"Have always enjoyed this song, just wanted to add it to my collection. Takes me back to my young and carefree days."
,B00136JL5K,1,1,5,ok
,B00136JL5K,1,1,5,"I love Michael Jackson's talent, and this track by him is a great groomy sound, it has very intriguing words, and a unique display of vocal variations by the incomparable Mr. Michael Jackon.  I think its a must-have by anyone who likes Michael Jackson."
,B00136JL5K,-1,1,5,He iis Michael Jackson...'nough said!
,B00136JL5K,1,1,5,Everyone Loves Michael
,B00136JL5K,1,1,5,"I don't know what to say really. This is a classic, a must to have, a great work by Jackson. The quality is superb, download is pretty fast and the rest I think everybody knows. One of the best songs of Michael's."
,B00136JL5K,1,1,5,EXCELLENT SERVICE
,B00136JL5K,1,1,5,"I loved this song when it first came out and this appears to be the original version I first heard.  However, music tastes are purely subjective and what I like some other person may hate.  You should always listen to the sample clips before buying any song, anywhere."
,B00136JL5K,1,1,5,This is truly one of my favorite michael Jackson song. What can you say about the KING OF POP himself. A truly amazing artist and entertainer of his time. Michael Jackson was truly gifted and magical. R.I.P MICHAEL
,B00136JL6Y,1,1,5,"Music is all very personal and I'm not sure why I'm being asked to review it.  What I may love, another person will not, but I'm tired of seeing it on my ""Review Purchases"" screen, so I really love this song."
,B00136JL6Y,-1,-1,1,dont listen to music because music bores me and i don't even listen to music at all to begin with
,B00136JOU2,1,1,5,Simon and Garfunkel has always been my favorite group. I was glad to have found this song in MP3 format.
,B00136JOU2,-1,1,5,"Not sure how I missed this gem in my music collection, and all is now good.
I remember one of the short films on SNL that featured Homeward Bound behind airport reunions.
Sob."

,B00136JHUO,1,1,5,COOL SONG
,B00136JHUO,1,-1,3,This is old music I like by R. Kelly.  He has such a large varieties of song he sings. This one I like a lot.
,B00136JHUO,1,1,5,What can I say? The man can pump out some good music and this one is a classic that will never die.
,B00136JHUO,1,1,5,"I have been looking for this item and finally found it, I appreciate it. I love it, I love it. Thank you"
,B00136JHUO,1,1,5,"I loved this song that's why I purchased it! I will definitely purchase more songs very very soon, that's a promise!!!"
,B00136JHUO,1,1,5,I love the smooth R&B sounds of the early 90s & this is one of the best of that time!
,B00136JO6G,1,1,4,This song was reccommended by a friend and I really liked it. I will tell other friends about it too.
,B00136JO6G,1,1,5,"This song is very touching and sang beautifully. The lyrics of this song pertains to many situations in life, You will enjoy this one."

,B00136JO6G,1,1,5,"A song a friend of mine requested for his father-in-laws funeral and they loved it, it realy got every one crying."
,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,"One of my favorite songs of hers back when she was making real music!!! Glad I made the purchase, I love this song."
,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,This is one of my Mariah Carey favorites. It takes me back to a time when my friends and I have such fun in school giggling about our sweethearts.
,B00136JDR6,1,1,5,Have always enjoyed A.P.P...........just wanted to purchase the music again (used to have all the group's music in vinyl yrs ago.)
,B00136JDR6,1,1,5,Love this and this song another one for the jam list
,B00136JDR6,1,1,4,"This band I compare with Pink Floyd a lot, they are two band that have great music and sound alike in a way. This is one of my favorite songs from them, the lyrics kick ass. This is one song that makes you think about people who have really screwed you over, by playing those mind games. To anyone who likes 70's/80's rock this song is 4 you.

Kris L. CocKayne"
,B00136JDR6,1,-1,3,I bought this because I had heard a small bit of it the other day and I couldn't get it out of my head. I enjoyed this song when it came out originally (I wasn't even a teenager then) but I wanted to have it at my disposal to listen to whenever I wanted. I'm glad I bought it and can listen to it on my Mp3 player.
,B00136JO6G,1,1,5,"Very happy with this purchase. Not to bum anyone out, but we downloaded this as part of the music for my Grandma's funeral. It fit so well. Great song anyway. Helped us remember the good times."
,B00136JO6G,1,1,5,Love this song. Reminds me of my husband and me when we were dating and our life together. Haven't got to the end yet but it's pretty much how we feel.
,B00136JO6G,1,1,5,Enjoyed this story a lot.  Colin Raye knows how to keep you reading right up to the end.
,B00136JO6G,1,1,5,Love his music

,B00136JP6A,-1,-1,3,"Enjoy Mariah Carey, but I did not like this song as well as I had hoped."
,B00136JP6A,1,1,4,It's a song my little girls love.
,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,I love this song. So glad to have it.
,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it...
,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,I love this song 
,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,This song was during her prime years of entertaining.  Great voice.

,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,Its a great song. I like it because she is one of my favorite singers. I would recommend to anyone.
,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,"Mariah  sings with her heart and soul. She makes you feel  like you have you have been where she is
singing about, and when she hit those high notes , I feel chills  all over. She is one of the very best."
,B00136JP6A,1,1,5,MC in her prime without a doubt. This is one of many songs I play when I'm on the road for a while and cruise...
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,"Great old song, had to have it on my phone after hearing it on the radio. Loved it back then and even more now!"
,B00136JL32,1,-1,3,Good song.
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,"Been looking for this song for a long time, glad I found it,. I am not disappointed,,"
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,Smooth and Sultry
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,"I feel deeply sorry for the generations that have passed over the globe and never had the priviledge of hearing this perfect song.  It invokes certain emotions (whether you've ever endured a break-up or not).  It is a song that I will always want around.  I remember it from my 20's.  I'm 50 now and went hunting for it...OMG even the opening line, ""This is the saddest day of my life"" is just killer.  Goodbyes are never fun, no matter what the reason is, and unfortunately, separation and loss is something everyone will go through sooner or later.  What better song to make you feel ""understood""...and no other band could've sung it better.  Love the harmony!"
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,"I just LOVE this song, but it's all about his decision - kinda wish her side was allowed for, but it wouldn't be the same, would it?"
,B00136JOV6,1,1,5,"If you want great folk songs, you can't beat Simon and Garfunkel. It has a great tune and wonderful harmony typical of this duo."
,B00136JOV6,1,1,5,Simon and Garfunkle have always been my favorite group. I was glad to have found this song in MP3 format.
,B00136JL32,1,1,4,"The words in this song are the same as the words spoken to me groom my fiance. She told me good by on th e phone, She did come back but it was to late. Great song."
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,"A very Beautiful song. Great for just sitting back with your girl. I love The Manhattans when they sings these types of songs.
OH My!!!"
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,I have always loved this song since hearing it on radio years ago. It's a nice songyou need to quit okay
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,Old style group from the past.  This is one of many songs I enjoyed from The Manhattens.  Love it.  Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.
,B00136JL32,-1,1,5,Very good song. Please take off the stupid word count you have on here. Should be able to use words.
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,This song is one of my baby sister's favorites and I even had to learn to play it on the guitar for her in younger days .
,B00136JL32,1,1,5,I enjoy this song so much. It brings back great memories of my sister who has now passed and I enjoy it in my musical library.
,B00136JMOK,1,1,5,I really have enjoyed this album and there are the classics on it that everyone enjoys but also many will like.
,B00136JMOK,1,1,5,This song should get much more airplay usually only on 4th of july and memorial day....it is a True classic
,B00136JMOK,1,1,5,I love Johnny Cash and his rendition of this song is inspiring.  Brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.
,B00136JBWS,1,1,5,"This product arrived on time, with no damage to the package or product. I am a satisfied customer. MS"
,B00136JBWS,1,1,5,"I have this album...when 12"" vinyl was the way you purchased music.  One of their best albums; I liked most of the songs.  Now I have it my Amazon Cloud.  Classics never die!"
,B00136JBWS,1,1,5,Love the song!
,B00136JBWS,1,1,5,Love Earth Wind & Fire!!! This is another favorite of mine & it just makes you want to sing along & get up & dance!!!!
,B00136JBWS,1,1,5,I wouldn't have download this song if I didn't like it a lot.  Good music if you want to get your boogie groove on!  Earth Wind & Fire are great.
,B00136JHU4,1,1,4,"Falling slowly is featured in the movie Once. For those who don't know ""once"" which was released in 2007, is Winner of the World Audience Award at Sundance, a small-scale romance aboutmusic, that bring unlikey people togther. This is a great song."
,B00136JHU4,1,1,5,"And I'm not talking about instrumentals either, I'm talking about lyrical themes to movies that have to embody the movie, and really set the tone for it the movie. However, there is a rarer quality of a movie song, one that if you have not seen said movie, but you here the song first, and you love the song so much that you actually want to see the movie. That is what this song does. While watching these past Oscars they played the nominees for best movie song of the year, and I thought to myself, it all seems so fake. The song from ""August Rush"" completely missed the mark it was trying to achieve, and ""Enchanted"" with the exception of ""So Close,"" sounded like typical Disney type fair.

However, then came, ""Falling Slowly,"" a song from a widely unknown film, I was like, ""Wow, this is really different, this is beautiful!"" And it was all that and more, and the studio version only improved on these precious elements. It's a moving, gentle song that really touches your heart. And like I said, I liked the song so much, I now want to see the actual movie, ""Once.""

Overall, the surprise song of the year, and a feel-good story that these unknown musicians are finally getting the credit and recognition they deserve. Buy this song, and you won't be disappointed.

By the way, get this version, there's a longer version that was put out, and it's not as good, because the song seems a little bit too spontaneous and drawn out, and it also loses some of the elements that makes the soundtrack version so great."
,B00136JMS6,1,1,5,"I listened to this song about 25 times right after I downloaded it.  It has always been one of my favorite songs.  I was reminded of that when I heard it listening to WJEJ AM radio in Hagerstown, Maryland.  I always turn on this station about 15 minutes before the noon CBS news.  They have the most amazing playlist.  You never know what you might hear from one song to another.  I hadn't heard this one for a while, but immediately a flood of memories came back to me in that way that only music can cause.  Copperline by James Taylor is a 5 star performance/sound . . .

,B00136J9YI,1,1,4,This is a song that I remembered hearing on the radio and this is a perfect rendition of the one that I heard. Anyone who has heard and liked this song with like this copy of it.
,B00136J9YI,1,1,4,"I love 3 Days Grace. These guys have great lyrics,tempo & the singer has a beautiful voice. Love to sing along with."
,B00136J9YI,1,1,5,Like that I can just download from amazon right to my phone. Always great quality. Lots of great songs to choose from.
,B00136J9YI,1,1,4,I like Three Days Grace and I really like this song. It's the epitome of the ironic to me; I love the lyrics AND the music.
,B00136J9YI,1,1,5,"Another great song from Three Days Grace, and one of their best. This song really speaks for people who actually care about each other even though they fight and curse each other all the time. I see this song great for sibling rivalry analysis."
,B00136J9YI,1,1,5,I love Three Days Grace. This song is Awesome. It's one of my favorites. The song is cool. The band is a favorite of mine. This song is a must have for any Three Days Grace fans.
,B00136JHU4,1,1,5,You'd probably have to see the movie to appreciate it.  It was made with real musicians.  Very good movie - liked it a lot.
,B00136JHU4,1,1,5,I heard this song on tv one day as I was flipping through the channels and knew I had to have it.  I use it every morning for my alarm and it's perfect.  It's almost haunting.
,B00136JHU4,1,1,5,I first heard this music from the movie it is from.  I have been wanting a copy for a while and when I heard it on Pandora I bought a copy through Amazon.
,B00136JL8W,1,1,4,this song is kind of cool and the video of it is cool as well . it's to bad he did what he did . nice song to put on my player .
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,"""Beat It"" is Michael Jackson's statement that no music genre is beyond his reach.  Pretty much a straight rock song, ""Beat It"" defied conventional thinking about Mr. Jackson's music.  It had a rock beat, but you could definitely dance to it as well.  Aided by a blistering guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen, the song rose to number one in mid 1983 and the video has become a classic in its own right.  The song ended up snagging the Record of The Year Grammy as well as a best rock vocal Grammy."
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,"This song is great to dancercise to, as it will give you the best cardia workout.  Wear headphones and get naked because you are going to sweat."
,B00136JL8W,1,1,4,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,"Michael Jackson has been a long time favorite for the past few decades. No matter what happens to him in court, no matter what went on recently (His death), Jackson will always prevail. Sure, we have the Black Eyed Peas, but before, Jackson stood by his name as the King of Pop.

Beat It is his signature song. It tells about an anonymous person ending up meeting a gang (Or so I assume), and the people in the gang seem like as if they want to injure the person. Now, that may not be the actual storyline in the song, but seriously, what do you think of after hearing this: ""They're out to get you. Better leave while you can!""

As for the song itself, it's as catchy and fun to listen to as any other Michael Jackson song. There is almost no other way to put it."
,B00136JG96,1,1,5,Such a moving song! Kurt Carr is a creative genius.  He was able to capture the essence of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus through music and lyrics!  Close your eyes and prepare to travel back in time.
,B00136JG96,1,1,5,This is an awesome song.  My church choir has sung it for two years at Easter and each time it brings me to tears.  Kurt Carr and the choir did a truly fabulous job in bringing the story of the crucifiction to life.
,B00136J9YI,-1,1,5,<3<3<3
,B00136J9YI,1,1,5,i love this song
,B00136J9YI,1,1,5,"I just purchased this song (I Hate Everything About You) as an Mp3 and I am really happy that I did. The sound quality is great, and it is just what I wanted!"
,B00136J9YI,1,1,5,"How can one possibly rate a mp3 download negatively? I give five stars to this purchase, because it was quick and hassel free."

,B00136JPVK,1,1,4,I miss the music and showmanship of this outstanding guitarist.  Texas Flood is an outstanding blues sound and I know of no other musician that can play this stuff like Stevie.
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Its a classic......
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Listening to this song makes me realize how sad it is to lose such a great talent so young!
,B00136JL8W,1,1,4,When Michael was still Michael
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Great guitar work
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,good
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,"'took me years to enjoy his music.  I had to hear some of the songs hundreds of times, before I began liking them.  I cannot condone his actions, but his music was ahead of his time."
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,as always super song.
,B00136JL8W,1,1,4,Like the song.

,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,"This may be the only Michael Jackson song I have,  but I really like it! It lifts you up and gets you dancing!"
,B00136JGX2,1,1,5,I have not heard from this group in so long so I was pleasantly surprised to hear this song. I couldn't download it fast enough. Download it and enjoy it while watching the rain fall down on you.
,B00136JL8W,-1,-1,1,song was great BUT Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again. IF YOUR gonna download this song do it but not from AMAZON.

,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Good stuff.
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,"This takes me back to those 1st MTV days, when this was one of the 1st ""videos"" that debuted.
A time when my kids & their generation soon forgot that the single comes out 1st, not the video. But this song & millions after it changed that forever.
Definately one of Mike's best, a scenario about gangs, & he becomes the peacemaker with his genuine moves & choreography.
Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo, Quincy Jones' producing, Mike's vocals & dance moves, can't Beat It.... *rimshot*  ;)"
,B00136JL8W,-1,1,4,As described
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,classics are the best!
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Just as expected.
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Still lovin Michael after all these years.
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Another great hit of Michael Jackson. Too bad he didn't stick around for the next album he was making.
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Old but good music
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio stations coming out of chicago. when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which as far as im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,"Reviewing this song is like reviewing a sunset at the beach! I mean, it's ""Beat It"" for crying out loud!  If there were ever a late 20th century Pop anthem, this has to be it!!"
,B00136JL8W,1,1,5,Really happy the be able to play on my Kindle!  I can enjoy great music while playing a game or reading a book.
,B00136J81W,1,1,5,"I love this song the quiality is great,adn I enjoy putting it on my own personailized cd. I would recomend this way of purchasing"
,B00136J81W,1,1,5,"This is a very powerful song, I loved it the very first time that i heard it. I  discovered MercyME about 2 years ago with the worship song "" All of creation "". They are artist that truly write songs that speak to the spirit."
,B00136J81W,-1,1,5,"I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.
See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours.
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:"
,B00136J7RC,-1,1,5,:)
,B00136J7RC,1,1,5,"Love, love, love!"
,B00136J7RC,1,1,5,"Quite the classic song.  Really I can keep singing this to myself forever, and it's a great way to teach kids."
,B00136J7RC,1,1,4,The Music Theory of diatonic Major Scale is part of musical knowledge. This concept isn't Rocket Science to understand but important
,B00136J7RC,1,1,5,This is my all time favorite movie - my mom used to sing these songs to us as kids so I play them for my son now
,B00136JDNA,1,1,5,I've loved this song since it first came out. It's just a feel good kind of song!!!! This one's hard to beat!
,B00136JDNA,-1,1,5,"if you read my reviews you know I think good music stopped being created about 1992. so you can guess how I feel about 70s music in general.

this is a great song and I think he played every instrument too"
,B00136JOKC,1,1,5,Because I think Bob Dylan is one of the best  singers from the 70's or anytime and best at that style of music
,B00136JOKC,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite Dylan songs of all time.  It encapsulates the attitude and honesty of the sixties.
,B00136JOKC,1,1,5,"For only $0.50, you can't beat it!!! Aye-tunes (or similar mp3 websites) have never offered a major
artist at these prices. Suggest you do the same for The Beatles, Rolling Stones, or other MAJOR
artists from this era."
,B00136JOKC,1,1,5,"I have been a fan of Bob Dylan since the 1960s. I don't like every song that he has churned out, but this song is one of his best.

I heard ""Positively 4th Street"" during my teen years, meaning that the music and lyrics hit me at a time when I was vulnerable, my mind was often in turmoil, and I was forming crucial adolescent friendships.

The piping sound of the organ, the supporting guitars, the punctuating percusssion, and Dylan's sarcastic tongue hit me where I lived. The lyrics caused me to examine my own relationships, especially with people who didn't seem to care a lot for me! In other words, I loved this song as a teenager, and still go back to it when someone disappoints me!"
,B00136JDNA,1,1,5,good
,B00136JDNA,1,1,5,love this song
,B00136JDNA,1,1,5,"I love every version if this song, the guitar is awesome."
,B00136JDNA,1,1,5,And it doesn't fade out and back in like the 8 track.  Nice recording with high quality sound and better than I remembered.
,B00136JDNA,1,1,5,An oldie ... and a goodie... but only because Greatie wouldn't sound right! Love this song from my childhood! Recommend
,B00136JDNA,1,1,5,This is one of my all-time favorite songs. It sounds like I remember and you can't beat the price. I love this MP3 setup they have now.
,B00136JDNA,1,1,5,"Sounds great, downloaded without errors and meets expectations.  Amazon offers a great selection of music and they're are my preferred download site."
,B00136JC4U,1,1,5,Will get you moving and in the spirit to decorate bake some cookies and dance. We'll miss Andy Williams but the song will be played every year.
,B00136JC4U,-1,-1,1,"What a con, I should have looked harder, but Amazon shows an Ablum cover, and expecting to get it all for .69 cents, you get one song.  Its deceptive, but  probably not illegal. But I don't like it, and probably will never use this site angain."
,B00136JODY,1,1,5,There music will last for generations.  They are one of a kind.  Their music has been the inspiration for the music industry.
,B00136JPTW,1,1,5,I love the sincerity  of this song.
,B00136JPTW,1,1,5,"This song with Pastor McClurkin and Yolanda Adams has got to be the greatest collaboration in terms of a duet.  I make it my business to play it weekly, or at times. every other day.  The sound is so encouraging and motivating."
,B00136JPTW,1,1,5,Perfection at work.  The voices are amazing.
,B00136JPTW,1,1,5,Beautifully sung by the two.
,B00136JPTW,1,1,5,"This song just puts you in the right place, knowing all Gods mercy and there voices are amazing.  You can't go wrong with Donnie and Yolanda."
,B00136JPTW,1,1,5,I love this song. It is beautiful and meaningful. It has been sung by a variety of singers and I have this version and Charlotte Church and Josh Groban. I really love this version as I am a huge fan of both McClurkin and Yolanda Adams. I am not saying that any version of this song is better than the other because sometimes I want to listen to this one and other times I listen to the other. It is just a great song period.
,B00136JPTW,1,1,5,"Downloaded with no problem. Sounds great, and the recording exceeded my expectaions! Excellent, will definitely download more music through this source."
,B00136JPTW,1,1,5,I give this a five star rating because the duet was done masterfully. I have always had an appreciation for Donnie McClurkin & Yolanda Adams. This song was heavenly  and their voices blended in a great way
,B00136JODY,1,1,4,replacing old LP and cassette music with MP3 or CD.  I like the MP3 option since many CDs (albums) only contain a couple keepworthy songs.
,B00136JODY,1,1,4,"Great album, would highly recommend to fans"
,B00136JODY,1,1,5,"I think this was their last big hit before Maurice White (lead vocals) went into semi-retirement. Released in 1981, it sort of closed the 70's as it wasn't quite disco and not like their rhythm and blues either-more of a blend I guess. Great rhythm and blues/rock( just before New Wave) is what it was, rediscovered by several artists in the 90's. Great fun song and the entire CD comes as a bonus with Prime."
,B00136JODY,1,1,5,Another amazing song I love listening to before going to work. Thank you for making it easy for me to get it.
,B00136JODY,1,1,5,"Such a fun and upbeat tune to get the whole family groovin'!  Hard to be in a bad mood when you listen to this song.  Turn it on and get moving!  From toddlers to teenagers - the kids will love it, and you know Mom and Dad will!  Great song!"
,B00136JODY,1,1,5,"I WAS YOUNG. This was the kind of music I listened to. It made sense,and a lot of people fell in love  dancing
close to some of the songs."
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,What could be better than Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett!  Need I say more?
,B00136JID0,-1,1,4,1

,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"Nice product, quick shipping"
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,good song.
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,Two of favorite performers
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"Not the deepest song in the world, but it is a blast to listen to and sing along with."
,B00136JID0,1,1,4,great song
,B00136JID0,1,1,4,An instant country/pop classic.  Great track.
,B00136JID0,-1,1,4,This is a mix of Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville meets slow country music.
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,Great item
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"Just used the product and was very satisfied, just as advertised. Would recommend this product to others."
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"I am now able to get songs that I used to have on vinyl, cassette or eight track. Easy to download from Amazon."
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"Love Alan Jackson.  This is one of  his best songs, and clearly a drinking song...I liked it a lot, it was easy to download to my computer, and to my Kindle Fire..."
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"This song makes me think about reconnecting with my friends and enjoying a few drinks, snacks, and laughs after a hard day at work."
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"Just like any other MP3 download, I would have ordered it if I didn't already like it.  Sound quality is good.  AIf you like the song, buy it."
,B00136JID0,-1,-1,2,"I know 'It's Five O'clock Somewhere' is a good song because I've heard it done well at many square dances.  But I was very disappointed with this version.  I know a local square dance caller who does it much, much better."
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,toe tapping and hand clapping tune just got to loive it and I sure do like to sing along with this tune
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"I'm an Alan Jackson fan for sometime...when you add Jimmy Buffet to the mix, ""How cool is that""!
The song sounds great and they both offset each other well."
,B00136J8JY,1,1,5,A different version of a great song recorded by several groups. This is outstanding! Christmas music that is so special.
,B00136JKQA,1,1,5,One of the few songs of the 70's that I can listen to without having the urge to throw up.
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,"A good toe tapping song, that is great to sing along with. I recommend this song to everyone that likes a great country song!"
,B00136JID0,1,1,4,Five O'Clock comes early for me somtimes and an old friend. We always got a kick out of this one.
,B00136JID0,1,1,5,Great party song.  Alan and Jimmy are awesome and rocking on this one.  One of my all time favorite songs.
,B00136JID0,-1,1,5,"I'm not a huge country fan but you really don't have to be to love this song. Plus, it's got Jimmy Buffet. 'Nuff said."
,B00136JS6C,1,1,5,This song is one of the greatest songs ever. They don't write music like this anymore. All they have now is rap and rock music that is dark and dreary. truly a feel good tune with simple lyrics. I am biased but I love the vibes by the man Vince Montana Jr. he is the Philly sound.  This song takes me to another place another time. truly beautiful music.
,B00136JS6C,1,1,5,"Heard it first in Vietnam, and have loved it since. I recommend this one-especially for those quiet times-alone-together.
Bring on the intimacy."
,B00136JS6C,1,1,5,Have the cd just wanted to listen to this song on my phone ended up making it a ringtone  Love it  Give me old school any day
,B00136JS6C,-1,1,5,Memories
,B00136JS6C,1,1,5,love old school!!!!!!!!!!!!
,B00136JS6C,1,1,5,La-La Wonderful.
,B00136JS6C,1,1,5,The best music ever!
,B00136JS6C,1,1,5,I chose this rating because I like the sound and quality of MP3. The Delfonics sounds great on this remastered mix and is great to listen to.
,B00136LDQK,-1,1,4,The only good song on the album. Not a big fan of Ozzy. But he always manages to get great guitarists to play for him. And Jake E. Lee is no exception and this song highlights his great talent.
,B00136JGBO,1,-1,3,Just love hearing good music and this record and artist has it all. Besides I like paying for the songs I want verses the whole album.
,B00136JGBO,1,1,5,I love it was so lifting for praising the LORD anytime you need Him Love gospel then you will love this songs
,B00136JGBO,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs.  Kurt Carr has delivered an excellent song and the lead singers are awesome.  This is a very inspiring songs because I know God has blocked a lot of bad things from happening in my life.  The enemy is defeated.
,B00136JGBO,1,1,5,Kurt Carr and his singers sing this song like they have spent time on their knees. It touched my soul!
,B00136LELO,1,1,5,I love Sara Bareilles! This song is so beautiful. Raw and emotional Sara has such control of her voice! I think her album title is perfect. Little Voice but a BIG impact. I remember seeing Sara Bareilles on Jimmy Kimmel and just being blown away by her voice and piano skills.
,B00136JES4,1,1,5,"great music for your adventursome side especially for us old babyboomers who grew up watching all those westerns on tv and at the movies, not sure the younger generation would appreciate this song but for this old timer it is pure fun and escape to a simpler time and place, and younger days whem I did not have so much responiblity and our world was not so insane."
,B00136JES4,1,1,5,"This is a must-have for any classic rock collection. The title downloaded fine, converted easily to a WAV file, and played well in the car CD player."
,B00136JXWG,1,1,4,This is a great album by a great artist. I think that Amazon should let you rate albums without writing a review.
,B00136LELO,1,1,5,great song
,B00136LELO,1,1,5,Great.
,B00136LELO,1,1,5,great
,B00136LELO,1,1,5,Good
,B00136LELO,1,1,5,Lyrically beautiful with a fantastic melody!
,B00136JES4,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136JES4,1,1,5,Awesome guitars in this song!!!
,B00136JES4,1,1,5,their music is awesome
,B00136JES4,1,1,5,good southern hard hitting country rock
,B00136JES4,1,1,5,I gave this a 5 stars because I love the long version more than the radio version because it has longer guitar riffs!
,B00136JES4,1,1,5,I was assigned to Spectre gunships in Thailand during the Vietnam war and this was the theme song of Spectre.  It still has special meaning to me and Im sure to anyone else from Spectre
,B00136LELO,1,1,4,I had not heard of this song until I found another duo singing it on the x factor. this song is so amazing I just had to have a copy. I am a fan of this artist and found this to be the perfect rendition of the song I wanted.
,B00136LELO,1,1,5,"""Something always brings me back to you, and never takes too long.""

Five EXCELLENT Stars! Singer/songwriter Sara Bareilles is definitely one of the best young rising stars out there in pop music: possibly headed towards Streisand and Dion territory if she keeps it up, writing and singing some heavyweight, heartfelt songs, delivered by her sweet dynamic soprano voice, backed up by her own attractive piano stylings. In the album ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Voice/dp/B00136Q6DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Voice</a>"", one of the best performances among many is the song ""Gravity"" starting sweetly and building in intensity to one stunning, hair-raising grace note crescendo that is twisted and turned up and down the music scale in one long breath. ""Gravity"" was previously the lead song in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Careful-Confessions/dp/B004HE43B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Careful Confessions</a>"". My Highest Recommendation. Five AMAZING Stars! (1 MP3 track. Time: 3:52)"
,B00136LELO,1,1,5,Very good
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"I have loved this song since it first came out in the 70's, still a rockin song. Just now added to my mp3 collection.
I always thought Ozzy was great."
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,This was perfect. It was totally awesome hands down. I would not have and issues in getting this again. Perfect.
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"there are few songs that define a singer/band that every collection has to have and this is one of them.
you hear the opening and its ozzy."
,B00136LFX6,1,1,5,This song was actually my introduction to Brad Paisley. It actually renewed my formally dormant interest in country music. this is a great song nd I love it.
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,The download worked great through the Amazon Cloud. The price was fair. No complaints.
,B00136JPLU,1,1,4,"4 stars only because of too much wah-wah pedal. never liked the d--- things. other than that, a very, very haunting track. a hard punch in the gut by one generation looking back at another's misery. a story there. for what it says, i love it. for how it says it,
i would have wanted it a bit more perfect. how the writer found the pride earned of my generation's sadness says a lot about his gift."
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,"First time I heard it I knew I liked it, and I immediately bought it. If you like classic rock songs, do give this a try!"
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,"I heard this song on the radio and instantly wanted to hear it again. I remember it from years ago and was certain I had it already, but didn't. It was a little more expensive than most mp3's, but I've always liked Alice in Chains and it's one of their best songs. Very much worth the extra money."
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,"I am not a huge fan of this group, but they do have a couple of songs that I really like and this is one of them."
,B00136LFX6,1,1,5,"Used for a project, great loved it."
,B00136LFX6,1,1,5,Any song we're listening to on the boat is a good song!!!  We also have the theme from Gilligan's Island and Jaws.
,B00136LFX6,1,1,5,"What can say about this one... firstly, it's West Virginia's own Brad Paisley... as far as this song, I can't imagine there's anyone that doesn't like it!! The humor of real life at its best in a song!!"
,B00136LFX6,1,1,5,"This Is A Great Brad Paisley Song, It Has A Hint Of Comedy To It, But Relays A Small Truth About Men And The Way We Think. A Must Have For Your MP3 Collection"
,B00136LFX6,1,1,5,I liked it so much that I bought it twice. I forgot I already had it. But it was money well spent.
,B00136LFX6,1,1,4,"I think this song is hilarious!  I had to make the purchase because it is so unusually funny.  The sad, mournful intro makes the song even more delightful when the mood changes and he sings about choosing fishing over his woman. But this track does not have the cheering and hooting in the background.  It is only Brad singing so don't buy this one if you want the version where the crowd hoots and hollers in the background."
,B00136LCH0,1,1,5,"A classy Michael Jackson hit, that really brings out his thoughts

and backround on himself.  You kind of get to know what he was thinking

about when it was performed."
,B00136LCH0,1,1,5,Great entertainer and a great person all around. He will be missed by all. The songs that mkae you laugh and cry and feel are always so touching!

,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,Gotta love that guitar!
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,Classic
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,great song. Thank you!!
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,Great
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"great, thanks"
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,Its OZZY - need I say more???
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,Ozzy is still good
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,"song review, loved the song before I bought it."
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,Great!
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,great!
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,Sounds like an MP3 digital file.
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,Excellent song
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,love it
,B00136LFEA,-1,1,5,As expected
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,Good download
,B00136LFEA,-1,1,5,ozzy!
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"Love this song!! Sometimes I wonder if Amazon's digital downloads are really all that clear or if it's just the devise I'm burning the songs to? All the songs I've bought very in volume when burned to a devise, I'm sure there is a way to fix that."
,B00136LF72,1,1,4,"This song can't help but put you in a good mood.  LOVE this song, but only gave it four stars because there is about one minute of applause and cheering at the end.  Would have been nice if they cut that out.  Other than that, it's so much fun."
,B00136LF72,1,1,5,"I got this for the children at my church to sing along with, and they love it (as I knew they would!)"
,B00136LF72,1,1,5,"I WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER THE SAME AS I DID FOR MATT REDMAN. I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS, ONLY GOOD THINGS TO SAY AND I do tell people about how it makes me feeler 'safer' if you will."
,B00136LF72,1,1,5,"After years of delivering this is a fun song.  Actually our church choir has begun to sing it and it is a hit, especially with the man/woman split.  Great worship song."
,B00136JPLU,1,1,4,"Great album, great music"
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,Great song! Heard it first when I was younger on the radio and then forgot about it until I started watching Supernatural for the first time recently.
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,All it was cracked up to be
,B00136JPLU,1,1,5,This is another Alice in Chains song that I heard and liked. After seeing the band Alice in Chains on the Audience Channel on TV I like Alice in Chains and their music. Some songs I like better than other songs. This happens to be a song I like. If you would like to hear a small portion of it you can go to the Amazon MP3 store and listen to a small part of it. Sandra K
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,The Isley Brothers always seem to get right on the Smooth Jams.you know they are Funky as all Heck but they have made some of the most important Ballads ever.this incredible Family Act has been going strong for many Decades&the material here is a reflection of there Greatness&effect of doing Great SLow-Jams.this is a must A.S.A.P.
,B00136LDQA,-1,1,5,I got this song for a power play list to charge my  work outs. When it was released in my aera it ws not to well known.
,B00136LCH0,1,1,5,I really like this song.
,B00136LCH0,1,1,5,"A perfect song to sing to your kids, especially if you have adopted.  So touching and sweet."
,B00136LCH0,-1,1,5,Wrote one
,B00136LCH0,-1,1,4,it's michael
,B00136LCH0,1,1,5,I love Michaels sincerity in this song. I can really appreciate his talent and vocal prowess in this song. It was always nice to hear him sing from theheart.
,B00136LCH0,1,1,5,"You Are Not Alone really means what the title says. When I listen to Michael sing the words of this song, it makes me feel connected to someone or to feel connected to myself. It is one of those songs that carries one away into a state of warmth & feeling loved. It is so beautiful & I love hearing Michael Jackson's voice singing it. Love & Miss You Michael. jkm"
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,good
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"hey it is ozzy, what can i say"
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,great
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"Another song added to my playlist for workout music, first part's done, now the real trick-getting back to Planet Fitness!"
,B00136LFHW,-1,1,5,"this song was kind of cool from back in it's time , but the live version is a little better than the studio version ."
,B00136LFHW,1,1,5,Highly recommend. Is a nice blast from the 80's past and reminds me of my college days!  Should be on anyone in that age bracket playlist.
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,"Great cd! I've always loved the Isley Brothers, one of my favorite groups of all time! Thanks for this great listening pleasure! So relaxing!"
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,Love it.
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"Nice greatest hits from Ozzy, definitely a must buy for a new Ozzy fan or someone wanted to collect all the top Ozzy hits."
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"Fantastic, cannot get enough of 80's hair bands! You will not regret this purchase. Takes you back to a time where music actually made sense and was worthwhile to listen to."
,B00136LFEA,1,1,4,You have to have Ozzy on the playlist.  This song is played at all of my college alumni football games and I had to have it to play around the house and drive my husband crazy.
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"Who can deny that is perhaps Ozzy's best song.  Great beat, no offensive language and rocking all the way through."
,B00136LFEA,1,1,5,"I always liked this song, even before it became a car commercial. Looking forward to the reformation of Black Sabbath despite the loss of it's heart."
,B00136LDQA,1,1,5,"""Smart and coy, a little crazy,
The kind of face that starts a fight...""

This song has quickly become one of my all time favorites!"
,B00136LDQA,1,1,5,"Kids getting into more and more of my music so downloaded this and they play it all the time.  Great album, brings back lots of memories"
,B00136LDQA,1,1,5,Survivor is one of the best bands of the 80s with so many great songs it's impossible to choose a favorite but this one is high on my list.
,B00136LDQA,1,1,5,"Love the 80s and this group is one of my favorites! I bought this on cassette first then on CD, never gets old to a real fan."
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,Most of the best songs are on here.
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,Outstanding Product and Excellent Customer Service
,B00136LCG6,-1,-1,3,one of mj;s best and creepiest sounding songs but hey mj was a weirdo and his lyrics shows but hey the world didn't care.
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,"I have always been a fan of Micheal's since I was a little girl.  Now my son actually requests this song calling it the ""Annie"" song!"
,B00136LEUA,1,1,5,Great cover song.  Used it for baptism
,B00136LEUA,1,1,5,great song.
,B00136JOSE,1,1,5,"The title track of Tunnel Of Love uses the classic amusement park ride as a way to examine his own marriage.  Just like the ride, marriage ought to be easy, ought to be simple enough, a man meets a woman and they fall in love.  But it's not that easy, there are bumps in the ride and sometimes it gets rough.  Mr. Springsteen's first marriage was failing at the time and the line it is easy for two people to lose each other is quite prophetic as the marriage ended up in divorce.  The music perfectly captures the carnival mood of the piece and Nils Lofgren's guitar solo cuts through the joyful sound like a razor blade acting as the tension that cuts through the rocky relationship. The song fades out with the recording of the sounds of a real roller coaster from Pt. Pleasant Beach, NJ."
,B00136JOYS,-1,-1,1,I downloaded the CD and still haven't been able to listen to the whole CD so I deleted it from my Library
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,I would to say I was very please with my order and hope to do business in the future.
,B00136JOYS,1,-1,3,I love the Isley brother music
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,"""love it!"""
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,Very good
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,"Isley Brothers is one of the best R & B groups of our time. From In Between The Sheets to Voyage to Atlantis ..All these classic songs brings such memories of quality music which is missing in today's artist and music. If you love a good song , amazing production and family of brothers that can hold a tune like no other this a great investment to have in your music collection."
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,A really nice album I especially like For The Love of You and Summer Breeze. Very Cool
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,ok
,B00136LCG6,1,-1,3,I enjoy listening to some of the old songs
,B00136LCG6,1,-1,3,More of his music to enjoy
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,Good product for the price.
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,All time favorites!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,B00136JS3U,1,1,5,"I've always enjoyed Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer's singing. The two of them in this duet makes for wonderful listening. Now I have captured Donna Summer forever. RIP, Donna.

Minnie E Miller, Author of Whispers from the Mirror and music lover."
,B00136JPIS,1,1,5,A favorite song.
,B00136JPIS,1,1,5,"I love this song!  Especially since it was played in a skit on SNL with James Brolin and Amy Poehler!  Every time I hear it, I think of James Brolin!"
,B00136JPIS,1,1,5,"I know it's an 'oldie' but it should still be played on every radio station in the US. Because, after all we are ALL no angels. (And the pic of Allman on the album cover is still AWESOME)"
,B00136JPIS,1,1,5,"I LOVE this song! REALLY great to hear it!  Very nostalgic. Reminds me of Summer time...""good times""...during my younger years. Nice!"
,B00136JPIS,-1,1,4,"Not that crazy about Allman's solo career, for the most part. This song was pretty good, though, so I bought it."
,B00136JPIS,1,1,5,Love this song. Glad I could find it again. Great addition to my kindle library. I listen to them at work.
,B00136LCG6,1,1,4,"No one does it like Michael.  This song has rhythm, a beat and is smooth on eh eardrums.  It makes you move your feet."
,B00136LCG6,1,1,4,It was great.
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,Who doesn't love all that is MJ
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,Always the greatest!
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,Who could NOT love a song by Michael Jackson.  I was happy to add this one to my song collection.
,B00136JPIS,-1,1,4,I heard it on the radio and thought it was decent.  Actually I thought I had been listening to Bob Segar or Joe cocker until I realized who the artist was.
,B00136JPIS,1,1,5,"With ""I'm No Angel"" Gregg Allman give us a pop/soul song that shows his vocal range and outstanding writing abilities. It's a sing-a-long classic that everyone will enjoy."
,B00136JPIS,1,1,5,My husband and I listened to this years ago when we were dating.  It is high quality sound and very good.
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,All the rolaz ( songs) are all good happy with the purchase it's stays playin on my Playlist repeat mode fosure
,B00136JSQ2,1,1,5,"Amazing song, beautiful voice, brought back lots of memories.  The movie was really good too.  You can never go wrong with Barbra."
,B00136JSQ2,1,1,5,"I love the movie and this song. Barbra sings without flaw at anytime.
I m glad I downloaded it. I can listen to it at anytime."
,B00136JSQ2,1,1,5,"I would recommend this product.  It is lovely, smooth and soothing to the senses.  I love Barbra Streisand's voice-great.  It is outstanding."
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,Good job.
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,"around the time I was 8 years old was when I first heard the song smooth criminal by Michael Jackson. I admit that smooth criminal by Michael Jackson has to be one of my favorite  Michael Jackson songs even though it does not get hardly any radio airplay like his other songs and my guess that the meaning of the song is controversial in itself. The online music video to the song is very good. From my perspective, smooth criminal by Michael Jackson plays with the idea of how innocence can be hardened and transform into something else completely under corrupt and/or hardened circumstances."
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,This song is one of a kind.  Hearing the music brings the visualization from the video.  One of Michael's best.
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio stations coming out of chicago. when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which as far as im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,"Great song, better movie and what a blast from the past.  Movies like this are fun and are not made today... to bad they would make money."
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,This is literally the song that was heard in the classic Smokey and the Bandit. A great song for country and western fans alike. It is a must have!
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Awesome music for a reasonable price without buying the whole album... what else can I say. Something to say about the digital age.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,4,"There is no question that Train has shown a strong return to the mainstream this past year as one of the strongest guilty pleasures of the past decade. While they just haven't had the definitive sales that have shown with their albums in awhile, they have made a good impact back into the light with Hey, Soul Sister from their new record Save Me, San Francisco. But, their classic songs still remain as distinctive as you could imagine like Drops Of Jupiter, their 2001 smash which is still as strong to listen to today, as it was when they Pat Monahan and company made it nearly a decade ago. So if you've loved Hey, Soul Sister, than add Drops Of Jupiter to your MP3 collection.

Song: B+"
,B00136JVM8,1,1,5,"it reminds me of the movie waynes world ,which was so dam funny and this song went w/ it perfectly"
,B00136JVM8,1,1,5,NO matter how hard I try I will NEVER be able to get the movie WAYNE'S WORLD out of my hear when I hear this song!
,B00136JVM8,1,1,4,"Classic song. This is going on my heavy metal / hard rock play list on my mp3 player. A must have! The song was featured on ""Wayne's World"""
,B00136JVM8,1,1,5,"I downloaded this one song because I heard it in a movie. The whole album is great. If you like ground pounding guitar and vocals, get it!"
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,Really happy the be able to play on my Kindle!  I can enjoy great music while playing a game or reading a book
,B00136LCG6,1,1,4,This is a good upbeat song with a really crazy story.  Michael Jackson was a strange one who exhibited questionable behavior but he was a musical genius
,B00136LCG6,1,1,4,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,"This song is so ""smooth!"" Smooth Criminal is one of Michael Jackson's best songs ever. The music video had some of his best dancing and the emotion he puts into his singing is off the radar."
,B00136LCG6,1,1,5,Excellent song. Love It much!!  Would recommend it to R&B lovers everywhere.  Really good price for for one great song.
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,I like this song and wanted it for my Kindle
,B00136LGIA,1,1,4,Smokey and the bandit theme song. Love it
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,"One of the best damn songs to grace this country's airwaves and highways. Always gets my diesel running and my thirst for beer into high gear. Hats off (for one thing only) to ol' Cledus Snow and Bo Darville for firmly inserting this masterpiece into American History for all time. Recalls memories of Trans Ams, hot pants, cheesy moustaches, large and small Enos's, and the all-important, all-American CB radio."
,B00136LGIA,1,1,4,good song
,B00136LGIA,1,1,4,Great music to drive with.
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,"Nobody does love songs like the Isley Brothers. I am sure that their music has played a major role in the population explosion between 1975 and the present. Seriously, this cd is synonymous with romance, and if that is your aim, then this is the cd to buy. You will not be disappointed. Much love."
,B00136LDKQ,-1,-1,1,"I'm sorry, but I cannot extend any tolerance towards a blatantly ripped off song. This song's verses sound EXACTLY like that Dobie Gray song ""Drift Away"". I don't ever want to hear this song in a store, or anywhere, ever again. I don't like writing negative reviews on this website anymore, but I'm sorry, this song is garbage, and I need to say something about it. It is one of those pieces of music that is every negative term I can think of. It's unoriginal, generic, and has a lackadaisical reason for existing. I like this style of music, but this is a song that infuriates me because it is so terrible."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Love this song.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,good song
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,4,Love it
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,4,pretty good
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,loved it
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Love this song
,B00136JV6Y,1,1,5,"Heard this song on AOL's Halloween station. Had to have it! Annie Lennox' voice makes this a beautiful, haunting love story that stays with you for a long time!"
,B00136JV6Y,1,1,5,I just love the name of this song. I was watching Dracula the other day and I am not one to watch the credits but the credits went on and on and then this song came on and I had to look it up because it had stuck in my head and would not go away.
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,I like it.
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,I'm very happy and satisfied!!
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,great - wish you could make your own samplers with individual songs - would be cheaper than buying individual songs  or buying an album for only one or two songs
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,"A stupid trucker song about moving beer across state lines. The fact that it's stupid is the greatest song about bootlegging ever. This was in the movie Smokey and the Bandit and in every scene it works. I love this song and I play it anytime I go east. I live in MN and our wimpy Governor thinks its so harmful to shoot off fireworks, so in honor of his stupidity I sing along with Jerry and change the lyrics to ...and there's fireworks in Wisconsin..."" Just a great stupid song the deserves a listen to when in the mood to go against the flow."
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,OK
,B00136LGIA,1,1,4,Love it
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,"Possibly one of the best soul groups in history, The Isley Brohters have countless music from a half century span of time.  My favorites of their work consist of their slow and slower mid-tempo love jams, which is why I am so into this love songs collective.  Most of my favorite songs like ""For The Love Of You,"" ""Between The Sheets,"" ""Footsteps In The Dark,"" ""Make Me Say It Again, Girl'"" and a personal fav, the spiritual and mystical ""Voyage to Atlantis,"" one of the best songs of any genre ever conceived.  Unfortunately, ""Caravan Of Love"" by Isley, Jasper, Isley is not here, perhaps for it not being a slower jam. Regardless, Love Songs is an awesome intro or reflective of the Isley family genius."
,B00136JOYS,1,1,5,"Ranging from major hits to obscurities, this album is about all the slow jams of the Isley Brothers; Quiet storm to raw classic soul; it's all there.
I am having difficulties removing this album from my CD player.

I've never been a big fan of the IB however, this album have surely made me think again.
Highly recommended."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Excellent
,B00136LDKQ,-1,1,4,Music
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Awesome! Exactly what I expected
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Good music.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Great!
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Love Train
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,A classic!
,B00136LGNK,1,1,5,This is a great song. I am glad that I bought it. When you hear a great song then you are able to bougth it that makes it more enjoyable to have. Love it.
,B00136LGNK,1,1,5,"Is it too soon to label this song a Country Classic?  It is humorous, danceable, and has been parodied endlessly (got to hand it to Cletus T. Judd for the best one).  Kenny's performance is firmly ensconced on my ""Rowdy Fun"" playlist for all my favorite Country vocalists.  It always gives me a smile on my lips and a bounce to my step.  Play it and allow your mood to rise like the diesel exhaust from a hot tractor!"
,B00136JOYS,-1,1,5,"This is actually more like a 4.5, and here's why:
Of the two widely recognized Isley Brothers slow jam compilations out - this one and 1994's ""Beautiful Ballads"" - both albums have monumental oversights.  One record (this one) is missing ""Choosey Lover"" and ""Don't Say Goodnight""; the other record (""Ballads"") is missing their best slow jam and one of the best slow jams ever, ""Sensuality"", as well as ""Groove With You"" and ""For the Love of You"", while replacing it with stuff like ""Caravan of Love"".  And NEITHER album has ""Let Me Down Easy"", but since that's more of a break-up song, you can sort of forgive the oversight.
Somewhere between these two albums is the best slow jam tape ever made.
Not that this one doesn't deserve 4.5 or even 5 stars despite this.  The other CD was lacking, in that it had items on it that weren't exactly ballad-like to compensate(!) for the above omissions.  This one is still a solid, 100% CD in and of itself that you never have to hit the ""Next Track"" button on.  it doesn't break mood, doesn't insert a jumpy dance groove in the middle of the rotation...it's exactly what it says it is and is exactly the way you want it to be.  It's practically been laid out with the ebb and flow of a night with your lover in mind.
Of the two albums, this one is superior, despite its own grievous ommissions."
,B00136JOYS,1,1,4,good cd I'd rather get the Isley brothers story for more of dat good classic stuff ron and his bros put out over the years.
,B00136LGIA,1,1,4,This was an essential purchase for a very special project of my oldest son.  He is in the process of restoreing a 1977 Trans AM and the music motivates him to complete some of long and tedious details of the project.
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,Good quality for such an older song.  Fit in well with the variety I wanted. Will consider getting more this way.
,B00136LGIA,1,1,5,"It in my opinion is the ""Smokey & The Bandit"" theme song!! Jerry Reed did his role in the films perfect for the story. Sadly many are probably not aware of the life of a Trucker in reality"
,B00136LHA2,1,1,5,needed to update my music catalog for my MPS player and can't do without this one.  Highly recommend this to anyone who likes this genre.  Missed listening to this for a long time.
,B00136LHA2,1,1,5,"This song is an L Cohen classic and I love every note and word of it. Some of the best poetry I've ever heard, Suzanne is a classic. The MP3 process couldn't be easier or more effortless."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,ok
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Another great song from Train.  Love this and work well in my play list when I ride.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,I knew this song would be # 1 as soon as I heard it!
,B00136LGNK,1,1,5,good
,B00136LGNK,1,1,4,"I do...I do...I do like Kenny Chesney on a tractor.  Yes, very sexy!!!"
,B00136LGNK,1,1,4,A fun country song with a little bit of Rock
,B00136LGNK,1,1,5,All good.
,B00136LGNK,1,-1,2,"I bought this song to add to a road trip playlist. I personally hate country music, but my buddy is a huge fan so I added it for him"
,B00136LHA2,1,1,5,"This is a classic and great for acoustic guitar, a nice song to learn technique on"
,B00136LHA2,-1,-1,2,bought this song a on accident thinking it was a different one. it's ok but kinda slow
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"The sound is not muffled. It's great to play, even over a speaker!"
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Love this song
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Simply great music!
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"Another great song, has some memories attached."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,The radio version has some awesome guitar parts not included here.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"This  song  just makes me feel good when I play it & sing along. It's on all my ""Good Day"" playlists."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,Drops of Jupiter is one of my favorite Train songs.  They are such a wonderful band and spread happiness!  This purchase was easy and went right to my Amazon Cloud.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,got this track because I liked it when I first heard it and its a great jam with the ladies
,B00136JMRW,1,1,4,A classic tune done in a way that only Johnny Cash can do it.  It has always been one of my favorites.
,B00136JMRW,1,1,4,I had to get it for my collection. He was a legion in that time. And put out some great classics.
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,"What more can I say than Johnny Cash singing about a lone cowboy getting a visit from Ghost Riders chasing the devil's herd. It's a song that brings up vivid images of the old west, the mysticism of the cowboy life as we think it was, while at the same time encouraging us to examine the path of our own lives. Many have recorded this song, but no one did it better than the Man In Black."
,B00136JMRW,1,1,4,I think this is a good copy of the song. Could not go wrong with this choice. Would recommend definitely.
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,"This song is too awesome for words,if you love ballads this is the one, his voice does this song like no other"
,B00136LITC,-1,-1,1,none
,B00136LITC,-1,1,5,A geat song
,B00136LITC,1,1,4,This song was great.
,B00136LITC,1,1,5,"The premier song by an American classic.  The song that set the background for a lot of people's,  of a ""certain"" age, lives."
,B00136LITC,-1,1,5,Sounds like the day it was first recorded. No updates like artists try to do and then you wish you had the one you remember.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"Just a great album, all the Train songs I want (at this time) at a good price.  Got to love the ease of access from cloud connection"
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"From their second album of same name, released in 2001, it went on to win a Grammy for Best Rock Song.  Reached #1 on US Adult Pop Songs and #5 on Billbord Hot 100."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"If you love Train, you will absolutely love this song!  It is one of the very best they have ever done!"
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"Love the song the lyrics are fantastic, it is one of those songs that you will be listening in the future and smile remembering the good day :)"
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,This song was the 1st Train song I ever heard. Has a great beat and I also listen to it while exercising and swimming laps in the pool.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"What do you say, If you like it buy it.  I like Train as well, calling all angels, etc.  download for movies and music is easy from amazon."
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,Good recording
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,Great song!
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,One of my favorite Johnny Cash songs...
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,Johnny has the best voice!
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,Classic
,B00136JMRW,1,1,4,Good song.
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,Great purchase!
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,Johnny Cash at his best!
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,5,"Wow!  John Denver wrote and sang this song for his wife. Sad that they eventually got divorced. I would love to have my husband sing this to me, but of course, he can't sing.  Recommend to all lovers...young or old."
,B00136JMRW,1,-1,3,It's wacky!
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,"I always loved this song, but as the lyrics say, ""if you want to save your soul from hell you better"".... you can't save your soul from hell, only Jesus can and that in itself changes your ways when you believe."
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,"My favorite version of this song, although the version I heard first was by the Outlaws, wayyyyyy back in the '80s or '90s. Cash's sandpapered voice perfectly captures the correct mood for this."
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,I love this Product! Arrived quickly. Will order again! Thx seller!
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,It's Johnny Cash...what else can you say.
,B00136JMRW,1,1,5,"Love Cash, i group up on this classic country song. brings back memories of riding in the back of a pick up truck from a rodeo. Can't beat an absolute classic artist singing a great song."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,This song was the first one that got me to really listen to Train and have been a huge fan ever since. Something about their style of music and of course couldn't ask for a better lead singer. His voice is awesome!
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"Nothing you can say but all good, Train continues to deliever the hits, Drops of jupiter proves it and even today with there newest music it proves that Train will continue to be a great band."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,4,How do you rate a song? If you didn't like the song you wouldn't download it right?? I mean really!!
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,I enjoy lots of music by Train and love that they are featured on a lot of shows I watch.
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"I must say,I heard this song on the radio and did not know who it was. I visited the radio stations'website to view the playlist and discovered the name of the band. Great song,bluesy, piano based,interesting lyrics."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES

GREAT  MUSIC  ! !

ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES.

A MUST HAVE IN ANY MUSIC COLLECTION."
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,years and years ago I.fell in love with this song and the group! still love both always will! bank on that
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,4,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,5,"Its my wife's and I favored song I call her Annie, her middle name is Annette."
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,5,"Though this song is approximately 40 years old, I listen to it over and over.  This is one of John Denver's best - it fits right in with his 70's style of soft vocals..... John Denver is truly one of the legendary singer/songwriters of all time - he's up there with John Lennon, Paul McCartmey, etc and his voice and style of singing will never die......"
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,4,Gift
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,5,I love this song. It is now in my video library. Thank you very much.
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,5,"i love the older music, so much better than the new junk"
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,5,Lost but not forgotten
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,4,Such a beautiful song sung by an exceptional voice.  Really miss him.
,B00136LIMO,1,1,5,this is a great song i am totally  happy with my purchase of this song it was a great deal had no problems
,B00136LDKQ,1,1,5,"Written about the death of a family member, this mellow pop tune really speaks to me. It's simply wonderful. I highly recommend listening to it."
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,4,"I know this song was written for his wife, but if you really listen to it, it can pertain to anyone or anything that makes you smile and laugh and cry....it's a beautiful song and makes me want to hug and kiss someone!"
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,4,"Honestly, I was never a huge fan of this song, the guys voice always seemed kind of whiney to me, but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song, one of his favorites, he thinks it's really romantic etc. . . . Not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so I decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix CD for Valentine's day. I've always known the lyrics were romantic, but they have more meaning for me now. Also, this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper versions. His voice doesn't bother me now. Just goes to show how important recording quality really is."
,B00136LHZ2,1,1,5,This is diffenitly a classic for me and fills out my music libary.  I love the sound of this singer.  A little old but a classic.
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,This song speaks for itself.  It is pleasant to hear and the vocals are outstanding.  I recommed this for to the blast from the past group who want to still enjoy the sounds.
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,I purchased this song to use on a video I made when my family and I went to Animal Treasures Park. It was perfect for what I needed.
,B00136LIMO,1,1,5,This song has a lot of meaning to it if you are older!! LOL
,B00136LIMO,1,1,5,"Gave five stars because I liked the song--first head it on our country/Western  radio station.  I kind of liked it and bought it to listen to whenever.  Not too big a fan of Johnny Paycheck, but he still deserves to be heard!"
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,What can I say this the Music I grew up on. Try it You'll Like
,B00136LFF4,1,1,4,I have the original vinyl 33 rpm version of this album with Take Five.  Have always loved it.  Just thought I'd download this as a portable version.
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,classic and a must have in anyone playlist
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,Excellent
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,"If you know the music, you love them."
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,classic
,B00136LEN2,1,1,5,Great addition to my Amazon music library
,B00136LEN2,1,1,5,"When I was in college this song came out and when I had a breakup with a boyfriend, I always listened to this."
,B00136LEN2,1,1,5,I love this old song.  It is haunting and emotional.  I recommend this fine tune to one and all.  I hope you enjoy it!
,B00136LEN2,1,1,4,"Music is personal. Yes, I am satisfied with this purchase. Search was easy, purchase was easy. Others will pick what they want to listen to."
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,"An oldie, but goody!"
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,Love this Music.
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,Another favorite oldie.
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,Played this for a Jungle Themed event in Cub Scouts - always a crowd pleaser.
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,great
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,I remember my mother playing this son as a kid....heard it again the other day and it immediately took me back to my childhood when my family gathered to listen to great music. Class song for the ages!
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,Drummer Joe Morello passed away just the other year. I bought Take Five (as the only know drum solo in 5/4 of any worth) to remember his solo...it is a textbook of perfection.
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,I've always enjoyed this song and am grateful I could find it as an MP3 selection. Time to listen again. Here I go!
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,who doesn't love this song?  It's a classic!!
,B00136LKMM,1,-1,2,OK
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,This is a must have in your music collection if you love music. You will fall in love with this.
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,Brubeck is a master and this is one of my favorite pieces of music.  I listen to it daily.  Love it
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,I love it and it was a great price. Brubeck is almost perfect on this album. I grew up with it as a kid and still love it.
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,"The tune Take Five is the definition of classic, popular jazz. Mellow. Brubeck. This album is awesome.  Our High School Jazz band teacher alway made sure we did at least a couple of Dave Brubeck tune's."
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,One of the coolest jazz classics ever to be recorded from a great group of talented musicians.  Definitely a must have for a jazz enthusiast.
,B00136LFF4,1,1,4,I just love this piecce of music it is so relaxing and enjoyable to listen to nice and mellow jazz.
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,"Was a download- worked well, even though some of my songs have something
wrong with them as in they don't finish playing, which drives me nuts."
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,love the song
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,"OLD FAVE, WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?"
,B00136LKMM,-1,1,5,I would give the Lion Sleeps Tonight 8 stars.  the high soprano voice boggles my mind.
,B00136LFF4,1,1,5,This is the most popular jazz recording of all time. It is recorded by an extremely influential jazz legend who recently passed away.
,B00136LFF4,1,1,4,"I've always liked Jazz - not as much as Rock, of course - and <i>Take Five</i> was always the top piece, in my opinion.  Jazz is supposed to be hot <i>and</i> cool, pick you up and calm you down, all at the same time.  <i>Take Five</i> did all that.  Dave Brubeck was a genius."
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,This is my husband's (of 54 yrs) all time favorite.  We both really enjoy it and after listening to it are humming it half the day. ( if you can picture that)  Brings back memories!
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,"I was still a kid when this came out and I remember it hit the top of the charts in something like a week. None us (and I mean American teenagers) had ever heard anything like this. In later years I learned it was sort of a rock-version ripoff of a classic African folk tone, which of course makes sense. No matter, though, because being a universal language, music belongs to the world. There is so much going on in this arrangement, and it all fits together so perfectly, that you have to listen to it over and over to begin to pick up everything that's going, from the harmonies and little vocal touches and phrasings, to that incredible female background soprano, which I sounds almost like a Theramin, one of the first electronic instruments. The woman never got credit as far as I know, which is a shame because she just carries the song to incredible heights."
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,"I heard this in yoga last week and it reminded me how much I loved this old favorite! This is the original that came out on the radio around 71, Great song."
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,This is such a fun song and totally clean so I'm not worried about my child repeating any of the words.
,B00136LKMM,1,1,5,"I will always hold this song very dear to my heart, We lost our oldest son when he was 21. That was his favorite song. We always knew when he was close to or at home because he played this song all the time and blaring. lol"
,B00136JWRW,1,1,5,"Total classic!!!!!
This is an all time favorite. The song relays the most memorable message- Sweet Baby. I am a fan of Clarke & Duke."
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,Dido put a lot of love in her songs. She has a lot of soul. Like an R & B singer. You can feel what she is trying to express in her songs. I really love the way she sings. My CD was destroyed in an house flood so I am glad to have this song again.
,B00136LJO6,1,1,4,I remember when it was on the radio and it always made me feel happy to hear it.  I thought it was time to break down and buy it for my Kindle music!  I enjoy it everytime I play it.
,B00136LIBK,-1,-1,3,"Its a great song don't get me wrong, I loved it when it first came out, and hadn't heard it in a while and I bought it for my Love Songs playlist, and it just didn't fit the vibe I was going for."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,4,"Very Nice Country Slow Tune, Good For Dancing And Will Continue To Buy These Tunes From Lonestar. There Still a Good Old Country Band."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,4,"Have not listened to this group much but am ""amazed"" on how much I enjoy it.  Thank you for the 69 cent deal on this one!"
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music
,B00136LI4W,1,1,5,"Great for making love, relaxing while reading or cooking, or a lovers' dance!  Very peaceful and relaxing.  I would definitely buy any of his music!  A+ for me!"
,B00136LI4W,1,1,5,"I love Kenny G's music, really mellows me out, old computer crashed and am building my collection back.  His sound is so smooth."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,"This was my song that my husband fell in love with. We eventually claimed it as ""Our Song"". He passed away May 2015. I still have the song to remember the good times with."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,One of my favorite love songs!
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,Great Song!
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,liked the song
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,really really good song.  heard it on the ending credits of a movie and just had to get it right away.
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,I was pleased with the product.
,B00136LJO6,1,1,4,good song
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,So pretty
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,"Have missed this song. I would recommend this song for your library, it's got great lyrics, rhythm and beat."
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,love her music
,B00136LLZ8,1,1,5,"Thanks Alan, brings back memories of Dad and that 68 Chevy that smoked."
,B00136LLZ8,1,1,5,like it
,B00136LLZ8,1,1,5,All good.
,B00136LL6C,1,1,5,"I have found other renditions of Jimi Hendrix songs disappointing, even those done by the best.  Stevie Ray's ""Little Wing"" is much more than mere mimicry.  He has obviously studied Hendrix with great patience and talent.  He plays one of my favorite Hendrix pieces with incredible reverence and unmatched style.  He has played ""Hendrix"" and added his own personal tribute.  We have suffered the untimely loss of two great guitarists."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,4,"Nice song that is performed well by this group. I think I like other versions better, but it is still a strong performance."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,"I'm not a big country fan, but I do like a few songs and a few bands. This is one band that I have had the privilege of meeting and helping out when I was working at a hotel as a front desk clerk a couple decades ago when they were first starting out. These gentlemen were very nice, considering the hotel that had originally had them booked at were overbooked and they got bumped into the smaller hotel that I was working in at the time. Their calm down to earth personality helped to break my rock and roll soul down long enough to listen to this song and fall in love with it. Nearly 20 years later it's still my favorite song of theirs."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,4,just a great song at a great price. this is one of those songs that just make you feel like chilling and have a glass of wine.
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,I love this song.  It may be an oldie but certainly a goodie! This is  My favorite Lonestar song ever.
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,"The song, ""Amazed"" is yet another wonderful tune by the amazing Lonestar. It is something that will touch everyone's soul!"
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,"LONESTAR IS A GREAT GROUP. LOVE THEIR MUSIC, BUT THIS SONG HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE OF ALL THEY DID, HAD TO HAVE IT ON MY MP3"
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,Oldie but goody.
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,"This is a song every one can sing to, with, and feel good. A song 'about' felling good, and being in the groove when you sing it."
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,Love this song. It is now in my frequently listened to playlist. I'm not sure that I'm necessarily a fan of Dido but I do seem to like many of her songs.
,B00136LJO6,-1,-1,1,"heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping. it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review. i guess it's perfect for a furniture store: bland, generic, and soporific"
,B00136LJO6,1,1,5,"This song has so much value 10 years later.  The music, the softness the lyrics...oh to replay over and over again."
,B00136LIBK,-1,-1,1,"If I was having myself a bowel movement at a b-bq joint in Anytown, USA and this came on mid movement, i'd committ Hari Kari. it's that terrible. this makes Shania Twain sound like Mozart."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,"This is a beautiful song by Lonestar, one of their country ballads.  This band has been around for a long time and this is one of their most well known songs."
,B00136LIBK,1,1,5,Bought this because Amazon has the best prices. I did not want to purchase the entire disk just certain songs so this worked out for me.
,B00136LIBK,-1,1,5,This is an oldie but a goodie. I like being able to buy only the songs that I like and not spend money on full cds.
,B00136LG58,1,1,4,"Taking me back to middle school, the skating rink- and my not skating. Enjoyed the hell out of the music, though."
,B00136LG58,1,1,5,"Brought back many memories from high school! the dances, the clothes. the boys, and the sound of the music Thanks!"
,B00136LL6C,1,1,5,One of my favorites.
,B00136LL6C,1,1,5,"Great take on an old standard.  It's much more polished and shows SRV's mastery of the guitar but of course lacks the pure raw energy (and noise) of the original.  My personal favorite out of all the other covers (Derek and the Dominos, Sting to mention a couple).  I love the different bell like tones he pulls out of his Strat and the single coil pickups."
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,"This Christmas song takes me back to the days of my youth. It is a sad, reflective song about a chance meeting with an ex lover. I was going through a tough patch when this was first released and cherish the emotions that this song brings up. I've been searching for a long time to add this song to my Christmas music collection but didn't know the title or artist until I finally did an internet search and stumbled across this song. Thank you Amazon!"
,B00136LF54,1,1,5,love it
,B00136LF54,1,1,5,"I played this song so much I think my phone sometimes skips it so that it won't play it, but still love her voice and songs."
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,Thank you
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,"Have always loved this song. Could happen to anyone of us. In fact, I've run into old girlfriends on many occasions. And, much like the song suggests, I came out miles ahead! Sadly, Dan passed away far to early but he's singing in heaven now. Truly gifted artist. RIP Dan!"
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,Love the album
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,Great song!
,B00136LNOW,1,1,4,"I have most of his song, but I needed to get them on my computer and player.
I couldn't pass this one up."
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,one song...love me some Keith Whitley....wish I had bought the entire CD. He was just too young to die. Miss him!
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,It's been a long time since this song was released and as far as I am concerned it is still great!
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,"Beautiful song. It saddens you when you hear the song and look at the ""Innocent Age"" album cover. Find it and you will understand."
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,Great song!
,B00136LECS,-1,1,5,Can't say much. I was just looking for some digital music to add to my collection. Np problems
,B00136LECS,-1,1,5,Can't say much. I was just looking for some digital music to add to my collection. Np problems
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,Nuff said. You cannot have a good music collection without a little bit of Ted. I have all of his titles in vinyl and just wanted a few on the MP3 player. I can always count on Amazon to have the song I just have to hear now!
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,"Have listened to this  song, since the days of my 8 track player & cruising Gratiot.

the Guitar & Derek St. Holmes on vocals  is a killer song.

I Love doing  cardio or curls to this 1"
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,8 minutes of the Nuge! Good guitar and vocals.  This is why he was the alpha is his band. This is a classic and it is timeless!
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,Keith Whitley was an original. Too bad he left this world so soon!
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,One of the best love songs...ever...
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,Great song.  Nice slowdown song for couples.

,B00136LECS,1,1,5,great
,B00136LFUO,1,1,5,"A great song. Great words, great driving guitars, too. It has a great beat and is easy to listen to."
,B00136LFUO,1,1,5,"""Drive"" by Incubus is a very inspirational song about embracing all facets of life.  I enjoy listening to ""Drive"" because it helps remind me to have self-confidence and emotional strength at all times.  The fact that the singer admits to feeling fear, but imagines how life would be like through a happier perspective is musically therapeutic to me.  ""Drive"" is best for anyone that craves musical tracks about making the best of life regardless of the external circumstances that may emerge."
,B00136LIFQ,1,1,5,A beautiful song by Perry Como one from late in his life. A song for a fan for shore a love song well done

,B00136LECS,1,1,4,"This is an oldie but goody that I love to sing along to. He's got a great voice, and I like the story of the song - running into someone from a long time ago, and wondering, for a moment, what might have been."
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,I love this song.

,B00136J9FM,1,1,5,"Do not usually write reviews for music.  I either like it or not, and never try to figure out why.  Still, I really like this song.  Never heard of Crossfade until recently.  Will look for more..."
,B00136J9FM,1,1,5,"I purchased and rated it because it is a great song, I highly recommend it to those who like Rock."

,B00136LFUO,1,1,4,Awesome song!
,B00136LFUO,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorite songs from the year 2000. I think this song combines a catchy pop sensibility with a modern, hip-hop feel. A great song by a talented band."
,B00136LFUO,1,1,5,Love this song...
,B00136LFUO,1,1,5,"I hear a blend of jazz and hard rock, with a thin vein of the group America. These guys are like people reborn from another time, as their lyrics suggest it heavily."
,B00136LFUO,1,1,4,Love these guys.
,B00136LFUO,1,1,5,Love this song.
,B00136LFUO,-1,1,5,"While driving, this one is the song."
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,Brings back so many wonderful memories.  Introduced this as a first  of many to someone who has never heard of John Denver.
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,Just exactly what you would expect from John Denver...this one never gets old and is as beautiful and wistful as ever..
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,I have always liked John Denver's music and Annie's song is one of my very favorites. I play it often.
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,"This song brings back so many memories of my youth. Now older, the lyrics are so meaningful. One of a kind."

,B00136LECS,-1,1,4,"A radio station that I used to listen to in Tampa would play nothing but Christmas music from the day after Thanksgiving until December 26. This was one of their Christmas songs. The song tells a story about the singer meeting an old lover at a record store. The story takes place at Christmas time but otherwise has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas! This song has more to do with regrets over missed opportunities. I like it, but Dan Fogelberg has done better songs.

,B00136LECS,1,1,5,"Poignant. Heart wrenching. A beautiful song about the inevitable march of time, fading memories and the love that never ends. For those of us still enamored by our first loves, this song will forever be a tear filled reminder of days gone by."
,B00136LECS,1,1,4,"Such a lovely, poignant tale of the meeting of former lovers years later. The lyrics are relatable & the tune is mournful & joyful at the same time."
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,One of the Greatest country songs ever! A must own
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,"I CHOSE THIS ALBUM,ITS EASY LISTENING. HE WAS ARE GOOD ARTIST, UNFORTUNATLY NOTORIATY WASNT UNTIL HIS PASSING. I WOULD RECOMMEND HIS MUSIC."
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,We lost this wonderful country singer way too young ... his songs calm the soul and lift your spirits.  He will be missed.
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,"If you want a great country song , this is one of his best. He was one of the best."
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,"Everything about the song is good.  The lyrics, arrangement, and the artist.  Its song with passion giving you a visual of what is being felt."
,B00136LNOW,-1,1,5,Very moving song.  It's sad to think how his own life ended.  Alcoholism robs so many people of their futures.
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,Love Keith Whitley.  This is a great song.  Would highly recommend. Beautiful love song.  Love his whole album and others as well.
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,"I have loved Country music for years and when the opportunity came up for me to buy a song from what i consider to be one of the best traditional country artists, I did not hesitate! Keith's soft and warm voice on this song makes me realize why I am a fan of his!"
,B00136LFUO,1,1,5,Drive - Incubus great tune!
,B00136LFUO,1,1,5,Can't seem to get enough of this song... Such a catchy tune... Great sound style and vocals. The lyrics are sooo hauntingly True!

,B00136J9FM,1,1,4,"Great album, would highly recommend to fans"
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,Listened to and loved John Denver music as a kid in the 70's. Great addition to any digital music library. True beautiful classic.
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,Denver is sadly missed. This song was such a big hit for him and I really did use it at my wedding!!
,B00136LCBG,1,1,5,"I LOVE TO HERE JOHN DENVER SING
 HE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT SINGERS OF HIS TIME
 I HOPE HIS SONG S WILL BE HERE FOR YEARS TO COME"
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,"Don't close your eyes by Keith Whitley has grown to be a song that I loved to hear over and over.  His voice
 soft, sad, and yet almost like a lullabye.. this to me is one of his best, he has many others, this is my most
 cherished of his songs he's left us with."
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,"Love this song and who does not love Keith Whitley!!! He was one of the greatest!!!!  Sorry he is gone, but we still have his music ."
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,Nothing like the classics. Love these old songs. Brings back memories of growing up. Cold coke and peanuts. Sultry summer nights.
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,"This downloaded perfect and conveniently to my Kindle... love this song!  Would recommend it to friends and family.  You get it ""on the spot""!"
,B00136LNOW,1,1,5,"It's just pure country music. No one can sing this song better than Keith Whitley. If you love the country music, then this song needs to be in your collection."
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,5,LOVE IT
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,5,ok
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,5,John Denver and his accompanying musicians are excellent. The recording is clear and well done.
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,5,I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,5,ok
,B00136LH8Y,-1,1,4,This is another one of Denver's classics.
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,4,"This is the song from the 70's that you may or may not remember. I was stoned when I ordered this, so it actually sounded better at the time. Next time you smoke pot, be sure that you have ""One-Click purchase on, and you will have plenty of America and John Denver songs on your hard drive!"
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,5,one of my all time favorites. 1 the best singers there ever was. I have all his songs but I wanted I'm on my phone too specially this one
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,I really love this song and at the same time it is hard to listen to knowing Dan has passed on. I found it interesting that after his death the woman he wrote about in the song came forward. It adds a more personal touch to the song.
,B00136LECS,-1,1,5,"I had been hearing this song on the radio at Christmas time.  It is a pretty and catchy song about two old lovers who accidentally meet in a grocery and wind up spending the evening together discussing old times and where they are now.  Neither of them are really happy with their lives, but in the end they say goodbye again."
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,"Beautiful, beautiful song that bring tears to my eyes every time I hear it. It tells the story of former lovers who meet again on Christmas Eve many years later. They share an hour or so together drinking a 6 pack in her car catching up on their lives but neither one reveals everything or the True picture of their current lives. After they've said all they've had to say, they part ways and go on with their lives. Many of us have been in a similar position and can relate to the characters. A timeless classic."
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,"I remember the piece wistfully, remember where I was when I first heard it, and remember my own past everytime I listen again and again. And I love that I can immediately download and listen  when I get the feeling. It's that time of year. He's gone now, but left us some good  nostalgic listening."
,B00136LECS,1,1,5,I have always loved this song and its hard to find so I downloaded to my kindle fire and now I can listen to it anytime that I want!
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,One of my faves from my youth. Heard it on the radio and was reminded how much I like it.
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,Great
,B00136LMA2,1,-1,3,"Is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is mimicking the vibe of Santana's Black Magic Woman? When I was a kid and didn't know who ELO was, I thought this was a Santana song. Always reminds me of the scene in Austin Powers where Dr Evil falls in love."
,B00136LMA2,1,1,5,ELO classic song.
,B00136LMA2,1,1,5,A dance classic for anyone around in the 60's..
,B00136LMA2,1,1,4,"I've been a fan of Elo ever since the 70s.  To this day they still have one of the most unique sounds out of any band that has ever existed.  Oh, and this song, in my opinion, is definitely one of their better ones.  Great!"
,B00136LMA2,1,1,5,I simply love the music of Electric Light Orchestra. I most of their music is classic stuff and you won't find it anywhere. I definitely would recommend for your collection the whole album.
,B00136LMA2,1,1,4,"I like Evil Woman, but I'm trying to think what other songs the ELO did. If you can send me something to let me know what other songs they did, I's appreciate it."
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,5,"Sunshine on my shoulders make me high.
Sunshine in my eyes makes me cry. If I had a day to give to you"
,B00136LH8Y,1,1,5,I love all John Denver's music and songs. He inspired me all the time as God inspired me to sing too!
,B00136LH8Y,-1,1,5,I did not like his music at first but when i heard sunshine I realized he made more  records then rocky mt high  so Im a huge fan adn he also made a movie  that he sang this song it was to a little girl and it was a sad movie so Now i have to fiand this movie .
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,This is great... love this
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,The best song he ever did IMHO. Love the riffs.
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,"Gotta be one of his top 3 in my book, probably my favorite.  A True timeless classic with aggressive lyrics, way ahead of its time."
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,They're gonna play this at my funeral! lol! I love this song! This is the kind of song you party to lmao!
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,"This song is very instrumental, and will give you a pick up no matter what your mood is. The best way to listen to this is to either wear headphones or blast it in your house. Although; using headphones you can hear all of the nuances better. Just make sure it is cranked up."
,B00136LIAG,-1,-1,1,"I will be completely honest with you, I am not a Kelly Clarkson fan!  This was a purchase for my wife who loves this song so..."
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,Have enjoyed listening to this song of Kelly Clarkson's over and over again.  She is so talented. Have many of her songs.  I enjoy listening to them on my way into work.
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,KELLY IS THE NEW AGE QUEEN OF MUSIC. HER VOICE IS PERFECTION AT ITS BEST. LIVE OR ON RECORD. ANY DOUBTERS? GO LISTEN TO MILEY CYRUS
,B00136LIAG,-1,-1,1,"Alright, listen to the lyrics for this one. First of all, I can't tell whether this is about a boy she has serious anger issues with, or whether this is about a child-abuser. The latter would make the song more powerful in a lyrical sense, the former on the other hand, would just make the song wrong all the world around. But, in either case, Clarkson does a poor vocal performance here, and somebody totally messed up on giving this song a tune. It's so bad, it verges on mind-numbing, and annoying. And after you've heard the song ten times on radio, in the same morning, you'll verge on convulsions and other serious medical and mental issues. Yes, it's that bad.

Oh by the way, Reba didn't help the song any. In fact, she just made it worse, as if that was even possible. In fact, that version could be the worst excuse for a duet I've ever heard. In either case, with either song, don't buy it. Keep your sanity, and keep your ears."
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,I always like this song so I bought it . I have had very good luck with all my amazon songs they sound great.
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,"Will definitely down ALL of my favorite music instead of buying the album, CD etc.  Very easy to download with click of a couple of buttons."
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,Love this song!  I like the length and especially the bass line.  It really ironically relaxes me i listen to it while driving.
,B00136LMJ8,1,1,5,"Although I've heard of Ted Nugent for a long time, I had never heard his music.
I happened to hear this track on my local classic rock radio station and instantly
fell in love with this track and knew I had to have it!  I am someone who loves most
music ranging from classical to some hard rock, depending on my mood, and this
track blew me away.  It's loud with awesome electric guitar, but not overly overdone
as some electric guitar can be.  I would put Ted Nugent's talent with the guitar on
the same level as Carlos Santana whose music I absolutely love.  I highly recommend
this track to all rockers out there!"
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,Love it
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,Songs good
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,Good song
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,This is just the song that takes me back 20+ years to a time where you played it so much it's permanently engraved in your memory.  Joyful!
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,"Back in the 70's September is a love son que a todos les gusta amazon tiene de todo para todos ,los gustos"
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,This is my go to song when I need a boost...especially during one of my long runs. Brings back great memories!
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,"The band ""EARTH WIND AND FIRE"" made quite a mark on the ""OLDSKOOL"" ""R&B"" and ""SOUL"" music genres with such songs as ""FANTASY"" and many other great hits!!!.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for any type of ""OLDSKOOL"" Music, especially ""R&B"" and ""SOUL"" Music of the 1970s/1980s!!!."
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,Their music will last for generations.  There music will last for generations.  They are one of a kind.  Their music has been the inspiration for the music industry.
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,"A great going in the car......song.  The lyrics just let your mind wander

and the song build up is one of Earth, wind and Fire's better choices"
,B00136LOFK,1,1,5,I recommend this product.
,B00136LOFK,1,1,5,great
,B00136LOFK,1,1,5,This song still brings tears to my eyes; even after all these years.
,B00136LOFK,1,1,5,It was great. Not a single problem when it was downloaded. I will give this a one hundred percent great download.
,B00136JXWQ,-1,1,5,Truly missed!
,B00136JXWQ,1,1,5,Good music!!!!
,B00136JXWQ,-1,1,4,rest in peace teena marie love your stuff but tended to like the stuff that was not played on the radio
,B00136JXWQ,1,1,5,I had just purchased Sapphire and a Ultimate Collection cd for Teena Marie. I just wanted this song to round out my collection.
,B00136LIAG,1,1,4,"This particular song by Kelly Clarkson of American Idol fame is very likeable and one of her best offerings. Another that I previewed which grabbed me is her song ""A moment like this"" which I loved greatly. I highly recommend these two songs as they are her best."
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,Great Music! Glad I can buy only the Tracks I want
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136LIAG,1,1,4,It's a great song. I would say that its about it but have to write a long review as to why I like the song lol
,B00136LIAG,-1,-1,1,"This song is boring, unenergetic, and as generic as you can get. Just overproduced crap made to cater to boring-a$$ FM radio easy-listening for doctor's offices format."
,B00136LIAG,1,1,4,nice download easy to use..would recommend to anyone..can't go wrong with kelly she is a great singer..check her out..yes go for it..
,B00136LP22,1,1,5,"this is a classic from a legendary singer with a very special voice,this is one of her biggest hits and I think you will enjoy it!!!!!!"
,B00136LP22,1,1,5,Denise Williams has an elegant smooth relaxing voice and I just love all her music. Listen to. Free daily especially after a stressed filled day at work.
,B00136LP22,1,1,5,Denise was the music to listen in the 70's fast and slow jams but her voice is just beautiful.  R&B music
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,My favorite of Kelly Clarkson's: it is so nice just to be able to buy one song instead of a whole album.  I downloaded this to my Cloud player.
,B00136LIAG,1,1,5,"I loved Kelly from American Idol, but don't listen to much of her music. She sang this when she appeared as a guest on Amer Idol and I loved it so I added to my rock playlist."
,B00136LIAG,-1,1,5,"I wrote the heading but what this song does for me is makes me know why it is so hard to say ""HI"". In the other way I think of her saying this song to me. Since I have been holding on too long."
,B00136LJ9Q,1,1,5,"Clint Black is one of the True great country artists...this song is one that proves that!!!
I loved the song from start to finish!"
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,Excellent song
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,I have always loved this band.  I always dance to this song when it comes on.  Had to have it for myself. :)
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,"What can you say about these guys, excellent!"
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,classic good music
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,This song always puts me in the best mood. It makes you feel like the world is your oyster.
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,Can't stop listening to good quality music.
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,5,Earth Wind and Fire can sing just about anything.  I am such a fan.  This was a great album.
,B00136LIZ6,1,1,4,replacing old LP and cassette music with MP3 or CD.  I like the MP3 option since many CDs (albums) only contain a couple keepworthy songs.
,B00136LR84,-1,1,5,An excellent purchase.  Definitely not a waste of time or money.
,B00136LR84,1,1,5,one of the best i love that song
,B00136LR84,1,1,4,great song
,B00136LR84,1,1,5,"When you speak of Johnny Cash you know it is going to be a good remark, as he was one of our bests in country music. A must have."
,B00136LR84,1,1,5,"Good tune, but i've noticed most of Johnny Cash's songs are excellent, and it's so nice to hear him paired up with so much duet talent....."
,B00136LR84,1,1,5,"I love this song, i just watched the movie walk the line and had to get it for my kindle!"
,B00136LJ1E,1,1,5,"This is a Fantastic song that reminds me of days gone by. I highly recommend any music by Earth, Wind & Fire."
,B00136LJ1E,1,1,5,I always loved this song. It moves me deeply emotionally and I never get tired of it. One of my favorite songs.
,B00136LJ1E,1,1,5,"What can you say about EWF, always good music for any age group, It takes me back to the 80's!"
,B00136LJ1E,1,1,5,"I have always loved Earth, Wind and Fire. It's telling us we can't change the world but learn to live in it."
,B00136LIGA,1,1,5,"This, of course, us a great song, but also a great download! The quality is outstanding, and better even than the cd I own... I own an original copy if the album, but when ever I burned it to my computer, the quality was just never very impressive, so I decided to buy the mp3, and was very impressed!!! Much better!"
,B00136LIGA,1,1,5,GOOD
,B00136LIGA,1,1,5,Great Song
,B00136LIGA,1,1,5,Great product at a great price! Fantastically digital download was fast and at a low cost! I would recommend this to anyone.
,B00136LIGA,1,1,5,It has the most original beautiful soul serving music. Billy Joel is unique and his music will inspire you to relax and love lif.
,B00136LQC6,-1,1,5,"The quality of the MP3 doesn't do it justice though because it would have been better if it was a WAV file. But nevertheless, I will always love this song which is why I gave it 5 stars."
,B00136LQC6,1,1,5,"One of Michael's good ones which I always enjoyed listening to.  Nice, easy sound.  I play it from my cloud player on my Kindle while Im on my computer.  Love it"
,B00136LM0C,1,1,5,Lifetime ELO fan.  Great tune to sing to while driving
,B00136LM0C,1,1,5,Even 'old' songs can give a fresh perspective. ELO's timeless piece still hits me in the muse.
,B00136LM0C,1,1,5,Great music.
,B00136LM8E,1,1,5,"Talk about upbeat, dancing, and if you search video on youtube, you'll see the J5 dancing to it.  If you need to forget about your troubles and a lift, this is a great song.  RIP MJ"
,B00136LM8E,1,1,5,"""Sunshine. (Oooh). Moonlight. (Yeaahh). Good times.(Mmmmm). Boogie. You just got ta....."" With the Tito's guitar riff at the beginning that repeats itself much later, Blame It on the Boogie is a dance groove personified that is so electric you can't help but GET UP to GET DOWN! Even after Jermaine departed, Michael continued to help spearhead the assault with pulse pounding hits like this! Just like the lyrics say, ""I just can't, I just can't, I just can't control my feet!"" ""Yeaaah, Woooo!"" It's no wonder that after he went solo, Michael's stardom would reach unprecedented heights, so ""don't blame it on the sunshine, don't blame it on the moonlight, don't blame it on the good times, Blame It on the Boogie."""
,B00136LM8E,1,1,5,"This song is an oldie and a goodie!  Great, fun vibe to it and catchy lyrics.  Classic Jackson 5 with MJ!"
,B00136LPOU,1,1,5,Great Oldie
,B00136LPOU,1,1,4,"I purchased this song, because I love Toto's music. When they were really popular they had numerous hit's including Africa, and this one. Hold the Line is more of a rock hit from the late 70's. It's a tough song that gets to the point, this song was constantly played when I was growing up. It never got old, Hold the Line, Love Isn't Always  On Time famous lyric from the song. Another B***S TO THE WALL SONG, get it because it's a classic."
,B00136LPOU,1,1,5,Greatly expressed song about long for  romantic love or love of any kind.
,B00136LPOU,1,1,4,"Classic Toto. Good lyrics, good rhythm and good beat. Must hear if you like this era in rock."
,B00136LPOU,1,1,5,I've always liked Toto because of their diversity and talent. I am mainly a rocker so this song is awesome. As a guitarist thumbs up on the solo.
,B00136LPOU,1,1,5,Love this Music.
,B00136LPOU,1,1,5,Great song!

,B00136JOVG,1,1,4,"When it comes down great guilty pleasure artists, we often seem to forget what influence they've made on music today, especially back in the 80's. For those acts, we always will think of Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince. But, for Billy Joel, he really made the best that was still coming around. 35 years after he broke ground with Piano Man, he has still dominated with his music on the radio. While he hasn't recorded an album since 1993's River Of Dreams, his music still stands the test of time because it is worth while from beginning to end. But for those who seem more interested in acts like Britney Spears and anyone who has been on American Idol, and doesn't own a Billy Hoel record, than this is a start to download for your MP3 player.

The Essential Billy Joel is a collection of over 30 tracks from Billy's long and successful career from the 70's, 80's and 90's. The songs here have all been remastered well, and chronicle a innocent man who has made the music of our times. The collection includes a lot of great standards he has made his own for over 35 years like Piano Man, River Of Dreams, We Didn't Start The Fire, the delight diddy Uptown Girl, and The Longest Time, all the way to #1 hits like My Life, It's Still Rock N' Roll To Me and Allentown. There is so much that is great in music, but there are a few of his great songs that were sadly overlooked like You're Only Human (Second Wind), Modern Woman and a few other good songs. But, those are small complaints, because those songs were only minor hits. Instead, the collectin includes some of his songs from his 2001 classical pop album instead.

All in all, The Essential Billy Joel is a very strong and standard greatest hits album from beginning to end that is fun and a joy to listen to, whether you're a hard core fan, or anyone who is new to Billy Joel's songs. This album is definitely a great purchase to download off the internet, or buy from your local record store. Even though Billy Joel hasn't made anything new in awhile, his music is still making us go to extremes.

,B00136LQC6,1,1,5,"I can still see Michael Jackson's music video, whenever I hear this. I miss him terribly. He was truly a gift not to be duplicated."
,B00136LQC6,1,1,5,Always have been a fan of Michael Jackson's music. This is just another one of his classic hits! The music is filled with passion.
,B00136LQC6,1,1,4,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
,B00136LRXO,1,1,5,"Anyone who's had children or pets to sing to sleep will love this song. It is moving and speaks of you, your children and their children. It is more powerful than his other songs like I love you just the way you are."
,B00136JMH2,1,1,4,"A well known ballad or two, banging Southern production and mounds of lyrical swagger."
,B00136JMH2,1,1,4,"The title was taken from the bumping track ""Front, Back, & Side To Side"". I purchased an old The Source magazine from December 1994 and saw that was a track for one of their Sure Hot Singles back in the day. Thing was I never paid too much attention to UGK, except for a few songs here and there. Then ended up being the laughing stock at my job, because I told them that I'm from the A, their recent album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underground-Kingz/dp/B000K7UFL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underground Kingz</a>&nbsp;was the only album I owned. So I ended up buying this the very next day.

Super Tight is a very southern style album. Both Bun B and Pimp C sound way different back in '94, than they do today. A lot of tracks would bump today as they did back then. ""It's Supposed To Bubble"" is one of them. Bun B drops a solo track ""Feds In Town"" which sounds real good. ""Pocket Full Of Stones 2"" and ""Protect & Serve"" are other good songs. ""Stoned Junkee"" is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and features 3-2. The final track ""Three Sixteens"" featuring DJ DMD is a very good way to close out the album.

Super Tight is an excellent album. Some of the production sounds dated (although I have to give mad props to Pimp C for his production), but it still bumps here today. It's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar, especially when other albums from the south such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik/dp/B0000013GB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Diary/dp/B000000W6Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Diary</a>&nbsp;dropped the same year. But if you're a fan of 90's southern rap (mainly groups like E.S.G., UGK, or anyone from Rap-A-Lot), don't hesitate to get this album. I used to live in San Antonio during my high school days ('00-'04), and this album reminds me so much of how it was down there in Texas. Peace!

,B00136JMH2,1,1,5,"Pimp C and Bun B came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire.  This album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel.  The beats are melodic G-Funk, with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs.  Lyrically and vocally, UGK kills in all departments.  They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows. The track ""Feds in Town"" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. ""Super Tight..."" is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue. The mid 90's was one of the best periods in rap history, and this album is testament to it.  Don't sleep on this classic."
,B00136JMH2,1,1,5,"The boyz from Port Arthur return after 2 years for their 2nd group album, and their 2nd best album.  Only 11 songs but no weak point, 1 classic, 2 almost classics, 2 are ok, and the rest are good or great songs.  Guests are on 3 of the 11 songs.  As usual for a UGK album, the production is great and handled mostly by Pimp C (9 songs) and DJ DMD does the other 2.  They show why they're the best group to come out of the south on this one and especially with their ""Ridin Dirty"" album.  A must have, great album!!

#1 - 10 (CLASSIC hardcore song w/ great beat -- just over 2 minutes)

,B00136LOU0,1,1,4,"Good song to ride in the car listening to... road trip anyone! Heatwave had a lot of good songs from the 1970's, this one is laid back and mellow!"
,B00136LOU0,1,1,4,heard the short version on the radio recently and took me way back to the local disco here in Phoenix. All I needed were my 'Angel Flight' pants and my 'Members Only' jacket.... Hah... still a great song to just sit back and listen.
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,"THIS SONG IS TOO COOL. (I AINT SAYING MY AGE) BUT DOES THIS TAKE ME BACK TO THE DAYS OF DANCING TIL YOU DROP. NOW I DROP MUCH SOONER (LOL) BUT THIS SONG HAS A SERIOUS BEAT AND THE WORDS MAKE SENSE. IN FACT WHEN THIS FIRST CAME OUT I BOUGHT THE (WAIT FOR IT) ALBUM. BUT IN MOVING I LOST IT OR SOMEBODY MOVED IT TO THEIR HOUSE. ANYWAY NOW THAT WE CAN DOWNLOAD, BURN ETC SONGS I GOT IT AND A FEW MORE OF HEATWAVES SONGS! AWESOME!"
,B00136JOVG,-1,-1,1,"Where is Pressure?

You kidding me?

Only my favorite Billy Joel song ever!

Can't believe they left that off - glaring omission.

I'll pass."
,B00136JOVG,1,1,5,Good collection. I never hear this stuff any more (maybe its the radio stations I listen to). But I remember when these songs were really popular. Overheard my 9 year old listening to Uptown Girl on some website. Saw Billy Joel's New Years Rockin Eve concert. Decided to put this on my iPhone. Fun trip down memory lane.
,B00136JMH2,1,1,5,"UGK, on their second album, finds the unstoppable riding groove that they are most known for today.  Bun B's rugged flow and menacing lyrics nicely offset Pimp C's playalistic style.  The beats are strictly playa beats that you can ride to or just chill and bob ya head to.  Never corny and always on point.  Pimp C is definitely an underated producer.  Every song bumps but the classics are `Return', It's Supposed To Bubble, I Left It Wet For You,  Feds In Town, and Front Back Side to Side.  This album, being nearly ten years old, does not have a dated sound and wouldn't sound out of wack on a mix cd of recent songs.  It would fit right in.  And that my friends is a sign of timeless classic music.  UGK - Supertight - 5 stars."
,B00136JMH2,1,1,5,"...pimp c must have a helluva record collection to get at all of the samples the way he does.  they got the lyrical skills alright, but young chad's production gets slept on!  the neptunes, swizz beatz and others cant touch him.  him, organized noize, gangstarr's premier and suave house's old production team are perhaps the only ones i can compare him to, skillz wise.  this is a classic right here."
,B00136LRXO,1,1,4,Good song.

,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,Old School Excellence
,B00136LOU0,-1,1,5,"First, this is the original recording. It's a shame to have to point that out, but the majority (!) of matches for Groove Line are re-recordings. It's much better to match those memories to the actual remembered version.

Second, this is the extended version. The usual, radio edit is 4:22 (as found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mega-Hits-Dance-Classics-Vol-8/dp/B000006LRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mega Hits Dance Classics, Vol. 8</a>, for example), but this is the full (12-inch?) length of 7:26. Disco songs were meant to roll along forever, just like that.

As I type, this version of Groove Line is also available in Amazon Prime Music, but I thought it was worth the bit of cash to be able to download the MP3 to use wherever I want. However you want it, if you like disco, you should check this out."
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,loved it.
,B00136LOU0,1,1,4,"First time I heard this song to my recollection was as an opening number on the Donny and Marie show with all that choreography and those Ice Angels . To judge it on that performance would not be fair ...... then I heard the song done as it was meant to be ...... Bravo Heatwave . If you have any tolerance for disco you should enjoy this , I know I do."
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,love it
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,Extremely satisfied
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,great song
,B00136LS9W,-1,1,5,I can play this song 2-3 times a day 7 days and not get tried of hearing this last hit that he performed w/Journey on Video which they was nomated for a Grammy and should have received more than a nomanation?
,B00136LS9W,1,1,5,Steve Perry is Mastermind. His music will live forever in our hearts and no one can ever replace the voice of the Centuries to come. Love you Steve !!!
,B00136LQUI,-1,1,5,"I love this song, it brings back bittersweet memories of the summer of 2000.

In June of 2000 after the unexpected and sudden death of my husband, my BFF at the time and I were riding in my black '96 Mustang GT, windows down radio blaring.  She was trying to get my mind off of what had happened a few days before when Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" came on.

Before I even had time to think about it, we looked at each other and started ""car dancing"", you know, you're bustin' a move while moving at a high rate of speed, singing at the top of your lungs, laughing, crying and just having fun.  People driving past us would look over and smile, or laugh, some even paced themselves alongside us and broke out in their own car dancing moves.

I didn't stop and think about what people would think if they knew my husband had just died.  I didn't stop and think about anything except the moment me and my best friend were in, ""Girl's just having fun"".

The lyrics are easy to pick up, sing along with and dance to and the video was great.

I believe that if more girls just wanted to have that sort of carefree silly fun, the world might be a little less uptight."
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,"As music goes, the download was smooth, the quality of the conversion was flawless to the novice ears, and when played on multiple devices, to include an mp3 disc where I had over 200 songs made no differencethe quality was spot on.  Amazon has delivered yet another fine conversion and I love the fact that the songs I have purchased are backed up on their cloud.  What a great throwback, I love it, and I enjoy the massive selection offered by Amazon!

The services offered via Amazon are great and their music selections are massive and I love how easily I can choose while operating multiple or from any device!"
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,Very Enjoyable
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,Great old school music
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,love it!!! will buy again!!!
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,"This is probably one of my most favorite songs by Heatwave. They have great music, but I like this one the most."
,B00136LOU0,1,1,5,"Great song, no need for all these words, great song says it all. Disco lives whether some folks what it too or not."
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,This song never gets old.
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,Good
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,love this
,B00136LO78,1,1,5,"is that it was about someone who died from an overdose.

I know that when I first heard this song it came and went. I didn't pay much attention to it at all.

But these days I like it lots. This is after I bought the platinum edition (2007). The ending is emotional. And I could see myself getting teary-eyed if I loved someone half this much.

But I'm not in a relationship. But I still like songs like this. Love-oriented ones. I always have!

 And they range from different sides of mainstream music from Pop (Mandy, Robin, Christina or Jesse,) to R&B (Mariah, Carl Thomas, Beyonce and Luther Vandross) to Pop-Rock (Maroon 5, Incubus, Yellowcard and Fall Out Boy).

5 stars.

,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,"I just recently bought ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper as an mp3 file, and I have to say I am most pleased with it.

I can recall many times hearing various  Cyndi Lauper songs playing on the radio (back in what I am guessing must have been the 80's).. and listening to this track again really stirred up some memories!

I picked up this track while it was on sale, which was also a plus."

My husband and l are 56!!!"
,B00136LO78,1,1,5,"Just like my other review of PINK purchases I LOVE her. Additionally, the ease of purchasing was just as wonderful."
,B00136LO78,1,1,5,This song explains how I feel about an ex friend of mine and if i see her again at a reunion at our old school then I will if need to play it for so she knows why I broke the friendship with her.
,B00136LO78,1,1,4,"I'm not much into 2000s Pop music, but this one actually spoke to me.  You don't hear many good ballads anymore."

,B00136LO78,1,1,5,This is the radio version of this song that I was looking for. This is the version I remember and wanted to buy and that is exactly what I got. I have never had a problem with sound quality when buying from Amazon. I bought this MP3 a while ago but it needed to be reviewed.
,B00136LQQ2,-1,1,5,Memories

,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,oldie goodie
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,4,I never liked her punk songs like Girls Wanna Have Fun which was why I was surprised when she came out with this one - expressive of love's angst and contradictions. Having seen her in the movie Vibes also made me like her.
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,4,"Thanks to the tv series Bones, I rediscovered Cyndi Lauper. Her music is still good, still has a lot to say and I have really enjoyed connecting again."

,B00136LQUI,1,1,5,"Timesless song that just will always make girls of any age feel good, smile and love live! never gets old!"
,B00136LQUI,1,1,5,Cyndi has always been strange and when she burst on the scene she  just ripped it up! She was a weird looking awesome talent. I still to this day enjoy this song and a few more.
,B00136LQUI,1,-1,3,"Do I really need to write a review for this song? It is my childhood, it is me, it is for all the girls that hit their had on a glass ceiling."
,B00136LQUI,1,1,5,I live this song by Cyndi Lauper! It's definitely a great song to add to your collection. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys listening to cyndi Lauper!
,B00136LQUI,1,1,5,"This song was always fun, from the time it came out when I was a teen.  Now that I have two little girls, they love this song.  It's happy and fun!"
,B00136LQUI,1,1,5,Hey this is a very up beat song that captures the fun spirit that it is to be female. It also gives a sense to a time in music where this female movement was awakening to the reality that we all just want to have fun.
,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,great
,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,Great song by a great and legendary artist

,B00136LQQ2,-1,1,5,"I really liked this song, so much that I bought it. I hate reviewing music, who am I Rolling stone magazine? but this reviow your purchases keeps coming up, so to clear it I wrote a review."
,B00136LQQ2,-1,-1,3,This is an okay song and I listen to it sometimes. I have it on my ipod and itunes library.
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,4,Written by NJ songwriters. Sung by the original 80's Jersey Girl. Still a moving love ballad. Cyndi Lauper still rocks.
,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,This is a great song and album done by a great musician. The recording is clear and great for listening.
,B00136LHH0,1,1,4,"Use to live in West Virginia. Must be the state anthem there. Great state. Really nice people. However, 54 inches of snow in one night was just too much for me. Still love the song. Brings back many fond memories of the state and people."

,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,Awesome
,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,Love it
,B00136LHH0,-1,1,4,John Denver was a voice in the 70s.  This is one of his classics.
,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.

,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,I love John Denver. He is one of the best iconic folk singers. His songs are heartfelt and True. I cant say enough.
,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,I loved this song ever since I first heard it. I was in my early teens when it first hit the airwaves on the radio. I still love listening to it.
,B00136LHH0,1,1,5,"This is a song I remember from my childhood, driving cross country with my family. I hear this song and back in time I go."
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,Its simple as that. This was one of my favorites of her songs. Holds special meaning and memories for me.
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,Great song after all these years and will be on into the future.  This lady has soul and is one of the best vocalist around.
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,I love this song it makes me think of the 80's when mtv was just that. Music Tv only. I wish we had something like that now. I think this is the best song she has.
,B00136LQQ2,1,1,5,Easy listening the grown up Cyndi punched out much more adult songs after she showered the pink out of her hair. Thank you very much for this one CL.

,B00136LV12,1,1,5,"Great song from the late 90's, it definitely brings me back to my childhood days, great memories also and it was only 99 cents!"
,B00136LV12,1,-1,3,i like the music more than the rapping but its a good sampling choice that goes good together it gets a little more play than others
,B00136LV12,1,1,4,Great song that has a great beat and you can dance to and can listen to it around my kids.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,I got this free Mp3 download from a CD purchase. I love this deal  because I am able to buy songs from CD's that I do not entirely like. This one song is a fun one and I am trying to learn it on piano.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,I love jamming out to this song in my car. It's well written and excellent to listen to everywhere and anywhere.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,"Sounds great, downloaded without errors and meets expectations.  Amazon offers a great selection of music and they're are my preferred download site."
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,"This is a great song -- a classic -- and the mp3 does it justice. And a great price, so we can all sing along with the Piano Man!"
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,It is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste  Summary: buy of simply find it on you tube
,B00136LV12,1,1,5,Good dance song
,B00136LV12,1,1,5,Great song!
,B00136LV12,1,1,4,"This is not my favorite Will Smith song, but it is a bit of a must have I couldn't pass up for $0.69."
,B00136LV12,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136LV12,-1,-1,1,Awful. I think this is the worse wiil smith song ever.
,B00136LV12,1,1,4,"Great album, would highly recommend to fans"
,B00136LKMC,1,1,4,"In 1966 you couldn't turn on your radio without this song playing.  I sometimes think this song made the movie ""Midnight Cowboy"" a success."
,B00136LKMC,1,1,5,"Perfect for those of us who spent a lot of their time dealing with teen angst in a bleak and sometimes heartless world (yeah, whatever...) and a great bookend to ""Without You."""
,B00136LKMC,1,1,5,I was born decades after the movies initial release however because I am fan of Dustin Hoffman I scoped this movie out during my research of Hoffman's list of movie appearances the movie got me looking at reality from a whole new perspective & because I was deeply moved by the story I scoped out the sound track and was lucky to find the one memorable song was out on Mp3 so scopped it and have been happy since cuz it's True living in the City Everyone's talking
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Loved it.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Like it lots!
,B00136LRVG,-1,-1,1,Purchased by an ex-friend who figured out how to hack my account 4+ years ago.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Billy Joels greatest song.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,excellent
,B00136LVM6,1,1,4,Adding to my collection after hearing the song at a friends house.  Its a good enough song that I wanted it added to my collection.
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,I grew up listening to Steve Perry and this is my favorite song of his. It sounds great on my headphones.
,B00136LO9G,1,-1,3,I like this song. It is the only song by rosanne cash I like. So I bought it. It's a good cover version of a song her dad sang.
,B00136LO9G,1,1,5,This song was purchased to add to my collection and it was what I expected and the cost was great.
,B00136LO9G,1,1,4,Great country song when country was really country and not a cross-over with pop and rock.  Rosanne Cash brings you to what country music is really all about.
,B00136LO9G,1,1,5,I had to get this song. She can really put it out there. I like that type of music. A touch of Bluegrass.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,I heard him in concert in 1973. Great song.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Fun to sing along to.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,classic oldie.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Great song.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Love it love it
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,great
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Excellent
,B00136LVM6,1,1,4,good song!
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Love it!
,B00136LVM6,1,1,4,"Always loved this song, one of his best I believe!"
,B00136LKMC,1,1,4,Good deal for 99 cents.
,B00136LKMC,1,1,5,"I can really relate to this song-I feel the same way sometimes. Maybe  I have Aspergers(the latest ""Fad Disease"", I know) .It doesn't really seem like a song Nilsson  would write(he didn't,I know) or perform. I've never heard the original version by Fred Neil (the composer) but I don't think he would mind. He got rich from the cover and retired to Florida,just like in the song. Maybe I'll check that version out someday."
,B00136LKMC,1,1,5,I had the record album however everything is on CDs today.  I have always liked this song.  I can relate to it especially this winter wanting to go South for warm weather.  It relates to everyone heading South for sunshine and warmth.  I remembered I can download it on Amazon.  Great.
,B00136LKMC,-1,1,5,"This is a sad song that accurately describes how the dying Ratso and Joe Buck take Ratso's last trip to Florida.  Listen to the phrase, ""I'm going where the sun keeps shining through the pouring rain.  Going where the weather suits my clothes.""  In the south along the Gulf Coast they have a saying for this condition.  ""The devil is beating his wife""  This means the sun is shining and it is raining like hell.  How could the producers of ""Midnight Cowboy"" used this as the opening song?"
,B00136LKMC,1,1,5,Love this man and his music!
,B00136LKMC,1,1,5,Really love it but I'm also going to get the longer version as soon as I can.  Harry Nilsson has a wonderful voice.
,B00136LVM6,1,-1,3,"Not bad, classic"
,B00136LVM6,-1,-1,3,Song is alright.
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,"Should have been gone, this song is the best!"
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Great
,B00136LVM6,1,1,4,"Another rare hit from the 80's. Why they couldn't include it on the recent Journey albums, I have no idea. This is a great hit that Steve Perry did on his own. I'm glad Amazon MP3 brings up the most popular tracks by name or artist. It really helped me find this one."
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Would not buy if it was just OK.
,B00136LVM6,-1,1,4,Meets expectations.
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Excellent
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,love it
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Love it
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Love it
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,"I purchased this song ""Piano Man [Clean]"" by Billy Joel because I really liked it, so I decided to get it as a digital download.  Now that I have I am very glad that I did. The sound quality is excellent and the song is a classic!"
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Billy Joel and this song are my favorites.  I was so glad to run across it as an offering while scanning the MP3 offerings on Amazon.  I immediately purchased it and count it among one of my most-listened to songs so far.
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,excellent song
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,I loved this song from the movie A Walk To Remember.  A great example of how God can change your life around.
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,I fell in love with this song from the movie A Walk to Remember.
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,Loved
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,I love the movie and the song l give it 5star
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,Love the song and the movie.
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,"The movie was great, and the song is amazing too. I love Mandy Moore's voice. It's so breathy and light.  The lyrics are clean and inspiring."
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,Love the song. Beautiful. I love the movie as well. Made me buy the movie which I watch over and over again
,B00136ITNK,1,1,5,I love this!  I played it at my husband's funeral a couple of months ago and it really ministered to everyone at the funeral.  I love MercyMe so much.  Everything they record lifts up the Lord and helps to bring you into a worshipful mood.
,B00136ITNK,1,1,5,Very nice 5 Stars
,B00136ITNK,1,1,5,An excellent song (and prayer) for every believer!!!  Helps me to keep my focus on my heavenly hope.  I think most of us long for our heavenly home and to be with our loved ones that have gone before us.
,B00136ITNK,1,1,5,Another super hit by Mercy Me.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Who doesn't like the Piano Man?
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,All of us love this. We watch / play / read it often. Item was in condition as expected and there were no troubles with it.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,One of my favorites by Billy Joel. Catchy but poignant. I love Amazon MP3 downloads. Great prices and you don't have to log in to use them.
,B00136LVM6,-1,1,5,Brings back memories
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Love it
,B00136LVM6,-1,1,5,pop all the way
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Love this song
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,My favorite Steve Perry solo song.
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Always been a favorite!
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Such a talented Artist. Beautiful song. Purchase was easy and acquiring it was easy by downloading it to my Amazon player.
,B00136LVM6,1,-1,2,"""Oh Sherrie"" was Journey lead singer Steve Perry's first solo release.  No one can deny the strength of Mr. Perry's voice, but he is too bombastic on this track.  He goes for the sledgehammer right over your head, when a little more subtleness would have better for a love song written for his girlfriend at the time.  The guitar work sounds a little too much like a knock off of Neal Schoen.  The song was a massive hit in early 1984, peaking at number 3.  It would be his only solo song to crack the top ten."
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,"I originally downloaded this to use in my wedding and changed my mind only because it didn't seem a great fit. But it's a beautiful song, written and originally sung by a Christian artist. I like Mandy's version more, though, it's moire expressive."
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,4,Really enjoyed it.  I heard this song in the Movie and my daughter and I started looking for the title.  We found it and bought it.
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,I love Mandy Moore as a music artist and actress. Her songs are very touchy in heart. I love singing along with her song.
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,"I love this song.  very moving.  I buy only the songs I really like.  most of the time I find them as background music on a tv show or movie.  and amazon, wonderful amazon, makes it possible to buy that one piece most of the time.  no need to buy and entire album that you may or may not like any more of the songs on."
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,"A Truly Beautiful Song.  The melody and the way this song carries you is addictive.  Mandy Moore's voice is flawless and so beautiful. This is one of those songs you will want to hear ""over and over and over again...."" ( words right from this very song).  Everything is perfect about this song."
,B00136LUSQ,1,1,5,I love this song.  It's Disney meets Christian.  I love the lyrics.  I love the mandy moore version better. I love the strings.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,So enjoy this song just seems to grab you and make you want to sing along.  Added it to my MP3 player to exercise to
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,"The best by one of the best! Why this was not as big a hit as his later work or why  he went all the way to 1977's ""Just the Way You Are"" for another are mysteries to me. I have his first 5 albums on first pressing vinyl, but why risk damaging vinyl? I've gradually put together a patchwork of his best music on cd and mp3, but this was the first mp3 by him I bought. If you only have one Billy Joel song, you would not go far wrong by making this one it. Besides, it is the True story of how he hid out until a lousy record deal expired and met his first wife in the process. All the characters were real people and the waitress who is ""practicing politics"" became the first ""Mrs. Joel."""
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Great audio quality love this song and listen to it all the time on my phone computer and my ps3
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,"Who doesn't love this song by Billy Joel.
If you are old school I am sure you have heard this popular song. Is a beautiful song. When you play this song, it takes you back as if you were in the scene. Just listen to it. Very pretty storyline song."
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Saw this in the $5.00 albums and had to get it.  It was one of my faves when it first came out.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,This song is for any mood you're in also a great song to sing-along to when you are in a bar.
,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,4,"It is hard to believe that it has been 3 years since Michael Jackson tragically died. Yet, his music remains in vivid memory as he was still alive today. Something that only few and far between artists whom has passed on can still deliver in spirit. His last major hit, You Rock My World from his lackluster Invincible record still remains very solid with his standard dance songs from the late 70's and 80's. It is one of his better songs from Invincible that still stands tall. While it isn't as good as his ballads were like Man In The Mirror or Lady In My Life. Still, it holds up well into why he will always be The King Of Pop. He knew what he wanted in song and heart. The song still stands taller than most of the junk on radio today.

Song: B"
,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,5,"What can I say about THE KING that hasn't already been said.  This is a song for the True STEPPERS, not the perpetrators.  It is a JAM.  One of MICHAEL JACKSON'S BEST."
,B00136LG5I,1,1,5,"This product arrived on time, with no damage to the package or product. I am a satisfied customer. MS"
,B00136LG5I,1,1,5,What's a old school collection without this song.
,B00136LG5I,1,1,5,The emotions anotha great group oldies 4 ever gots to have them oldies on my playlist and this is a must have rola right here very much worth dwn loading
,B00136LG5I,1,1,5,"Love the Emotions, this song is great.  I will be back to purchase more of their songs for sure soon."
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,Steve Perry could sing cereal ads and I would stop to listen.  He has one of the most powerful voices I've ever heard.  This is a classic!
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,"Founder and former member of the 1980s rock band ""Journey"" ""Steve Perry"" made quite an impact on 1980s Rock Music, both as a member of ""JOURNEY"" and later as a ""solo-artist"".  I would DEFINITELY recommend that anyone who is looking for 1970s/1980s Classic Rock give this and other albums by ""Steve Perry"" a listen!!!."
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,"Nice song with good rythum and lyrics. I hear this song on the radio today and remember the good times when it was ""hot"" on the street and in the dance places. Amazon does a nice job when matching this song to other similar music, Give this person a RAISE and fire the person that selects the dance mixes. David"
,B00136LVM6,1,1,4,"Always liked Steve Perry's voice especially with Journey, even though he was D***. Good solid melody, nice highs and lows."
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,"Truly one of the great anthems of rock. Driving guitar, great rhythm, angst, and Steve Perry's vocal power. This song has the perfect formula for an audio monument to Rock and Roll."
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,"I remember Oh Sherrie and still love it.  Now that we have Google these days, we can read what was going on when the artists recorded their hits."
,B00136LVM6,1,-1,3,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B00136LVM6,1,1,5,"Have always liked this song, and now I can listen to it any time I want to with it on my flash drive."
,B00136LT0U,1,1,5,"Very sexy songs, good mood setters, and I highly recommend this group to all who need to relax and get the day off their mind."
,B00136ITNK,1,1,5,"Bart Millard wrote this song after the loss of his brother-in-law, but anyone who has experienced loss will be blessed by this song.  Every believer will love the hope that this song gives, that one day we will see our loved ones again.  In this day and age more than ever, ""I've never been more Homesick than now.""  Bart shared a personal experience through this song, but everyone can relate to this amazing song.  Amazing song and amazing performance.  I would recommend this song to everyone.  You will be comforted and blessed."
,B00136ITNK,1,1,5,I love the ability to download songs.
,B00136ITNK,1,1,5,While I know GOD is with me I am always homesick and that pain never goes away. It becomes mangable with GOD and with words spoken by others makes it so comforting not to be alone even when I feel alone.
,B00136ITNK,1,1,5,AFTER MY SON PASSED AWAY ..I HEARD THIS SONG AND IT DESCRIBED WHAT LONELINESS MY HEART WAS FEELING.FOR MY SON..
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Billy Joel was really with it and knew what was going on within his world and with people who listened to him.  PIANAO MAN tells a story and brings a smile and a tear to the eye.  One of my favorites.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,"I don't know why I haven't got this song before now, but glad I did, and amazon has helped with other music that I find myself saying why don't I have that song yet."
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,great song great price great singer and great product. I will be back to download more music in the future
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,One of the great pieces of music written by and performed by the master. A must have if you like his music.
,B00136LRVG,-1,1,5,"I am not a fan of a lot of Billy Joel songs - I can't stand ""Uptown Girl"" which was a huge hit for Joel.  However, I really really like ""Piano Man""."
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,I have always enjoyed Billy Joel music.  Piano Man justifies my enjoyment with his music. I can listen over and over.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,this song is awesome I love it. it reminds me of hanging out with the buddies and just having a drink.
,B00136LODC,1,1,4,"Pink! (aka, Alecia Moore) had always been a fun-time singer with songs such as ""There You Go"" and ""Get This Party Started"".  In 2006, she managed to combine the same up-tempo beat of her songs with a strong message.  ""Stupid Girls"" is a female empowerment song encouraging young women to follow their own, independent paths and be True to themselves, instead of falling into the superficial traps of trying to be popular for popularity's sake and trying to attract a boy at the cost of self-respect.

  Pink! possesses that fierce grrrrl attitude but, unlike misdirected belligerence (like Avril Lavigne), she is focused and it comes out in her music."
,B00136LODC,1,1,5,"Really fun song, only problem I have with it is that the daggum chorus keeps running through my head at the strangest times..."
,B00136LODC,1,1,5,"I love the meaning behind this song.  It teaches girls to be strong, independent young ladies.  It also teaches them that they are pretty just the way they are."
,B00136LODC,1,1,5,Love this song the video always makes me laugh. Her performance  at the Grammys was top notched and after that I went back and listened to her music a little more closer. I have to say great music.
,B00136LT0U,1,1,5,Great song!
,B00136LT0U,1,1,5,Very nice.
,B00136LT0U,1,1,5,This song should only be played if you intend to make love. Approach with caution! Velvety lyrics over creamy smooth music. Just WOW!
,B00136LT0U,1,1,5,A great blast from the past. It is the brothers at the top of their game.  I am sure many children were conceived while listening to this one particular song.
,B00136LT0U,1,1,5,"I have always had a very mature ear for music and often go back to tunes that are far before my time, and this is certainly one of my favorites of the areaI searched for this joint thru the years when we had moved to the cassette tape, CD, and then finally MP3/4.  I am now happy to own it A great addition to my music collections."
,B00136LT0U,1,1,5,"Quite possibly one of the most beautiful songs ever made about love. I decided long ago that if I ever get married, this is the song I want played as I walk into the church. It's simply immaculately played and sung and just simply reeks of love. A deserved classic."
,B00136LT0U,1,1,4,"If you know and love the Isley Brothers since 1963, This old Heart of Mine and Twist and Shouts days, before the Beatles'tried' then Drifitng on the ...."
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,i love the song.  i would recommend it to my friends and family.  i listen to this song all the time.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,"I never get tired of this Billy Joel song.  Not only is his piano playing phenomenal, the lyrics are unforgettable."
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,Billy Joel is the Piano Man.  Back in the day he did a wonderful job of keeping up with the times.
,B00136LRVG,1,1,5,"This, IMHO, is the best song Billy Joel ever made.  He's given us a lot of good music over the years, but this one is the best.  Great lyrics, superb accompaniment, etc.  I can (and do) listen to this one over and over."
,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,5,You want be disappointed.good beat to get your groove on
,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,4,"Hard to believe today it is 5 years since Michael Jackson tragically lost his own life the way he did. I definitely do not think Michael Jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a pedophile and wacko jacko. Still he still had some great songs towards the end of his career and his life. You Rock My World, one of his last hit songs originally from the lackluster Invincible album is still one of those few standouts from that album that is playing well. It showed a more R&B rhythm to the appeal that Michael Jackson wanted to get into a generation that was getting into Destiny's Child, TLC and when a lot of R&B really was going more into a dance and hip hop rhythm. It really was a good song, but one of Michael Jackson's last to really hit the nail on the head. If you would prefer Michael's music from the afterlife, as it was released from the Xscape record, you should absolutely go back to what made Michael Jackson a legend in the first place, and get Invincible with You Rock My World.

Song: B"
,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,5,This song really rocks. I don't know why it didn't do so well when it was released. The video is awesome and the song is a must for any MJ fan that did not pick up the cd. Make sure you get the version with the Chris Tucker intro.
,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,5,"Music is all very personal and I'm not sure why I'm being asked to review it.  What I may love, another person will not, but I'm tired of seeing it on my ""Review Purchases"" screen, so I really love this song."
,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,5,Miss you so much Michael there will never be another one like you. You are truly one of a kind.
,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,5,"The prelude; Michael Jackson and Chris Tucker having a conversation about a girl they're supposedly looking at, though there isn't any background noise to help set the scene; is like the skit at the beginning of Black Or White. It may be funny initially, but it's replay value is nowhere near that of the song it introduces. Listeners of at-least the official album versions of these tracks may, in other words, find themselves skipping past, or at-least zoning-out on, the first several seconds. That means the tracks, essentially the songs, would be better without their preludes. In the case of You Rock My World, the title of which doesn't come across nearly as corny as it should, the song would also make more sense without it. The dialogue implies that the girl is a total stranger to both Chris and Mike, but the song lyrics have Jackson already romantically entwined with her.

""It feels like I've finally found a perfect love this time,"" he insists before going into one of his best choruses yet. ""You rocked my world, you know you did,"" it goes, utilizing a harmonic vocal stack similar to the haunting Ghosts, ""Who'd think I'd find someone like you to call mine?"" The words are trite; on paper the song would read like a high school crush poem; but the vocal melodies, even on the verses and bridge, are quite awesome. The music, highlighted by dramatic keyboard strings where applicable, is a slinky soul groove that goes back to the relative timelessness of the Thriller album. Despite an unnecessary scratch break near the end; the ad-lib peak section should take the song out; it's producer Rodney Jerkins at his best. It's not Michael Jackson at his best, but it's damn close. If the quality of this love theme is any indication, I'd guess he got the girl.

Oh well."
,B00136JDS0,1,1,5,"""Frankenstein"" is one of the top three rock instrumentals of all time! If you just go by the clip, you'll miss a bunch! Just download it, turn up the volume and hang on (get the one with the longer drum solo)! The Edgar Winter Group was incredible. When this first came out, it just blew people away."
,B00136JDS0,1,1,5,"This is a rare combination of pop and progressive music and is loved by those who enjoy both types of music. It has a live feel, by which I mean it doesn't seem over-produced like many progressive rock tunes. It is one of the few instrumentals to make the charts in the 70s. It has some nice flourishes such as great sax solos, judicial use of cow bell, and one of the nicest drum solos recorded, with ample timbale which lends an exotic flavor. There is great synthesizer throughout with strong performances by all backup musician. The drum solo on this version is a little longer than the radio version (I like this slightly longer version better).

This is a great classic that deserves to be in both pop and progressive catalogs."
,B00136LJ4Q,1,1,5,good song. Sandra K.
,B00136LJ4Q,-1,1,5,"When I first heard this song, I thought that this was made in the 1980's. But I found out that the song was recorded in 1977. This song sounds like it has a 'disco' influence, with a touch of 'classical rock'. I love the song but I don't know what has happened to the group."
,B00136LJ4Q,1,1,5,Excellent!

,B00136LJ4Q,1,1,5,Great Music

,B00136LQ9Y,1,1,5,I've been a big fan of Michael Jackson since I was a child. Man in the mirror is one my favorite songs sang by Michael

,B00136JDS0,1,1,4,Here's a nice blast from the past when you're in the mood for something a little wild. Be sure to buy this album version. The live one is overlong and weird.
,B00136JDS0,1,1,5,"Much better recording that I had with my 8 track player.  As I listened to it, I kept expecting that fade out - fade back in the section of the song I was used to when listening to the 8 track. BUT... I don't really miss that."

,B00136LG4O,1,1,5,I love this song... give me a lot of energy listening to it!  I highly recommend this copy. The volume is perfect and such a great song!
,B00136LG4O,1,1,4,"This is a good song to dance to. It has a nice beat, and a fun sound. It's also one of those ""crowd sings along"" songs, because the refrain is fairly easy, and there's a nice segment where the band drops down in volume, encouraging those listening to sing along."
,B00136LQ9Y,1,1,5,One of MJ's all time best songs

,B00136LQ9Y,1,1,5,I really like this song probably the best song Michael Jackson ever performed. It is also so True our biggest concern should be who is in the mirror
,B00136LQ9Y,1,1,5,"Love Michael Jackson.....so does my daughter. But I grew up knowing him. He was younger than me, by about 3 or so years. But what a waste on such a talented man.  God needed him maybe for all the kids in Heaven."

,B00136LX8I,1,1,5,"If you're looking for some party songs, you might like this one. It has some beat to it but not over the top. The price was good and the download was easy. Good purchase experience."
,B00136LX8I,1,1,4,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.
,B00136LX8I,1,1,5,Love to work out to this song. Sly was one of the best and his beat can't be beat! Enjoy!

,B00136M210,1,1,4,Great classic old school song! Too bad more current artists couldn't gain some insight and get back into good meaningful music
,B00136M10M,1,1,5,"""Because The Night"" is one of the gems of punk.  The unlikely collaboration between Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith, the song is direct and Patti Smith's performance raw.  All these years later, this performance, at first plaintive and then strident, retains the excitement and passion it had when it was first released in the spring of 1977.  This is a must for any collection of popular music of the '70's."
,B00136M10M,1,1,5,"Love this song, been very hard to find until now, so glad I could easily find it again and listen to it whenever I want."
,B00136M10M,1,1,4,"I first heard this song done by 10,000 Maniacs on their MTV Unplugged show. I loved that version and found out later of this version so I had to have it. I still enjoy the Maniacs version better, but this one is still good."
,B00136M10M,1,-1,3,"i love her since i thought she sang the song because the night also by 10,00 manices althought i lived them better i thought this version had a softer quality"
,B00136M10M,1,1,5,"Patti Smith had such depth and emotion in her voice when she sang.  I like this song for that very reason.

And it's a great song to belt out when the spirit moves you!"
,B00136LV3U,1,1,4,Fun song with a typical Will Smith Hip hop beat.  (The original beat is from the song forget-me-nots by Patrice Rushen)
,B00136LV3U,1,1,5,Good movie theme
,B00136M10M,-1,1,5,Patti owns this song!
,B00136M10M,1,1,5,The original song and I still love it to this day.
,B00136M10M,1,1,5,"I always liked the song and hoped for a good digital conversion - it was indeed.  It was just like being a teenager again, in the later 60's/early 70's, CBGBs, Lou Reed and of course Patti Smith."
,B00136M10M,1,1,5,"Written by Patti Smith and Bruce Springstein, released as a single in 1978, and reached #13 on Billboard Hot 100 chart, and #5 in the UK."
,B00136LEMS,1,1,4,"To really be honest with you, this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music. While so many artists like Jordin Sparks and Beyonce' have taken so much radio airplay, it has been harder to find fresh faces to make good music come alive. Newcomer, Sara Bareilles though has managed to get herself out there and try to make a name for her little voice with her debut single, Love Song. The song actually is very catchy after awhile, and stays with you. It is a pretty good song that shows she has a decent ability who has the distinction of making good songs sound fresh, rather than flimsy and manufactured. I really hope she keeps making good ones for years to come, that really stick to the mind and soul.

Song: B-"
,B00136LEMS,1,1,5,"First off, Sara Bareilles is a great new musical talent, in the vein of the gaggle of female pop artist dominating the airwaves today. She sings great, and her piano work is incredible. The song could be compared to REM's classic, ""The One I Love,"" in that, the title sounds, well, like a lovesong, but actually it's like a break-up song. Bareilles does a great job at creating a radio-friendly upbeat pop song. And it all seems to work. Just the other day, I heard the song twice within a span of 15 minutes, on completely different radio stations.

Overall, a great little pop tune from a big talent. Music just seems to be coming up with a ton of surprises lately, and this song is no exception."
,B00136LEMS,1,1,5,"Much more things going on, production-wise than the version that I have downloaded to my computer. It's great though, gives it more personality.

The version I hear when I listen to it (downloaded version) has just the piano and vocals. Nice, but no production whatsoever. It's great, but not this. The video version is much livelier.

The song itself is pretty impressive though; it lets us know who Sara actually is; what she wants; needs and most importantly, how she thinks! Lyrics are subtly interesting and the piano work is somewhat infectious, albeit simple.

I've heard the samples here, and although they weren't enough to make me want to purchase the album, it doesn't take away from this awesome single and I will still give them another go someday!

5 stars."

,B00136NE9Y,1,1,5,"I would HIGHLY recommend this song for anyone who is a fan of Julie Andrew or of Sound of Music.

This Artist is new to me. I just happened to hear some of her music on Pandora
and I love this song."
,B00136NEX0,1,1,4,"I generally like Alan Jackson's voice, but I don't like every song of his. This one means a lot to me, because it is a description of my own early married life, where my own wife and I bought our appliances on time, bought our furniture used -- or it was given to us by relatives -- and our diet was rough and sparse. But, my new bride and I were happy together. As Alan Jackson sings, we were living on love! If you are a country music fan, try this song -- especially if it describes your own life, as it did mine!"

,B00136LRQG,1,1,5,It is a good album.
,B00136LEMS,1,1,5,This is a fun and rebellious song with a catchy beat. I really enjoy it. Great price for a great song.
,B00136LEMS,1,1,5,"This song has a good attractive beat and musical style, that depicts not so much the older generation but not quite what we've come to expect from music from our current artist. Her singing and song style seems to depict a lady Michael Buble in my mind."
,B00136LEMS,1,1,4,Great song. This was a freebie that I got with a pepsi code- can't complain all that much Good buy. :)
,B00136LEMS,-1,1,5,Best thing to write a record about is your label. Why not make a hit song that's not a love song because your label thinks thats all you can do.
,B00136LEMS,1,1,4,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B00136LQNU,-1,1,5,songs of my youth
,B00136LQNU,1,1,5,I heard this song when I was really young. And when I found it on my kindle I couldn't beloved it. I still remembered the words! It is a real catchie song.
,B00136LRQG,1,1,5,you will remember this one as soon as you hear it.
,B00136LRQG,1,1,5,"I think this is probably THE best song from Billy Joel.  I love the music, the beat, and the words.  I don't claim to understand exactly what the song is all about, but I enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone who has never heard it."
,B00136LMJS,-1,-1,1,"How should I put this song? Painful, as in whenever it's on the radio, you have the sudden urge to bash your head into something. The song is one we've heard a million times before, when your lover is gone, you're sad, yes, we know, we get the picture. Stick to being in love with the boyfriend, or hating him, or being jealous over him, or losing him, just not, pining over him being more than ten feet away from you. And good gosh, can this song be any more overplayed on the radio? I mean, if this and ""Keep Holding On"" were the only songs you knew of her, you'd think she's the worst artist since SoljaBoy.

And read my review of ""Keep Holding On,"" most of it also applies here. So overall, Avril needs to stick to ""Girlfriend"" and ""Sk8tr Boi."" Stick with the punk, not the ballads and uplifting inspiration garbage, please."
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,"I have always know that Walter Williams of the O'Jays has an excellent sing voice.  I got the movie, The Fighting Tempation and then this song, ""He Still Loves Me"" because of the O'Jays performing in it.  The surprise was the singing ability of Beyonce Knowles.  She did an excellent job in this gospel styled R&B song.  I am not really a Beyonce fan, but it was pleasant to learn that fully clothed and without her usual bottom wiggling and top jiggling, she showed that she does indeed have singing talent.  What a waste for her not to use such talent as an R&B performer instead of a shimmering shapley bowl of Jello."
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,"Beyonce has shown that she can do songs that are spiritual as well as sexy. This movie included songs that truly touches the heart no matter what the age, sex, color or creed."
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,"This song was featured at the end of the excellent movie ""Rush Hour 2"". It has a nice beat and makes you want to sing and dance like Michael!"
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,I loved this song since I first heard it! It was nice just to add it to my MP3 collection. I gave this song a 5 star rating...enjoy!
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,Great !!!
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,Love it
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,wonderful
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,Love it...
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,I recommend Amazon music. i have started buying most of my music here.
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,LOVE IT
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,Love it.
,B00136NE8A,1,1,4,good
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,good music
,B00136NE8A,1,1,4,Rhythm's gonna get you ... oh wrong song ... right experience!
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,Smooth transaction...no problems...thanks!
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,"Very pertinent now that Star Wars episode 5 came out.  MJ talks about ""The Force"" at the beginning of this song - many choose to believe he means THAT force.  Rumor is that MJ was moved by episode 4 when it first came out."
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,Great Song!
,B00136NE62,1,1,5,"One of my favorites by the late, great Michael.  His voice was awesome, and this song was rocking and carried a great message."
,B00136NE62,1,1,4,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
,B00136NE62,1,1,5,"Black or White is one of those songs by Michael Jackson that is memorable not just because of the beat and the video that would later accompany it, but because of the words.

We live in a time where so much is put on color, but there is something else that I realized when I heard the song recently. Life is not black and white. Nothing is really at its best when it is separated and distilled. Michael Jackson knew that in his career and refused to be defined. We would do ourselves and the world a favor that doing the same.

Black or White contains a message that minds us that we are all human, all important regardless of what we look like. What matters is how we live and treat our fellowman. If we remember that, then we will truly be able to say we are living life to the fullest."
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,I love the Ojays and to have the lead singer start this song off was a treat. .. I love it. It is very uplifting. Listened to it all time at work.
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,This song can help a weak Christian remember who's opinion really matters and this song can help a strong Christian remember who brought us this far. love it.
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,My hair sticks up whenever I hear this song. Exhilarating!
,B00136NE8A,-1,1,5,it's Michael Jackson (duh)
,B00136NE8A,-1,-1,2,this song is soooo played out!! it wasn't all that to begin with! but it only annoys me more b/c it is played tirelessly
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,A wonderful Michael Jackson classic song.
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,ok
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,"A Michael Jackson Classic!  This upbeat pop tune will have you on your feet dance to Michaels smooth melodious voice.  It also has a great music break that allows you the opportunity to dance without focusing on the lyrics.  Go ahead, do your Michael spin"
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,"I saw the movie. This was my favorite song. Any one that has doubts about their faith should listen to this song. It would truly
touch them."
,B00136LLLW,1,1,5,"Yep, I got ONE. THis one and good lord, I love it. One of my favorites and can listen to it over and over"
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,Good stuff.
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,"I grew up at the same time as Michael Jackson. It is incredible the impact he had on so many millions of people. He will live on forever, no doubt."
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,it's Michael Jackson how many stars would you give one of his most popular songs he's ever recorded I mean come on it's a total of five if not more
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,Great!
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,"This song has a great beat! Its catchy and makes you wanna move your feet, it does run a little long for my taste though espescially with such repetitive lyrics."
,B00136NE8A,1,1,5,Such an enjoyable selection of songs from MJs heyday!. This is a great addition to my collection of songs to listen to and work out to.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"As ordered; As delivered; As expected; There, feel better about yourself?"
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,I Love It.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"This brings me back to 1982. I had just separated from a 8 year hitch with Uncle Sam. The Cold War was raging. This song was very inspiring. It is both, powerful and meaningful. It stuck with me forever. Great stuff. I just love it. The MP3 sound good."
,B00136NFOI,-1,1,5,Pretend you're Rocky running up those steps when you're working out!  I do.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,4,"I know this is song is possibly over a decade old, but I can't help but to feel the energy to fight when I hear it the beats."

,B00136NFOI,-1,1,5,A hymn from the 80s!
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"Anytime this song comes on it instantly makes me happy for a large variety of reasons, the main reason being just how great the song is. I would say it is in my top 50 songs I love from through out my life time."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,very good !! :) :)
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,GREAT SONG

,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,Exactly as expected.  Product description was spot on and the product functioned as well as it should have.  I would not hesitate to buy again.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,I recommend this product.
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,This is one of MJ's best! I loved this song and since I have misplaced my CD I wanted to replace this song at the very least.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"Oldie, but goodie that I added to my exercise play list.  I like happy tunes with a beat for exercising --- helps my motivation, which is more pitched towards reading a book than exercising."
,B00136NFOI,1,-1,3,Drives me nuts
,B00136NFOI,1,1,4,Love it
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,Easy to purchase and download with Amazon software.
,B00136LSRY,1,1,5,"Time Has Come Today was one of the first few songs I learned to play on my Silvertone electric guitar. It became a staple of my high school garage band that played around Virginia Beach in the late 60's and early 70's. So it should be no surprise that the driving beat of this notable call to action from the Chambers Brothers holds a special place for me.

Unlike many of the songs and artists from those times I think this tune and their greater works have stood the test of time very well with those other artists we still hear broadcast. The message is still as applicable now as it was then. Time HAS come today."
,B00136LSRY,1,1,5,Good stuff!!
,B00136LSRY,1,1,5,The best of Early Rock and Roll. You just can't beat songs like these. The generation of today just can't see their Mom and Dad's crankin up the stereo and jammin to songs like this
,B00136LSRY,1,1,5,I believe this is my very favorite rock and roll song. These guys played awesome stuff. I remember them coming down the aisles toward the stage as the song was beginning. When they got on stage they were the best. I had this album in vinyl and my wife chose to use it to melt over a can in the oven ti make a chip dish. I listen to it a lot now.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,I like or I wouldn't have bought it.
,B00136NFOI,-1,1,4,k
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,great
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,All time Classic
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,Fun song

,B00136NFOI,-1,1,4,"Good song, not so good the movie (Rocky IV)."
,B00136NFOI,1,-1,3,A favorite and always a winner.
,B00136LU4A,1,1,5,Awesome
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,I love the video for this song. I think of it each time I listen. RIP Michael.
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,"Remember the Time by Michael Jackson is a love song that touches on the singer asking his past love to remember when they shared a great relationship together, hence the lyrics remember the time.  The music video is fun to watch and features some well-known celebrities."
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,love the song
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,amazing!
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,"It's Michael Jackson, enough said.  WONDERFUL SONG."
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,RIP Michael. Your music will always be enjoyed by many of those who enjoyed your music while you where here with us.
,B00136LPYU,1,1,5,"This was another song that Michael Jackson made while he was still thinking straight. Even after his accident, he was a magnificent singer. I just wish he had stayed on track. Maybe he would be alive today."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,Loved it!!
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,Great song. Great version. It sounds like the original recording to me.
,B00136NFOI,-1,1,5,<3

,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,Inspiring!!!!
,B00136NH0U,1,1,5,I got this song to use for a memorial DVD for my grandfather. It worked perfectly for that and I even used it for a second memorial DVD I made for someone else later.
,B00136NH0U,1,1,5,"this song brought my family comfort during the loss of our granddaughter, a beautiful song, Rayleight definitely was a borrowed angel!"
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"Survivor has released many excellent recordings. However, this appears to be the song that they will be most remembered for. What a legacy! Every aspect of this recording is absolutely great. Enjoy!!!"
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"This is one of the best songs written for any movie, but fits the Rocky series well. Easy to use as part of a workout mix,traveling song or locker room pre-game anthem."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,4,"I have heard this song more times than I ever wanted to and I was never a big fan. I've played it on basically every karaoke or music game made and have endured it even more times when friends all insisted on playing it.
But still I knew I had to have it on my workout playlist...it's still inspiring after all these years."
,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,Steve Perry has an awesome voice.  This song has been a classic from inception.  So glad I found it again.
,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,It is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste  Summary: buy of simply find it on you tube
,B00136LTN2,1,1,5,"The good thing: It has Bob's best known and some of the best songs Bob Dylan wrote and recorded.

The bad thing: It ONLY has Bob's best.... there's a lot more to Dylan.

The recording quality is very good. The list order pulls it all together nicely. I give it 5 stars, but really, buy full albums by Mr. Dylan, his singles, and also covers of his songs too!"
,B00136LOVY,1,1,5,I got this for my MP3 player & loved it. Great sound & enjoy it very much. I will download more
,B00136LOVY,1,1,5,"Just a great song I hadn't heard in a while. Great memories.. great song by a great singer.
Thanks again"
,B00136LOVY,1,1,4,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,GREATEST SONG OF ALL TIME. This is argueably the best song out there. The whole world knows of it. Great Price. Worth The Buy.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"one you hear this song it like an magnet it stay with you all day , strong vocal  and sounds of a master peace ."
,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,Well produced.

,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,great song
,B00136NFOI,1,1,4,"I have loved this song since I was little. Love the older songs.great clarity as well, love all of survivor
songs."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"This is such a great, get it going work out song! I listen to it every time I work out. It gets me started and pumps me up to get in a great, fast rhythm."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,4,"My son's favorite football song!  We would play it before a game to help get him ""pumped up"", and I can't complain that it didn't work b/c he was ALWAYS ready to go out on the field afterwards!"
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,Brings back good memories but always moves me to want to work out! A good recording. Sound is clear and strong.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,Just what I expected.  This version has a great beat and sound.  You want to sing and dance when listening
,B00136LOVY,1,1,5,Great songs.
,B00136LOVY,1,-1,3,Good for its time. Pop music.
,B00136LOVY,1,1,4,80s classic
,B00136LOVY,-1,1,5,takes me back
,B00136LOVY,-1,-1,3,Song is alright.
,B00136LOVY,1,1,5,"Take me home tonight by eddie money captures the spirit of two people making it clear about the way they feel about each other. The female vocals to this song add an element of a story being created in concert with eddie moneys singing. I think that I gathered online that the strong vocals come from a singer who contributed to the ronettes. I admit that I forgot her name, but I think it is Ronni Spector (born veronica Bennett from what is listed on Wikipedia)."
,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,"You can never go wrong with Journey, love this band
however I am not sure why this is showing up on Amazon, since I own all their CD's and didn't order it from Amazon."
,B00136NI9K,-1,1,4,Meet expectations
,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,Enjoying the music.
,B00136NI9K,1,-1,3,Can't go wrong with this song
,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,"I am a huge fan of Journey, more so, I love this particular song. Now, I have the luxury of listening to the song, repeatedly, in my own library. I own it, so thank you amazon for allowing me to purchase and download the album into my library."
,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,Journey has does and always will rock the world!  Steve Perry has a unique sound and powerful voice.  Whenever I hear him I have to stop and listen.
,B00136NI9K,1,1,5,"love the song and was easy to download that's about it.  What else is there to say, it's a music download"
,B00136NI9K,1,1,4,"I bought this song when Amazon had a special on Styx, Kansas, Foreigner and Journey. MP3 is typical Amazon quality, no bad spots."
,B00136NFOI,-1,-1,1,Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,One of my favorite goups to listen to . I would recommend this song to exercise to. Good beat. Thank you.
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"Seriously, what child of the 80's could not love Eye of the tiger? It was the soundtrack to our lives back then, with our walkman and our mix tapes. Sooo many memories! If you were alive back then, you won't be sorry you downloaded it."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,4,This song brings me good memories good Rock song the price  is good and this is a classic buy it
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,This is such a great classic song and of course I am pleased with this purchase. Eye of the Tiger!
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"just as inspiring as it ever was!!! now my son who is 9,( I am 39) gets just as excited as I did from the power within brought out by great music inspired by a great story."
,B00136NFOI,-1,1,5,Ran up the steps that Rocky ran up in Rocky 1.  Had photo made with Rocky's statue.  Got poster of Rocky framed in my room.  Love Rocky and Eye of the Tiger.....a True fan
,B00136LRQQ,1,1,5,"Like so many others, I had not heard the Cash/Dylan version until I saw Silver Lining Playbooks. I have the original vinyl album by Dylan and had always loved the song, but the collaboration of Cash and Dylan blew me away. It's been a long time since a song evoked such emotion in me, but this song, this beautifully sad, painful and loving song was meant for their two voices. An incredible version of a classic Dylan song."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,I love it ! If was bought for my nephew so now i don.t have to listen to him wine about not having it lol. Thanks
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,Downloaded this song because it appears on the TV show Supernatural - sang by Jenson Ackles playing Dean Winchester - no need to say more if your familiar with the show.
,B00136NICW,1,1,5,"A personal favorite.  Jerry Reed sings with enthusiasm and a smile.  Purchased this MP3 for $.99.  Bitrate - 256 vicinity, would prefer better highs/lows quality seen in bitrates of 320 and higher."
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,I like this tune.  I purchased this tune because it's the rock anthem so many DJ's play.  My friends love it!
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,"How True this song is. Not only in the past but in the here and now how easily people follow those who promise them paradise, hope and change but only give them oppression and slavery to the state."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,The song is great. I use this for my work out and/or playing videogames! What a classic song! (We need more like it.)
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"What can I say? Survivor had it down. Great group but like so many in the 80's, they seemed to come and go before you really got to know who they were. This one got a lot of radio play (for those of us who remember when radio was FREE!). Seriously, though, great song! Brings back a lot of wonderful memories."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,"This has definitely become one of my favorite songs to listen to whenever I desire to give myself an emotional boost and encouragement. It is definitely a song that I intend to listen to more often from now on. If you are looking for a song that is going to give you an emotional jolt of encouragement and hope, then this is definitely your song. Have you ever had one of those days that was challenging, but you knew that you could triumph, but you need a good song to get you emotionally going? Then this is definitely a song to recharge your hope and optimism batteries. Many joyful, happy, and self-confident people are also going to enjoy this song. However, I must emphasize that this is also a song to be enjoyed if you happen to crave something to listen to that is going to feel encouraging and give you a dose of emotional and spiritual strength."
,B00136NFOI,1,1,5,No matter who you are or where you are...you can't go wrong with eye of the tiger and cranking it up loud...love it.
,B00136NI6S,1,1,5,"Great singer, he's probably singing in heaven."
,B00136NI6S,1,1,5,"I could listen to this one ALL DAY. If there was ever a groove that makes you want to just KEEP GOING - this is it! Luther's lyrical performance is snappy and soulful. Watch the Music Video for this one, it takes you right back to the dawn of the ""Walkman""!"
,B00136NI6S,1,1,5,its Luther nothing else needs to be said
,B00136NI6S,1,1,5,Good music
,B00136NI6S,1,1,5,love it
,B00136NI6S,1,1,5,I really liked this song after I heard it in the movie.  I usually don't listen to this style of music but it was really good so I got it.
,B00136NJCG,1,1,4,Good listening.
,B00136NJCG,1,1,4,Pure classic rock
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,Great 5 stars
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,"I remember first hearing the rock song Cult of Personality when I was around 8 or 9 years old (via both tv and radio).  During the past few years I have also heard this song every now and then via the radio (with most recently hearing it via iheart radio). I reluctantly confess to not yet fully understanding the deep meaning of Cult of Personality by Living Colour and many times enjoying more for the music, the unique lyrics, and the speech at the end. I looked through both songfacts and song meanings to interpret that the song could have a meaning to avoid listening and illogically believing everything you read either via media and/or popular and/or charismatic people and to instead strive to more frequently rely on your own intuition and logic."
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,Great song
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,Nothing else needs to be said but great
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,I love this song. It is now in my video library. Thank you very much.
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,great stuff
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,Great
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,It was thanks to the WWE using this song for CM Punk that I was able to discover it. It has a powerful message.
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,All of us love this. We watch / play / read it often. Item was in condition as expected and there were no troubles with it.
,B00136M0O4,1,1,5,I have to say this song is better and its the best version out there. Buy it and rage on.
,B00136M0O4,1,1,5,crystal method's version has music only. filter's lyrics make the song. liked this song since I was a kid. rest of sound kinda blows.
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,"I just download songs I remember playing on the radio, here in movies or just remeber hearing. All is well and good. Rock and Roll Lives On!"
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,"I'm writing this review for my soon to be 12 year old son. He's a WWE fan all the way. He collects the wrestlers,and never misses a WWE show. This is one of his favorite theme songs."
,B00136NJCG,1,1,4,"This hit single from the early 90's is still a relevant song today due to WWE superstar CM Punk. If it wasn't for watching WWE today, I would have forgotten all about this song and I'm glad to hear it again!"
,B00136NJCG,1,1,5,I enjoy listening to this song whenever and wherever. I first heard it on the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. WWE Superstar CM Punk uses this song as his entrance music.
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,I love R&B and hip hop but artist like Gretchen Wilson and Carrie Underwood has definately made me a country fan.
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,"WHY BUY THE WHOLE CD WHEN YOU CAN BUY THE 1 SONG YOU LIKE!!!!!!!!!!  TOTALLY COOL, BUY IT NOW COOL"
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,I first heard this song when my son was a toddler.  He and I used to sing it while making our hour drive to where I worked.  It is still a lot of fun to just sit back and jam to Redneck Woman.
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,She has a very upbeat rhythm. By far one of the best new country artists.
,B00136LUKO,1,1,5,"This is a very nice song! Probably my favorite from Keith Whitley.
Very pretty song that has great quality.
I used it for a YouTube Video.  :)"
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,Luv this song
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,great for line dancing
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,Great Music
,B00136NH5U,1,1,4,great song
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,Great item
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,Amazon makes purchasing songs really easy and is unmatched in when it comes to the ease of purchases and the quality of the downloads.
,B00136NH5U,1,1,5,"WHAT WOMAN WHO CAN DANCE, HAS A MIND, AND ISN'T AFRAID TO BE HERSELF WOULDN'T LOVE THIS SONG.  I AM A REDNECK WOMAN!"
,B00136NFE8,1,-1,3,"I chose this song because it reflects a relationship between two people. Nothing in a relationship is hidden but, those things that are hidden will effect a relationship. An open relationship should reflect the genuineness of both people in their commitment to one another. This is why I chose this song because she poured her relationship into this song. I loved her honesty in this song, and that's more than enough for a person to buy the song."
,B00136NEYO,1,1,5,This is good country! I love Alan Jackson and this has always been a favorite...especially because he's singing about visiting the grave of Hank Williams.  Great tune!
,B00136NEYO,1,1,5,"Love being able to pick and choose the song I want to purchase without paying for the entire CD, that could get costly."
,B00136NEYO,1,1,5,fantastic--Mr Jackson crosses all lines with his music-if I play it outside all the neighbors want to know who it is.
,B00136M29M,1,1,5,"This is Garfunkel's greatest hit. Even though he had only one next to Simon's many great hits
this one is as good and probably better than any of Simon's. A masterpiece. But sad."
,B00136M29M,1,1,5,"I have loved listening to Art Garfunkle since his days with Paul Simon. I bought the vinyl of ""Angel Clare"" back when it came out and it's still one of my favorites. When I saw it available on the downloads I couldn't resist it."
,B00136LUY0,-1,1,5,it was great. this is dumb that you make me write a reveiw. that you are forcing me to take time to write something when what i really wanted to say was not enough.
,B00136NLVK,1,1,5,"If you enjoy[ed] folk music from the 60's; if this is not in your collection, it's a great 1 to add."
,B00136NLVK,1,1,4,Glenn Yarbrough has a way of trembling his voice that brought him a hit with this one from the '65 Steve McQueen movie
,B00136NLVK,1,1,5,Too bad Glenn Yarbrough didn't have other great hits like this one. The movie was pretty fine as well if you're in to old black and whites!
,B00136NG9W,1,1,5,This is one of the all time greatest hits in my book. Everyone should enjoy this any time they possibly can. I would suggest this to all who love music.
,B00136NG9W,1,1,5,I love this man songs gone too soon simple the best in the world what more can I  say. I love you Luther
,B00136NG9W,1,1,5,"This is truly a classic song and one my favorites by Luther Vandross. When I seen this song on mp3, I just had to purchase it."
,B00136NG9W,1,1,5,It's a tear jerker! I love Luther...such a huge loss! I love that I can listen to it whenever I want on my Kindle.
,B00136NG9W,1,1,5,Every song of his I can think of was a hit. When you listen to his music you just love him even more.
,B00136NG9W,1,1,5,This is one of Luther's best singles. Enjoy it.
,B00136NG9W,1,1,5,wonderful should be song when you propose to someone
,B00136NG9W,1,1,5,Great song from a superb Singer
,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,"Good for exercising/ dance, or simply an empowering piece ..it lifts ones spirits to a new level ! Majestic! Awesome!"
,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,This song has been around for every but I still love it.  Very dramatic.  What are we counting down to?  I don't know.  But it still has a feel of mystery and drama.
,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,This saves me time and money. Since I'm in school I really don't have too much time nowadays. Rock on.
,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,"Yeah, it's cheesy.  Yeah, it's 80's.  Yeah, it totally rocks.  How can you not want to stand on the top of a speeding car with your arms held to the sky while listening to the only good song Europe has ever produced?  Plus GOB Bluth in a pirate shirt with a dagger in his mouth is pretty awesome..."
,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,"...oh, Gob.  To me, this used to be just a novelty song from years afore, but was greatly brought to popularity as being Gob's theme song from Arrested Development.

I'm sure the rest of Europe's music is good, but I only downloaded this song to bring to memory Gob's introduction at optical illusion shows."
,B00136LXLU,1,1,5,I think this is my favorite big band song from the days of my parents. They had it on an album and I heard it a lot even though I was born after 1950.
,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,great

,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,Awesome!!!
,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,"I love this band! Totally brought me back to my younger days. It's amazing the memories music can bring back. I also love buying my music on amazon, it is so easy and downloads quickly.  I would highly recommend this band for any 80s heavy metal lover and I would recommend using Amazon music for all of your music needs."
