He knew of a place that Jesus said he would prepare for his followers who remain faithful a place where his own wife and child were already there.

Then the Boy grows up and he is in college, his Mom and he were talking about the thing happening in the small town he grew up in. Finally she tells her son that the old man who was his best friend had died.

Later in bed that night he says to himself, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry.  He knew his old friend was home with his family he had lost so long ago.

But my point with the title was that Tattoo was safe. So safe that it bored me. I think I thought it was ""cute"" the first time I heard it but I still haven't seen the video and I don't care. I don't think I'll ever care for that song EVER.

And that's fine with me.

But this single...I heard it a few times and was like ""I like it. I really do.""

It's much more...her. I think. Still don't ""know"" the girl! But it just seems a bit less predictable. Sure, this love thing is tried and True to death, but this song is catchier to me, the production a LOT nicer (like a floating, ""this can't be real"" kinda feel) and it shows more vocal power. I will say at the end though, Jordin literally shrieks a note and it's just too loud. That could've been left out but if you don't mind belting, then this song is good pop music.

The vibe, playful and youthful (the eldest, Chris is only 18 after all).

And even though some of you are sick to DEATH of him (me excluded), Chris does a good vocal job here too. After hearing the SMASH, ""With You"" and a few of his older tracks, I can tell that even though they had no hand in the writing of this track, that at least Chris feels his part. Surely, Jordin does too.

I wish her luck in the future although I heard her album wasn't that great. Guess I didn't miss much!

3.9 stars (compared to the measly 2.25 i awarded the first single, Tattoo).

End note: I like Jordin. She's a sweety, got's a good set of pipes and she's damn pretty. However, I did have many gripes with her actually winning because although she was more marketable than Melinda (who got ROBBED!!!!!!), she didn't have the pipes like her nor quite like Lakisha.

It was sad.

But she won. It's over. Great voice. Hope to see her co-write 2 songs (at least) next go round and I wish her happiness. No surprises here.","And I do n't think she 's writing any of her material but that 's OK for now . She just started out . But my point with the title was that Tattoo was safe .

First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).

Altogether, I just don't appreciate either of them ripping the Irreplaceable beat off though.

Come on! We heard it ENOUGH in 2006/2007!!!

Second. I will never forget you/You're in everything I do/

""Herb"" - along with teenyboppers and Nelly fans, herbs are something else I detest.  Esoteric arrogantly defines the term herb all throughout the track ...
""Rest In Peace"" - a clever concept song where Eso rhymes about himself passing on and how his music ALL OF A SUDDEN is known, and how there are album profit problems among his family and friends...
And the rest of the tracks are the usual Esoteric battle/android type of material... NOTHING on this material is WEAK by any means (there are no blunders like Guestlist)...

A3QWNQ2WA7QZYJ,B00138F9AO,1,-1,2,"THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE, GET AWAY.

Released in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.

There is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.

This is one of those singer/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.

To make a singer/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.

John Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.

It also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.

The album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.

But, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.

The worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.

If you are new to Widespread Panic, get the live CD Classic City and then get the first two CD's, Widespread Panic and Space Wrangler, which are fantastic, five star albums.","THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE , GET AWAY .

Some of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on her ""Mama's Gun"" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, ""Don't You Forget It"", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track.
The only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on her album, but smoothed around the edges, ""Butterfly""; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough.
The rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear her sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.

A1ALPL858XSDE,B00138KJI6,1,-1,3,"With Lorrie Morgan's recent departure from RCA subsidiary BNA, this new seventeen-track set captures the final original recordings of a mostly successful eleven-year tenure.  It also serves as a fairly effective sequel  to Morgan's eleven-track Greatest Hits collection from 1995.  There are two  overlaps: her signature recording - the symphonic saga ""Something In Red"" -  and the pedestrian non-hit ballad ""Standing Tall.""  The latter tune should  have been dumped in favor of the pretty, top 5 charter ""Out Of Your Shoes""  (the only significant Morgan recording not found on either anthology).
  In the five years since her first collection, the honey-voiced Morgan's  track record at radio has become increasingly spotty.  Not surprising,  about half of the hits included here are recordings made before 1995 that  didn't make it onto the first set.  These include her hard-shufflin'  breakthrough single ""Trainwreck Of Emotion"" (choo-choo!), the toe-tapping  #1 ""We Both Walk,"" and the stirring confession ""He Talks To Me.""  They tend  to make more of an impact than the recent rousers ""Go Away"" or ""One Of  Those Nights Tonight"" and especially, her snoozy duets with ex-hubby Jon  Randall (""By My Side"") and Sammy Kershaw (""Maybe Not Tonight"").
  The five new recordings show a great diversity in both musical styles and  taste.  Morgan's stunning take on the Tammy Wynette classic ""Another Lonely  Song"" is a tribute in every sense of the word and probably her greatest  vocal performance to date.  Meanwhile, the rap-infested ""Whoop-de-do"" is  definitely her worst (Morgan has never sounded so inane).  The remaining  new efforts are a pair of pale ""Something In Red"" imitations (""To Get To  You,"" ""If I Cry"") and a live recording of the precious Sarah McLachlan hit  ""Angel.""  Those last three torchy recordings seem to signal the direction  Morgan wants to take her career in the future... what a shame.","With Lorrie Morgan 's recent departure from RCA subsidiary BNA , this new seventeen - track set captures the final original recordings of a mostly successful eleven - year tenure .

A6FIAB28IS79,B0013DCCS6,-1,1,4,"This is not the cacophonous circus that two big bands playing together (for the first time, without rehearsal, and in one 12-hour session) might have become.  Think of it as one large ensemble (like Kenton's 40+ piece mellophone orchestra) commanded by a first captain (Ellington) and two assistant directors (Basie and Strayhorn).  Basie, the spokesperson for understatement, and Ellington, the supreme creator of small ensembles within larger ensembles: the result is sensible, swinging, and frequently exhilarating music--with enough spontaneity to satisfy even a Charles Mingus.

In fact, Mingus was the only musician the ultra permissive Ellington ever fired from his band--at the insistence of Juan Tizol, after the volatile bassman had come at the trombonist with a fire ax.  On the occasion of this recording, Tizol again insisted that Ellington fire someone--trumpeter Cat Anderson, who had nearly sliced off his head with a spiraling Sam Woodyard cymbal. "" It's him or me,"" said Juan.  Ellington may have been agreeable, but the Maestro was not about to submit to an ultimatum issued in public by his trombonist.  So ""First Time"" was the last time for Juan Tizol.

Musical highlights include some heated exchanges between the two bands' top soloists, especially Thad Jones vs. Cat Anderson, and Frank Foster + Frank Wess vs. Paul Gonsalves (who could hold his own in any company).  Also, Wess' flute (an instrument that didn't interest Ellington) and Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet do a memorable ""pas de deux.""  At the same time, not bringing together the lead altoists--Johnny Hodges and Marshall Royal--is a wasted opportunity.  On the whole, the affair favors Basie over Ellington, whose subtle, nuanced palette and sophisticated compositional genius are less apparent than usual.  The Freddie Green rhythm guitar would all but clinch it as a primarily Basie date were it not for the rich percussive colors and personal back-beat (as opposed to Sonny Payne's broader stroke) of Sam Woodyard.

A minor disappointment is the audio on this 2008 edition.  There's some breaking up of the sound during the climactic ensemble passages of the main burner, ""Battle Royal.""  Perhaps mine is a defective copy, because after the perfect sound of the digitalized and reissued ""Ellington at Newport 1956,"" a buyer would have the right to expect as much of a 1962 date.  Otherwise, the reissue presents complete tracks for the first time and adds 11 tracks to the 8 on the original album.  The notes are copious, informative, and frequently absorbing.

Like the Ellington/Coltrane meeting, this is not an Ellington essential, but then again it's one no fan of either member of the royal pair would want to be without.","This is not the cacophonous circus that two big bands playing together ( for the first time , without rehearsal , and in one 12 - hour session ) might have become .

But as radio versions usually do, it doesn't give justice to the album version. And like the special edition of The Abyss, some things are better extended.

Like I said, about the first four minutes of the song sound like a boy band reject song. It has good vocals, less than original lyrics and beat, and although it's not as bad as most of the stuff out there, it's kind of a passing song. Easily forgettable.

But get into the extended portion, and you get more lovely instrumental intrudes, and just general expansion that could be a considered a deleted scene in the movie world. And while it may not be much, it is a nice addition.

Overall, some stuff is better longer, and some stuff can't be short enough. This song is helped by the length, and makes the song sound fuller. Still not totally amazing, but still pretty good. Justin still has a long way to come around before he becomes amazing. Hint: Drop the duets with Beyonce and Fity Cent, you work better on your own.","As a radio single , this song was a passing car you had though you saw a million times in the form of Backstreet Boys and the like .

Not Trent Reznor. The Ghosts are truly something very new on a long-known but previously underdeveloped foundation. Consider ""A Warm Place"" off Downward Spiral or the opening to ""Something I could never have"" off Pretty Hate Machine. These were reminders that beneath (and even coexisting with) the screams and mechanistic vicissitudes that define industrial music, Trent Reznor is a consummate musician.

""Ghosts"" is fully a harmonic successor to the atmospheric movements on the very underappreciated ""The Fragile"". Consider the 1999 album's ""La Mer"" or ""Pilgrimage"" as opposed to ""Where is Everybody?"" or ""The Wretched"". Not to say that NIN isn't atmospheric, but rather that there are definitely tracks with an intentional message as opposed to tracks that are more meant for the listener to get lost in. Ghosts is clearly the latter.

This is not an album you'll ""get"" in one sitting. It would fail miserably if it were so simplistic.

AZKXH0J59TK11,B00158SHD8,1,-1,3,"Last year, Nine Inch Nails bounced back from the artistic decay that was ""With Teeth"" with ""Year Zero"", a record that I believe to be Nine Inch Nails' artistic high point, a dense but never fractured album that featured some of his highest production and some of his sharpest songwritting.
Now, only a year later, Nine Inch Nails and their leader Trent Reznor, who for all intents and purposes is Nine Inch Nails, have returned with the nearly two hour ""Ghosts I-IV"", a set of atmospheric instrumentals.
Now, if you would have told me even two years ago that the words ""prolific"" and ""Trent Reznor"" would ever, EVER be mentioned in the same sentence I would have laughed at you. But apparently after getting sober and getting the awfulness of ""With Teeth"" out of his system the man is just that. A total of thirty six tracks, ""Ghosts"" is as sprawling in ambition as ""The Fragile"", even without the accompaniment of vocals.
In fact, this new, quicker working version of Trent Reznor works much better for the music than the one who would spend a good half a decade pain stakingly going over every note. Like ""Year Zero"" last year, there is an immediacy to ""Ghosts"" that previous NIN records lacked. Though the record is dense and layered, it is never overblown with needless tinkering and a million small little pops and bells and whistles that can be found on earlier NIN products.
It's also nice to see Reznor in a True collaborative spirit, as ""Ghosts"" is co-written by Atticus Ross and Alessandro Cortino, NIN's current keyboard player. The difference in perspective helps give this record a feel different of any previous Nails album.
And let's all be honest with each other: the weakest point to any Nine Inch Nails record has always been the lyrical skills of Reznor. Usually clumsy, occasionally inane, Reznor lets the music do the talking for him this time, which is a nice plus.
So why only three stars for this record? Well, because at times ""Ghosts"" feels like a collection of ideas rather than songs. Though there is nothing awful on this record, there is also very little that is extraordinary, and it is too long for it's own good. The mood swings of the record are all complimented well, but too many song build and build and build and just stop, rather than fully taking off and entering someplace different and more interesting.
In fact, the best place to listen to ""Ghosts"" is probably in your car, late at night, driving home, where it can sink into your head but you're never really paying close attention to it.
But ""Ghosts"" is worth the purchase for sure. It's price, and the quality of good, if rarely great, music, and the fact that after almost twenty years Trent Reznor actually sounds like he's enjoying the process of making music.
Hopefully this is a series that he will continue to work on for many years to come.","Last year , Nine Inch Nails bounced back from the artistic decay that was "" With Teeth "" with "" Year Zero "" , a record that I believe to be Nine Inch Nails ' artistic high point , a dense but never fractured album that featured some of his highest production and some of his sharpest songwritting .

A9IZ4H60VZMMT,B00158SHD8,1,-1,3,"...Which is my only complaint with this record. I pre-ordered the whole thing over a month ago and got the free download. After a month of digesting, I must say that this really is not as musically redeeming as other NIN albums, and thats not because of the lack of vocals. I've always loved NIN since the Broken days and I think every album up to this one was great in its own way. To me, each track on Ghosts seems like an incomplete musical idea. As soon as one track starts to build and get interesting, it ends. Other tracks are just looped sound effects with no real variation. More than anything, this album is a fantastic showcase of electronic sound effects. I think its really cool the types of sounds Trent has made with his electronical synths and moogs, and other various toys. Ghosts really shows you what you are capable of doing with todays modern electronic musical equipment. Sadly, as a NIN album it failed to hold my attention, even as background music. I think if Trent were to take the strongest tracks here and have them fully realized into songs, then it would really feel like a new NIN album. This is an experimental effort only. But a cool one. Needless to say, I don't think its worth the $300 dollars (now $600 on ebay) for the special Ed with the Vinyl records. Bottom line, definitely get this if you are a NIN fan at all because it is a fun listen and there are cool sounds on here. Just beware, as the songs don't tend to go anywhere. Have fun.","...

A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,B00158SHD8,-1,1,4,"For a musician who has taken 6 years and 5 years between albums in the past, Trent Reznor sure is active lately, and we can probably thank the rising technical possibilities for working outside of record company strictures. But it's important to remember that Ghosts I-IV is NOT the next proper NiN release, and it should be viewed more accurately as a side project. Here Trent eschews lyrics and vocal melodies (his traditional Achilles heels) for 36 instrumental tracks that mostly provide atmospheres for not-so-easy-listening mood music, while highlighting Trent's sequencing and programming skills. It takes many, many listens for all of the tracks to differentiate themselves in your consciousness, but your patience will mostly be rewarded. Ghosts I-IV occasionally recalls the classic albums, delivering mood manipulation a la The Fragile (tracks #3, 11, 17, 28, 33); and surprisingly for this rather quiet collection, harsh Downward Spiral-like angst (#4, 8, 19, 23, 31). There are also a few experimental surprises that have not been heard from NiN before, such as weird bluegrass guitar (#14 - courtesy of Adrian Belew), pummeling rave (#16), old-school gangsta-hop (#24), bass-driven heavy funk-rock (#26, 27), and even vaguely Asian world music (#30).

But even with those occasional throwbacks and advances, many of the tracks on this release still have trouble rising above the pack. Primarily, almost all of the songs are just too short for their ideas to develop beyond basic introductions. In fact, just two tracks (#20, 34) feature more than one basic beat pattern or chord progression. And there are just too many weak tracks that turn moodiness into boredom - ranging from thin beat programming exercises (#9, 18), simple piano melodies propped up unsuccessfully with random noise (#10, 13, 22), and basic sequencer patterns that repeat to the point of absurdity (#6, 34). Of course, fans should feel as mellow and moody listening to Ghosts I-IV as Trent probably did while creating it. But at times there are just too many under-developed ideas vying for the listener's and the creator's attention.

Way too often that does not even encapsulate the feel or sound of the music/song or artist I am talking about.

Much like books, food , perfume- music is a subjective thing.  You either love it or you don't.

AYSLSU7966FWE,B0016679I8,1,-1,3,"I love everything Sevendust has ever done, and I loved the significant evolution that was heard on each of their first 3 albums. Since then, they've continued to put out quality metal, but it seems that they got stuck a few times in terms of direction. ""Seasons"" was an excellent album, but it didn't do much that ""Animosity"" hadn't already done. ""Alpha"" was also great (one of their heaviest), but it didn't do much that ""Next"" hadn't done. I prefer Sevendust when they're heavy, but I felt like ""Next"" and ""Alpha"" were slightly boring compared to earlier stuff...the songs weren't as diverse, and the chugging guitar riffs and the chorus vocals seemed a bit repetitive. Now we have ""Hope and Sorrow,"" the band's 7th album. It's a breath of fresh air, because we see the band getting back to incorporating melody again. ""Inside"" is a great opening tune because it's very heavy and also it sounds like the Sevendust we know and love. ""Enough"" offers a fun guitar riff that breaks the cycle of the chugging guitar riffs from the last 2 albums. The first single, ""Prodigal Son"" is a very basic tune, but it's catchy groove will get stuck in your head almost immediately. ""The Past"" is a mellow tune featuring Chris Daughtry doing some guest singing, and while it isn't a very strong track, it's nice to see the band playing with this style again.
Overall, this is a typical sounding Sevendust record, and it represents their general sound quite nicely. It's certainly not the strongest album they've put out, but I'm glad they are back to experimenting with different styles again. I think if they had put out another album that sounded like ""Next"" or ""Alpha"" it wouldn't be enough to hold my attention with all the other albums coming out this year.

A2VCKET09T30E4,B00168G2M0,1,-1,2,"This is the first album without Mick Taylor, and it shows. To use the title of one of their tunes from the Goats album, Black and Blue continued the mid-70s trend of the Rolling Stones ""Coming Down Again"" from the glorious heights of their '68-'72 Classic peaks. B&B is simply an uneven, if not amateurish performance, by a group touted as World's Greatest ROCK & ROLL Band.

This album has much more of a NON-rock & roll style. ""Hot Stuff"" is funky; reggae is evident with ""Cherry Oh Baby""; and ""Melody"" is a little jazzy. Tellingly, only one song from B&B managed to (barely) crack the US Top Ten, and wasn't even a Rock and Roll number (Fool to Cry).

No, this can arguably be considered a low point in the Stones' output from the '70s, especially considering that Ron Wood was still testing out his wings here as a new band member. The album DID manage to score some notable PR for the infamous Hollywood billboard in which a Jagger-bound young model was shown to say

""I'm BLACK AND BLUE from the Rolling Stones -- and I love it!""

The resulting firestorm from feminist groups probably added to sales of the album, despite the mediocrity of the tracks. The lads from London thus continued their notorious streak of controversy for being ""Bad Boys.""

One last thing....

Just wanted to make some corrections on reviewer Jarchow's comment ""Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording""

Technically incorrect.

-- The incomparable English pianist Nicky Hopkins played on numerous Stones' recordings, and on one or more Beatles recordings (e.g., ""Revolution"" from the White Album).

-- Guitar great Eric Clapton played lead ax on The Beatles ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" and recorded with Keith Richards and John Lennon on the tune ""Yer Blues"" for the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.

More technically correct, but still historically interesting, are the following:

-- One of the Stones played on a Beatles recording. Appropriately, this was Rolling Stones founder and talented multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who played alto saxophone on the B side of the Beatles' last single ""Let it Be."" The recording is a comedy-lounge tune called ""You Know My Name (look up the number)."" Jones was part of the recording sessions with the Beatles in early April 1967 for this composition.

-- One of the Beatles played on a Stones recording. That honor goes to none other than John Lennon, who jammed with Keith Richards (and Clapton, as mentioned above) on the Beatles tune ""Yer Blues"" for the Stones' 1968 Circus.

-- Head Stones Jagger and Richards joined the Beatles in recording their 1967 release ""All You Need is Love.""

-- Lead Beatles Lennon and McCartney joined the Stones in recording their 1967 release ""Sing This All Together.""","This is the first album without Mick Taylor , and it shows .

First, it has been available in very high quality form since Joe Pope released it on a series of 45s on his own Deccagone label in approximately 1974.  It then appeared on several LPs, two of which I own, in the 80s.  These were not ""bootlegs"" in the traditional sense.  They were excellent quality and were probably legal recordings at that time.

A3OO4WIO4SKD55,B000VZMRQE,-1,1,5,"This is the real ""Let It go"". On The Album, ""Just Like You"", you get the video edition of the song which removes about 50 percent Of Lil Kim's rap verse, Keyshia's add libbing at the end of Lil Kim's rap and the second chorus. If you have the album, I suggest buying this MP3. If you have the album on the an mp3 player, I suggest buying this MP3 and replacing it for the album track. This is also known as ""Let it go Extended"". As sucky as it was to put the edited video version on the album, I still think buying this mp3 in addition to the album is worth the extra $0.89 Amazon is charging for it.","This is the real "" Let It go "" .
