A1RXVSBGGRKIIW,7799420340,-1,1,5.0,"Good luck finding any artist or group putting every song hit on one cd - it just doesn't happen.
But if you want to buy a Cd with a lot of Michael's hits- you cannot go wrong with this selection.
Pricing was very fair."
AE9GUE3HHOX3U,7799420340,-1,1,5.0,"Who would have ever thought Michael Jackson would die in this era?  It doesn't seem real, he wasn't supposed 2 die.  This collection of hits is almost as good as buying all of his solo works.  I actually would rather have each individual album but I don't have time for all that and I already own hundreds of cds, so The Essential Michael Jackson makes the most sense, for content and consolidation reasons.  But I still would like the artwork and other tracks from the other cds but I just don't feel like buying them, so i just bought this.  I went to 5 different stores and they were all SOLD OUT.  I finally got the last copy but I had to pay $25.  I think alot of people are just buying this cd as a trinket, I actually want to LISTEN to the music, so stop buying it if you are just going to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it.  As for the music, I don't like any of the Jackson 5 stuff, it sounds dated and all the songs are overplayed.  I like ""Ben"", in my oppinion, that's the only good song MJ did when he was really young. They left out ""Never can Say Goodbye"" which is about the only good Jackson 5 song, so that sucked.  All MJ's other hits are on here from ALL the albums.  The only other song I'm pissed about is ""Jam"".  I wish they would have included that song, but I don't want to have to go out and find a copy of ""Dangerous"" just for that song.  Life is complicated and the music industry always makes it complicated for music fans. I wasn't really impressed with the pics in the liner notes, they could have included better, unreleased pics of Michael.  I am a Michael Jackson fan even though I disconnected with him and his music during the child molestation stuff.  Now that he died, I can feel better about paying him tribute and listening to his music again.  After all, I did a lip sync of ""Bad"" in full costume in high school drama class.  MJ was a part of my life.  God Bless u Michael, this world loved u.  *One last note....""Farewell My Summer Love"" should have been included on this cd, that song is probably impossilble to find.  I used to have it on 45."
A14GK0E64J0WAS,7799420340,-1,1,5.0,"In 2005, Sony released without much or any fanfare the terrific ""Essential Michael Jackson"", which easily is the best Michael Jackson compilation available these days. It also released a slightly different international version, which I recently picked up while in China. No, I didn't buy it from a pirated-CD hawking character on some street corner. In fact I bought it in a regular CD store in Shanghai, for all of 39 RMB (about US$ 5.50), if you can believe that.

The international version of ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:

1. The Jacksons' ""Can You Feel It"" replaces ""Enjoy Yourself"" (an improvement);
2. Somehow ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" (from ""Bad"") is lumped along with (and in the middle of) the ""Thriller"" songs on CD1, obviously not an improvement;
3. The title track from ""Dangerous"" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's ""HIStory"" second CD of new material are added (""Earth Song"" and ""They Don't Care About Us""), a wash as far as I'm concerned although ""Earth Song"" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How ""They Don't Care About Us"" ended up on the ""essential"" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).

Would I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover). That aside, ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" is a terrific album, whether you buy the US version or the international version, and it really showcases Michael Jackson at his best."
A1KNYQPZ1JQD62,7799420340,-1,1,4.0,"Michael Jackson is the biggest selling artist of all time. Also one of the greatest artists of all time. This is the 3rd greatest hits album in row. First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more. But that is why they released the Essential Jacksons. Disc 1 continues into all the ""Off The Wall"" & ""Thriller"" classics. Starting on Disc 2, it goes into all the ""Bad"" singles..the only one that was missing is ""Liberian Girl"" which was a single in the U.K., All the singles from ""Dangerous"" are here besides ""Jam"". I am not sure why the title cut ""Dangerous"" included. That should of been where ""Jam"" should of been. Also the final single from the ""Dangerous"" album is not included ""Gone Too Soon"". Now it starts to slip a little. We only get 1 song ""History"" & One song from ""Invincible""? No No!! Where is Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song & Childhood? From Invincible, where is Cry & Butterflies? and also his 2003 hit single ""One More Chance""? All of these titles are missing. Hopefully we will get a new album from him soon and not anymore greatest hits album."
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I,7799420340,-1,1,4.0,"Truth is, Michael Jackson needed a 2-disc collection as much as anybody. Those single discs didn't quite do it for somebody who's still often called the ""King Of Pop"". So, the pros and cons. I personally don't need the Jackson 5 material myself, but some might. I also think this is a bit shy on his most recent work. I do miss ""Earth Song"" and the duet ""Scream"" with Janet too. However, many of his best songs came from ""Thriller"" and ""Bad"", and we get most of those here. In fact there are 7 of the 9 songs from the original ""Thriller"" album, and even more from ""Bad"". Plus we get the best of ""Off The Wall"", and again some of his earliest stuff. The fact is, after listening to this collection of Michael Jackson, you almost can't not like him. It's just ""Human Nature""."

A26N27LJVQNVI1,9714721180,-1,1,4.0,"These single disc remasters were done on the cheap end. They didn't even bother to paint the disc. The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.

The three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it. I just wish they had given the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet. Bare minimum quality digipack, but it is low cost I guess. I just expected some kind of decent booklet with this remaster."

A356RFKNIG043B,9714721180,-1,1,4.0,"4 stars for what it is in the history of metal, 3 stars for how it now
compares to what it was back in the day.

In short: when this came out, heads turned and then banged, hard. Seemed miraculously heavy at the time, but of course this looks like Romper Room now after bands like Carcass etc (none of whom do much for me after a ""tune"" or two). I love True heaviness, which comes (to my ears) from extreme tightness between the drummer, bassist (kickdrum and bass locked in tight over the riff, specifically) and guitars. Here we have one of the great heavy rhythm players and a fine metal drummer.

But Lars and James are only half of this band. Kirk is WAY overrated as a lead player, very prosaic and uninspired, miles from someone like Randy Rhoads. And man, after the decades of Cliff-worship, this album proves that legend is often myth. The bass playing here is merely average, truly. There are dozens of heavier and tighter bassists; Cliff may have been a party monster and added to the vibe that way but his playing is average. Geddy, Geezer, Harris, etc etc etc blow him off the map.

  That said, there are some fast and furious highlights here, but frankly everything is so on top of or ahead of the beat that it gets wearing after a few tunes. About one minute into Bell Tolls is a highlight because everybody locks in but the guitars are finally a bit back in the pocket and everything gets much heavier and fatter due to that. That's why the Black album hit so hard: producer Rock knew how to make their groove much fatter and got them focusing on melody as well as heaviness. The Black is too poppy to be real metal but is good for what it is, as is this. But neither is as good as Puppets, which has their most intense moments.

  This is a great thrash album, but that genre gets real old if you want music as well as power. But if power and release is all you want, this will do it for you. But if you really want that, go to the various (FREEEEE!!!) Metallica tape-trading sites and get the live shows from this and later periods; that's where the real heaviness lays. Funny that the best stuff is free, ain't it? Who says life is always unfair?"
A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,9714721180,1,-1,3.0,"Metallica is boldly and appropriately named as it's virtually impossible to have any meaningful discussion about the Heavy Metal genre without any mention being made about the vast impact that this band has made over the 80s and up to the mid 90s.  They lifted up the genre from mindless, juvenile topics of wild sex, drugs and fast cars to discussions about serious topics from the meaninglessness of war to environmental disasters and so forth.  What U2 did for pop/rock, Metallica did for Metal in blending intelligent topics with very, very good musicianship and hence making the genre more accessible to a much wider audience than ever before.  In doing so, they extended the life of Metal and ensured an audience at a time when people were more interested in synth-pop ala Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones etc.  Metal owes a great debt to this band for ensuring the endurance and evolution of the genre to what it is to this day.

This version of the 1984 album comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very, very well executed and is one of the best that I've ever seen.  The gatefold sleeve is made from very good quality thick cardboard and assembled so well that you don't fear it coming apart easily once the glue starts to get old.  Also included is a 12 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese.  For the English ones you'll need a good magnifying glass to read it from the gatefold sleeve itself which very faithfully replicates the original lp design.

Unfortunately, the sound quality is the same as it was in the original release and hence has not been remastered.  Although good by 1980s standards, the quality is not as good as what we have become used to with all the releases that have been well remastered these days.  For this reason, although the content is very good, I cannot give this version 5 stars as it's hard to justify the value proposition here as you are effectively paying for the mlps design only if you already have the album.  I suppose if you don't already have this or if you are a big fan of well-designed and executed mlps sleeves then you may be tempted to cough up the mulah for this.  If the sound had been remastered and hence improved over the original cd, I would have no hesitation to give this the full 5 stars and to recommend that you part with your hard-earned dough for this.  With ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade To Black"" you are getting two of Metallica's best ever tracks here and again contentwise you can't fault this album but you'll have to decide if the overall value proposition of this version of the album is worthy of the upgrade."
A1EYSN1T55SV7U,B000002TTH,1,-1,3.0,"I give Queensryche credit for trying something different with this album.  Clearly the music scene had changed immensely from their previous smash hit release ""Empire"", and yet Queensryche went is a direction of their own--not following the trends of the times.  And yet, this effort falls a bit flat in my estimation.  Maybe I am just like others who are fans of ""Empire"" and the epic ""Operation Mindcrime"" and shouldn't expect the band to remain the same.  Nonetheless, the catchiness of previous efforts is clearly lacking.  The song ""Disconnected"", which actually did make it to rock radio for a brief stint, sums up this album perfectly for me.  The first single released, ""I am I"" is one of the better tracks."
A25PM9JGHPU8EI,B000006045,1,-1,2.0,"Teardrop, with the mesmerizing vocals of Liz Fraser, is the standout track - unfortunately the rest doesn't quite measure up. Don't get me wrong - Mezzanine is a very ""listenable"" album, something that works well playing in the background at night (some tracks work especially well for seductive exploits). It's just that the rest of this album sounds like second-rate Portishead."
A1HQWPU9DCL9Q8,B000006045,-1,1,5.0,"Massive Attack were one of the first gasps of trip-hop noticed outside of Bristol, and sadly they will be one of the last, it seems.  They are urban without the bounce and easy egotism of hip-hop.  They conveyed menace, but not the sinister pangs of angst echoed by Trent Reznor and Tori Amos during the same era.  They spoke volumes without words, and like Paul Oakenfold provoked an atmosphere, although Oakenfold reached for lofty heights while Massive Attack belongs in the darkened alleys and underground clubs.  Through its incarnations, Massive Attack has been an intellectual's house party in a 1930's brownstone in Chicago's Wicker Park, rain on the windows of a high-rise over L.A., and the smoke, mud and confusion of a college rave.

Mezzanine is complex, both within the tracks and in the connective tissue between them.  It is dark on the bright side, more a 4 a.m. flicker of streetlamp than a dawn of any sort.  Its power is in a balance of rhythm, drive and deep-seated anxiety that begs for further listen."
A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B000007UVW,-1,1,5.0,"OK, it may have started out as a great ""concept album"" in the mind of Sandy Pearlman. It may have grown into a Joe Bouchard solo album, which stretched out over multiple recording dates. It may have ended up as the ""final"" BOC album in 1988 because of the fact that Joe Bouchard was joined in sessions by Eric Bloom, Allen Lanier, Buck Dharma and Albert Bouchard.

So WHAT?

It's got the bone-rattling, truly unique ""The Siege and Investiture of Baron von Frankenstein's Castle At Weisseria,"" featuring Joey Cerisano and Jon Rogers on additional lead vocals and the unforgettable shout/chant/refrain ""CARPE DIEM"" followed by doomsday crashing riff-heavy guitars, and the opening track ""I Am the One You Warned Me Of,"" which is easily as good as any of the tracks on the early BOC albums.

There's also a remake of two songs from the second album (""Tyranny & Mutation""), ""Astronomy"" and ""Subhuman"" (which is retitled ""Blue Oyster Cult"" here).

Sometimes it pays to focus on what an album IS as opposed to what it ISN'T.

This one will shake the fillings loose from your teeth. It may be a patchwork quilt but it rocks like a mother, and the fact that it's back on CD is worth celebrating."
A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00000I7LP,-1,1,4.0,"I wanted an album so rugged, nobody could touch it, Eminem proclaims. If hes referring to rap albums, this LP might just be that. Ill say here and now, with no hesitation or reservation, that Eminem is easily the best rapper Ive ever heard. No popular rapper you can think of, alive or dead, even comes close. I mightve been saying the same about guest Royce Da 5-9 if he weren't upstaged by a rapper whose comedic wit, clever wordplay and sheer rhyme skills near genius.

There is very little filler in Eminems verses. Even when hes lacing them with unnecessary profanities; the Slim Shady persona is a deviant (white-trash) druggie who aims to offend; almost every two bars are a quality set and many of those sets are classic quotables. Unless hes cheating it somehow, his creativity is close to amazing. He even does his own sound effects. The beats are also impressive, so the albums only major drawbacks fall on faulty choruses and silly skits.

A1QJ5AX049KOGM,B0000564WK,1,-1,3.0,"The Left Banke were one of those groups who seemed to shine briefly but brilliantly and then fade into relative obscurity. That said, they did manage at least one better than ordinary album (this one) and an OK follow up (Left Banke Too), the latter release sadly missing the original group's principal songwriter Michael Brown. For all that these guys did record one of the best and most beautiful songs ever put down by anyone in Walk Away Renee and that is way more than many other musicians will ever achieve..

A28FNKCGFS03VL,B000MSTZV0,1,-1,3.0,"For those who may not know this, there are actually 4 Pointer Sisters, not 3, but second-youngest Bonnie (born in 1950) broke away to pursue a solo career which began with this album for Motown. She had a couple of sizable hits from it with ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"" and ""Free Me From My Freedom"" both of which are great songs. However, as a whole, this album is not quite on par with late 70s Pointer Sisters material, as nothing else on the album quite measures up to the hits."
A39P9MWS8L0FZH,B000MSTZV0,1,-1,3.0,"Bonnie Pointer made two solo albums for Motown and both were called BONNIE POINTER. One has her picture of her head with earrings on a red background, the other has a picture of her head with flowers in her hair on a blue background. (I call them the RED or the BLUE albums). There is different music on each, the blue has a few covers of older (mostly Mowtown)music, like JIMMY MACK. The track listing for this RED album is: 1: WHEN I'M GONE, 2: FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM, 3: HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, 4: AH SHOOT, 5: MORE AND MORE, 6: I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, 7: I WANNA MAKE IT (IN YOUR WORLD), 8: MY EVERTHING. / The song HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a single, it was even released as a ""Disco Single Remix"" with a longer disco sound. I've owned both the Red and Blue albums and I personally think the Red album is the better album."
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B000MSTZV0,1,-1,2.0,"The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.

 As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.

 So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.

 Released in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover. Songs: I CAN'T HELP MYSELF, JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES, DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL, COME SEE ABOUT ME, NOWHERE TO RUN."

A1WGUNGPYRR4TI,B000QZX5B0,-1,1,5.0,"Ok, people who are dogging the snot out of his album, do you really expect a band NOT to change their style?  If so, go listen to Marduk, Gorgoroth, Immortal, Nevermore or some half-baked crappy bands that bring shame to metal.  Any band that has potential and wants to keep their edge and notoriety needs to experiment.  They did a beautiful job with this album, and I love every song on it.  My favorites are ""Stabbing The Drama"" ""Nerve"" and the bonus track ""Wherever Thorns May Grow.""  I'm not saying that those who challenge them are wrong or stupid, I'm just saying that based on your reviews, you seem to want repetition and monotony.  Sorry, but True listeners don't want that.  You may as well just buy one album and not bother buying others.  This is a must have for all metal and Soilwork fans!!!"
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000QZX5B0,-1,1,4.0,"After spending the past few years getting all the nu-metal trash thrown at me, it seems that that fad has finally waned down.  This new ""metal-core"" fad in metal today will most likely suffer the same fate, but for bands like Soilwork, this passing fad may find them mainstream success.  After the disappointing ""Figure Number Five"", Soilwork return with ""Stabbing the Drama"", which is a vast improvement, and while it may not harken back to the ""Natural Born Chaos"" or even ""Steelbath Suicide"" days, this album still manages to be a more than solid headbanger.  The title track features an incredibly catchy chorus, while ""One With the Flies"", ""Stalemate"", and ""If Possible"" are great as well.  However, there are times on ""Stabbing the Drama"" that it sounds too mainstream aimed, especially on ""Distance"".  Despite that, and many of the negative reviews featured here, ""Stabbing the Drama"" is an intelligent metal album, which is something the genre so desperately needs with all the Killswitch Engage's and Atreyu's running around today.  All in all, if you've never heard Soilwork before, check out ""Steelbath Suicide"" or ""Natural Born Chaos"", and then give ""Stabbing the Drama"" a stab."

I really got the wrong version of this song; I would have rather had the original that he sang on a 45.  This isn't it; it is a LIVE version; it's not bad, but see if you can find the original if you know the song well.  If you never heard the original, this version is fine, but for most of us, we can distinguish the slight differences.  My problem was I was not paying close enough attention; you only get 30 seconds to make up your mind, and this version sounded pretty good for the first 30 seconds."

See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again. Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours.
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:"

Artists and bands like Badly Drawn Boy, Coldplay, Turin Brakes, and Travis are embracing folk music and incorporating it with pop and rock. Kings of Convience is the next band to come out with a cd filled with melodic folk/rock. A lot of reviewers has compared this band with the late artist Nick Drake which I can totally hear through out the entire cd.
To be perfectly honest, I really don't know what to make of this album so far. I have only listened to it twice. Compared to Turin Brakes, I much prefer Turin Brakes over Kings of Convience. I found this cd a bit too mellow for my tastes. Even Travis rocks out on a few songs on their latest album.

A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000TE71FE,-1,1,5.0,"The guitar work makes this song; it's the kind of song you want to jump up and dance to, but if you hear it too many times, it loses its appeal (so play it sparingly is my philosophy).  One of the things that makes this song really great is the use of brief interludes of no song (the beat?).  Anyway, this is one song that if I play it too much, I lose interest in it (kind of like a strong spice, a little goes a long way)."

AAEA4STR27PN2,B000TECDFM,-1,1,5.0,This is one of my all-time favorite songs! This was when rap/hip-hop was fun! There was gangsta rap for those who liked it and the pop side.

It is very refreshing to hear great MUSIC along with a great voice - the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is because although Javier is a new artist, his voice sounds almost exactly like Eric Benet and I found myself comparing their voices as I listened but overall, this is a great addition to my collection.
My favorite songs are: Crazy, Beautiful U R, Song For Your Tears, Biggest Mistake, If I Never Get To Heaven, She Spoke To Me, In Your Hands & October Sky."

Been there down that&better in most instances. He is Talented but I don't hear a Knock out song as much as I Hear tight Music.when He gets Words&Music as One then He will escape being labeled in a box with others. He is a Talented Cat though&the Future Looks Promising but a Song like ""Crazy"" is cool for now but with Artistic Growth he pass that by Leaps&Bounds over time."

An instrumental work, this is four minutes and ten seconds of pure guitar nirvana. Rock fans of all stripes will appreciate this track.

That being said, the actual Amazon MP3 download isn't clipped well; it has a fraction of a second from the previous song at the beginning so that you hear an out-of-place guitar at the 0:00 mark. I had to listen to the track several times to make sure it wasn't just me, it goes so quickly. Any rudimentary audio editing program can clip this out, but it's still enough to knock off a star."

She's at an age where these timely songs make an impression and stick with them. For me, it would have been a tune like Ghostbusters or Rock me Amadeus. I get the appeal, even if I don't appreciate it so much. I won't begrudge her enjoyment of it. But I can call it like I see it, and I'm pretty sure it will be forgotten in short order. It is danceable though, so until then, enjoy!

AJ5V9EBLVBHAW,B000URYSW4,-1,1,5.0,"When ""Mothermania"" was released there were already several compilation albums of The Mothers Of Invention floating around. Except for ""Mothermania"", none were compiled or approved by Frank Zappa. On FZ's only approved ""best of The Mothers"" collection, we get four unique mixes of four songs, which makes this release essential for the Zappa fan who needs EVERYTHING! ""Mother People"" has the verse that was censored out of ""We're Only In It For The Money"" (which includes the wonderful lyric: ""Shut your f-----g mouth about the length of my hair"". ""The Idiot Bastard Son"" features a short intro that was trimmed for ""We're Only In It For The Money"", and it also omits the mid-song dialog that ruined the flow of the song. ""Call Any Vegetable"", which consists of three parts and runs about 8 minutes on ""Absolutely Free"" is trimmed to a more digestible 4:23, by omitting most of part 2 (""Invocation & Ritual Dance Of The Young Pumpkin""). Finally, we get the alternate edit of ""It Can't Happen Here"", which has the piano ballet interlude removed, and adds an extra line of FZ's dialog with Suzy Creamcheese. For me, as a Zappa fanatic, ""Mothermania"" on CD is a long awaited, essential collection."
A1X93ES4DITTWK,B000091NES,-1,1,5.0,I love the orignal version of the song as well as the New Jack Swing Remix. I don't care about the other remixes. We need more one hit wonders like Jane Child instead of these so-called artists who want to stay around for years and years and put out [...]. Hoolllaaa!
A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000091NES,-1,1,5.0,"This groove wore out the turntable when I first got it.  Not only was the single version one of the best songs of the late 80's, the New Jack Swing remixes took the song to a higher level."
A1MH8L9TVKMYDN,B000V616JC,-1,1,5.0,"I greatly appreciate having an actual ""hit"" song available for two bits (.25). It's about
time someone actually cared about the consumer & made available songs this cheap. My only
wish would be to have more songs available for this price on an regular basis. iTunes is
unable (or incapable) of providing songs to download at this price point."

I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.

But youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.

I guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs."

AQ4B80F0JSBNI,B000V63C7G,1,-1,3.0,"Well, yes. And I don't apologize. Don't get me wrong, I love Patsy Cline as much as anyone among the many 4- and 5-star reviewers so far, and I really regret breaking the string of assessments. But the fact is, there are many, many more superior compilations available now than this MCA release from 1988 which re-issues an earlier vinyl LP produced by Owen Bradley.

For a few dollars more you can pick up one which has all 19 of her Country hit singles registered between 1957 and 1982, the last ten posthumously following her death in that March 1963 plane crash.

Also, like far too many of the early compilations, they chose NOT to give us the original version of her first hit for Decca in 1957, Walkin' After Midnight. That version went for 2:30 and reached # 2 Country/# 12 Billboard Pop Top 100 in May. What they give you here was a re-recording done in August 1961, shorter by almost 30 seconds and performed at a slightly faster tempo.

The rest are all originals although, technically, tracks 7, 10, and 11 were not among her ""12 greatest hits"" which is, after all, the title of this album. Back In Baby's Arms was the uncharted B-side of Sweet Dreams (Of You), Why Can't He Be You? was the uncharted flip of Heartaches which, not included here, made it to # 73 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in 1962 (but failed to make the Country charts - go figure), and You're Stronger Than Me was the uncharted flip of So Wrong in 1962.

In addition to Heartaches, legitimate hits left off this volume were the B-side to Walkin' After Midnight - A Poor Man's Roses, Or A Rich Man's Gold [# 14 Country] - the double-sided 1962 hit When I Get Thru (You'll Love Me Too)/Imagine That which reached # 10 Country/# 53 Hot 100 and # 21 Country/# 90 Hot 100 respectively, When You Need A Laugh [# 47 Country in 1964], and He Called Me Baby [# 23 Country in December 1964 and her first immediate posthumous hit].

In 1969 her rendition of the old Eddy Arnold hit, Anytime, reached # 73 Country, followed nine years later by Life's Railway To Heaven which topped out at # 98. Two years after that, in 1980, a release of her cut of the old standard Always went all the way to # 18, followed in December by a re-mix of I Fall To Pieces [# 61]. In late 1981 her duet with Jim Reeves on Have You Ever Been Lonely (Have You Ever Been Blue?] soared all the way to # 5, and in 1982 yet another version of I Fall To Pieces, this time dubbing her voice with that of Jim Reeves, was a # 54.

With the insert you do get two pages of background notes written by Jay Orr and Don Roy, a chronology of Patsy's all-too-brief life, and a list of session personnel involved on each of the 12 tracks. But while these features and the AAD sound reproduction makes this a nice, inexpensive, sampling of Patsy, MCA can easily turn it into a 5-star offering by simply following the lead of others who re-released earlier 10- and 12-track CDs [Elvis, Donovan, Sarah Vaughan as examples] with bonus tracks."
AYOO12C9Y2T95,B000V63C7G,1,-1,3.0,"I won't quibble with what's here songwise....it's a pretty good set of Patsy's music. All but 2 of her Top 10 country hits are here (no ""When I Get Through with You"" or the pasted together duet ""Have You Ever Been Lonely?"" with Jim Reeves.) In all, 7 of these are top 10 hits from the country charts.

Soundwise, I'm sure it was fine at the time of release. However, since then, advances in CD technology have made it possible both to fit more songs on a disc (up to 80 minutes) and remastering improvements have made the sound quality you can achieve, even on ""vintage"" recordings, much better.

BOTTOM LINE:
For these reasons, I'd argue that your best choice if you want only ONE disc of Patsy's music is THE DEFININITVE PATSY CLINE (ASIN B000002X0P). But if you know you can't spend much money, the used price can't be beat."

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000V64LIA,-1,1,4.0,"Let me start by saying that this is a great song, and I actually like what Timbaland did with the it, and actually prefer this version to the original. However, why did Timbaland give OneRepublic (the band that made the song), a ""featured"" spot. The guy just remixed the song, and added his voice to the background. Is that deserving of taking credit for you making the song? No. I mean, I'm not the biggest Timbaland fan mind you, I like ""The Way I Are,"" but really, this is an undue cheapshot. But, if he hadn't done this, then OneRepublic probably would have taken forever to put out their stunning debut, so in a way, it's actually a good thing. Still bad, but good came out of it.

Overall, the song is still pretty great, and it deserved to be #1. But support OneRepublic and go buy their album, ""Dreaming Out Loud."" It's a great CD that has this song, and the original, and enough other stuff to please most everybody."

But their second  Something More which kicks off the cd.  Was the reason why I went ahead and bought this cd.  A good uptempo song.  With lyrics that I think everyone can relate to at one time or another in their lives.  Just Might, and Down In Mississippi were also hits.  From the first time you listen to this cd.  You knew they were going to be big.  And losing a member didn't slow them down at all.  Hello, Fly Away, Small Town Jericho and Speed Of Life are all done very well.  After this I haven't bought all of Sugarland's cds.  I have a couple of others.  They are all good.  And I don't know if they are ever going to get back together.  I'ved heard there was some talk about it.  And I don't know if they could just pick up where they left off if they did.  But I am really surprised after all their success.

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000V66YS0,1,-1,3.0,"This is another song I like from Steely Dan, it isn't as good a Do It Again; but it holds it own.  It is still a good song but if your expecting something along the lines like Do It Again you will be disappointed. It is more of a pop song, a little mello, so if you are only into rock it might not be for you. I like it; but I also like pop, rock, rap, some Country. So I would recommend you listen to the sample on Amazon first. It might be a song you like, but I always say test the waters before you take the plunge.

A1KNYQPZ1JQD62,B000V6980Q,1,-1,3.0,"I have always been a huge Janet Jackson fan and this was the first album I ever purchased by her. I was a fan of the song ""Come & Give Your Love To Me"", after purchasing the album, I later found the 45rpm as well. But this album was Janet's first and did not sell to well. It has sold approx. 400,000 copies in the U.S. and about 600,000 worldwide. The album peaked at #63 on the Pop Charts and #6 on the R&B charts. They do have a few standout tracks, such as ""Young Love"" and ""Come & Give Your Love To Me"". Those were the first two singles but barley cracking the charts. Another good track is, ""The Magic Is Working"". Of course, this album does not compare to her masterpiece ""Control"" or anything after that. But I would still recommend this to any Janet fan!"
AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B000V6980Q,1,-1,3.0,"I remember this very well from high school. It came out several months before a certain brother of hers (no, not Tito) blew the world away with the biggest selling album of all time.

For the most part, this is synth-pop filler all too typical of the early 80s on the verge of the dark ages of Black music. But some nice tunes really stand out. ""Love and My Best Friend"" sounds a lot like the certain brother's ""Ben,"" but is really nice in it's own right. ""Forever Yours"" is a nice ballad which gave some indication of what was to come, but I really liked (and still have a fondness for) ""Young Love,"" especially where she does the really sweet scat singing at the end.

Overall, some good stuff that makes it interesting for more than just historical reasons. Buy used."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B000V6980Q,1,-1,2.0,"""I got this Album when it first came out because I dug ""Say You Do""&.""Young Love""this Album though on a whole had some moments&interestingly has a More Grown Up vibe that alot of the stale stuff She has done in recent Years IMHO.the Sound&Production was good for the time period. I like this Album better than Her ""Dream Street"" AlbumThe ""All 4 U"" Album. Janet wasn't too bad on Here Vocally it was passable....."
A3RC3AK8UN89I9,B000V6980Q,1,-1,3.0,"This is where it began, the career of Janet Jackson, she was 16 at the time of its release, and who knew that she would acheive so much in her career. While this certainly isn't her best work, and it didn't receive much attention, its still a fun album to listen to. The songs are infectuous. The album is very Jackson sounding, with songs like Say You Do, Youll Never Find (A Love Like Mine) and Young Love, and theres also some ballads here like Love And My Best Friend, and Forever Yours. Her voice isn't that strong here but its still nice, I mean this is her debut album and she didn't hit it big until Control in 1986, but this is still worth checking out."

A3AGA80TQCWSIA,B000V6ADNW,-1,1,5.0,classic.
A21QD3LJIKOZO0,B000V6ADNW,-1,1,5.0,"Since everybody knows how big this album was and how much drama that surrounded it, I'll give a brief review of the album,

On ""Intro"" there is no rapping or talking, all we hear is a coin drop, following that we go into the next track produced by Rob ""Reef"" Tewlow, ""What Up Gangsta"" and the beat is sick especially when it first comes on, The good doctor gave fif a hit with ""In da Club"", you couldn't go anywhere without hearing the song or somebody just rapping the lyrics ""Go shorty, it's your birthday/ We gonna party like it's your birthday!"" The other singles were ""21 Questions"" (featuring Nate Dogg), its one of those would you be down for if I didn't have this type of song. ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" is the best song on here. On ""Back Down"", he also throws more shots on ""Heat"" the Dr. Dre's beat is simple, it has a constant guncok sound. Em shows up twice, on ""Patiently Waiting"" where he easily outshines Curtis and ""Don't Push Me"", also featuring Lloyd Banks. On the latter Em is rapping about the same stuff as 50 but he doesn't get called out for it? Double standard? But on another note it was a dope track. There are some missteps on here though ""Blood Hound"" (featuring Young Buck) was just too boring for me, the pimping anthem ""P.I.M.P."" cant even be saved by his catchy hook. His braggadocios raps brings the down the album as well, at least switch it up sometimes! We know you got 9 times, we know you went from noting to something tell us something we don't know. As for the bonus tracks ""Wanksta"" took him to another level, it appeared on the G-Unit mixtape then the 8Mile sdtk, ""U Not Like Me"" and ""Life's on the Line"" were out before he was even signed. Overall I think 50 dropped a classic album and lets not try to rewrite history, this was biggest album of 2003. If you do buy it I suggest getting a used one for 5 dollars or less. I heard all 50s album and trust me this is the one worth checking out besides Power Of The Dollar."
A8SCX6VUTE05H,B000V6ADNW,-1,1,4.0,"Yeah it's True that this was the most overrated release of 2003. But it's also True that this was the best album that he has ever made(next to Guess Who's Back). Every wack album after this proves it. In Da Club was a huge record for him and Many Men, Wanksta, What Up Gangsta pretty much kept this album afloat. Eminem makes two dominating appearances on here(Patiently Waiting and Dont Push Me). Eminem floored 50 on Patiently Waiting and Both Em and Lloyd Banks leave 50 in the dust in Dont Push Me. Back Down while overrated was a good diss record towards Ja Rule and Murda Inc but they could have kept Alex Thomas fruit basket a** off of the record though. Gotta Make It Heaven is tight as well as the three bonus tracks: Wanksta, U Not Like Me and Life's On The Line. Contrary to popular belief this album is not a classic. Blood Hound feat Young Buck is weak. Like My Style feat Tony Yayo is straight garbage and Poor Lil Rich, P.I.M.P., and 21 Question feat Nate Dogg have filler written all over them. By the way, the bonus DVD is not worth mentioning. Other than that, this album was good but way overhyped. Even though GRODT is overrated in comparison to what came after it, GRODT is one of the few G-unit releases worth mentioning. Standouts: WHAT UP GANGSTA, PATIENTLY WAITING, MANY MEN(WISH DEATH), IN DA CLUB, HEAT, IF I CANT, BACK DOWN, DONT PUSH ME, GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN, U NOT LIKE ME and LIFE'S ON THE LINE."

A3RV0VQKIM2HSW,B000V6ADNW,1,-1,3.0,"I think when people approach this cd they should do it without thinking of all the hype surrounding him. Now honestly the beats to me hands down were all hot like many cds today. As for the lyrics though only half the songs were good. I really rate this a 3.5 but if he talked about more things than just the typical I would have given it more stars. I cant hate on 50 cents even though I see a lot of other reviews doing just that. These things are his life experience (which just happens to be the same experience of many others) and like other artists he just put it into his music. Now whats good here?:
*In da Club
*What up Gangsta
*Patiently Waiting
*Many Men
*If I cant
*P.I.M.P
*Poor Lil Rich -- One of the tightest beats on the cd
*21 Questions
Overall 50 gave you himself as best as he could on this without pretending to be anything else but 50. It is not the best cd ever made like the media has hyped it to be but it is a good cd and anyone who likes hip-hop/rap over hot beats will like this. Lyrically its not the best but at least half the songs he shows you how to put both lyrics and beats together."
A2K150EBPF8LT7,B000V6ADNW,1,-1,2.0,"Honestly, I like 50 Cent as a rapper; he has a certain honesty to him that is lacking in most rappers today. When I heard that he was signing with Dr. Dre and Eminem, I was happy for him; it was certainly the best career choice he ever made, since this has sold 4 million plus albums. But one provision though, the only reason he is in mainstream culture is beause he is associated with Eminem, which will guarantee platinum status(think D12). As far as the music goes' it gets stale and repetetive after awhile. Wanksta is a great song; not for the lyrics, but for his approach towards the fakes and phonies of the rap world. But I love 50 anyway, and God bless him in future projects."

This on the other hand, is something else entirely...

It's such a sad song. A song that seems to have such little hope for the protagonist (I'm not sure what they're called in songs). She will Be Loved is about a guy who loves a girl who has some sort of issue. Either she is mentally unstable? Used by other people in wicked ways? Etc. This scenario dooms the protagonist to this longing for a person who he will never get... because she can't respond. Not that she won't. She CAN'T.

It's a very sad song that has little hope.... but that's life. It doesn't always turn out great for us, and this song reflects that. It has a great tune to it that sounds like the protagonist's fate. Adam Levine has a great unique voice that brings home the lyrics. And the story itself (a plot worthy of a book, i should add) is heartbreaking.

Buy it... but don't expect a happy ending, lol"

I guess I'm best off looking to youtube, as the cast recording, while impeccable, can not possibly recreate the audience's experience. In retrospect I wouldn't expect it to, unless it was one of the live performances, eg Les MIz.
The vocals are fantastic, but for me, the context and the shock of what is physically happening to Elphaba is what took my breath away.
So take this for what it is, a studio recreation of a classic Broadway moment. But look to the Youtubes for some of the Widked performances or even concert footage of Idina Menzel performing ""Defying Gravity"" to bring back the emotion experience you remember from the show."

In the case with Bon Jovi, they've tuned down the feeling on their latest record, in regards to a more somber feel, as with regards on their latest single. You Want To Make A Memory, the opening single from Lost Highway is a elequent melloncollie song that reflects on heartbreak and divorce, similar to what Richie Sambora had went through the past couple of years. the song really shines nicely as a down to Earth song that deals with empty and being lonely. Although it doesn't have the edge to bring in new Bon Jovi fans, it works nicely for those die hards who want to make more great memories.

A2J8WWG4W0OFYQ,B000VJ3BYC,1,-1,3.0,"The truth is, I don't own this particular CD, but several reviewers are mistaken about the facts of this material.  First, it has been available in very high quality form since Joe Pope released it on a series of 45s on his own Deccagone label in approximately 1974.  It then appeared on several LPs, two of which I own, in the 80s.  These were not ""bootlegs"" in the traditional sense.  They were excellent quality and were probably legal recordings at that time.  I don't know if there has ever been a legal release of this material on CD, but there are at least two (probably many  more) really good quality bootleg CDs that contain this material, in True studio quality, with no hiss or surface noise.

Finally, there are 3 original Lennon/McCartney songs: Loved of the Loved, Hello Little Girl and Like Dreamers Do.  While not lost classics by any means, they provide a valuable glimpse into their really early writing style."

Radio-friendly pop-punk, that would be the best and most accurate description of ""all killer no filler"", which took the world by storm mid 2001 with its single ""fat lip"". Chances are, unless you were living under a rock, you've heard that song, and their other radio friendly hit, ""in too deep"". Although sum 41 has shifted their style since the release of ""all killer"", this band never fails to amaze, and getting any album from them is worth your while.

Upside: ""Fat Lip"" is perhaps one of the catchiest and most original pop-punk songs I've ever heard.

Downside: The album is a little short, and fails to live up to it's name with the :49 second filler song ""wake up"".

You'll like ""SUM 41"" if you like: Blink 182 and Green Day."

A3GKMK6KQH3Y1H,B000VRQPLA,1,-1,3.0,"This is a promising debut, all right, and Luke Reynolds' lead vocals definitely fall into the ""achey-breaky"" school that was practically founded by Chris Martin.  Some of the songs are memorable, especially the title track, ""Boxcar Racer"", and ""Every Ship Must Sail Away"".  And the instrumentation is at times gorgeous, with excellent fiddle and mandolin work; in fact, that's when the band really shines.  Steven Harris' production defintiely leaves some Dave-Matthewisan footprints, and that's fine with me, too.  So what's the problem?  The CD as a whole just doesn't excite me - much of it has a pleasant familiarity and all the excitement of Keane's debut (in other words, capable but not artistically challenging).  I'm still waiting for a new band this year that will knock my socks off, and these guys only gave my socks a gentle tug."
A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000VRQPLA,1,-1,3.0,"Blue Merle's debut CD has some very good things going for it.  The band's sound is kind of mellow folk-country-pop that has an appeal.  Lead singer Luke Reynolds has an expressive moan in his voice that communicates longing, sadness and desire.  The great weakness of the disc is that the tracks blend facelessly into each other without any jumping out as truly memorable.  Their sound is impressionistic with emphasis on atmosphere and mood, a wonderful rainy day disc.  ""Every Ship Must Sail Away"" is a good example of the aching groove in which the band revels, ""Cause years pass & people change; the bluest skies can turn to grey.""  ""Boxcar Racer"" has a nice jazz groove and a distinguishable melody & is one of the better tracks.  ""Either Way It Goes"" also gets a bit of energy, ""I didn't mean to let you down, but sometimes even angels hit the ground.""  Ultimately, Blue Merle show promise and have a nice sound, but now they need to hone their songwriting skills to make tracks that stick in the memory.  Enjoy!"

A2HWD9PTM7RBXN,B000VWLEC0,1,-1,3.0,"A Single Man is a big improvement over Blue Moves.  Just the first few tracks proves that.  Love the Big Dipper tune with its jazzy arrangements.  Shine On Through is one beautiful ballad.  And Song For Guy is soothing to the soul. The piano touches are quite special.

Elton explores many styles on this recording as opposed to sticking with a constant arrangment as he has done on previous recordings such as Caribou and Madman Accross The Water.  This is a good thing.  Howeve, the last few songs are pretty unmemorable in the hook department.  Others midway through the record have pleasant arrangments but lack a strong melody.

Therefore, this is a good recording but not on the same level as Elton's prime time era or even The One or Too Low For Zero."
A3GTI1Z7YE49ZS,B000VWLEC0,1,-1,2.0,"""A Single Man"" by Elton John is a hard one to evaluate. On the one hand, the songs are mostly good ones; and the production is super sweet! Very soft and understated. But Elton's vocals are mostly dis-engaged and generally charmless.

""Return to Paradise"" might just be; what with those beautiful Falsetto vocals, ""Georgia"" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up ""Tumbleweed Connection"". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs ""Madness"", ""Reverie"" and ""Song for Guy"", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; ""Madness"" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; ""Reverie"" is brief but effective, and ""Song for Guy"" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.

The other songs aren't bad. ""I don't care"" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun. ""Part-time love"" is the best of the rest, a pumpy little tune with a big production. Not a bad album, Rating **1/4 or 2.25"

The beats and rhythm in the song sound like a merry-go-round would sound if music went with it.  ""Merry-go-round,""  ""Around"" the way..""  anyway, he is rhyming about making passes at girls while walking down the block, most likely in Jamaica, Queens where he grew up.

On The Album, ""Just Like You"", you get the video edition of the song which removes about 50 percent Of Lil Kim's rap verse, Keyshia's add libbing at the end of Lil Kim's rap and the second chorus. If you have the album, I suggest buying this MP3. If you have the album on the an mp3 player, I suggest buying this MP3 and replacing it for the album track. This is also known as ""Let it go Extended"". As sucky as it was to put the edited video version on the album, I still think buying this mp3 in addition to the album is worth the extra $0.89 Amazon is charging for it."

AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000VZQHNS,-1,1,5.0,"Nelly Furtado completely remade herself in 2006.  Her earlier work, including hits ""I'm Like a Bird"" and ""Powerless"" were fun and entertaining songs (and Nelly is a very attractive, appealing artist), but they didn't excite the mass audiences.  They had more appeal to the Adult Contemporary chart.

  2006 saw the debut of her song ""Promiscuous"", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take ""Promiscuous"" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This set the tone for the remainder of her album ""Loose"", which showed her new image to be genuine instead of posed."

All of the songs have a different mood on the album, but on your first listen you might feel underwhelmed like I did for the first maybe 6 times I heard this album. Then it all sinks in.

'My Favorite Mistake' in particular, the first track talks about a relationship that is almost just for show and not working out well. Even Sheryl admits it's a ""mistake"".

One for the repeat button.

4.5 stars or a 9/10."

  Bridge: The beginning of this part kinda sounds like dribbling basketballs. And don't forget kids, ""Go for the moon!

  Verse 3: I'm confused at a little part. In the middle, are they saying, ""Gent's room,"" or, ""Gas. Well,""? why don't you comment and tell me.

On the other hand, if I listened to this song more than a couple of times in the same day, I probably would turn it off as it does get a little monotonous. There's no heavy message, and it is a passable dance song."
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000W03ITI,-1,1,4.0,"Over the years, we've had our share of rock/pop, pop, and who can forget power-pop, but Fall Out Boy brings back, if it was ever gone, Power-Rock. In this case, FOB goes for a breakup song, which most creative in the song title, is written in TXT MSS. Thankfully, the song is not sung in that. In style, this song resembles 'Arms Race' a little to closely, but differs in minor, but better, changes in the verses and chorus. Also, the song sounds a little better when Patrick Stump sings solo.

So overall, while it's not a bad song, it's not a great one either. But it is a great power-rock song."

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000W05EGI,-1,1,5.0,"The ethereal sound was created by laboriously building up multiple overdubs of the voices of Stewart, Graham Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing a single note in unison. This multi-track was then mixed and dubbed down onto 16-track tape. This process was repeated across all 16 tracks to create a lush 256-voice ""virtual"" choir that could ""sing"" chromatic chords.[2] A number of these prepared multi-tracks were then cut into several endless loops, each of which contained the basic notes of the main chords used in the song. The chorus loops could then be played by using the mixing desk rather like a keyboardeach chord could be sounded by bringing up the fader for that loop. The instrumental break featured the repeated spoken phrase, ""Big boys don't cry..."", spoken by Kathy Warren, the receptionist of their own Strawberry Studios where the band recorded the track. These whispered lyrics would later serve as the inspiration for Brit  group, The Cure, who had an album and song called Boys Don't Cry. Axl Rose has also stated that this is one of his favorites which inspired him to get into music."

What we have here are some half decent songs, that whilst not awful, are a par down on what we are used to from this artist. On to many of these songs, they all merge into each other. Only a hardcore fan/lover of quiet storm moment would fine anything of any value here. I never had my copy for long, giving it to my big Sister, who loved all things Johnny back then.
As for the more the more up-tempo songs, 'I know you Want me is OK' as is 'So gentle'.

A24P8BEJ26FU01,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3.0,"RnB/Soul singer, India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002. Most sophomore albums by other neo-soul artists, such as D'Angelo and Macy Gray (note that I haven't heard either of these albums) were deemed by fans to have fallen to the dreaded sophomore slump so India Arie had a lot to prove. India Arie proved she had undeniable talent with her debut album, both lyrically and vocally and most fans tend to compare the two albums. On both, India Arie wrote or co-wrote all the songs and she writes about meaningful topics such as self-respect and communication in relationships. On her sophomore album, ""Voyage To India"", India Arie provides her wonderful lyrics and vocals in songs that seem to tell what many women are thinking of, rather than being self-reflective as she was on her debut.
India Arie starts her sophomore album off with a short intro, just over a minute in length, called ""Growth"" which states that the only thing that is constant in the world is change. It's a somewhat pointless intro, but the statement she makes is definitely True. The second track is an mid-tempo song called ""Little Things"". As expected by the title, this song talks about appreciating the little things in life such as a ""call in the morning from my little sister singing me happy birthday"". As with most of India Arie's songs, the lyrics are not complex but are beautiful in their simplicity. Next comes ""Talk To Her"", a somewhat preachy song about how to talk to a woman. India Arie instructs the listener to treat the woman with respect and ""talk to her the way you want someone to talk to your mama"". In other words, talk to her respectfully no matter what she's wearing (""It doesn't matter if she's wearing a miniskirt or a business suit""), a message that desperately needs to be heard in today's society. The song also talks about the importance of respect and communication in relationships.
Afterwards comes the mid-tempo ""Slow Down"", a debatable album highlight. The song speaks about taking life day by day and not rushing through everything. The lyrics are once again simple yet beautiful. It's about remembering that speed isn't always the best way to achieve your goals. Next comes the romantic ""The Truth"", with its lyrics seemingly half-spoken, half-sung (more like spoken to a tune). Nonetheless, a sweet, romantic song about what India Arie loves about her man. The next song, ""Beautiful Surprise"", has a similar theme about finding love when you least expect it. It was written by India Arie alone and really shows off her talent for songwriting. After comes a short interlude, ""Healing"" which talks briefly about releasing all sadness from you. Like most interludes however, it is not too memorable.
Subsequently come two songs about moving away from the pains of the past, ""Get It Together"" and ""Headed in The Right Direction"". ""Get It Together"" is another somewhat preachy song that talks about having to get it together to heal your body and heart. It is a beautiful song when you listen to it but in the grand scheme of things, it does not stand out. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" fares much better, probably because it is more upbeat however it is fairly short compared to the other songs on the album. After that comes ""Can I Walk With You"" is an album highlight that seems to talk about taking friendship to another level and it is probably my favourite song on the album. Then comes ""The One"", a very overused song title but this is probably one of the better songs of that title. Lyrically and vocally it is a unique (in a good way) song but it is also quite short.
Next comes ""Complicated Melody"" another romantic, metaphoric song that compares India's man to colours, numbers and songs. It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice. Otherwise, it adds little to the quality of the album. The song, while it sounds nice, is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons. Following this comes another interlude, ""Gratitude"" which is not much different from the other two. Then comes another highlight, ""Good Man"", another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album. India's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well. The second last track, ""God Is Real"" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album. Finally, there is the bonus track ""Interested"" which doesn't stand out at all compared to the other tracks. The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great.
Overall Mark: 3/5
Although this is still a great album, ""Voyage To India"" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie's debut so good. The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other. As a whole the album sounds great, but when you break it down, many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and, of course, different lyrics. India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists, like Jewel (similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop), so memorable. The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable."
ABE14SVILZLNY,B000W11N6W,-1,1,5.0,"With the surprise double-platinum success of 2001's Acoustic Soul, India. Arie became that rare bird -- particularly in contemporary R&B -- who straddles the line between artistic innovation and schmaltz. Certainly a talented guitar-playing songstress, she also takes her lyrical cues from Hallmark cards, a mix at once comfortable and off-putting -- and difficult to put one's finger on.
This follow-up, seemingly rushed into stores, doesn't clear up the confusion; as with Alicia Keys, it's almost impossible to criticize a contemporary urban artist who writes life-affirming, organic songs, yet this journey ends as unconvincingly as Soul or Songs in A Minor. What's more, it lacks any sort of knockout number -- Soul had two, ""Video"" and ""Brown Skin"" -- leaving us to wonder just where Arie intended on taking us.
Which is not to say that the potential isn't there, only that balance is not. Is she the younger visage of Tracy Chapman (""The One,"" ""Power of Words"")? Channeling Chaka Khan on two gleefully old school steppin' tracks, ""Interested"" and ""Slow Down""? When she takes her own advice to ""live for the moment,"" she gets better results: ""Get it Together"" is a swirling slam-dunk of a love song, and ""Good Man,"" an overlooked track off the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, makes a nice fit here. When she comes off preachy, it's with treacly results: ""God is Real"" and ""Little Things"" are cloying bits of armchair philosophy.
Voyage is at its most interesting, and often its best, when Arie tries to come from out of the shadows of her influences and chart her own path. Though she stumbles on ""The Truth"" trying to incorporate slicker R&B-style beats into the mix, the titular Spanish folk tinges of ""Headed in the Right Direction"" says it all, as does ""India's Song,"" which could have been the album's most overwrought track but instead perfectly mixes Chapman's subdued introspection with Woody Guthrie's wide-eyed folk. These are the tracks suggest the voyage isn't over; it may have only just begun."
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3.0,"It's amazing what a few Grammy nominations can do.  India. Arie's debut album of folk-laced soul didn't break any new ground, but it was an overall appealing mix of catchy tunes and positive messages that were a welcome alternative to the talk-show/men-bashing lyrics of her ghettoized peers.  And even though she walked home empty-handed on Grammy night, her debut album, ""Acoustic Soul,"" enjoyed robust multiplatinum sales.  Expectations are naturally high, and I hoped that her followup ""Voyage to India,"" would be a musical and lyrical step forward from her debut.  While the album is thoroughly listenable from start to finish, ""Voyage to India"" just doesn't serve a platter filling enough to stick to your ribs.  Arie has her heart in the right place, and her intentions are noble, but the truth remains that she's a passable lyricist, often resorting to ""love yourself"" cliches that become one-dimensional.  And while the music is pleasing, the folkish, acoustic-based melodies and choruses seem a bit predictable.  However, I really dug ""Little Things,"" the sincerity of the love song ""Beautiful Surprise,"" and ""Get it Together.""  While ""Voyage to India"" is an okay album, it pales in comparison to better, superior albums we've heard in the last year from ""Cookie"" by MeShell Ndegeocello, the flawed yet fascinating ""Unplugged"" set from Lauryn Hill, and ""How Do I"" from Res.  Ultimately, it's a ""Voyage"" that takes off promisingly without ever reaching its final destination."

I ordered this one because of the song Rescue...great tune. The cd itself is disappointing, though. I realize we all go through changes and I believe this cd was put out during/after her move to LA? Seems like she was really going through some down time (I could be wrong about this) This cd is so very depressing and repetitive.....only on a couple of tunes do I hear a break out or some power within the music. I'll continue to buy her music that's for sure....this is just not a cd I'll be listening to very often."

A1ANRKHR4QWXJU,B000W1UOTY,1,-1,3.0,"This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto."

A2HWD9PTM7RBXN,B000W20FY2,1,-1,2.0,"My title is kind of blunt isn't it?  However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies.
The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.
After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.
Dear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment."

The only difference is that Marilyn Mansons version is a grittier/darker remake.  Im guessing-from reading online meanings of the song-that the basic summary behind Marilyn Mansons version is the controversial notion of a person witnessing both people being abused and those that are the abusers themselves (which Im guessing can apply to either personal or professional/career settings).  I myself am lucky to have a loving husband so fortunately this song is not life imitates art for me.  However, Im intuitively collecting this song as a way of understanding the shadowy/dark sides of human nature for my professional storytelling career aspirations."

A25KDGSE2EVYXY,B000W21ER4,-1,1,4.0,"This is Weezer's first ever album, and I think it's pretty good. I think Raditude might be my first favorite. I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin' tune to listen to, but it's not quite hard-rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.

""My Name is Jonas"" might be a song about the singer's brother, since the actual singer's name is Rivers. A punk rock song with a light guitar intro. The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first.

The Amazon sample for ""No One Else"" says ""My girl's got eyeballs,"" but the whole line is ""My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head."" The music is fun, catchy, and a little simple.

""The World Has Turned And Left Me Here"" is so Weezer-y, you can almost immediately tell who sang it if you hear it for the first time on the radio. I would've given it a 5/5, but it kind of got old after a while.

""Buddy Holly"" is Awesome! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly? Kinda, kinda not.

Next comes ""Undone"", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.

""Surf Wax America"" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.

Next comes ""Say It Ain't So"". This one has everything that a Weezer fan would like; Pretty good lyrics, rockin' chorus, guitar solo, and it's really catchy. Say it IS so!

Somebody said that ""In The Garage"" this one is an anthem for nerds/ rock 'n' roll lovers, and I might have to agree. It's my favorite song on the album. I like the intro because it sounds so different from the rest of the song. [Is that a bagpipe?]

""Holiday"" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure. Yes, it has a middle section, but much louder and better than the one SWA had.

""Only in Dreams"" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5/10]

Now for the bonus tracks:

For ""Mykel and Carley"", I'm not so sure who Mykel and Carley are, but the song was great! It had a guitar intro that reminded me of the intro for My Name is Jonas. Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band's newest album, Death to False Metal.

""Jamie"" is Just boring. Enough said.

However, ""Susanne"" is Another great hit from Weezer!]

Finally, we have ""PaperFace"". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it."
A19I5KZQM3CA6W,B000W21ER4,1,-1,1.0,"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?

To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.

After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.

On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.

A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):

I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.

If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as ""You're just jealous!"" or ""I'd like to see you do better!"" or ""How is it in your parents' basement?"" or ""You must jerk off to your computer!"" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:

""Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!""

FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.

To those of you who would call me ""pretentious"" or ""music snob"" or ""self-righteous"" or ""self-absorbed,"" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is ""simple,"" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:

""Devil's Night Out"" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" by The Sex Pistols
""The Essential Heart"" by Heart
""Highway To Hell"" by AC/DC
""Meat Is Murder"" by The Smiths
""The Strange Case Of..."" by Halestorm
""Greatest Hits"" by Tom Petty
""Complete Greatest Hits"" by The Cars
""Ugly"" by Life of Agony
""Remain In Light"" by Talking Heads

As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!

I also wish to point out that arguments such as ""Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!"" or ""You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!"" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)"

I suspect it was connected to some commercial or another.  I liked the tune a great deal and wanted to have it in my collection.  But if you want rabbit stew you have to have a rabbit.  Without knowing the song title or the artists it was an uphill battle.  By memorizing some of the lyrics I was able to Google to lyric sites and it wasn't long before I got what I needed.

There are a few covers of the song out and about, but I rate the La's version a strong B+ and the Sixpence None The Richer version a solid A.  But I decided to buy both and they are a great addition to almost any rock/pop collection."

A10KCGSDJJAVRO,B000W3TI6C,1,-1,3.0,"These versions of many blues and soul standards are all fine, there are a couple of Freddie penned trax as well.  I've read the quibbles in the All Music Guide and thru out the Freddie King reviwes listed below, but I still really like this music.  Yes Leon's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix, and the strings and backing female voices occationaly over power King's playing and mar and date the arrangements, but it's soooo good, even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie.
.
I'd suggest picking up the 2-disc ""KING OF THE BLUES"".
That CD contains all of these cuts and then some; about 60 in all, in a generous package.  There are only a handful of songs that are not up to par and some that are so good you will wonder why you did not already have King in your blues collection.  For those looking for a blues CD beyond Freddie's vintage 1950's classics, see ""KING OF THE BLUES""."
A2INX8B6VXUVW6,B000WAJIE2,1,-1,3.0,"Back in the the mid-1960s, Capitol Records signed an almost-60-years-old housewife to a recording contract, for some reason.  She was Mrs. Miller, who sang with a quasi-operatic soprano.  She mostly recorded cover versions of recent pop hits.  She often went off-pitch, and sometimes she fell behind (or got ahead of) the beat.  She sang with more vibrato than Tiny Tim, and occasionally she would perform bird whistles.  Of course, the whole thing was a joke by the record company.  It's pretty funny, although it wears a bit thin after a while.  I don't think too many people can take 21 songs by Mrs. Miller!  But if you can't get enough of Mrs. Miller, this is a pretty comprehensive collection."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000WCZW7M,1,-1,3.0,"The past few years have really brought out anew for pop star Amy Grant. She had moved back into her Christian roots well with her core audience, but unfortunate, she hasn't been able to click with newer music buyers. Since her A&M catalog was recently moved over to EMI, on her label Sparrow. While so many acts have done well with a new label in catalog sales, Amy still has a long way to return to the success she had a long time ago. A few years ago, it was well said with her previous hits package Greatest Hits 1986-2004 which did very well with the actual appeal. Now that she has another hits package, does Amy Grant really have the appeal she once conquered with record buyers?

Amy Grant's 2007 Greatest Hits mixes in a bit of the old and the new that Amy had delivered well from her 90's pop mix, to her contemporary mixes of soul and Christian music. The songs have been remastered nicely, and tries to deliver nicely as a re-introduction to Amy to a whole new audience. The collection includes some of her great gems like Every Heartbeat and Baby Baby, to her contemporary Christian classics like Lead Me On and Father's Eyes. While the collection works fairly well for new fans, it misses a few great songs from her pop era that worked better from her previous hits package. The collection overlooks a few great tracks like The Next Time I Fall, her often overlooked duet with former Chicago singer Peter Cetera, as well as The Things We Do For Love, which she did for the Ellen Degeneres film Mr. Wrong, and her delightful cover of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi from House Of Love, which had a very colorful video, and a better beat than when Joni recorded it years ago.

All in all, Amy Grant's Greatest Hits isn't a bad collection though, but it just doesn't deliver like the A&M days really did, or her previous Greatest Hits 1986-2004 album, which unfortunately is no longer in print. Hopefully, there could be a better hits collection that could attract Amy's great pop days like that one did, but this one could've had more to be desired, and that makes it a missed heartbeat.

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000WCZW7M,-1,1,5.0,"With three decades of music under her belt, Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections.  And while they are both great, there was no place to find a sample of her entire career.  Until now.

This disc is an attempt to collect the hits from Amy's entire career, and it does a remarkable good job.  With just nineteen songs, it hits all the highlights.  It includes ""Simple Things,"" the title track from her last major studio release and ""Old Man's Rubble"" from her self title debut.  In fact, it includes at least one song from each of her major studio releases (not counting the hymns projects or the Christmas releases) except for her third, ""Never Alone.""  Heck, it even includes ""Stay for Awhile.""  That song originated on Collection and went on to become a hit in its own right.

And there are plenty of classics here, from ""Baby Baby"" and ""Saved by Love"" to ""Thy Word,"" ""El Shaddai,"" and ""Father's Eyes.""

Having said that, there are some drawbacks.  Fans who already own all her releases will find absolutely nothing new here.  All nineteen tracks have been previous released.  While they have been digitally remastered to sound better, I must admit I don't notice the difference.  Of course, when you are getting almost an hour and twenty minutes of music, this is being picky.

An equally picky point is the over representation of ""Heart in Motion.""  I know it was her biggest release by far.  But it gets five tracks, which is about a quarter of the disc space.  And, to be honest, it's not my favorite of her releases.  Seems like one or two could have been cut to include a song from somewhere else.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"" didn't make the cut.  That would have been a good switch.

Finally, there's the timing.  Amy's last two releases have been a greatest hits and a live disc.  I know she just changed record labels, but I would have preferred to see this after another studio release.

In reality, these are all minor quibbles.  Any fan of Amy's music will find lots of memories in these nineteen songs and be glad to have them all in one place."

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000WKT6B2,1,-1,3.0,"For the music of 1994, the scene changed immediately, from Grunge to Hip Hop. In the case for Boyz II Men, they became even more popular then the boys from Philadelphia. At that time, they became bigger than most of the manufactured music out there. Although they started big, the ballads they were making were explosive.
The 1994 album, II became the most successful R&B album of the decade, selling almost 14 million albums, and launching 4 smash hit songs including Water Runs Dry, I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, and Thank You. At that time, they really proved that the music spoke for itself, not an image among all boundaries. The style blended beautifully with similar artists like The Temptations, The Four Tops, and even The Jackson 5. Nevertheless, they actually were at the very beginning of the Corporate Pop era that lead to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. Luckily, the music wasn't locked into Teen Idol stardom, which made Boyz II Men one of the most popular groups of the 90's.
It is kind of sad that a lot of teen acts that are out there aren't mature enough like Boyz II Men. It is just incredible to know that some acts constantly can't capture that era. Hopefully, the next True Soul group, can recapture the legacy Boyz II Men set."

Now we've dropped below 45 songs, but that re-recording of Runaway is still one of them. This package is still a great value, but for sneaking in this clunker, I can only give it 4 stars.

On the other hand, it's a darned shame that at least a one unmarked re-recording snuck into this set. Runaway is obviously not the original version.
