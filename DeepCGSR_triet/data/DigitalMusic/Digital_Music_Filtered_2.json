CocKayne","reviewText":"One of the best songs from the glam band Europe , another song they wore out playing on the radio . I was in 7th grade when this hit came out . I remember some of my friends and I before school would start walk the halls singing this song . I mean you do crazy things when your 12\/13 years old . The reason why I like this song , I guess it 's because its not like other glam band songs , this one sounds different . I like the lyrics and the beat is n't the same copycat beat you hear from some of the other glam bands . I recommend this hit to any glam band fan , 80 's music fan or anybody looking for that old school sound .","summary":"The Glam Band Sound Is Still Alive And Well In The 21st Century","unixReviewTime":1441065600,"image":null}

Cracked has a sketchy record when it comes to recommendations , in my opinion , but given that I loved most of the other songs on this particular list ( \" Eye of the Tiger , \" \" Do n't Stop Believing , \" \" Holding Out for a Hero , \" \" Love is a Battlefield , \" etc . ) I 'll just say ... if you 're an unabashed fan of cheesy ' 80s poodle - hair rock , you will love this song . :D \n\n There 's nothing subtle whatsoever about this song . From the triumphant and soaring synthesizer opening to the epic guitar and drum riffs , this song 's instrumentation is the epitome of goofy ' 80s rock . The lyrics , while simple , are also rather nonsensical , seeming to hint toward a group of astronauts leaving Earth but otherwise defying easy explanation . And the lead singer 's voice is nothing to write home about , though at least he actually tries to carry the tune and does n't just yell into the microphone . And yet somehow , this all WORKS . It 's a goofy song , yes , but it 's the kind of goofy that leaves a huge smile on your face . It 's a song that 's completely over - the - top but in the best possible way , and you ca n't help but want to bang your head and sing along when it comes on . I have n't listened to anything else by Europe -- and from what I understand this is their only real hit -- but they sure hit a home run with this number . This song has found plenty of new fans thanks to \" Arrested Development , \" but even if you 've never seen that show , it 's almost impossible not to like this song . It 's not the greatest hit of the ' 80s , but it sure is one of the most fun ... and yes , one of the most terrifyingly epic .","summary":"Goofy and over-the-top but epic and entirely enjoyable hit of the '80s","unixReviewTime":1439942400,"image":null}

But with time and space , the song has still been as iconic today , as it became a hit back then . When I had heard Fall Out Boy do a cover of this definitive song , Ray Parker Jr. & Huey Lewis got credit for in the 80 's , and the original version is n't bad after all this time . It is definitely one of those movie songs that has still stood the test of time , in the way other movies songs like Purple Rain did for with the late great Prince and Footloose for Kenny Loggins as well .

I bought one CD ( Hotel Paper by Michelle Branch ) which I ended up giving to my daughter - it was good , but sort of ordinary ... My second try netted Wreck of the Day , the right one , and it was worth every bit of effort and two purchases . This is an awesome song , and every song on the CD is excellent , too . I just hope my 5 stars lift this track up to where someone else might find it and discover Anna 's incredible voice and superior songwriting .

I purchased this song for a special occasion , that being my mother 's funeral . It was requested by my daughter because she said my mother and her were recently talking about how it reminded her ( my mother ) of my her and my father who passed away 14 years ago . This song is in itself a classic . Few country singers today can match the voice of Alan Jackson . Sometimes there are certain songs by certain artists that stick in our memories and bring a smile on our faces and this is one of them . Both of my parents were big fans of Alan Jackson and I am as well . Many of his songs bring me back to the days of hearing my dad singing them . This song is one that will always stick out to me and bring that smile as I think of my parents and \" Remember When ... \"","summary":"Remember When - Alan Jackson","unixReviewTime":1482192000,"image":null}

Now I 'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz ( which by definition IS fusion , like in Fused On ) no , I 'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro - Latin Gumbo Rock ! Artists like Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye , The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra , Santana , Traffic , Pink Floyd , Genesis , even Yes and ELP ; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor 's stable of jazz giants . Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers ' label ( not represented here of course ) got word of mouth disease , it was jazzy , funky , rock - drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago , this music was not a stretch at all , especially if you were also a fan of War , with or without Eric Burdon . So this groovy 17 - track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential . The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order , not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music . Listen to Ca n't Hide Love and try not to think about \" smooth jazz \" a decade later , way ahead of its time , way ! This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide . It contains all of The Best of Earth , Wind & Fire ( 1978 ) save the weakish Love Music , six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2 , and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story ( from Open Our Eyes , ' 74 ) and the title epic from Gratitude ( ' 75 ) . Even if you have most of their studio releases , how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life ! The CD comes with full music and track credits , a terrific bio ( The Eternal Groove ) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in - depth history ( The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks ) all packaged with some beautiful artwork ( always a staple of EWF albums ) . Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group , full of positive vibrations and inner peace , Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it . Get a heaping helping right here and you wo n't regret it .","summary":"A Fusion Like No Other!","unixReviewTime":1506902400,"image":null}

Grace Slick ( as was Stevie Nicks ) was , and still is by most of us early rockers , the Queens of Rock n ' Roll ! \n\n White Rabbit was one of Slick 's first songs written by her , and she brought it over from The Great Society ( a band mostly associated with the Acid Rock era of 1965\/66 ) when she joined Jefferson Starship in 1968 . It was a huge hit for Starship with Grace Slick doing some of her best vocals ! Long Live Starship !","summary":"Long Live the era of real Rock n' Roll, the 60's and 70's!","unixReviewTime":1405814400,"image":null}

I must first start off by saying how much I love the fact that that Three Days Grace manages to turn a song about love involving pain into a genius art form . This is another fun song that I have on my zune player and I like how he expresses himself when he sings lyric such as \" trust me and take my hand \" \" when the lights go out you will understand \" and then the song pauses for s split second before he belts out pain among the right timed guitars to help break the pause . He raises his voice some times during the songs but he does it at the right times in the songs such as in the end of it and at one of my favorite moments in the song when he sings \" I 'm always here for you \" \" Iknow , I know , I know , I know that you 'll thank me later \" . The lead singer 's awesome voice goes perfect with this song . Anyhow , the interesting thing about this song is that if you would like to listen to a sensual erotic song that falls under the hard rock \/ alternative rock genre then this song would be a must have in your musical collection . but I am still enjoying it and I am glad to have it as part of my musical collection .

It has released a number of greatest hit compilations so far , but this one is most suited for ordinary music fans who have never bought any of EW&F albums . Earth Wind and Fire is regarded as a disco hit maker because during late 70s to early 80s the group had produced such tracks that might fit well for disco - dancing from slow ballad AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE to dance - pop BOOGIE WONDERLAND and LET 'S GROOVE . But up until mid 70s they created some great spiritual songs with ethreal out - of - the - world chorus . CAN'T HIDE LOVE is one of the good examples to show their chorus style . FANTASY is by far the most successful single release in Japan . KALIMBA STORY and MIGHTY MIGHTY are the funky pop songs representing their early days ' music style .

Sherwin","reviewText":"Earth Wind & Fire : Greatest Hits has many hits that I remember from when I was a kid in school ; it brings back a lot of memories for me . This is a strong single CD compilation although as others have noted it does n't give you every last one of their hits . However , what we do get is very high quality control music from Earth Wind & Fire ; and that 's great . The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that artwork , too . This came out and hit the airwaves big time ! Earth Wind & Fire simply never sounded better . They really handle this well ; they never skip a beat nor do they ever let go of a superfluous note . The tempo and key changes make the number strong ; and they sing this very well . \" That 's The Way Of The World \" quickly shifts gears for a much more mellow sounding tune ; this features the group squarely in the spotlight -- right where they belonged and still belong ! \" That 's The Way Of The World \" was always one of my very favorite Earth Wind & Fire tunes ; and I think just one listen will tell you why -- this is all THAT good . \" September \" has an awesome beat that would even get the dead tapping their feet to the rhythm ; \" September \" was yet another huge hit that got a lot of airplay when it was originally released . I still hear it sometimes on an \" oldies \" radio station in my area ; and that 's grand . \" Got To Get You Into My Life \" is one heck of a snazzy tune ; they make this a masterpiece and they deliver this with a lot of feeling . In addition , \" Sing A Song \" has them harmonizing to perfection -- and beyond ! \" Sing A Song \" is another major hit on this CD . \" Serpentine Fire \" uses the percussion to great advantage ; and of course another big hit for this group is \" Fantasy . \" \" Fantasy \" charms me with its beauty and it 's truly a stand - out on this album -- how could they ever get better than this ? I 'm amazed . \" Mighty Mighty \" has quite a beat that gets you up and dancing nearly wherever you are ; and listen for \" Reasons . \" \" Reasons \" has a mellow , pensive flavor to it that is absolutely stunning -- and the backup singers harmonize well . \" Let 's Groove \" is another tune that still sounds good all these years later ; and I really like \" Boogie Wonderland \" which Earth Wind & Fire performs with The Emotions . \" Boogie Wonderland \" was a huge success for these artists and I still love to hear it today . \" After The Love Has Gone \" again showcases Earth Wind & Fire at their mellow best ; and the album ends strong with Earth Wind & Fire performing \" Getaway . \" \" Getaway \" has a strong beat that makes me want to dance ; and it also leaves me wanting so much more ! This is a great album for fans of Earth Wind & Fire , but if truth be told they would need other CDs to have all of the hits from this fantastic group . This album is particularly good for the casual fan who wants most of their hits on one single CD ; and it makes an excellent starter CD for people just discovering the fine talents of Earth Wind & Fire .","summary":"got to get them into my life","unixReviewTime":1241654400,"image":null}

It was the group 's signature song , their first # 1 hit single and still remains their most popular song ever . The Highwayman tells the story of death and rebirth in four parts , and each part is sung by a different member of the group . The first three characters ( Willie , Kris , Waylon ) meet their deaths and are somehow resurrected . Johnny 's character has already left his former life and is in the process of being reincarnated . His character may also represent all of The Highwaymen . Along the coach roads I did ride \n With sword and pistol by my side \n Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade \n Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade \n The bas***ds hung me in the spring of ' 25 But I am still alive \n\n Kris : \n\n I was a sailor . I was born upon the tide \n With the sea I did abide \n I sailed a schooner around the Horn to Mexico \n I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow \n And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed But I am living still \n\n Waylon : \n\n I was a dam builder . Across the river deep and wide \n Where steel and water did collide \n A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado \n I slipped and fell to the wet concrete below \n They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound \n But I am still around ... I'll always be around \n\n Johnny : \n\n I fly a starship across the Universe divide \n And when I reach the other side \n I 'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can \n Perhaps I may become a Highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain And I 'll be back again ...","summary":"THE LEGEND...","unixReviewTime":1221004800,"image":null}

Containing most of the band 's hits as well as lesser known tracks that are just as strong , Greatest Hits is the perfect introduction to this talented band 's music . Simply put , every track here is top notch with most of them hitting the Top Ten on both the pop singles and black singles charts . The tracks \" Mighty Mighty \" , \" Saturday Nite \" , and their only # 1 pop single \" Shining Star \" are excellent funk songs punctuated by their trademark snappy horn lines . The tracks \" September \" , \" Serpentine Fire \" , and \" Sing A Song \" are near perfect pop songs with soaring harmonies and melodies that stay in your head immediately upon first listen . Their late-70 's hits \" Let 's Groove \" and \" Boogie Wonderland \" are very strong disco tracks with the former track aging wonderfully compared to most of the music from that genre . While the harmonies are strong on all of their material , harmonizing does n't get much better than on \" Getaway \" , arguably the finest song they 've ever recorded . The ballads here are all fantastic with \" After The Love Has Gone \" , \" That 's The Way Of The World \" , and \" Reasons \" being not only among the best recorded in the ' 70s , but of any era . Other great tracks here include their cover of the Beatles ' \" Got To Get You Into My Life \" , \" Fantasy \" , and \" Kalimba 's Story . \" This is a phenomenal greatest hits album that should be part of every music fan 's collection . Highly recommended .","summary":"An excellent compilation of an extraordinary band","unixReviewTime":1090800000,"image":null}

Their heavy horns , infectious rhythms , and disco overtones are nothing short of an all - out party , and the digital remastering some of their best - loved tracks are granted here make the aural results all the more delicious . Funk workouts like \" Shining Star , \" \" Let 's Groove , \" \" Boogie Wonderland \" and the classic \" September \" are solid , irresistible works that age like fine wine , and silky ballads like \" That 's the Way of the World \" and \" Reasons \" proved that they could be twice as smooth even when the tempo was half as fast . The band even offers up one of the strongest Beatles covers ever recorded , an irresistibly bright reading of \" Got to Get You Into My Life . \" But their hands - down masterpiece will always be \" After the Love is Gone , \" a simply - perfect cut that boasts flawless vocals , lush horns , and a striking chord progression . Of the songs that were n't crossover smashes , some are revelations ( \" Mighty Mighty , \" \" Saturday Night \" ) while others simply are n't up to snuff ( \" Serpentine Fire , \" \" Kalimba Song \" ) .

He is also considered one of the great stylists and innovators on his instrument , forging a unique jazz - based rock style that propelled his supergroup through 20 top ten hits , 16 million - selling albums and numerous sold out concerts around the world for millions of fans . After Danny was \" fired \" by the group in 1990 , he went into seclusion and put his drums aside . Following years of production projects in the sudio and even Broadway , Danny got back into form in recent years with the inspiration of top industry musicians . His jam sessions resulted in the formation of \" CTA \" and now the release of this studio work with a wonderful mix of Chicago classics and originals and other rock standards . Every track works and every track cooks . Danny 's drum chops are back intact as he leads this band of top flight musicians with the amazing Marc Bonilla on guitar and Tower of Power 's incredible Larry Braggs on vocals . Yes , Danny Seraphine is back , back with a vengeance and showing the world a return to the original musical inspiration that made the early Chicago great . While his former bandmates earn a paycheck entertaining the wine and cheese crowd with Peter Cetra covers like \" If You leave Me Now \" Danny and CTA are playing real music for the sake of the music itself and blowin ' the door down . \" California Transit Authority \" is a superb CD and is a must listen for all Chicago fans and fans of rock music in general . The current members of Chicago could also stand to listen to this exciting work as a reminder of what they set out to accomplish musically in 1967 , while using \" Chicago XXX \" as a coaster for their drinks .","summary":"Danny Seraphine Returns With a Vengeance","unixReviewTime":1217116800,"image":null}

And by the way , does anybody else think that an inspirational song from somebody like Avril Lavigne , who is not the best of role models , is just plain wrong ? In either case , the song does n't work , except on a lyrical level , and even that 's been done before .","summary":"Inspiration From A Punk Rocker","unixReviewTime":1204329600,"image":null}

Still not there ? Oh well ... This song , her last real song that anybody would pass more than a horrifying glance at her . And while not her best vocally , you just ca n't get away from that beat . Congrats , kudos , and bravo to the producer that created that , because it is simply amazing . Perfect for spy movies , and when it was used in \" Chuck , \" and it 's just so darn catchy . You know the opening chords , you know the riff , it 's all familiar , and lovable . She 's okay , normal dance club fare . Nothing special vocally here . Just a beat , and a music video ! So overall , you might want to skip the vocal version , and just get the instrumental version which I am just lovin' up on now . So hurry , get it , use it as a ringtone ! Or use it next time you ca n't get the James Bond \/ Mission Impossible Theme for your secret spy activities . By the way , some great covers have been made of this song , and most of them come out surprising well . Some offer a different take , some are fun , some are strange to say the least . Hard - Fi did a great low - fi indie cover of the song , which all but removes the original melody , and just keeps the lyrics , while adding some car effects . Nickel Creek did a great humorous live performance that you can find in various places . In that version , one of the band members readily admits , \" This song kicks a*s ! \" And Yael Naim did a cover of the song , which is very strange and haunting .

I realized this was a departure from the simplistic arrangements I 'd come to expect from Britney , it was actually full of layers of sound and lyrics that had something to them . I know somebody reading this will say , \" huh ? \" when I 'm talking like this but I actually think there 's some substance to this song , even a challenge to Britney 's usual music . It 's cool if you totally disagree but I think that it 's a great pop song , whatever that means to every individual person .","summary":"Total guilty pleasure","unixReviewTime":1399939200,"image":null}

Unfortunately , for Celine Dion , she has been hit with so much sadness in her personal life from two devastating passings n her beloved heart . One of them is the sad death of her brother Daniel , whom died of cancer at 59 years old . Another one is the heartbreaking news that her soulmate and manager Rene ' Angeil died after a severe battle of throat cancer that hurt their love and tore them apart . He battled in 1999 and survived , but it came back to take him for several years . When I think of Celine 's sadness , I think of her song My Heart Will Go On from Titanic . It is one of those songs that really do strike you at the soul of the heart , and even more with the recent death of James Horner , and the hypnotic song that really grabbed you . Celine 's heart will go on , but the heartstrings of her loves will always be in that song .","summary":"Heartstrings","unixReviewTime":1452988800,"image":null}

She was NOT like any other artist out there . She was wacky , creative , quirky , fashionable ( check out her various outfits ) and did n't take herself so seriously . Quite simply , Cyndi just wanted to have fun . But before she became a megastar on the pop map , she had previously fronted a rock band called Blue Angel . They put out their first and ONLY record in 1980 . It really IS worth checking out . Once Cyndi became an actual solo artist , her first order of business ( aside from being on MTV ) was to recruit another band called The Hooters . They helped her launch 5 mega smashes on her 1983 debut , \" She 's So Unusual . \" First , there is the opener , \" Money Changes Everything . \" Cyndi showed the world who was boss and that she was n't going anywhere . Next was the most important staple , \" Girls Just Want To Have Fun . \" The whole indescribable nature of the song was what got her noticed in the first place ( most notably on Dick Clark 's American Bandstand ) . Then there was the much more serious ballad \" Time After Time \" , which remains one of my personal favorites to this day . This album was only the tip of the iceberg of what would catapult Cyndi 's 30 year career longevity . In 1985 , she released 2 tracks for The Goonies movie :   the theme song ( \" The Goonies ' R ' Good Enough \" ) and the much faster rocker , \" What A Thrill . \" A year later , Cyndi spread out her artistic talent even further with \" True Colors . \" Each song was a hit on its own , and Cyndi had A LOT of guest stars ( The Bangles , Billy Joel , Aimee Mann , and even Pee Wee Herman ) . The title track and accompanying video is another one of my personal faves . In 1988 , another minor hit :   \" Hole In My Heart ( All The Way To China ) \" from the movie Vibes . It 's a VERY elusive song to find , if that is even possible . I actually got it from an 80 's compilation disc on eBay several years ago . It 's just one of those feel good songs that you really need to have ! ! ! Next came 1989 's \" A Night To Remember \" . Cyndi was becoming much more serious as a songwriter and performer . \" I Drove All Night \" had a much more rock feel to it , and it proved that Cyndi was indeed evolving . Sadly , this was the only real hit on her record ; in hindsight , the rest of the songs deserved MUCH more appreciation and should not have been cast aside . What about \" Unconditional Love \" or \" Heading West \" ? ? In the 90 's , Cyndi would release 3 more records . By that time , she was getting even deeper into her artistry and would even release some non - album tracks . For example , you may be familiar with the ethereal 1992 's \" The World Is Stone . \" In 1993 , Cyndi re - teamed with the Hooters for some delicious tracks on \" Hat Full Of Stars . \" There were , again , some minor hits :   \" That 's What I Think \" , \" Who Let In The Rain ? \" , and the lilting , hushed title track which is still another of my personal faves . Unfortunately , the album was n't getting the right amount of airplay . But that never stopped Cyndi at all . She kept having great song after song . In 1995 , Cyndi released her first greatest hits record , \" Twelve Deadly Cyns . \" I loved the candy coated , luscious album cover , and so 3 new songs were added to Cyndi 's ever growing repertoire : \" I 'm Gon na Be Strong \" ( this was an updated version of the 1980 Blue Angel track ) , \" ( Hey Now ) Girls Just Want To Have Fun \" ( a sequel to the 1983 megasmash ) , and \" Come On Home . She wanted to be an ARTIST , not a \" hits \" maker . On \" Sisters Of Avalon \" , Cyndi went all over the map ( but in a very good way , mind you ) . There 's the forceful , in your face title track . 2 other minor hits also took notice :   \" Ballad Of Cleo & Joe \" and \" Unhook The Stars . \" Sadly , this particular album was one of her most underappreciated . Overall , this \" greatest hits \" CD covers Cyndi Lauper 's timespan from 1983 to 1996 . Since then , Cyndi would release 6 more albums in 1998 , 2002 , 2003 , 2005 , 2008 and 2010 . No two records were EVER the same . And that brings me to the 3 reasons that Cyndi is MY favorite female artist of all time . One :   She created albums on her OWN terms and would n't conform to the record companies . She played various instruments -- whatever she could find , she would put to use ! And three :   many of the songs were very euphoric and would make a person feel good about himself \/ herself . So , if anyone is having a bad day , all you need to do is put on a Cyndi Lauper record and learn how to have fun . I 'm sure glad that I did ! ! !","summary":"Wanna have fun??

There are some treasures on here though and for the price , it 's definitely worth picking up if you want to discover her music more or just own some of the best songs she ever made ( the Goonies song for instance is amazing and not easy to find ) . So for die - hard Cyndi Lauper fans , the Goonies song is probably the main attraction for you . Other than that , you may disagree with the \" greatest hits \" selection .

Sherwin","reviewText":"The Essential Cyndi Lauper really should have been a two CD set . While we get a good number of her biggest hits on this album , there is n't quite enough to satisfy me . Although the material that we do get is wonderful ; where are some more very good tunes ? At any rate , Cyndi worked hard to produce great music for her fans ; and just one listen to this album proves it . In addition , the quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very well done . \" Girls Just Want To Have Fun \" starts the CD off with a huge number that was one of Cyndi 's earliest hits . \" Girls Just Want To Have Fun \" celebrates women who just want to enjoy their relationships with men without long term commitments ; and Cyndi delivers this like a pro ! The number is full of positive energy and it 's great music for dancing even today . \" Money Changes Everything \" was another early hit for Cyndi ; this has that mid ` 80s dance flavor to it and Cyndi 's really good diction enhances the number even more . \" Who Let In The Rain \" features Cyndi front and center -- right where she belongs ! \" Who Let In The Rain \" is a fine number that proves Cyndi can easily tackle a rock flavored ballad to make it take flight ! \" She Bop \" was always one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper hits ; this hit the airwaves big time during the summer of 1984 and I remember going to dances where the DJs played this very often . \" She Bop \" has a great , power - packed melody that is also rather catchy and it remains one of Cyndi Lauper 's best hits ever . \" Time After Time \" also comes from the mid 1980s ; and Cyndi does this wonderfully . \" I Drove All Night \" comes from Cyndi 's great album entitled A Night To Remember and just one listen proves that Cyndi is a champ ! \" Hat Full Of Stars \" is a ballad from the album of the same name ; and listen for \" All Through The Night . \" \" All Through The Night \" is one of Cyndi Lauper 's best hits ever -- period . The percussion enhances the musical arrangement and Cyndi 's excellent diction makes her performance even better . \" All Through The Night \" is another one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper tunes and it deserves its place on this CD . \" When You Were Mine \" comes from Cyndi 's first album entitled She 's So Unusual ; and Cyndi 's cover of the song originally done by Prince really shines bright . \" True Colors \" comes from the album of the same ; Cyndi does this with great sensitivity and the guitar work enhances the melody quite a bit . Awesome ! \" Unhook The Stars \" plays with major and minor keys as Cyndi sings this very well ; and the album ends strong with a great number from the movie The Goonies entitled \" The Goonies ' R ' Good Enough . \" I agree with other reviewers who write that this last number is a most welcome addition to this album . I always liked Cyndi Lauper ; so while I love the tunes on this album I must admit that it 's not as complete as it should be . There should be several other songs here . Specifically , I would have wanted extra songs like \" Hole In My Heart ( All The Way To China ) ; \" \" My First Night Without You ; \" \" Ballad Of Cleo & Joe ; \" \" Boy Blue \" and maybe even one or two more . That 's a missed opportunity ; and I can only hope that we get a better Cyndi Lauper \" essential \" collection two CD set soon . Nevertheless , I still recommend this album for Lauper 's fans ; and it makes a great starter CD for people just discovering Cyndi 's talents . It 's also a fine CD for people who merely want a small sampling of Cyndi Lauper 's incredible artistry .","summary":"extremely good--as far as it goes, that is...","unixReviewTime":1238976000,"image":null}

It 's not perfect , yet I think it 's superior to \" 12 Deadly Cyns . \" \n The big complaint was that for so long , american fans could n't get \" Good Enough \" from \" The goonies . \" Well , FINALLY it 's included . Whether or not Cyndi likes the song , it 's an 80 's movie song classic and was a top 10 hit . Eight of Cyndi 's top 10 hits are on here including the classic \" Girls Just Wanna Have Fun \" , \" She Bop \" , \" All Through the Night \" and \" Time After Time \" frm her debut . all four of these were massive radio hits and still heard to this day . \" True Colors \" and \" Change of Heart \" were big hits off of her sophomore album . Her last top 10 single is included too from \" A Night to Remember \" which is \" I Drove All Night \" * recently Celine Dion did an amazing cover of it . * \" Money Changes Everything \" is graciously included also which did n't hit the top 10 , but was still a big top 40 hit . The non - hits are also very worthy . \" Hat Full of Stars \" is gorgeous and \" Sisters of Avalon \" is very catchy . So why 4 stars ? As outstanding as this collection is , \" What 's Going On \" * a top 10 hit from \" True Colors \" * was left off as was the minor hit \" Hole In My Heart . \" These are minor gripes but would 've really put it over the top . Still , it 's a great hits collection and well worth the money . Cyndi is awesome .","summary":"Best Cyndi Collection Yet","unixReviewTime":1065571200,"image":null}

For starters , that hypnotic \" Get Up , Get Up , Get Up , Get Up \" hook that is softly whispered over the rhythmic beat calls us into the theme of the track . Marvin 's voice is like that of an ecstatic angel living with one foot in the clouds and another in the entrance way to the bedroom . I can picture hips gyrating , beautiful women dancing in the background , red satin sheets , candles , rose petals and the whole bit . In all my years of listening to music , never have I heard a song quite so stirring and smooth . Marvin states in no uncertain times that he is seeking some sexual healing from his partner ( or partners ) and is not shy about laying his cards right out there throughout the duration of the song . The song starts beautifully and truly ends too quickly .","summary":"Classic Marvin Gaye at his best....","unixReviewTime":1382659200,"image":null}

Vocally , Kroeger fits the song , and Santana plays some awesome riffs that keep you moving , and the song afloat . Without that amazing aspect , the song sinks with sub - par lyrics , however , you can only keep coming back to Santana 's amazing guitar mastery and craft .

After the souful success of No One from As I Am , her fourth album , she shows absolutely no signs of ending her reign in R&B. Her latest single , Like You 'll Never See Me Again , the second single from that album shows a softer side from her voice that remains strong from the soul , and still shows a pitch in her voice that has grown with her style in writing . I really think this one follows the way No One helped make As I Am shine . This track works better than anything from wannabe artists like Fantasia or Jordan Sparks . I definitely know Alicia really will make her next single just as good as this one .","summary":"Truly Alicia","unixReviewTime":1201824000,"image":null}

The song is a look at a Vietnam vet who returns home to find that his country has forgotten all about him . The song 's dark lyrics are masked by a stirring , anthemic backing track that embodied a patriotic sound that caused confusion over the real meaning of the song . All the misunderstanding aside , the song is both pro and anti America . It takes on the yin and yang that is this country by on one hand , celebrating the majestic and glory of the flag and then the dark underbelly where we send the less fortunate to keep them out of sight . It is a perfect song and one of , if not , the greatest single of all time .","summary":"They're Still There, He's All Gone","unixReviewTime":1367971200,"image":null}

The song is well - crafted , the lyrics are good , and the vocals shine . I 'll always remember the song by a little moment I had with the song a few years back . Riding through Orlando , Florida at 4 o ' clock in the morning , moving to my new house in NC , I was flipping through the radio and came to this song . And there I listened to it , in the back seat of a car , the lights of Orlando outside , and I just stared out my window . That 's the atmosphere this song creates .

James Brown was a major force in American music since the 1950 's . I do n't believe James was given due credit as he sang to ethnic audiences . Whereas , say , Chuck Berry , sang to a white audience ( Chuck was a genius . I do n't know how he was able to relate \/ sing to a white audience ) . James Brown is the \" God Father of Soul \" . I miss you James , your enthusiasm and your talent . Listen to many black artists and they claim influence from James Brown . For example , the \" King of Pop \" Michael Jackson did many of James Brown dance moves . For some strange reason Amazon encoded this song at the bizarre rate of 247 kpbs . No matter , buy this song ! James sings \" I feel good \" as a reference to his 1965 popular song . Also , James 's reference to \" Eddie Murphy eat your heart out \" . This is in reference to SNL 's Eddie Murphy 's \" getting in the hot tub \" spoof of James Brown .","summary":"What can I say? The God Father of Soul.","unixReviewTime":1301702400,"image":null}

But this song was so special it broke out into an AM singles hit . It was very toned down for Blue Oyster Cult but that 's what made it work . For all it 's theme of death it 's not angry or hysterical but rather uses a mellow , almost folk - like vocal by Buck Dharma ( who wrote the song ) along with tightly harmonized backup vocals and guitar to carry it 's ultimately positive message of accepting the inevitability of The Reaper . Everything is restrained until the wonderfully explosive guitar interlude about two and a half minutes in . The band 's engineers created an echoing acoustic for the instruments that also serves the song well . All in all a melodic and memorable hit . Oh yeah , it 's also got that cowbell !","summary":"Great Rock Classic...Cowbell Included","unixReviewTime":1431820800,"image":null}

Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly . This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \" Total Eclipse of the Heart \" ; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler ; written \/ produced by the gifted Jim Steinman ; backup vocals by Rory Dodd ( who can be distinctly heard singing ` echo ' ) , Eric Troyer , and Bryan Adams . One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the ` backup vocals ' in order to heighten the experience for one and all . Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler , whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise . Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart 's content on any given , bleached out , saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad . Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women - warriors throughout the land , who carry torches for their men ( hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts ) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent . \" And I need you now tonight And I need you more than ever And if you 'll only hold me tight \n We 'll be holding on forever And we 'll only be making it right \n 'Cause we 'll never be wrong together We can take it to the end of the line \n Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time \n I do n't know what to do and I 'm always in the dark We 're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks \n I really need you tonight Forever 's gon na start tonight Forever 's gon na start tonight Once upon a time I was falling in love But now I 'm only falling apart \n Nothing I can do \n A total eclipse of the heart \n Once upon a time there was light in my life But now there 's only love in the dark \n Nothing I can say \n A total eclipse of the heart \"","summary":"John du Prey - Classical Review","unixReviewTime":1332979200,"image":null}

And at the end of every season the show plays a recap of the season 's events right before the season finale ... and said recap is invariably accompanied by this stirring number . I have n't listened to anything else by Kansas , but if \" Carry On Wayward Son \" is any indication , they were a pretty epic band . \" Carry On Wayward Son \" balances out the more energetic portions of the song with some slightly slower , more low - key bridges that have an almost thoughtful sound to them , and are mostly piano instead of the guitar - and - drums of the rest . Not all songs can hit this balance successfully , so props to the songwriters for this . And while no \" Bohemian Rhapsody , \" it is a lot more musically complex than most songs of today . Whatever happened to these songwriters anyhow ... \n\n A classic rock number that 's enjoying some newfound popularity thanks to \" Supernatural , \" this is a great song for both classic rock fans and \" Supernatural \" fans to enjoy ... or heck , any fans of quality music .

If you 're not in love , but a dreamer like me , then you are n't left out . Alicia picked a good single . Making it her first , to me , at first was n't the smartest because this was not the song that impacted me on the first listen . The keyboard ( or organ ) in it is fantastic but it just was n't what we were used to with her ... it was really different . And the video was kinda too . But the more I listened to it , the more I fell in love with the song ! Her voice was ( and still is ! ) very , very heartfelt . It starts out with your basic piano arrangement ; pretty ; lulling ; uncomplicated . Then comes in the \" organ \" and it 's nice ; fitting . But you continue on , hear the chorus twice , and then the beautiful bridge comes in , and once you 've heard it about 5x , you sing along ; \n\n \" I know - ow .... some people search the world ... \" \" To fi - ind ... somethin' like what we H A A A V E. \" \" I know - ow ... people will try ... try to define ... somethin' so R E E A L.

With that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this song , or . I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool , but make little sense when it comes to music . Music is a personal thing . It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself . Granted it is only a 30 second sample , but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music , or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version . If you want to listen to a sample , simply hover over the track you are interested in , and press the play button . I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was fairly cheap on Amazon .... 69 cents , I think ? But most of the songs I download are free .. That s right ! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums . A great way to construct an entire music library , and admittedly , the way I obtained most of my own music . But quite honestly , a wonderful way to explore new music , too . In fact , some of the songs that I ve obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band , and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag . Anyway ... enough of my rambling . This song is great ! At the very least , give it a 30 - second listen ? \n\n And do n't forget , if you are in the market for freebies , you can always check here \n\n FREE SONGS : \n From Amazon Home page -- > Shop by Department -- > ( Digital and Prime Music ) Deals -- > Songs by Price ( on left side of screen)--- > Free \n\n FREE ALBUMS : \n From Amazon Home page -- > Shop by Department -- > ( Digital and Prime Music ) Deals -- > Albums by Price ( on left side of screen)--- > Free","summary":"love, LoVe, LOVE! this song. :)","unixReviewTime":1452211200,"image":null}

It has been over 20 years since Toni Braxton took on the music industry , and her success as a part of Laface records still has been a cornerstone of what great female R&B music is absolute;y like . Un - Break My Heart , is honestly one of Toni 's masterpieces from the sensual Secrets record . The song is definitely one of those songs that blends beauty , voice and soulfulness all into one , which Diane Warren had beautifully wrote for her . The song is absolutely one of a kind , and still sounds much more beautiful every time I heart it . Something that acts like Rihanna , Mariah Carey and Beyonce ' Knowles could take a real page on that female songstresses did like Toni back then .

I remember being in my senior year in high school when I heard this song . When I saw the video to this song being played on one of the music channels there was something about it that drew me on(I just wish that I can remember if it was VH1 or MTV ) . Carlos made the right decision when he selected Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty to sing the vocals ( Rob has a great singing voice ) . The reason why I say this is because I noticed that in the music video Rob Thomas really put his spirit and emotion in giving the musical \" Smooth \" a vibrant life of its own . \" Smooth \" is a gorgeous song about a man who is willing to change his life to accomodate the woman he loves , and he is asking the woman in his life to make up her mind about him . He makes this clear with the clever and catchy lyrics \" so give me your heart , make it real , or else forget about it ) . I love and enjoy listening to Rob Thomas 's vocals in this song . In addition , I was imagining who this song was for , especially when Rob Thomas did a good job of using his voice of emphasizing the lyrics \" my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa \" When I found out later on that it was for his wife Marisol Thomas I was very moved and thought that was romantic and heartwarming . I say this because \" Smooth \" came out in 1999 . It is posted online that they met in 1998 and married in 1999 . At the time of this writing , they are still married ( which I think is so beautiful by the way , may they enjoy more joyful and loving years together ) . I admit that part of the reason why I still find this song enjoyable to listen to is because I enjoy hearing Rob Thomas 's singing ( Rob 's music and vocals first drew me in with the 1997 Matchbox 20 musical hit \" Push \" ) . The best way to choose whether you are going to love this song is if you enjoy music by either Rob Thomas , Carlos Santana , and\/or romantic alternative rock songs .","summary":"One Smooth Song","unixReviewTime":1297382400,"image":null}

Kristofferson and Joplin had a close personal relationship and , while the song was not written explicitly for her , the tune fits Ms. Joplin 's style very well . Her voice is neither smooth nor melodic - it reminds me very much of Billie Holliday 's voice . And , like Lady Day , with Ms. Joplin it is n't about the tonality she brings to her work ; it 's the ( to coin a too - oft used word ) soul she expends when singing . Many singers can bring feeling into a ballad ; very few can make the listener want to weep in sympathy with the singer 's obvious pain and loneliness . Sinatra , most certainly ; he spent over 60 years with his main theme being loneliness ( or the brief intermission of a new love before loneliness returned ) . Billie Holliday ; her life was filled with pain both physical and emotional and she brought every ounce of it into her work . And Janis Joplin , whose body of work is small in the number of recordings but huge in the personality she embedded in the canon . \" Me And Bobby McGee \" ( recorded a few days before Ms. Joplin 's death in 1970 ) is a fine example of her music . While the writing may not be necessarily on a par with , for instance , Cole Porter 's work one must consider the different genre that Messrs. Kristofferson and Foster worked in . I highly recommend this recording - with the caveat that I have a personal emotional tie in to the record . I was freshly back in the United States ( just a few months ) from the Vietnam war when Ms. Joplin passed away leaving this last piece with which to be remembered and her passing hit me with nearly the force of a physical blow . I had listened to her songs when I was with the U.S. Army and her loss at the age of 27 was hard to deal with - even though I had never met her in person . Others who do not have direct experience of the 1960 's may not bring the memories that those of us who lived through it to songs of that era - but I think that this particular song of Ms. Joplin 's has stood the test of time and stands on it 's own merit . \n\n HTH \n\n Regards , \n\n Jim","summary":"It's Janis Joplin.

Her second single from that album , No Air with rising Hip Hop star Chris Brown , does n't work well either . While the song has a fairly nice beat , it just does n't seem to be an everlasting song that stands out .

This musical track is a very energetic and dance \/ pop creation about someone imagining what it would be like to be the lover of someone that they really desire . Sophie puts alot of soul and energy in this song in a very creative and intense way . I love how she paints a good story in her songs such as when she mentions while singing that she had a dream that she was the hero of the one she very much wants . She also makes it fun by mentioning about making her fantasy lover \" feel much better \" . What makes this musical track even more appealing is that Sophie sings really beautiful vocals to go along with the great lyrics to the song . \" Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover \" compares to two of the following other songs of Sophie B. Hawkins in a good way : \n \" As I Lay Me Down\"- A great musical track about how she appreciates her lover and intends to always be happy . This is such a beautiful song , and the video I saw to this on youtube is very good . \" Right Beside You\"- This is also another song that showcases her gorgeous voice , and she sings with the same passion and great spirit as \" Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover . \" \n\n   If you happen to like \" As I Lay Me Down \" and\/or \" Right Beside You \" then it is most likely that you are going to the fine musical melody that is \" Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover \" .","summary":"A Good Song with Fine Vocals","unixReviewTime":1297036800,"image":null}

It turns out that the vocals are sung by Trace Cyrus ( Miley Cyrus 's older brother ) . Although Trace is only 19 years old he really sings this song in a very self confident and mature way . Admittedly this is a song that you may not want to expose to somebody that is under 13 because the song has sexual undertones to it . The reason why I say this is because the song still has appropriate language to it but he sings about being on the bed with someone and their clothes on the floor ( to his credit creatively ) . He also suggests in the song how he will take someone home if he 's not left at the front door . However what makes the song great is that he sings the song creatively , self confidently , and narratively . The reason why is say that he sings this narratively is because it sounds like he is telling a short story about charming someone he is interested in while making sure to combine the singing in seamlessly . I agree with the others that say this is a good workout song too because the music is really   upbeat and sounds like something you can easily dance to in the club or a party . It was also featured on one of the reality tv shows I was watching on mtv one night that features Lauren Conrad . All in all if you are fine with songs that have a dance pop twist and you are curious to listen to how Trace Cyrus sounds then in my opinion you will like this song .","summary":"Shake It to the sound of Metro Station","unixReviewTime":1226361600,"image":null}

Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy . In the review for the song itself , allmusic.com wrote \" The lush power ballad \" The Flame \" was penned by two British songwriters , but the band made it their own with Robin Zander 's sobbing vocal dramatics and the haunting tones of Rick Nielsen 's mandocello chiming behind the guitar and keyboard backing . The lyrics , almost always an afterthought in romantic power ballads , often hint at the Police\/\"Every Breath You Take \" 's school of disguising unhealthy obsession as sentimentality ; the singer , unable to let go of his first love , which can be taken either as a scorned lover trying to see his failed romance as somehow cosmically ordained anyway , or as a vaguely disturbing intimation of stalking . It 's more likely that the latter interpretation was completely unintentional , though , since the band 's straight - ahead reading plays up the heartstring - tugging bombast . It was a perfect fit for the late-'80s ' power ballad \/ happy pop radio , and it was much better crafted than many similar offerings from the same period ( most of which were by bands who had been influenced , indirectly or otherwise , by Cheap Trick themselves ) . While it is n't the most inventive song the band ever recorded , \" The Flame \" is an undeniable part of their legacy , and a well - deserved , better - late - than - never , chart - topping popular success","summary":"GREAT SONG","unixReviewTime":1357603200,"image":null}

Her vocals were good , and then by the bridge , I was totally into the song . And just for a second , I thought she was better than Blake Lewis . Well , those thoughts quickly passed . Not only was Blake Lewis 's debut flat - out amazing and underrated , but due to the meat grinder that is radio , this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road . Today , this song blends right into the radio wasteland . While her vocals are still good , it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing . I mean really , I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality , but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo ? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available ? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is .

It just feels like words that just do n't completely carry heart , unlike other recent R&B songs , like Alicia Keys with her hit Superwoman .

The musical arrangement , especially with that cello , fits in perfectly with Christina 's vocals . The message of the song is that anyone struggling with a lack of self - esteem should remember that inner beauty counts for quite a lot and that other people 's criticism and lack of respect for someone should be ignored as long as they 're a good person on the inside .

Two vocalists trade off on this piece ( female and male ) , accompanied by guitar , drum , strings orchestration , and clarinet here and there ( I believe ) . There 's also an blues - style electric organ in the background . The rhythm is good and pretty evenly paced throughout . Interesting mix of classical strings , acoustic guitar , blues electric organ and a jazzy clarinet . Each providing a light touch of different genres . Who would have thought of putting this all together and that it would blend well . I like the voices , the male voice is baritone and has a slightly rough edge that is an interesting contrast to his female counterpart ( and does n't sound like all the other male voices I 've heard ) . This could easily have been a non - Christmas piece . If you like country , or blues and\/or light rock , I think you would enjoy this a lot .","summary":"interesting mix","unixReviewTime":1259971200,"image":null}

But while their debut was a wonderful collection of terrific songs--\"Evil Ways , \" Jingo , \" \" Persuasion\"--they were an even better live band .

You really can tell the difference -- Mike Shrieve was and still is a supurb drummer and made Santana rock out . The booklet included with this is great with alot of comments from Greg Rolie , the original keyboardist and singer .

The only nod to jazz is the Porgy & Bess number \" My Man 's Gone Now \" . Although Ms. Simone can tend to be self indulgent at times , she reins in that tendency here with a selection of songs ( 4 are self penned ) that really fit the Blues theme which is very fitting to her style and persona . The arrangements are also excellent with a tight band that supports but does not overwhelm the songs - no strings , no brass . My favorite thing here is a rollicking barrelhouse version of \" House of the Rising Sun \" , completely unlike the version made famous by The Animals .

As Nancy advances toward her September years her voice has mellowed , gotten richer and even more beautiful . Her newer CD RSVP is another fine example of her later talent .

Black 's Killin ' Time initially established him as the biggest of the new stars , with hits like \" A Better Man , \" \" Nobody 's Home , \" and the title track . These songs showcased Black 's clever wordplay amid fairly traditional honky tonk arrangements and a Haggardesque vocal style . While it was n't long before Black was surpassed commercially by Brooks and Jackson , his music maintained a high standard during his RCA tenure that was highlighted by 29 top ten hits . Black 's two Greatest Hits volumes were both frustrating affairs whose new material - aside from the haunting chart - topper \" Like The Rain \" - was subpar . This chronologically arranged , 20 - track collection concentrates on his biggest chart hits , including the lush \" Loving Blind \" and the heartbreaking \" Where Are You Now \" ( number ones inexplicably left off those other sets ) . The only non - single found here is the jazzy Bruce Hornsby duet \" Dixie Lullaby . \" As it sounds a lot like the enclosed Steve Wariner pairing \" Been There \" ( which it precedes ) , its selection is suspect .

The opening track , In the bleak midwinter , is a wonderful old English carol and it 's great to hear this sung by an American - a rare occurrence . Rocking is another old English carol , one that is particularly suited to this album , being both a holiday song and a lullaby . All through the night is a carol I 've heard before but recordings of it seem to be even rarer than Rocking and In the bleak midwinter . Elsewhere , there are beautiful songs such as Windy nights ( words by Robert Louis Stevenson ) , All the pretty li'l horses , Little road to Bethlehem and Love came down at Christmas .

Given the pressure of the prison shows , not to mention their tailor - made set lists , this recording finds Cash less on - edge , providing a more accurate rendering of his then - current stage show . Everyone but a very pregnant June Carter Cash is on - board , including the Tennessee Three ( Marshall Grant , W.S. Holland and Bob Wooten ) , Carl Perkins , Tommy Cash , The Statler Brothers and The Carter Family ( including Mother Maybelle , and daughters Helen and Anita ) . The set list covers many of Cash 's most beloved songs ( including a quartet of prison tunes , and a barn - burning take of \" Wreck of the Old 97 \" ) , plus a generous helping of historical and folk classics , including Jane Bowers \" Remember the Alamo \" ( recorded throughout the ' 50s and ' 60s by The Kingston Trio , Donovan , Willie Nelson and others ) . The ease and confidence with which Cash presents himself on stage is astounding , and more in evidence than in the live prison recordings . Spoken introductions to songs like \" Five Feet High and Rising \" pull everything together into a seamless presentation . Similarly , Cash 's generous revue staging allows his compatriots -- each headliners in their own right -- to shine brightly . Carl Perkin 's blazes through \" Blue Suede Shoes , \" The Statler Brothers sing a lively version of their crossover hit \" Flowers on the Wall , \" and the Carter Family performs a beautiful pair of songs from A.P. Carter 's catalog ( \" Wildwood Flower \" \" Worried Man Blues \" ) . Cash 's sister - in - law , Helen Carter , provides a wonderfully warm introduction to the Carter Family segment . The closing medley provides each member of the troupe a chance to give their twist on a Cash landmark . Johnny and his brother Tommy sing \" Do What You Do , Do Well , \" The Carter Family sings \" I Walk the Line , \" The Statler Brothers take on \" Ring of Fire , \" and Carl Perkins finds the rockabilly heart of \" Folsom Prison Blues . \" Cash closes out the show with a snippet of \" The Rebel - Johnny Yuma , \" and yet another reprise of \" Folsom Prison Blues . \" The crowd 's thunderous applause draws an encore of \" Suppertime . \" \n\n This is a beautiful ( and generous : 77 minute ! ) stereo recording of a stage master at the peak of his powers , singing and speaking to an enthusiastic sell - out crowd . It is at once incredibly intimate and incredibly grand .

An entire album of prevously unreleased live Johnny Cash goodies from his commercial heyday in 1969 , repeating the success of his earlier concert albums , but here performing for the city slickers in the Big Apple . Johnny is joined by the reconstituted Carter Family , brother Tommy Cash , the Statler Brothers ( who he was a patron of ... )   and fellow Sun Records veteran Carl Perkins ( as we hear on a   track intro at the very end of the album , June Carter Cash was n't able to attend as she was six months pregnant at the time ... ) It 's an efficient , professional   presentation , yet one that gives some nice glimpses into Cash 's inner life , mostly through the spoken introductions that accompany many of the songs . The most telling is the intro to \" Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream , \" in which Cash addresses the thorny issue of the Vietnam War . Stumbling nervously , hoping not to offend anyone one way or the other , Cash recalls how he and his show went to entertain the troops overseas , declaring , \" I may not be a hawk ... He also introduces a few songs with asides about his down - home background ; back then , these monologes may have been a bit hokey , but they 've added resonance as Cash has gotten older and his legend increased . Also of interest is an angry , emotional reading of his Native American rights protest song , \" As Long As Grass Shall Grow , \" which is one of the most powerful performances of Cash 's career . There are also plenty of religious tunes , which he also puts his heart into . There are some rushed moments , but on the whole , this is an album well worth checking out , and certainly a delight for longtime Cash fans who have never heard this material before .","summary":"Cash and family playing at their peak","unixReviewTime":1031270400,"image":null}

Mott was a unique band -- with they were never less than soulful even on their weakest material . Ian Hunter 's Sonny Bono \/ Bob Dylan delivery gave an impression of what the Pretty Things or Stones would have sounded like with either one of those singer \/ songwriters as their front man . Mott is a nearly flawless album . Hunter came into his own as a songwriter . I Wish I was Your Mother , All the Way to Memphis and Ballad of Mott ( co - written with all the band members ) all manage to capture Hunter 's gritty and blunt assessment of the world packaged in a melodic and colorful box . Ralphs contributes a couple of strong tracks as well although his contributions are a bit more subdued than on All the Young Dudes . Clearly Hunter had taken Bowie 's advice and stepped to the forefront as both frontman and songwriter . This managed to make the band better and also caused the original line up to splinter with Hunter the next casuality . The problem with this great album is the sound quality . The CD sounds flat and muddy . When you compare the sound quality here to the remastered editions of both All the Young Dudes and The Hoople , it 's clear that this album is in bad need of a facelift .

This does n't diminish Mick   Ralphs contributions -- his guitar playing is terrific and his single solo   composition(He wrote three other tracks with Hunter ) is a terrific song . Along with Brain Capers , this is the band 's finest hour . After this   Ralphs left the band leaving a gaping hole that , perhaps , only Mick Ronson   could have filled if he and Hunter had stayed with the band . I Wish I Was   Your Mother and Violence are two of the highlights from this terrific   album .

This music still sounds great today ; and many people have fond memories of the times they danced to these tunes when they were often performed live in dance halls and nightclubs . The quality of the sound is really rather good and I like the artwork . Benny Goodman & His Orchestra open things up with a great rendition of \" Do n't Be That Way ( Take 1 ) . \" The horn works very well for this number and Benny 's band never lets us down ! They do this flawlessly ; and it sounds great even today . Glenn Miller & His Orchestra follow with their smash hit entitled \" In the Mood . \" \" In the Mood \" is a number people remember well ; this got lots of air play and many people danced to it back in the day . Similarly , \" Opus One \" by Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra never disappoints ; \" Opus One \" is a peppy little number that packs a huge , unforgettable punch and I always like hearing \" Opus One . \" \n\n Glen Gray & His Orchestra ( with whom I 'm less familiar ) also make good with their hit , \" Casa Loma Stomp . \" \" Casa Loma Stomp \" has a great beat and they never play a superfluous note ! Great ! Of course , we ca n't have a swing CD without the great Duke Ellington and his buddies doing their wonderful \" Take the ` A ' Train ; \" \" Take the ` A ' Train \" hit the clubs big time and when you hear it you 'll instantly know why . A personal favorite of mine is \" Minnie the Moocher \" by the incomparable Cab Calloway & His Cotton Club Orchestra ; Cab Calloway could really swing and that Cotton Club was all the better off for it ! Listen also for \" Back Bay Shuffle \" by Artie Shaw & His Orchestra ; Artie Shaw instinctively knew how to make great music and \" Back Bay Shuffle \" showcases his talents nicely . There 's even a special number from Glenn Miller again when he and his buddies play \" A String Of Pearls . \" \" A String Of Pearls \" sounds like pearls should sound -- and that 's quite all right by me . \" Swingin ' Uptown \" by Jimmie Lunceford & His Orchestra is great ; but they could have omitted \" Mary Had a Little Lamb \" by Fletcher Henderson & His Orchestra . Oh , well -- no CD is perfect . The CD ends very nicely . We get two solid numbers , \" Flyin ' Home \" performed by Charlie Barnet & His Orchestra and then \" Sing , Sing , Sing ( With A Swing ) ( Parts 1 & 2 ) \" by Benny Goodman & His Orchestra . \" Sing , Sing , Sing ( With A Swing ) ( Parts 1 & 2 ) \" is classic swing music at its very apex and I think you 'll like it very much if you have n't heard this one before . This album is a great starter CD for people just getting into swing music ; and it makes an affordable single CD swing music compilation , too . If you like this you should consider other CDs of swing music available for sale on this website .","summary":"swing, swing, swing !!!","unixReviewTime":1231891200,"image":null}

Unlike many releases at that time , it even has three paragraphs in the insert describing the usual reception for these renowned groups when their buses rolled into town , along with a re - listing of the generous ( for the time ) 19 tracks showing recording dates and locations . With so much to choose from in terms of material , I have to agree with those who assigned 5 stars to the tracks presented here , each in its own way representative of the music so popular from 1933 to 1940 ( the span covered here ) . And yes , even to the inclusion of Fletcher Henderson 's Mary Had A Little Lamb , a 1936 recording featuring a brief vocal by Teddy Lewis , but some of the best instrumental solos ever put to disc . Really , the title and the lyrics are incidental . The same reviewer who lamented that selection , also had disparaging remarks for the \" whitebread \" Casa Loma Stomp , only the first of 64 hits for Glen Gray & His Casa Loma Orchestra ( named after a famed Toronto nightclub which the band called home for a spell ) which hit # 15 in January 1931 ( this is a 1933 re - recording ) , as well as Bunny Berigan 's rendition of All God 's Chillun Got Rhythm ( with vocal by Ruth Bradley ) . Yes , trying to do that in today 's society would go over like a lead balloon - but this was 1937 and that year both Duke Ellington ( # 14 instrumental ) and Artie Shaw ( # 15 with vocal by Tony Pastor ) had hits with it . Their inclusion in this historical volume is just fine , thank you very much . As the blurb says on the reverse \" Foot - tappin ' favorites & jumpin ' jitterbugs from the Fabulous Swing Era !

That revival has cooled but this generous ( 19 songs , 65 minutes ) set remains among the era 's better one - disc compilations ( all songs from RCA family labels )   for now third - generation fans . It may not have been all the classics revivalists danced to ; two swingin ' Louises ( Prima and Jordan ) recorded their jump , jive and wailin ' big band tunes for Capitol and Decca Records , respectively . But many of the era 's signature tunes are represented , sounding surprisingly warm in analog sound : Glenn Miller 's anthemic \" In The Mood , \" \" String of Pearls , \" and \" American Patrol , \" Benny Goodman 's hard , wild swinging \" Sing , Sing , Sing \" ( heard recently and famously in a cookie commercial but better in Goodman 's 1938 Carnegie Hall concert ) , Cab Calloway 's 1933 \" Minnie The Moocher , \" which he performed nearly a half - century later in the first \" Blues Brothers \" film and here does in full - throated youthful yodel . You also get seminal sides from Charlie Barnet ( \" Cherokee \" ) , Tommy Dorsey ( \" Marie , \" \" Opus One \" ) , and Duke Ellington ( \" Take The ' A ' Train , \" \" Cotton Tail \" ) . While these songs swing sweeter than 1998 's martini - and - cigar crowd might have liked , \" Fabulous \" may well be among the few big band CDs a new fan would need .

From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts , seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100 . Not even the late , great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour . I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20 - selection compilation together under the title \" The Essential Jim Reeves . \" To please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had 80 Country hit singles between 1953 and 1984 , 27 of which crossed over to the Hot 100 , six to the Adult Contemporary charts ( which did n't begin until 1961 ) , and one to the R&B charts . Never mind the hundreds of equally - wonderful selections from his many EPs and LPs . All in all , however , I 'd say he did a fairly credible job , augmented by five pages of liner notes by Colin Escott and three more photos of Jim , including one with wife Mary at an Awards ceremony . A partial discography of the contents is also included , but without any chart details . All but track 20 [ recorded in 1958 and included on an early LP ] were hits for Jim , 18 of them pop crossovers [ only track 4 made only the Country list , going to # 2 early in 1959 ] . His version of the old standard , I Love You Because , was recorded in 1962 and was first released on the RCA Victor LP Gentleman Jim and , in 1976 , became a # 54 Country hit as a single . Note , too , that the version of Am I Losing You was the one cut in 1960 and released on RCA Victor 7800 , going to # 8 Country\/ # 31 Hot 100 as the flipside of I Missed Me [ # 3 Country\/ # 44 Hot 100 and not included here ] , The first version , done in 1957 [ # 3 Country ] , remains a bit difficult to find . The earliest hit represented here , and the one that leads off the disc , is Four Walls [ # 1 Country for EIGHT weeks in 1957 ] which was his initial pop crossover However , this came after 13 Country hits beginning in 1953 with Mexican Joe [ # 1 for NINE weeks credited to Jim Reeves And The Circle O Ranch Boys ] . So I tend to agree with another reviewer who says that at least one of those should have been included in an \" essential \" CD . Not counting the first six , five of which were for the Abbott label and one , I Love You , a # 3 duet with Ginny Wright on the Fabor label , there were seven RCA cuts to choose from . The best of these included the afore - mentioned Am I Losing You , as well as Yonder Comes A Sucker and According To My Heart , both # 4s . Still , it 's hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum 5 stars .","summary":"The Voice That Wouldn't Die","unixReviewTime":1187827200,"image":null}

A solid effort   that will want you coming back for more .","summary":"NICE BEGINNINGS","unixReviewTime":958608000,"image":null}

While he is n't as visually exciting or physically demanding as many of his piers , his shows have an intimacy that few performers are able to capture . The two disc 1993 release offers an excellent sampling of Taylor 's tour from that year . The song selections could not be more perfect , offering his biggest hit singles ( \" Fire and Rain , \" \" You 've Got a Friend , \" \" How Sweet It Is , \" \" Handy Man \" ) , beloved fan favorites ( \" Sweet Baby James , \" \" Something in the Way She Moves , \" \" Carolina in My Mind , \" \" Country Road \" ) , obscure album cuts ( \" Traffic Jam , \" \" Secret O ' Life , \" \" Millworker , \" \" That Lonesome Road \" ) , and several cuts from his most recent efforts . His between song banter is charming , and his backing band is tight and performs the material with the respect it deserves . \" Live \" is a terrific document of Taylor as a live performer and a must for all fans .","summary":"A Beautiful Collection of Performances.","unixReviewTime":1360540800,"image":null}

Fowler","reviewText":"The best studio albums have something to recommend about them : the artist and the mixers can make the recordings just as perfect as   possible - mixing the various tracks to blend perfectly , and editing and re - recording any mistakes . Still - live shows always have an appeal that ca n't be recreated in a studio . Something about performing live , especially in front of an appreciative audience ,   inspires musicians to heights that are difficult to reach in the more sterile recording studio . That being said , \" Live \" albums are notorious for not quite capturing the experience of actually being at the concert . James Taylor ( Live ) , recorded during his Fall Tour of 1992 , masterfully dodges limitations that   plague many recordings . First of all - the recordings are incredibly good , with the mix reflecting the notoriously talented and tight band that Mr. Taylor always has at his disposal . A perfectionist universally respected in the biz , James Taylor is in a class all by himself among singer - songwriters : he can call upon enough talented musicians to flesh out TWO grammy - level bands , and while he gives everyone a place to shine within the structure of a concert , they all know that they are there to make James and his music sound as good as possible . Second of all - this live concert , like an actual JT concert - is extremely generous in the amount of music available . With two 15 song discs most of his best known songs ( up to 1992 ) are splendidly represented . Among the 30 tracks are one of my favorite renditions of \" Carolina in my Mind \" , plus exceptional versions of \" Sweet Baby James \" , \" Fire and Rain \" , \" You 've Got A Friend \" , \" How Sweet It is \" , \" Up On The Roof \" , \" Something In The Way She Moves \" and many others . He is also known for superb covers ( thus his two recent projects consisting entirely of cover songs ) . It is an embarrassment of riches that perhaps the quintessential song writer blesses us with that velvety voice on other 's songs as well . In this project he gives an absolutely scintillating version of George Jones ' classic \" She Thinks I Still Care \" and one of the best things about this live recording is listening to his introduction of the song - he says George Jones sings the song so well \" it makes you weep , makes your dog weep , and makes your roof leak . It 's pathetic ! \" Then he unleashes a version so good it would make George Jones weep tears of joy . If you do n't have any James Taylor in your collection - why not ? And if you 're only going to have ONE in your collection ... this would n't be a bad one .","summary":"A Master at the Top of His Game","unixReviewTime":1288569600,"image":null}

Backed by a 9 piece band the album really showcases the versatility that a Taylor live show encompasses . When one thinks of James Taylor it is usually the single guy with an acoustic guitar that you think of , but live Taylor really puts on an energetic show with a wide variety of music . Taylor has always had an element of soul to some of his stuff , and with the backup band and especially backup singers this album injects a significant amount of soul influence into the several tracks . All the big hits are here along with some of Taylor 's better album cuts . For me one of the highlights is the inclusion of the song \" Milworker \" which was written for a musical and not on any official Taylor album . The song is one of the best he has ever written and for anyone who has ever worked in a factory environment pretty much nails what day to day life is like . I do n't have any of Taylor 's studio albums so for me this collection is a great overview of the many facets of Taylor 's output .","summary":"James Taylor - Nails The Versitility Of This Unique Artist","unixReviewTime":1210032000,"image":null}

He appeared alone on - stage with a full head of   long , long hair in a simple denim shirt and cut - up jeans with his four or   five acoustic guitars , and for two and a half hours proceeded to absolutely   enchant the sprawling lawn - full of hundreds of audience members with a   spellbinding performance of all of the work from both of those albums . Although virtually unknown at the time , word of mouth had spread so quickly   in the Berkshires area ( who still considers him one of their own ) that many   of us went out to get this album to play before he appeared . This is a fantastic retrospective collection of   his greatest hits recorded live , and as one would expect of the amazing Mr.   Taylor , it is a terrific summary of that work . Many of my favorites are   here , including \" Something In The Way She Moves \" , \" Carolina In My Mind \" ,   and \" Rainy Day Man \" . Of course , so is \" Fire And Rain \" , \" You 've Got A   Friend \" , \" Steamroller Blues \" , and a wonderful combination of \" Millworker \"   and \" Country Road \" , which are both among the best songs he has ever   written . My all time favorite song from this album is \" Sweet Baby James \" ,   which is sung about the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts where I   grew up , so I have always considered this a special song . His performance   on it is a brilliant illustration of just how incredibly talented an   interpretive artist Taylor really is . He always pleases with songs like   \" Copperline \" , \" Mexico \" , and \" Walking Man \" , and this album is sure to please   even the most cautious music fan . It is certainly a terrific showcase for   how well Taylor can deliver on a variety of original works and covers of   traditional folk songs .

This was and still is a dense cacophony of beauty and your classic 80s angst and cynicism with moments of tentative redemption . Everyone 's got their favorite 80s icons- they 're probably mine because I got to see them in a small venue at the height of their powers , just after this had come out . Nothing burns into your teenage brain permanently like a great rock group when they 're on top of their game , before they 're just paying the bills and trying not to punch each other out in the process . \" She is Mine \" is a standout ; Butler 's seething rasp can have its oddly tender moments . ( I still think he 's one of the all - time sexiest vocalists- and I just die when he talk - sings \" Ha Ha Ha \" . Classic Butler - ism . ) . While \" Pretty In Pink \" tends to give me the Mollyringwalds and it seems a bit sexist , I still love it for what it reminds me of : that great p - furs signature intro . \" Into you like a train \" is just full - speed searing beauty , guitars sweeping around you . And \" No Tears \" perfectly captures 80s wariness of political activism and the ensuing apathy \/antagonism with the problematic radicals of the day ( \" There 's demonstrations , and demonstrations .... you do n't have a point of view . You do n't have to say you do \" . While occasionally Butler has his Dylan - ish moments of lyrical nonsense , they do work in their 80s way , like a collage of imagery and emotional impressions , not literal straightforward meanings in lyrics . It has a   melodic , yet driving , layered noise . I could never go full atonal - the No Wave thing , so this has that kind of energy , in a sense , yet is tight and has a sense of tune you can remember , as opposed to just tuneless screeching . The layers & textures never get in the way of the lyrical \/ melodic line- it always sounds like it 's just short of all parts crashing together , yet it 's sort of a controlled chaos that sweeps past you and around you . Also , this album has density without all the twinkly , trebly production that \" Forever Now \" has to make it more radio - friendly . Plus this just brings out the adolescent clove - smoker in me , when all this stuff seemed so romantic ! \" So run Down \" is another great track- reminds me of that teenage time when even a bad hangover seemed like a new adventure ! Between the Furs & the Bunnymen , it was all shades and trenchcoats here on out ... and that was n't such as a bad thing at a tender age .","summary":"Noise and Beauty, Sex and Cynicism - this was the 80s that was","unixReviewTime":1418860800,"image":null}

If THIS is what I can expect for the rest of this particular period , well ... I probably wo n't even bother . This is disappointing enough . \" Got ta Serve Somebody \" has lyrics that explain no matter WHO you are , you 're gon na have to serve * somebody * . The slow - paced disco beats and the straight forward lyrics leave a lot to be desired , however . The disco connection unfortunately sets the pace for the rest of the experience which , judging by the numerous positive reviews here on amazon , might make this the most overrated album in Dylan 's discography . \" Precious Angel \" is generic mid - tempo plodding nonsense from beginning to end . This is by FAR the worst Dylan album up to this point . Self Portrait had variety at least . Slow Train Coming , musically , is a product of the times- the dreaded days of the disco movement . The \" Shine your light on me \" chorus is almost sickeningly uncharacteristic of Dylan . You can tell he 's forcing himself to sing such a line , and I swear I can almost sense that he 's about ready to break out laughing during the chorus . The only compliment I can give is that the Jerry Garcia - inspired guitar playing is decent . \" I Believe In You \" includes a melody so soft that it 's basically a lullaby with terribly bland , simplistic and lovey dovey lyrics . Anyone who believes Dylan ca n't write vocal melodies would have a good point here . Normally I 'd disagree with those people but not in this case . \" Slow Train \" has a somewhat groovy rhythm , okay lyrics about a woman down in Alabama and figuring out and establishing your principles . The guitar solo is actually really good . Best song so far . \" Gon na Change My Way of Thinking \" is a MAJOR low point . Unsatisfying and disappointing Joe Walsh style mid - tempo hard rock with a VERY lackluster heavy guitar riff chugging along for the entire duration . I 'm mystified how so many Dylan fans can easily forgive such a failed experiment . \" Do Right To Me Baby ( Do Unto Others ) \" is where the religious lyrics are beginning to overstay their welcome as they 're now becoming excessively irritating . The bigger problem however is that there 's * still * very little in the way of exciting musical ideas taking place here . The songwriting is definitely uninteresting to me . Just because Dylan finally revealed his feelings on religious matters does n't automatically mean these songs are a pleasure to hear . \" When You Gon na Wake Up \" is lyrically quite tedious and straight forward despite Dylan telling it like it is . I 'm sorry but this song sounds WAY too similar to Dire Strait 's \" In the Gallery \" released a year before . Same vocal mannerisms and punchy rhythm . I * do * like how the tempo picks up during the chorus at least . Yes and I 'm aware that members of Dire Straits participated on this album so Mark Knopfler 's style was bound to be noticeable either way but eh ... I also have mixed feelings when the Band joined Dylan . When you combine two artists with a distinctive style the result is that it usually limits the potential of * both * artists , or rather , encourages them both to hold back their full scope of creativity which is the case here with Dylan and Knopfler . \" Man Gave Name to All the Animals \" is a reggae style tune with a strong appearance of female vocals . Dylan 's voice is exceptionally hoarse but both the verse AND the chorus are oddly melodic and appealing to me . This song almost sounds cute ! Definitely the most unusual song on the album . It avoids resembling generic disco beats at least . but ... this is no ordinary piano playing ! It 's VERY spiritual , uplifting , and emotionally a highlight . Maybe even the best song on the album both lyrically and musically . Great way to end the album . Man , I do n't know guys . Songs such as \" Got ta Serve Somebody \" , \" Precious Angel \" , \" I Believe In You \" and ESPECIALLY \" Gon na Change My Way of Thinking \" are REALLY unappealing to me . I suppose the rest of the material is passable but come on , Dylan 's first religious - themed album is hardly flawless . Look beyond the lyrics and notice the mediocre songwriting covering up most of the album . On a final note just let me mention that I have no problem whatsoever with the lyrics . Dylan covers religion exceptionally well and his conversion to Christianity is commendable , but I would n't expect any less from the master of creative wordplay . Besides , every Christian I 've ever known has always been super polite and supportive towards me and my decisions . The problem I have with the album is that the music does n't match the lyrics . Not many ( if any ) artists entered the dreaded , horribly dated days of the disco movement and came out with flying colors . It 's just impossible for me to look beyond the generic music and focus on the lyrics .","summary":"this train should have come to a complete stop","unixReviewTime":1335484800,"image":null}

After Slow Train Coming Dylan would go into a finger pointing faze preeching instead of spreading the word of his lord , but doing so with the threat of hellfire and brimstone and consequently losing a lot of his fan base in the process not that he cared . Slow Train Coming was a rare album and a rare moment in the history of Bob Dylan because we never saw him this happy , voulnerable , or inspired again in his career \n\n With the exception of ' When You Gon na Wake Up ' the album is mostly happy and up beat in praise and very possitive . The song ' When You Gon na Wake Up ' was a sign of things to come in a negative way , becaus earound the corner was nothing but judgement from Dylan . Really it was nothing but albums of judgement . But being as this record was recorded with legendary hardcore Jewish producer Jerry Wexler ( Ray Charles , Motown ) , I do n't think the man would have stood for finger pointing . ' Got ta Serve Somebody ' became Dylans last hit single of the 1970 's as well as his last hit single of his career . It 's got a very loose feel and is full of Jamacan influence and lots of heavy organ , it is easy to see why this became such a big hit . Throughout the album someone other then Bob Dylans musical abilities shine , and that is of Mark Knopfler of Dire Straights , yes the legandary axe slinger plays through out the album and is an asset to the team on tracks like ' Precious Angel ' and ' Slow Train . ' The former is amazing and would have fit well on Dire Straights debut . The later ' Slow Train ' is quite simply one of the best songs that Bob Dylan has ever recorded in his life period . Dylans lyrics have always been known for beig nothing short of brilliant , but on this album they seem and feel more inspired then usuall . That may be do to his new found faith . The imagery dipicted in his words are amazing and you feel like your there whitnessing Dylan speak to his lord right in front of you . Man Gave Names To All The Animals ' does seem like nothing more then a childhood neursery rhyme but it does at nice texture to the album and lighten the mood a little as it is a nod to Noah and his ark . Slow Train Coming is a must have for all fans of Dlyans work . It is his last essentail album for almost thirty years . After this Dylans albums were all hit or miss and even the decent ones are not essential and sound very dated . It was n't until the late 1990 's that Dylan did anything worth while . Since then he has released three albums that are among his best , Time Out Of Mind , Love And Theft , and Modern Times . Make Slow Train Coming apart of your Dylan collection .","summary":"Slow Train Coming","unixReviewTime":1177286400,"image":null}

Released in August 1979 , Dylan 's trek into Christian teachings and philosophy are heard in the nine songs , that clock in at about 47 minutes , with the album reaching number three on the U.S. and number two on the U.K. album charts . \" I just ca n't make it by myself \" \n\n Though most of the instrumental focus is rightfully on the Muscle Shoals Horns and Mark Knopfler ( g ) & Pick Withers ( d ) of Dire Straits , the powerful background vocals of Carolyn Dennis , Helena Springs and Regina Havis place exclamation points on the powerful gospel numbers . Got ta Serve Somebody does not skirt the stark consequences when a person willfully elects to pursue the avenues of evil . Precious Angel has an utterly beautiful melody and you will not hear as powerful a sermon from any pulpit as found in Gon na Change My Way Of Thinking . The guitar solos by Knopfler on Slow Train compliments the classic Dylan lyrics and America 2007 is found in When You Gon na Wake Up , as provocative a protest song - written for 1970s America - ever penned by Dylan . \" I 'm a little too blind to see \" \n\n But the song , I Believe in You , which concerns being cast out due to unpopular religious beliefs , seemingly set the stage for a six - month tour - starting on November 1 , 1979 - to promote the album . Dylan would not play older compositions - radio ads and other media material informed fans of the tour structure - and he oftentimes spent portions of the concerts lecturing hecklers who yelled out song requests or derided him for his Christian beliefs . But what was lost in much of the critical noise then is Dylan 's powerful messages of protest \/ patriotism , fellowship , friendship and love - themes that he had written about in the past - were given additional meaning when a rainbow of promise & hope appeared in his life . That he wanted to share his faith with others made his personal mission to spread the gospel even more wondrous .","summary":"Dylan's Greatest Moment In The Studio","unixReviewTime":1177286400,"image":null}

The year 1979 saw his most shocking transition . One that challenged and threatened Dylan 's career like no other . Dylan began espousing Christianity and throwing around the term \" born again \" . Jerry Wexler , who produced \" Slow Train Coming \" , told Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin that \" I had no idea he was on this born - again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me . \" Wexler diplomatically told Dylan to back off , but he produced the album anyway . So in the heyday of punk the performer many people associated , fairly or unfairly , with 1960s \" radicalism \" turned explicitly Christian . Not only that , 1978 's \" Street Legal \" met with an extremely icy reception . For many fans Dylan 's new \" phase \" was too much . Dylan 's \" Christian phase \" ( though arguably not a phase ) now looks somewhat innocuous from a historical perspective . After two ( some say one , some say three ) more \" Christian \" albums , Dylan 's lyrics morphed once again . Would his career have survived had he plunged permanently into Christian music ? Hard to say . Many thought he was through in 1965 . He may have simply found a different audience ( though in the 1970s that audience would probably have been a small one ) . Regardless , the 1980s were probably the low point of Dylan 's career from many perspectives . \" Slow Train Coming \" is a Christian album . It makes no apologies for this . Though far less preachy than its successor , \" Saved \" , the theme of the album remains unmistakable . \" When He Returns \" , the album 's passionate closer , more than demonstrates this with lines such as \" He 's got plans of his own to set up His throne when He returns \" . Whether or not listeners accept this album most likely depends on their attitude towards the lyrics . Because there 's nothing wrong with the music on \" Slow Train Coming \" . \" Got ta Serve Somebody \" grooves in a way that Dylan had never really grooved previously . \" Precious Angel \" features Mark Knoplfer 's distinctive guitar style and probably one of the best Dylan drawls ever recorded : \" Ya know I just could n't make it by myself . I 'm a little too blind to seeeEEEeeeeee . \" \" Slow Train \" contains an ominous groove . \" When you Gon na Wake Up \" lashes out at society 's failings . Whether one agrees with the religious perspective or not , the criticism here seems valid and constructive . Only \" Man Gave Names To All The Animals \" sounds a little trite . Everything else on \" Slow Train Coming \" receives passion and conviction . Again , whether or not one agrees with the overall message , Dylan 's performance is outstanding on this album ( it even bagged him a Grammy for \" Best Rock Vocal \" - something his detractors , especially those who find his distinctive voice grating , must have cringed at ) . \" Slow Train Coming \" just adds proof to the argument that Bob Dylan remains one of the most provocative , controversial , and intruiguing artists of the 20th century . Apart from the music , he 's given his fans plenty of challenges , and given future generations an almost insurmountable amount of material to ponder and debate about .","summary":"The most shocking transition of Dylan's career...","unixReviewTime":1118534400,"image":null}

This does not make it any better or worse than Saved or Shot of Love .

Moore","reviewText":"This album was a great shock , understandably , to many people when it came out - almost as much as Self - Portrait was . For that reason , and for Dylan 's subsequent backing off from his Born Again phase - which has since received a certain \" cornpone \" status in his mythology - this album is often overlooked by many people . Let me be honest : if it was n't Bob Dylan who made this album , I probably never would 've listened to it , much less bought it . I am not a religous person , and Gospel and Gospel - inflected music are not among my favorites . I held off on buying this and made it one of my last Dylan purchases . However , let me be the first to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised ! Odd as it may seem , this album is actually a return for Dylan in many ways . Ever since Blood On The Tracks , Dylan had been dipping his toe into more and more complex musical visions - the international vibe of the Desire album , the Rolling Thunder Revue , the big band - addled Street Legal , and his subequent \" Vegas \" tour - and this album goes back to the stripped - down rock band arrangements that he had long been known for . Whether or not you like it as much as his previous two albums - I do n't , personally - it 's easy to see that it 's more focused , more concise , and that Bob was way more into it . Here we see him , perhaps for the first time ever , trying his hardest to make his music as smooth , polished , and presentable as possible . Clearly , Dylan was trying to reach as many as people as possible with this album , something he had never cared about before . The production by Barry Beckett and Jerry Wexler on this album is immaculate , and still sounds great today . It sounds better than anything he has recorded and released since ( with the exception of the re - mastered songs on Biograph . ) It 's a sad fact that Columbia has neglected the Bob Dylan catalog - without argument , their most important artist - with only one of his albums , Street Legal , being remastered ; and this is one of his few albums that still sounds great today . Furthermore , Dylan took even greater steps : hiring the then - in vogue ( and terrific ) group Dire Straits to be his backing band , and going down to Alabama to record the album with the Muscle Shoals Horns and a full gospel choir . Although the music on this album is not his best , and certainly not his most original , it is a very tight , focused effort . Mark Knopfler has gotten props several times for his playing on this album , and it 's easy to see why . The rest of the players , as well as the production , are top - notch as well . The album is not necessarily what you might expect lyrically , either . Certainly , it 's steeped highly in Christian imagery and Biblical allusion , particularly that of the book of Revelation . But , Dylan had been weaving Biblical allusions into his lyrics for his entire caree - from early tracks like When The Ship Comes In to practically the entire album John Wesley Harding , to the deeply spiritual - leaning Street Legal . Of course , he had never approached it the way he does on here . They are not merely enrichening the songs , they ARE the songs . The lyrics can be a bit dogmatic at times - and , of course , self - righteous - but you can enjoy , and like , them regardless of your own personal set of beliefs . Even if you do n't agree with the opinions expressed within , you can still appreciate them as art . They do often have a very arrogant ring to them - Bob is practically breathing fire and brimstone on some of the tracks ! No less a figure than Nick Cave has gone on record as saying that this is his all - time favorite album , citing its \" anger and nastiness ... certainly not like the thing you find on most Christian albums . \" We get bitter , impassioned performances from Dylan on such songs as Got ta Serve Somebody and Slow Train . He had n't been this focused and into his material since ... well , quite a long time . You can tell he 's really into it , and truly pouring his heart out into his vocals and his performances . Standout tracks include the Got ta Serve Somebody , a \" list \" song with some truly biting vocals from Dylan ( it 's just unbelievably cool to hear him stretch out that word \" somebody \" ) , for which he won a greatly deserved vocal performance Grammy . Precious Angel is nothing less than a love song - a moving ode to the woman who turned him on to Christianity . Slow Train is an absolutely ferocious song that attacks corrupt politics - one of the album 's sub - themes - while weaving in much distressing imagery from Revelation . I Believe In You is an absolutely beautiful song about unwavering faith ( Dylan as JOB . ) To be sure , not all the songs are of this quality , and some even border on embarrassing , now . Still , this is quite a good album , and an essential one for any Dylan fan . Whatever one might say about Dylan 's conversion , one thing is certain : it re - invigorated him artistically , and got him interested in his work again and he turned out his most focused and concise album since Blood On The Tracks .","summary":"Underrated","unixReviewTime":1019347200,"image":null}

It does nt cover all of her hits , but maybe there will be a Volume II where she can add all those missing ones . Great job Lorrie , country radio may not play your music , but your fans do love you so much and we appreciate your hard work !","summary":"Lorrie is Amazing","unixReviewTime":988675200,"image":null}

I understand you ca n't expect a bunch of guys who are a combined twenty billion hundred million thousand whatever years old at that point to , in the immortal words of either Franz Kafka or George Clinton ( not sure which one ) , \" tear the roof off the sucker \" like they used to do back in \" the day \" ( no , not that day , the other day ) , but it 's still kind of stoic and boring . Now , the good news : everything else is far better . Especially when the group just jams - \" Back Where It All Begins \" , for instance , might even be better than the studio version . And you know how they always slightly vary \" In Memory of Elizabeth Reed \" when they play it live ? Well , here 's it 's all acoustic ! And it 's sweet ! Especially when it comes to the soloing . Now , here 's a proposal for a bill that should be signed into federal law : all bands must record and release at least one song with an acoustic guitar solo . I mean , how cool is that ? And \" The Same Thing \" has some fantastic heavy blues licks - it 's about the heaviest the group has ever gotten , in fact . Their Bo Diddley tribute \" Nobody to Run with \" ( one of the four songs from Where It All Begins , along with \" Back Where It All Begins \" , \" Soulshine \" and \" Sailin ' ' Cross the Devil 's Sea \" - all three are awesome ) is good fun , as it was on the studio version . And they save ( arguably ) the best for last with \" Jessica \" , with some slight shifts in tempo that give it an epic feel , as well as the usual great guitars that this incarnation of the band has in spades . It won a Grammy , and I understand why . It might even be better than the classic original . But that 's a tough call . Think they were feeling nostalgic ?

The opening song , Sailin ' Cross The Devil 's Sea sounds great , a lot like the studio version , and features Gregg Allman 's legendary blues growl . Gregg and Warren Haynes both shine on this inspired version of Warren 's Soulshine . Dickey Betts ' Latin - flavored and breezy Back Where It All Begins features a long guitar jam , where he and Warren trade interesting and enthusiastic solos . They also do a great job on No One To Run With . They dip into the At Fillmore East catalog with a very good version of You Do n't Love Me , and while not as ambitious as the 20 + minute Fillmore East version , it is very good , and Dickey even flashes back to the earlier version by quoting his guitar solo from it . It 's really an amusing and touching moment , and it sounds good , too . They also do a nice cover of another old blues song , The Same Thing . This recording of Jessica won the Allmans their first and only Grammy Award , and what a wonderful version of Jessica this is ! With dual guitar harmonies and more bongo drums and percussion than the studio version , the song sounds almost completely different from the original , and stretches out over sixteen minutes . Even with all this , the real highlight on the album is the breathtaking unplugged version of In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed . WOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The newbies who think Dickey Betts is no more than a mediocre guitarist should listen to this , and then reconsider . Warren Haynes stays right up there with him . The two guitarist show what they can really do on acoustic guitars , and bassist Allen Woody shines , too . This is priceless , a real gem that no ABB fan would want to miss . Like the First Set , the 2nd Set was produced by music legend ( and At Fillmore East producer ) , Tom Dowd , and the sound is exquisitely crisp and crystal clear . The clever packaging on both sets is almost identical , with the same cover photo , except the First Set is blue , the 2nd Set is red , and the photos inside and liner notes are different ( the layout is the same ) . This was a good place in time for The Allman Brothers Band and their fans , and it really shows on An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band , First Set and 2nd Set .

It is not the 2nd set from the earlier \" An Evening With the Allman Brothers - First Set \" . In 1989 , the Allman Brothers reformed , adding Warren Haynes on guitar and Allen Woody on bass . Next came \" An Evening With the Allman Brothers \" , which was recorded in 1991 . On the cover in little print , was written \" First Set \" . They then recorded the studio album \" Where It All Belongs \" . In 1994 they went on tour again , and released a CD from the tour called \" 2nd Set \" . This CD is very good , but not quite as good as the \" First Set \" . The old songs are played in new and exciting ways . The acoustic version of \" In Memory of Elizabeth Reed \" , is very interesting ( but not stunning ) . The new songs are all very good . The real show piece is \" Back To Where We Belong \" . It ends with a 15 minute version of \" Jessica \" that does n't sound very much like \" Jessica \" . There is alot of jamming and playing around with bits of \" Mountain Jam \" thrown in . There are no bad spots in the CD , but it does n't have the continous intensity of the \" First Set \" . Note that \" First Set \" , \" 2nd Set \" and \" Seven Turns \" can be bought together as low priced packaged set . Woody died last year and Haynes is now playing with Phil Lesh and Friends .

So he calls up ex Electric Flag and Paul Butterfield Blues band ace guitarist MIKE BLOOMFIELD and together they determine to make a ' quickie '   a Blues and Soul jam album they 'll pump out in one manic session . They get down enough material for one whole side of an LP ( a couple of covers and some originals ) - but Kooper needs the remainder . With Bloomfield flown the coup ( chasing things other than the blues ) And out of these most unlikely of ' sessions '   history was born . Columbia CS 9701 ( Stereo ) peaked on the LP chart at an impressive 12 and started a run of superstar jam sessions - all trying to capture the same lighting in a bottle ( common consensus agrees that few got near it ) . Al Kooper 's liner notes explain that he 's gone back with Engineer ALLAN TUCKER to the original master tapes and 24 - bit remastered the album to CD . And in keeping with fan - requests over the decades   he 's taken off the ' horn ' overdubs put on the long jam sessions so devotees of this iconic and cool 60ts album can finally hear Bloomfield workouts like \" Albert 's Shuffle \" and \" Season Of The Witch \" ' sans horns ' ( see bonus tracks 10 and 11 ) . They are magnificent and arguably up there with the best Bonus Tracks ever issued . All in all - you have to say that given what they had to work with   Kooper and Tucker have done a bang - up job . Here is the ' Man 's Temptation ' ... \n\n US \/ UK released April 2003   \" Super Session \" by BLOOMFIELD , KOOPER & STILLS on Columbia \/ Legacy COL 508071 2 ( Barcode 5099750807125 ) is an Expanded Edition CD with four Bonus Tracks and plays out as follows ( 77:14 minutes ): \n\n 1 . Albert 's Shuffle \n 2 . Stop \n 3 . Man 's Temptation \n 4 . His Holy Modal Majesty \n 5 . Really \n 6 . It Takes A Lot To Laugh , It Takes A Train To Cry Season Of The Witch \n 8 . You Do n't Love Me \n 9 . Harvey 's Tune \n Tracks 1 to 9 are the album \" Super Session \"   released August 1968 in the USA on Columbia CS 9701 ( Stereo ) and September 1968 in the UK on CBS Records S 63396 . BONUS TRACKS : \n 10 . Season Of The Witch ( 2002 Remix without Horns ) \n 12 . Blues For Nothing ( Outtake from the Session   first made available on the 1995 Mastersound CD of \" Super Session \" on Columbia CK 64611 ) \n 13 . Fat Grey Cloud ( Live )   Previously Unreleased ( Recorded 1968 at The Fillmore West , San Francisco , CA ) \n\n MIKE BLOOMFIELD   Guitar on Tracks 1 - 5 , 10 , 12 and 13 \n AL KOOPER   Vocals , Ondioline Organ , Piano , Electric and Acoustic Guitars \n STEPHEN STILLS   Guitar on Tracks 6 -9 and 11 \n\n GUESTS : \n BARRY GOLDBERG   Piano on Tracks 1 and 2 \n HARVEY BROOKS   Bass \n \" Fast \" EDDIE HOH - Drums \n\n The 12 - page booklet has an opening ' Producers Note ' from All Kooper not just explaining the recordings but the CD reissue and his ' without horns ' 2002 remixes . BRUCE DICKINSON was Executive Producer for the re - release and both the Michael Thomas original LP liner notes and the David Fricke Rolling Stone Review are reproduced ( four - stars from Robert who spends much of his time raving about Bloomfield when Kooper 's contribution was just as big if not more in my books ) . There are some black and white session photos and not much else . ALLAN TUCKER did the Mastering at Foothill Digital Studios in New York and the Audio is fantastic   full of power and presence and that sense of immediacy the recordings had anyway ( the Bonus Cuts are beautifully transferred too ) . It opens with a Bloomfield \/ Kooper Instrumental called \" Albert 's Shuffle \"   nearly nine - minutes of Shuggie Otis type Blues with Bloomfield shouting as he solos   Kooper letting loose on the keys ( an organ sound most would kill to get ) . Next up is the uber - cool \" Stop \"   an instrumental cover of a Howard Tate soul tune on Verve Records from December 1967 ( Verve VK 10573 ) . I ve loved this slinky little ditty for decades now and it still has that 60ts chug about it that utterly sends me . Next up is the first vocal by Al Kooper on their version of Curtis Mayfield 's \" Man 's Temptation \"   a song about a temptress who wants to \" ... ruin my happy home with man 's temptation ... But then we get the magnificent band really cooking on another Bloomfield \/ Kooper creation \" His Holy Modal Majesty \"   a 9:19 minute Organ \/ Guitar battle that feels like Santana gone Prog by way of the Blues ( and I still do n't know what the title means ) . Side 1 ends on the Traditional Slow Blues vibe of \" Really \"   5:26 minutes of Bloomfield letting rip on the frets while Kooper puts in huge chords on the Organ ( very tasty mama ) . Side 2 has always been problematic for me . It opens with A Stephen Stills take on Dylan 's \" It Takes A Lot To Laugh , It Takes A Train To Cry \" and to me it immediately sounds like the album has gone off the rails . The tune is OK   but thematically it comes over like poor mans Monkees instead of the fresh Bluesy workouts we were getting on Side 1 . Things are brought back from the brink big time by the stunning 11:08 minutes of \" Season Of the Witch \" ( a Donovan cover they did on the Side 1 all - day session ) . Columbia and CBS edited both it and \" Albert 's Shuffle \" down to fit on the A&B - sides of a 45 in October 1968 ( CBS 3770 in the UK , Columbia 44657 in the USA )   but it did little business despite the success of the album ( it 's a no - show here due to time constraints ) . Back to weird with the Hendrix flange cover of a Willie Cobbs tune called \" You Do n't Love Me \" which again is good   but still feels wildly out of kilter with the rest of the record . Then we enter mellow Jazz Soul territory with the saxophone - led \" Harvey 's Tune \"   another out of step instrumental that sounds like it should be in a Blaxploitation film instead of on this album . But then you 're hit with four corkers ... While the album has its incongruous moments   the bonus tracks act as an impossibly brilliant counterpoint   the first three sounding like the powerhouse Blues Session that should have been released . Why \" Blues For Nothing \" was left off the album and mediocrity like \" Harvey 's Tune \" left on is a total mystery ( 4:15 minutes ) and the two album cuts minus - the - horns actually seem to free the songs and focus you completely on the dynamic duo   Al Kooper on Organ and Mike Bloomfield on Guitar . \" Season Of The Witch \" is the prize here and stretches to its full 11:08 minutes - stripped and raw - it has a renewed power that 's thrilling . As if this is not satisfying enough   the live Instrumental Blues of \" Fat Grey Cloud \" is fantastic   Bloomfield joking first about ' tuning ' then letting rip   wild one second   Soulful Bluesy the next   with Kooper following after - pumping out an Organ Sound that is huge ( 4:39 minutes ) . In truth the original album is probably more four - stars than five - but this genius CD reissue with those stunning bonus tracks bumps it up again . Kooper sings in their funky cover of Donovan 's Sixties - sinister \" Season Of The Witch \" . And it seems that anything from that incredible ' super session ' was indeed worth picking up ...","summary":"\"...Pick Up Every Stitch...\"  Super Session by BLOOMFIELD, KOOPER & STILLS (2002 Columbia\/Legacy Expanded CD Remaster)","unixReviewTime":1441584000,"image":null}

First of all I went into the album having very little experience with Mike Bloomfield despite numerous reviews convincing me of the genius and spectacular beauty of Bloomfield 's guitar style . Well guess what ? I DO love the mans style ! It takes a while to warm up to it however , and this is mainly because he plays at such an intense speed that there 's hardly any time to catch your breath ! You need to hear it several times in a row to absorb and understand it ! Now when I first heard \" Albert 's Shuffle \" a thought occured to me ... \" MOVE over Eric Clapton ! \" because it sounds almost identical to some of Clapton 's heavy blues stuff such as the live version of \" Have You Ever Loved a Woman ? \" from his EC Was Here live album . It definitely falls under the same category of emotionally resonant blues , but regardless who influenced who ( though I think Clapton beat him to the punch but I could be wrong , hehe ) this song is downright amazing . Amazing how the guitar solos build through several layers of emotions and THEN to add more excitement , a keyboard solo makes an appearance around the halfway point , and it 's a highly melodic keyboard solo at that . It 's an interesting change of pace going from emotional guitar solos to melodic keyboard work . Perhaps the light touch of jazz after the keyboard solo is a bit much , but then again , this IS 1968 and considering this is what I believe the beginning of the classic years of rock , it 's quite a performance . There 's definitely nothing lacking or incomplete about this album overall , that 's for sure . \" Really \" falls under the same category- emotional guitar playing , melodic keyboard solos , jazzy tendencies , etc . Another high point . I absolutely LOVE \" His Holy Modal Majesty \" . In fact I actually first heard this song a few years ago on XM radio . What caught my attention is the bass groove that can be heard during the first couple minutes , and ... I had to do a google search to find THIS out , but the musical instrument jamming with the groove is something called an ondioline . Do n't even ASK me how to pronounce that , haha . It 's a high pitched instrument that 's somewhere in between an early synthesizer and a keyboard . Well whatever it is , it would probably irritate the pants off of me if it were to linger a few minutes longer BUT for just a couple minutes ? I can tolerate a couple minutes of a weird instrument ! Heck I can tolerate extreme pain for 2 minutes ! Well then again I 've never been tortured . Do n't get any ideas ! Anyway , that bass groove is ... WOW ! It makes \" His Holy Modal Majesty \" the best song on the album for me . It reminds me of something kinky or rather , an Egyptian girl being kinky , hehe . The rest of the song is occupied with fast - paced blues solos that are pretty melodic for the most part . \" Season of the Witch \" is the highlight for many people since it 's the most familiar song here . Well truth be told I never thought it was * that * great of a song- a slow - chugging , slightly ominous vocal melody that actually reminds me of Neil Young 's \" Down By The River \" for some reason , and the jazziness we eventually experience is ... eh , a bit much . Not a bad song by any means , and this is by FAR the best version of it too . 11 minutes is just too much for my limited attention span I 'm afraid ! Though it IS really melodic so at least it has that going for it . \" Stop \" is based around really cool , melodic blues guitar and keyboard soloing . Once again , the keyboard work strikes me as immediatley melodic whereas the guitar solos are a bit on the complex side so it takes time to search for the melodic lines . It 's awesome though . \" Harvey 's Tune \" is an atmospheric jazz instrumental . I love it . \" Man 's Temptation \" is a soulful tune with really beautiful and memorable vocals . I love the creative inclusion of horns as well . Yes there 's hundreds of 60 's songs that closely resemble this one in terms of atmosphere , arrangements and vocals but I do n't care- I 'll take them ALL ! \" You Do n't Love Me \" is dominated with the ULTRA cool phase shifter effect . You 'll know what I mean when you hear it . It sounds like you 're in a spaceship and headed for Saturn ! I wonder if todays technology can recreate this particular sound ? I have n't heard this effect used in any music after the mid 70 's . Anyway this is a blues \/ hard rock song similar to Robin Trower 's early work , and it 's awesome . \" It Takes a Lot To Laugh , It Takes a Train To Cry \" reminds me of the mid 60 's Byrds with a fast - paced , psychedelic part - country style . Those feel good vibes are in high quantity here as well . Overall , it 's super duper Super Sessions ! Pick it up for a solid taste of Mike Bloomfield , Stephen Stills and Al Kooper ( though for me Bloomfield CLEARLY steals the spotlight ) .","summary":"it's super alright!","unixReviewTime":1335830400,"image":null}

After the bands had finished their sets , late night jams were routine labratories . Hendrix , Jefforson Airplane , all the bands now in the pantheon hanging out and playing . This album is gives you a good idea of what this sounded like . Super Session is Al Kooper , Mike Bloomfield and Stephan Stills , backed by one of   the most underrated bassists of the era , Electric Flag 's Harvey Brooks . ( Bloomfield was in the same band . ) On the bill are blues jams , a few Kooper tunes , and a   fantastic jam on \" Season Of The Which \" by Donovan . These are the best players , and the jams have the craft of most studio albums .

Not many artists could pull off a rather loose \" jam \" session and have it hold up as well as this has . It just shows how much class and talent Al Kooper has . Tough enough , but how about when Mike Bloomfield fails to show on the 2nd day of the sessions , and Al has to recruit Steve Stills at literally the last minute . All things considered , it 's amazing that this album even saw the light of day , much less that it is considered a sort of classic of its type . Among jazz musicians , jam sessions are quite normal , but it 's usually a bit different for rock musicians . In this case , Al was as much of a jazz afficiando as he was blues , soul and rock , so he probably relished the idea to get Bloomfield and a good rhythm section , a couple of tunes he and Mike wanted to cover , and see what would happen . They did exactly that ( at least for one day ) and the results are pretty impressive . There are a few miscues : The phasing on \" You Do n't Love Me \" is very dated and gets annoying quickly . But still , if you can overlook the quirks and the obvious holes that are inevitably going to be there , there is a great spirit to this set . Sometimes living dangerously brings out what playing it safe could never get you , and I think that 's what happens here . The adventure outweighs the lack of preparation , and the results are a truly unique listening experience .","summary":"I don't know why it works, but it does","unixReviewTime":1177891200,"image":null}

It pushed the envelope passed the 2 and 3 minute danceable pop songs , creating a longer more progressive rock pallet , paying more attention to technical and subtle aspects of the music . The three musicians that created the super group , Al Kooper ( piano \/ organ \/ ondioline \/ vocals \/ guitars - Blood Sweat & Tears ) , Mike Bloomfield ( guitar - Bob Dylan 's \" Highway 61 Revisited \" , Electric Flag ) , and Stephen Stills ( guitar - Crosby , Stills Nash [ & Young ] , Buffalo Springfield ) , were all \" on hiatus \" from their most recent engagements . The three of them never actually played \" together \" , instead it was split into sets of Kooper \/ Bloomfield and the other by Kooper \/ Stills . The band was backed by a powerful rhythm section as well , Harvey Brooks ( bass - Miles Davis , Bob Dylan 's \" Highway 61 Revisited \" ) and Eddie Hoh ( drums - The Monkees ) as well as Barry Goldberg ( electric piano - Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels , Electric Flag ) . The heavy Electric Chicago blues works beautifully on the Kooper \/ Bloomfield originals , \" Albert 's Shuffle \" , \" Stop \" , and \" Man 's Temptation \" . The arrangements are precise , fluid and melodic . Kooper 's organ solos provide a groovy melodic edge to the music . \" Man 's Temptation \" is a very soulful number , reminiscent of Blood , Sweat & Tears . The 9 minute trippy waltz of \" His Holy Modal Majesty \" features the longest jam on the Kooper \/ Bloomfield side . The track also features Koopers electric keyboard - manipulated ondioline , sounding kind of like a tenor sax , although very unique . Due to health issues , Bloomfield was unable to finish the recording of \" Super Session \" . He 's first heard on a rendition of Bob Dylan 's \" It Takes a Lot to Laugh , It Takes a Train to Cry \" . Still 's biggest highlight on the album and a personal favorite of mine is \" Season of the Witch \" . This 11 minute epic song displays the boiling chemistry Kooper and Stills have working together , offering inspired interaction between the two . \" You Do n't Love Me \" allows Stills to play some heavy amplified distorted lead guitar , sounding a bit like Jimi Hendrix . This is one of those albums that age very well . Upon my first listen roughly a year ago , I was blown away at how fresh it sounded after all these years . It is unlike anything I 've ever heard , offering influence in a big way to the Electric Chicago blues and rock and roll movement . I am very pleased to say that the remastered version of this album , done by Al Kooper himself , sounds awesome , loud and clear . That 's something that fans of the original vinyl release will be anxious to snatch up .","summary":"Nothing short of super","unixReviewTime":1097452800,"image":null}

After nine hours of recording , Bloomfield and Kooper completed Bloomfield 's \" Albert 's Shuffle \" , \" His Holy Modal Majesty \" and \" Really \" , Howard Tate 's \" Stop \" , and Curtis Mayfield 's \" Man 's Temptation \" . At the completion of these first five tunes , Bloomfield packed up his things and abruptly left the studio . Still 's agreed to finish the sessions . As such you get two very different sounding recordings here . The first half -- Kooper and Bloomfield which contains some very nice blues and classic Bloomfield guitar . The last half features Kooper and Stills complete with jangly guitar and Buffalo Springfield like vocals . The disc is rounded out with some added bonus material featuring remix versions of \" Albert 's Shuffle \" and \" Season of the Witch \" without the horns and two others . An added bonus is \" Fat Grey Clound \" which is a masterpiece in itself . On the other hand , while this disc has some good tunes on it the addition of Stills and absence of Bloomfield leaves the recording with a hodgepodge quality .

I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan , there is some merit , although , the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much , so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills , but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit . Please . What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort . Sure , played hard , not much to show for it . I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on . Give credit to the remastering crew , though . You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is . The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I 've ever heard .

In fact , it probably would n't have hit # 1 if it had n't been for Nickelback being in the studio with their best - seller . But when they finally came around to the song , they saw it for what it was , an original rock piece that would go down as a rock classic from the 2000 's , and a riff that would go down in history as the bumper - music for many a radio program . Right off the bat , you get those classic rock riffs that just scream awesome with every note . They 're memorable , rockin ' , and most importantly , original . The verses continue the trend with the catchiness and the trademark Modest Mouse style . It might not make the most sense at first , but it all blends in one amazing song . And even though those trademark Modest Mouse vocals are incredibly hard to work - around usually , in this song they 're perfect . Nope , original songs require original vocals . No Nickelback notes are allowed here . Overall , this is going to be one of those songs that goes down in those Rolling Stone best of music books .

Now that Sony and BMG have merged their classical divisions , it 's possible to issue Ax 's excellent 1985 reading of the four Ballades -- the best ever done by an American -- with a 1988 recital of Mazurkas and the four Scherzi . The first recital was originally on RCA , the second on Sony . But just to confuse things a bit more , the readings here of Scherzos # 2 and # 4 are dropped in from an even earlier RCA recording . The provenance wo n't matter that much to the general listener , who will be happy with the budget price for probably the best Chopin two - fer on the market . Begin listening with the four Ballades , where Ax is at his most impassioned and inspired . Even three years later , when he got to Scherzos # 1 and # 3 , he had become more refined and relaxed , less a romantic risk - taker . He 's remained that way ever since , but here at least we can hear Ax in his glory . Faithful as I am to Pollini and Kisin in this repertoire , this collection often rises to their heights . - I returned to this CD recently , wondering if the rather uninspired music - making of Ax in later years indicated that I was mistaken about him early on . But I must say that his set of Ballades holds up next to the greatest I 've ever heard . they are the definition of charismatic .","summary":"Three phases of a great Chopin player","unixReviewTime":1150243200,"image":null}

It 's definitely slower and a bit more poppy than much of the other Cars stuff that he 's known for ... I'm not sure if that was by design or trying to fit into the cornucopia of music that comprised the 1980 's .

Shirley has such a voacl range as she has shown early in her career as when she was young in movies like Oklahoma . It also has that partridge family 1970 's feeling so if you were a fan back in those bell bottomed pants and big hair - do days buy this cd .

Well if you grew up with the Partridge Family music as I did then you know the happy memories and just pure fun the music provides . I was in my early teens at the time of the Partridge Family , owned all the albums then and have them all on cd now . But it is the holiday season when taking out this cd just makes all the great memories rush back and luckily I have those with me who love to share it and together we can make new memories . Granted it was only Shirley Jones and David Cassidy who really sang . But call it bubble gum or pop , the chemistry worked . This Christmas cd is pure hearfelt performances that bring the pleasures the holidays should . From the original peppy opening MY CHRISTMAS CARD TO YOU and other feel good tracks like SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN , JINGLE BELLS , ROCKIN ROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE and SLEIGH RIDE to the slower WHITE CHRISTMAS , BLUE CHRISTMAS and HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS we get the perfect blend of David Cassidy 's always great and reliable vocals mixed with the great Partridge sound . There is no sound in music like the backup voices on a Partridge song and it is great fun . And of course Shirley Jones get her solo turn on THE CHRISTMAS SONG . It will bring such fun and joy to these special holidays .","summary":"Partridge Holiday Magic","unixReviewTime":1292976000,"image":null}

Jingle my bell , though possibly inspired by Jingle bells , is a completely different song from the famous standard .

This album features Jan playing all of the instruments including acoustic piano , Fender Rhodes electric piano , moog synthesizer , Oberheim synthesizer and digital sequencer , Freeman string synthesizer , and mellotron along with a full drum kit . As it turns out , he is a pretty good drummer . Steve Kindler provides some violin work here and there , while David Earle Johnson provides percussion on The Animals and Sixth Day People . The music on The First Seven Days is a far cry from the full - out rave ups on Mahavishnu albums like Inner Mounting Flame ( 1971 ) and Birds of Fire ( 1973 ) . Rather , this is a very prog rock sounding album , with loads of synthesizers , European classical influences , rock influences , and with very little in the way of jazz . In general , the pieces range from quiet piano interludes to heavier tracks that feature the drums ( the title track for example ) . In general though , all of the tracks are very atmospheric and synth - heavy . For those of you that are curious , this album is not an exercise in mere \" blowing \" . Although Jan does flex some Mahavishnu - like muscle from time to time , the pieces are generally carefully composed and arranged , and exhibit a great deal of restraint for somebody with such tremendous \" chops \" . All in all this album is very highly recommended to prog fans , exploratory Mahavishnu Orchestra fans , and possibly even electronica fans .","summary":"Great synth prog from former Mahavishnu Orchestra keyboardist","unixReviewTime":1150416000,"image":null}

No less than three live albums-- \" Miles Davis in Europe \" , \" My Funny Valentine \" , and \" Four and More \" were drawn from these shows . \" Miles Davis in Europe \" is the weakest of these . The set consists of a handful of originals and standards Davis had been associated with for several years and Victor Feldman 's \" Joshua \" , recorded in this studio the previous month . The performances are decent enough , but it seems to lack something . Part of the problem is that Davis is at times detached-- his performance on \" Autumn Leaves \" for example finds him pretty really not digging in at all ( curiously enough , Coleman digs deep and produces a real gem of a performance ) . Much of the rest of the set shows that this was a very new band-- \" Milestones \" and \" Joshua \" both find Davis running full bore and soloing explosively ( particularly the latter , where Tony Williams pushes him on and on ) , but when Davis ' solo ends and Coleman takes over , the intensity drops way down , particularly on \" Milestones \" where Coleman seems to run out of steam . For all these gripes , there are still quite a bit of brilliant performances-- \" Walkin ' \" is probably worth the price of the disc alone-- Davis comes skidding in and whirls through his solo before turning over to Coleman , whose angular solo is unceasingly inventive . And Davis really digs in deep on \" I Thought About You \" , opening in a ballad form and really cutting loose into a deep blues feel . Still , all in all , there are other recordings by this band that are significantly better-- start with the studio effort or the other two live albums ( recorded some time later ) , come back to this one if you need more .","summary":"A band just beginning to find its feet.","unixReviewTime":1130889600,"image":null}

No , easily a SIX ! A one word Review ? SPECTACULAR ! An Essential Recording for any serious jazz collection . The big difference here is intensity and Tony Williams . The addition of the teenage drumming genius Tony Williams was a brilliant acquistion by Miles and it revitalized the quintet with his youthful freshness and orchestral cunning . And Davis formed one of the greatest rhythm sections in jazz history , along with the amazing pianism of Herbie Hancock on piano and the redoubtable Ron Carter on bass . Future \" NEA Jazz Master \" George Coleman , who synthesized Coltrane and Rollins into a personal style , was also a great ' get ' for the quintet ( beating out Frank Strozier , I 'm told ) . And they play like dervishes on this CD , finally released at a sensible price for such a classic recording . \" Autumn Leaves \" is FANTASTIC , both individually and collectively . Mile 's muted solo is so fresh , relaxed , and inventive . Coleman 's solo , composed of packets of notes , packs a powerful punch leading to a crescendo , opening the door for Hancock 's relentlessly brilliant , rhythmically varied solo with some great block chording . Note the fascinating musical conversation between Hancock and Williams at the beginning of the piano solo , before it surges back into 4\/4 . Carter 's arco bass solo is equally brilliant . But Williams is operating on a level of jazz drumming on a par with the greatest drum masters , driving and inspiring the musicians to new heights during their solos . WOW ! ! I 've listened to this song for decades and it still amazes me . But this was just the beginning ... enter \" Milestones \" . We 've heard \" Milestones \" a million times but Miles has concocted a new version for this occasion . It begins at a breathtaking pace , with a unison head that is not the usual toss - away head that Miles was sometimes fond of . \" Get it over with and let 's get to the solos . \" Not this time . The quintet is on top of ' all things unison ' . Mile 's fiery solo is one of his best up - tempo solos ever , Coleman 's ribbon of sound solo is fascinating , leading to Hancock 's truly spectacular solo . All pushed along by the brilliant rhythm trio , especially future DownBeat Hall of Fame member Williams . A fabulous performance . \" Joshua \" is in a similar vein as \" Milestones \" , but Miles had a plan . \" Joshua \" is distinct and invigorating with choppy rhythmic breaks delineated by Williams ' rim shots . Note how Miles stops in mid - solo , almost as a challenge ( \" What cha ' gon na ' do now , guys ? \" ) , and Carter and Hancock rush to fill in the pause before Miles surges back to finish an AWESOME solo . And Hancock 's solo is ' too much ' . After you listen to it , go back and key in on Tony Williams ' performance , he is formidable ! ! I could go on describing each excellent individual track . Later , Miles was so impressed that he made coast to coast telephone calls to Ralph Gleason to play and rave about certain parts of the recording , especially what Tony Williams was doing on the drums . For one known to be so self - critical , Miles was blown away by this quintet 's live performance ! So am I and I have been listening to this recording for decades ! This is a CLASSIC recording , jazz fans ,   A Real Keeper .","summary":"SPECTACULAR QUINTESSENTIAL QUINTET PERFORMANCE.","unixReviewTime":1117756800,"image":null}

Shaeffer","reviewText":"Evidently the title \" Simple Plan \" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band 's hits , you will sell more records . I really do n't know where to start with this one . This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers , and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy , with the exception of ONE pop - punk track , \" Time To Say Goodbye . \" It was said that during the three - plus years that passed between albums , that the group 's singer \/ songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer 's block . This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears ' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs , making Simple Plan sound like a boy band . Even when they try to rock out , the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place . And there are WAY too many piano - ballads . I think any trace of the faux - punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums , which were decent efforts packed with pop - punk hooks , can permanently be removed now . Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three - plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound \/ style on this new one that killed their career . It is the lack of originality , energy , and songcraft that will do them in . Lets face it , when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you , your band is not \" punk . \" And in the three and a half years this band was away , the scene changed , but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls \" unchartered musical territory . \" Perhaps \" UnCHARTED \" musical territory is more like it . This one is headed to a bargain bin near you , right next to all those old LFO albums .","summary":"A Greatest Hits of Ripoff Songs","unixReviewTime":1203206400,"image":null}

I 've always liked a Simple Plan , but they really mature on this album in a BIG BIG way . If you 're looking 4 more WHINING vocals from the lead singer you can forget it . He has finally reached P*berty and no longer sounds like Eminem . The lyrics to me just seem so much more mature and the group has collaborated so well with each other to create such an amazing piece of ART . I 've noticed the roaster contains some big name producers and that is probably what everyone is experiencing on the shift in sound . But it 's a very small semi change . The change actually seems like it 's for the better . \" I Can Wait Forever \" has got to be one of my favorite songs on this album . It 's a stand out track and is also an amazing ROCK BALLAD . Almost every song on this album is a 5 star track and the leads singer 's voice really sounds so soothing and beautiful this time around . The hooks to the CHORUS lines are beyond ADDICTIVE . Great to see this band mature and I 'm looking forward to see where this group lands next . Do n't pass on this album because it 's a total GEM .","summary":"WOW!!!!!

Shaeffer","reviewText":"Believe me , I am not a big fan of the electronic blips and blats that are littered throughout Simple Plan 's third full length album . And I also might add that there are no less than 4 ballads on the album ( one of which is a transparent re - write of Green Day 's \" Boulevard of Broken Dreams \" and the other sounds way too much like the Backstreet Boys ' \" More Than That \" ) . However , there IS a spectacular ballad on the disc , the piano - laden \" I Can Wait Forever . \" Simple Plan is always at its best , though , when it attacks a straightforward rocker , such as \" Time To Say Goodbye \" and the hook - laden \" Take My Hand . \" The boys do n't always hit the mark , but they deserve props for not putting out the same album three times in a row .... or like so many bands do , soften out completely ( like Relient K ) . There is a good bit of guitar rock here , and far more hooks than other bands in this genre crank out every few years . I give it four stars because at times the sound is intriguing , and other times it is annoying ( like on the disasterously embarrasing track \" Generation ' ) , and although the band goes to great lengths to sound different or unique , in some form or another , you have heard all of these songs before . Here 's a run - through of a few selected tracks : \n\n When I 'm Gone - First single off the album , big hook & chorus , but   kind of slow - paced . Take My Hand - The beat sounds exactly like The Bravery 's \" Honest Mistake \" but the hook is very catchy . Generation - Wretched synth intro , worse than Europe 's \" Final Countdown . \" This track is embarrassing . Time To Say Goodbye - Their trademark pop - punk sound . I Can Wait Forever - No , this is not a cover of the song by Air Supply . This is actually a great track and the best the band has ever done . Hope you enjoy .","summary":"Can't Argue With Good Hooks","unixReviewTime":1202860800,"image":null}

I also remember hearing it for the first time at my older friends birthday party on the new boom box that he had just received as a gift . I still remember this moment as one of the coolest experiences and moments in my life . I mean in the early 80s run dmc was IT ! ! I love all of their stuff especially the super iconic \" walk this way \" with the band Aerosmith . If history and memory serve me , I believe that this was the first collaborative project between a quintessentially rock n roll band and a hip - hop , rap group . I never knew back then that I would be making music history for now . I feel honored and privileged that God let me be there and experience it first hand . as for run DMC , it was made up of three influential rappers , performers from Hollis Queens , NY . these members were Joseph \" Run \" Simmons , ( yes , younger brother of the famous promoter , business mogul , Russell Simmons ) , Darryl \" D.M.C. \" McDaniels and Jason \" Jam Master Jay \" Mizell ( who is now deceased ) . little did they know growing up in Hollis that they would be hip - hop and music pioneers . they were the first hip - hop group to do many things that previous groups , hip - hop or not , were not privileged enough to do . they were the first to have videos on MTV , the first hip - hop group to be on the cover of rolling stone magazine , the first to have a hip - hop album go gold and the first to be nominated for a music grammy award and the list goes on and on . my favorite was their appearance on the show \" american bandstand \" hosted by the legendary dick clark . I know because i never missed an episode :) lastly , their tremendous influence on music and pop culture was cemented in 2009 when they were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame . ( the only other rap group to do so was Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five . ) personally , i ca n't give enough accolades to the group . I just know that they surely do n't make music groups like this anymore . with \" its tricky \" I was able to enjoy the \" fresh \" ride back to the early 80s when rap was new and genuine- no fakes here ! ! it was nothing but good memories , I say ! ! I wish I could bring them all back ! purchase a sample of music history and enjoy ! ! !","summary":"this song is so \"FRESH\"!! a truly momentous early 80s historical flashback!!","unixReviewTime":1390867200,"image":null}

Mr. Hankey and friends deliver 45 minutes worth of foul - mouthed & high spirited Christmas tunes . Some are originals and some are just completely butchered reworkings . If you 've seen the South Park episode of the same name , you are familiar with only half the content of this CD . The rest of it is just as much of a treasure . Sure , everyone 's heard \" Christmas Time In Hell \" and \" Merry F'ing Christmas , \" but the best songs are the ones that slip under the radar . \" The Most Offensive Song Ever \" , a duet between Mr. Hankey and Kenny proves to be just that , focusing on Virgin Mary . Cartman 's \" Swiss Colony Beeflog \" comes as a favorite to me . Little Eric reaches Bruce Springsteen type singing when yearning for that one thing that truly makes Christmas special . \" Hark The Herald Angels Sing \" is done very hilariously and sloppily by the South Park Children 's Choir and Stan 's sister Shelly lisps her way through \" I Shaw Shree Ships \" ...

I come running back to you , you push me away , you push , you push me away . \" Off The Wall gave us She 's Out of My Life and the real tears at the end of the song . I am not sure if it has ever been revealed as to whom the ' she ' is that he is referring to , Then , then there came Thriller and MAN ! , it is STILL thrilling us ! The flow from beginning to end has perfect placement and when we arrive at its conclusion , \" There 'll be no darkness tonight , Lady our love will shine ( Lighting the night ) , Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise ( Now is the time ) , Girl , you 're every wonder in this world to me , A treasure time wo n't steal away ~ So listen to my heart , Lay your body close to mine , Let me fill you with my dreams , I can make you feel alright , And baby through the years gon na love you more each day , So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life . \" And some people had the nerve to call this dude gay , and I do not mean happy .

In Michael 's voice , \" Yeah , and after we get off the ferris wheel , I 'll sing a few songs for you , and uh , you know , I always wanted a girl just like you , such a P.Y.T.

This album only confuses me all the more , but also delights me . The selections are superb , but the arrangements on this album tend to underscore Ellington 's bands strengths . At least to my ears it sounds that way . But I am not complaining because the musicianship is mind boggling . I am reviewing the CD version of this album , which contains the original eight tracks . The product page for the CD - at the time of this review - does not have sound samples . For those I recommend that you go to the page for the MP3 version of the album,&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/First - Time - The - Count - Meets - The - Duke \/ dp \/ B0013DCCS6 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">First Time ! The Count Meets The Duke<\/a > , which not only contains representative sound samples for the original eight tracks , but an additional seven bonus tracks that were released with the reissue of this album . Those sound samples will convey more information in a few seconds of sound snippets than I can possibly describe in words . Since reviews are crosslinked between both formats you may already be on the MP3 version 's page . Although I will not attempt to describe the music , I will point out some of the reasons I love this album . First is the piano duets that feature both the Duke and the Count . Their styles are so radically different that hearing them together is a study in contrasts that perfectly complement one another . If ever there was a musician definition of Yin and Yan this is it . As a drummer I enjoyed picking out the contrasts between Sam Woodyard whose style made innovative use of pitch as well as rhythm , and Sonny Payne who knew how to set up each phrase in a composition and swing the band like crazy . However , as a musician , the melodic and harmonic complexities of each arrangement and the solos were a joy and a learning experience . Here is who marched into Columbia 's 30th Street Studio in NYC on July 6 , 1961 and made this all possible : \n\n BRASS SECTION \n Trumpet : REEDS AND WIND SECTION ( some personnel double on instruments and will be repeated   under more than one category ) Frank Wess \n\n RHYTHM SECTION \n Piano : Duke Ellington and Count Basie \n Guitar : Freddie Green \n Bass : Aaron Bell and Eddie Jones \n Drums : Sam Woodyard and Sonny Payne \n\n If you love Ellington , Basie or both this is an album to own . I recommend the MP3 version because of the seven bonus tracks , but either way this is a slice of history that we can all be thankful that it happened .","summary":"To this day I still cannot pick a favorite","unixReviewTime":1368576000,"image":null}

Incredible excitement jumps from the grooves as two of the finest musical ensembles ever assembled play together for the first and last time . You can absolutely feel the love and respect from the bands for each other and the music , and I tend to crack up in laughter at moments throughout this recording , the intensity is so overwhelming . These are some of the best jazz players the genre has produced , veterans of four decades of swing at this point in 1961 , and this one - off meeting never disappoints . Having each band in one channel makes this surreal on good headphones . Nice production too , solid remaster with the brass register rarely shrill . Along with Cannonball Adderley 's Know What I Mean ? , this is one of the sweetest semi - unknown jazz recordings . If you know someone who says jazz does n't rock , just throw on cut one , crank it loud and proud , and step back with a smile . Are there any musicians of this calibre still alive ?

It is intriguing to listen to the two pianists collaborate with such a great deal of mutual respect and understanding ( with the additional attraction of Billy Strayhorn as Ellington 's second pair of hands on \" Take the A Train \" , a great Strayhorn 's composition ) . Frank Wess ' flute seems to blend naturally with Jimmy Hamilton 's clarinet ; it is a great fun to hear Cat Anderson and Thad Jones working together and to root for Basie 's tenorist Frank Foster as he tries to chase Paul Gonsalves ( Ellington 's tenor sax road runner ) across the highway of \" Jumpin at the Woodside \" ... \n\n \" To You \" , \" Wild Man \" , \" BDB \" and other tunes offer many surprises ( although not all the moments are equally impressive ) , with Quentin Jackson ( tb ) giving great contributions regardless of the fact that , on this album , he comes from Basie 's band , instead of his more natural place with Ellington trombone section ... \n\n Ray Nance is also here , as well as Johnny Hodges , Lawrence Brown , Willie Cook and many others ( including the rhythm guitar of Freddie Green ) , contributing to this great band that uses some very interesting arrangements for this occasion . Not an Ellington record , or a Basie record , this is a great big band album , although novices to swing music should probably start with somewhat more conventional and less extrovert material ...","summary":"A big, big band","unixReviewTime":1165708800,"image":null}

Adams","reviewText":"Basie 's best players come to Duke 's place , the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in 1961 and face Ellington 's finest . Not a battle , but not quite a merger , either , since the Count 's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel . There 's more than an hour of good music on here , laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras . Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible . This is one of those rare CD 's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music . This one reveals that during this 12 - hour late - afternoon - to - early - morning session , one of Ellington 's long - time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague . Also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics . Basie hated Columbia 's first idea to bill the date as a competition , and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art . The end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name . The cover finally chosen says \" The Count Meets the Duke \" but in larger letters it declares \" FIRST TIME ! \" and then adds \" 2 Great Orchestras \" and finally states \" Duke Ellington and Count Basie . \" The label Columbia \/ Sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says \" Duke Ellington MEETS Count Basie \" which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20 's . If you already like both orchestras , you 'll want to own this late career session . If you want an introduction to each group in its waning years ,   the CD serves nicely for that , too . This disc really jives , so do n't be expecting any ballads here .","summary":"Big band jazz: loud, fervent, it's a last hurrah...","unixReviewTime":1054080000,"image":null}

The differences between those later collaborations ( after the Count , like the one with Coltrane ) is that the producers took away The Duke from his Big Band . The Coltrane album is just the two of them . That 's great , but Duke made his claim to fame with his big band , and this album with Count allows two of the greatest big band leaders of all time to go at it . The results are just splendid .

As anyone knows who has ever sung \" Endless Love \" it is one of the hardest tracks to nail as most of the song is sung on a high pitch , but Shania delivers and more . This was no small feat for her as she had not sung in several years and was having voice problems up until the day of the recording .

But for Lionel reworking on his classics for his album Tuskegee , he went back to the basics and a country twist on his classics . Lionel and Shania teaming up for Endless Love , actually feels fresh and new to a whole new era of fans . The song sounds pretty good from beginning to end , and a nice new start for Shania Twain . While Lionel showcased bits from himself , to the classic he had made with Diana Ross , there still is a lot of chemistry between the two of them in song and heart .

Their new product was by far some of the rock band 's best work . Vocals were incredibly melodic , the rhythm section was n't over powering , and the entire album just had amazing musical traits . STANLEY CLIMBFALL opens with a good rock dance tune , and soon becomes a collection of powerful rock ballads . The progressions to the songs are not much more than the standard I - IV - V , but there is a reason why that progression is so popular and it works perfectly with the pieces of this album . The band is built from the drums keeping perfect time and the bass as the melodic foundation so the guitars and vocalist can lay out their amazing performance . Everything played by these instruments are so independent from each other but the counterpoint is crafted so well , that the pieces are just outstanding . Dynmaics are a major key to these songs as they should be for any piece , but Lifehouse performs this musical aspect perfectly . STANLEY CLIMBFALL is a great piece of work and one to add to any music collection . Stand out tracks include : \n\n \" Spin \" \n\n \" Wash \" \n\n \" Sky Is Falling \" \n\n \" Stanley Climbfall \" \n\n \" Take Me Away \"","summary":"Lifehouse' Climb Doesn't Fall","unixReviewTime":1159488000,"image":null}

My first few listens were judgmental , and I did n't give the album a fair chance to shine , because I was expecting more poppy hooks and rhythms . After I let that out of my head , I listened to some pretty excellent music . Without a doubt , the two best songs on the album are \" How Long \" and \" The Beginning \" , two of the last songs on the album . They show maturity as a band , and there is a Pink Floyd kind of feel to them , as the songs make you drift off and you feel like everything will be OK upon listening , and shortly thereafter . \" Just Another Name \" , \" Anchor \" , and \" Am I ever Gon na Find out \" are other stand out tracks , and sort of have a pop sound to them , with catchy hooks . Jason Wade is a brilliant writer , and has a unique voice . I look forward to Lifehouse 's future work , as they are on the verge of putting out a masterpiece with their current evolution .","summary":"Taking a different direction....","unixReviewTime":1078099200,"image":null}

In Jason Wade , Lifehouse appear to have a genuinely first - rate frontman and a fine writer of melodic , literate rock songs and who at a young age seems to have mastered all the combinations of chord changes that have direct access to the heart . The sounds Lifehouse 's music immerses itself with have been used so frequently in the name of such mediocrity in the post - grunge era - that perhaps the hardest thing about listening to an album like Stanley CLimbfall is finding the conviction to believe in it 's greatness . Lifehouse are truly a cut above . This is an album that by turns embraces terrific monster - hooks ( Wash , Am I Ever Going To Find Out , and the title track ) and subtle yet glorious melodies which reward repeated listenings ( The Beginning , and the wonderful bonus track How Long ) which , incredibly , is actually a real bonus - not just a cast - off . This is one band that deserves all the success they can muster and I highly recommend that we contribute to bands that consistently offer quality , depth and a reaon to keep coming back for more .","summary":"Lifehouse bring it once again","unixReviewTime":1053907200,"image":null}

I frequently heard John \" Cougar \" Mellencamp 's \" Jack and Diane \" on a \" lite \" radio station in the 2000s , but always thought it was a recent release -- it was n't until recently that I learned it actually came out in the early ' 80s . This does n't detract from my enjoyment of the song , however -- I enjoy older music more than most modern music , and ' 80s music especially . And this particular song is a fun and thoughtful one , upbeat but with lyrics that anyone can appreciate . A mellower rock song with electric and acoustic guitars as the main instruments ( the drums are more subdued up until the bridge ) , this song showcases the titular teens as the main characters -- two kids growing up in a small town in America 's heartland , entertaining dreams of the future and enjoying each other 's company . Even as they make big plans for the future , the chorus and the bridge counsel them to hang onto their youth as long as they can , because everyone grows up eventually , and there 's no returning to the days of your youth . After all \" life goes on , long after the thrill of living is done . \" \n\n Whether or not you agree with that sentiment ( there 's still the old adages of \" age is only a number \" and \" growing old is mandatory , growing up is optional , \" after all ) , this is still a powerful song , sort of a grown - up version of Kenny Loggins ' \" Return to Pooh Corner . \" While the singer of the former longs for a return to the days of childhood , John Mellencamp seems content to reminisce on the teenage years , and accepts that they wo n't come back and it 's best to enjoy them as long as you can . A very enjoyable rock number , one that transcends its era and is timely even to modern audiences .","summary":"Upbeat but thoughtful rock number about growing up","unixReviewTime":1431561600,"image":null}

Actually , the best songs are the ones Willie does solo . The theme here seems to be centered around the challenges of getting older , and surviving the changes life brings us as we age . In the song This Face , Willie sings : \n\n And this old heart 's been beaten up \n And my ragged soul 's had things rough \n And this face is all I have \n ... worn and lived in \n\n The Great Divide is ambitiously produced ( that 's a good thing here ) with lots of varied instrumentation and musical textures , and it sounds kind of like a pop album with a touch of country . The Willie solo songs Wo n't Catch Me Crying , The Great Divide , and This Face are all deep , thoughtful and quietly contemplative , and the music fits them perfectly . The best of the duets continue this mood , and they include the somber You Remain ( w\/ Bonnie Raitt ) , the Bernie Taupin penned Mendocino County Line ( w\/ Lee Ann Womack ) , and the very , very enjoyable Do n't Fade Away ( w\/ Brian McKnight ) , which is an inspiration to anyone carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders : \n\n Do n't fade away \n Nothing is what it seems \n You 're lost and in between \n But you 'll find yourself again \n\n These songs are all very good in a world - weary , but resilient and hopeful way . Be There For You ( w\/ Sheryl Crow ) and Maria ( Shut Up And Kiss Me ; w\/ Rob Thomas ) are pretty good , too , but Last Stand In Open Country ( w\/ Kid Rock ) is a good song that could have been better if Willie would have found someone else to sing it with . Nothing against Kid Rock , but as a singer he 's a little out of his league here . Willie also does a great solo cover of Cyndi Lauper 's Time After Time that works very well . Recollection Phoenix ( written by Rob Thomas ) is also a very good and thoughtful song that Willie does solo . The Great Divide is n't really a classic , but it 's a very good country \/ pop music album that has some great songs on it , especially if you 're a survivor and in the mood for reflective and autumnal themes , and hearing Willie get a little help from his friends .","summary":"WILLIE NELSON FOR SURVIVORS !

I mean , this girl comes off the American Idol of England , comes to the states , and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to # 1 . Apparently America just loves those female R&B Love Song vibes . Leona Lewis herself has a rather good voice , and carries herself pretty well throughout the song . The song itself is pretty darn standard in the R&B Love Song genre , so it could be sung by Mariah , or any artist in that mold for that matter . No ground is broken , but it is a nice listen , and so far , it has not annoyed me to death , so that 's always a positive . So overall , nothing brilliant , nothing new , but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial . And , even though this might be saying much , this song might be better than most of Mariah 's work , since her stuff is so overly done , it 's pathetic . It 's also a nice change of pace that Leona is n't practically begging her lover to touch her body like another certain artist has done .","summary":"Better Than Mariah?","unixReviewTime":1207958400,"image":null}

I mean , this girl comes off the American Idol of England , comes to the states , and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to # 1 . Apparently America just loves those female R&B Love Song vibes . Leona Lewis herself has a rather good voice , and carries herself pretty well throughout the song . The song itself is pretty darn standard in the R&B Love Song genre , so it could be sung by Mariah , or any artist in that mold for that matter . No ground is broken , but it is a nice listen , and so far , it has not annoyed me to death , so that 's always a positive . So overall , nothing brilliant , nothing new , but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial . And , even though this might be saying much , this song might be better than most of Mariah 's work , since her stuff is so overly done , it 's pathetic . It 's also a nice change of pace that Leona is n't practically begging her lover to touch her body like another certain artist has done .","summary":"Better Than Mariah?","unixReviewTime":1207958400,"image":null}

Now , I do n't profess to know every song that 's ever been released , but I like to think I 'm pretty knowledgeable about most rock and roll from 1970 's to 2000 's anyway . Well , I had this dumb look on my face and said I did n't recognize it . So we looked it up on YouTube and found the \" video \" they did for this song in the mid 70 's ( possibly the most hilariously creepy video I have ever seen , worth the look up if you have the time . lol . ) and I said without a doubt that I had NEVER heard this song . So of course I had to have it ! ! It 's on my playlist now and we get a kick out of it whenever it comes on !","summary":"Till the night closes in!!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1418083200,"image":null}

In fact , he might be the most unoriginal guy in modern rock to come around in quite awhile , and that 's saying something . However , this time he does n't sound like another artist , he sounds like his bad self , or more specifically , \" Over You \" which was his previous single . Anybody else see something wrong with this picture ? And yet , he rules rock radio . The verses are mediocre at best , and the chorus on its short run on radio is already annoying the heck out of me . It just does n't seem real , like it 's a half - hearted effort or something ; something to please the record labels . Chris 's vocals are stellar as always , but contrary to popular belief , the song itself makes for most of its success , and this one is made , but it 's in pieces taped together in a quick effort to please a record executive . So overall , on if , if not Daughtry 's worse in a rather short career so far . Hopefully he 'll come out his sophomore album rather soon , so the rest of the musical skeletons in his compact disc closet will stay where they belong : hidden .","summary":"Feels Like \"Over You\"","unixReviewTime":1206403200,"image":null}

Although the song has lost a little of its luster after going through the ugly radio cycle , the song still remains as good as ever with its touching lyrics , perfect vocals , great structure , and its build - up during the course of the song . In fact , the only thing that could top this song , is its acoustic version , which I believe was distributed by Wal - Mart . It perfects the song in amazing ways , and makes the song a real stunner with new depths of emotion . That version was quickly added to my long list of best songs of all time . So overall , Daughtry 's best song , and it deserves all its praise . Try to get the acoustic version if you can , but either way , its a great song that 'll always be remembered for American Idol .","summary":"The Goodbye Song","unixReviewTime":1205280000,"image":null}

For example the plain demo and vocal version of \" The French Inhaler \" packs a wallop as does the solo piano version of \" Mohammed 's Radio \" . As with the \" Elton John \" two disc release that had demos on the second disc , this is one of those few albums that was great to begin with but has been improved by including these terrific alternate takes and solo demos . The band version of \" Carmelita \" captures the live vibe of how this sounded with a full band and I actually prefer it to the more somber reading on the original album ( although both are exceptional ) . \" Frank and Jesse James \" is SO intimiate you can hear the helicopter that passes over Warren 's home briefly at around the 3 minute mark . Warren Zevon considered this his debut but it was really his second solo album ( \" Wanted : Dead or Alive \" was his first an album he really disliked ) . The cream of L.A. musicians appear on this terrific album . Zevon 's vision focuses on the dark side of L.A. and America . \" Hasten Down the Wind \" , \" Poor Poor Pitiful Me \" and \" Carmelita \" were all tackled by Linda Ronstandt on various albums and as great as her versions are they lack the bittersweet quality Zevon infuses in his versions . The original album sounds good -- not great in this remaster . It 's louder , more compressed than the original but fans will really be picking this up for the second disc out outtakes and alternate versions of the songs on disc one . The track listing below represents what is on the second disc . The French Inhaler(Solo Piano Demo ) \n 3 . Backs Turned Looking Down The Path(Alternate take ) \n 7 . Join Me In L.A.(Alternate take ) \n 8 . Poor Poor Pitiful Me(Alternate take ) \n 9 . The French Inhaler(Alternate take ) \n 12 . Desperados Under The Eaves(alternate take ) \n 14 . Mama Could n't Be Persuaded(Live ) \n 15 . I 'll Sleep When I 'm Dead(Alternate Version ) \n\n Highly recommended for fans of Zevon . The remaster sounds solid although it does n't have quite the dynamic range of the original CD . While it is louder the mastering by Gavin Lurssun is n't bad just not ideal .","summary":"Zevon's seminal self titled second album terrific upgrade with an entire disc of bonus tracks","unixReviewTime":1226534400,"image":null}

In addition to his musical creations , he 's also has a hand in organizing a music festival in Westchester County ( NY ) . He 's also had some bad luck in regards to record labels . The last CD he released with his previous label , A440 Music Group was a critical success . However , the company suffered from a   cash flow problem to promote his and other artists CD 's and declared bankruptcy last year . Baldwin has since signed on with 215 Records out of Philadelphia for his latest release , \" All in a Day 's Work \" . For those who are not familiar with Baldwin , just think of Alex Bugnon with soul . His style is smooth , very hip . His music sounds very much like New York . it has an urban style that is sophisticated and classy . I thought that sound was clear with the title track as well as the song , \" Steamy \" . They were clearly the best tracks on the CD . I was very thrilled by his release . He 'll be in our play list for sometime .

Rather than deciding where to begin -- operas ? -- you can begin everywhere at once . The performances are not second - rate , they are excerpts from world - class recordings . You can use this set as the basis for further listening adventures , or you can use it as an end in itself . As such , it is surely a contender for Best CD In The World . If you bought complete recordings of every composition excerpted on this disc , you might have to file for bankruptcy , so do n't let purism stand in the way of enjoying Mozart . I used this set as my introduction ( it was previously packaged as THE GREATEST MOZART SHOW ON EARTH ) when I first ventured into classical music a couple of years ago , and so far I 've expanded into operas , piano concertos , violin concertos , and string quintets .

Hedges","reviewText":"I have to admit I did n't know what to expect from this CD but was very pleasantly surprised . I had heard \" I Do n't Want To Be \" on the radio and loved it . On a whim , I bought the CD when I was out shopping , and did n't expect the rest of the album to be so consistently good , but it is . While \" I Do n't Want To Be \" remains my favorite track on the CD , there are numerous other standouts as well including the popular \" Chariot \" and \" Over - Rated , \" another of my favorites . The beauty of the album is the eclectic amalgamation of styles from pop ( obviously , ) rock , and blues , with a weird alternative undercurrent . DeGraw undoubtedly has a powerful singing style ( though he occasionally flirts with giving an overwrought performance , ) and has clear command of the material and the needed vocal range to pull off these songs . For those of you who doubt this , give a listen to the bonus disc , \" Stripped , \" and his interpretation of the Sam Cooke classic \" Change Is Gon na Come . \" \" Stripped \" was one of the big reasons I bought the CD versus just downloading a few choice tracks : I love hearing alternate , unenhanced versions of music ( e.g. \" Unplugged , \" ) and while not simply DeGraw and a guitar or piano ( there are rhythm and drum parts ) I really enjoyed \" Stripped . \" In fact my initial inclination was to give the album four stars due to some homogeneity in the songs as originally presented , but \" Stripped \" changed my mind , and made the five star rating the only logical choice . On balance I still prefer listening to \" Chariot \" in its original form , but \" Stripped \" provides a refreshing alternative approach to the material and the bonus of \" Change Is Gon na Come . \" You might not think a young guy like DeGraw could pull off the Cooke civil rights watershed , but he does so convincingly and respectfully . I am surprised I liked this CD as much as I did as I am not generally a fan of the genre , but DeGraw is clearly a talented performer and has genre - defying dynamism : \" Chariot \" is a really good effort , and will provide hours of listening pleasure .","summary":"Powerful Eclecticism","unixReviewTime":1324512000,"image":null}

Gavin DeGraw is the new Van Morisson ! . . sensitive , passionate , lyrical . He does n't possess the typical pop idol voice or much less a crooner 's voice , what he has is a lot more . Every emotion , every nuances of each lyric is riding on his unabashingly strong vocals , raw with feelings worn on his sleeve . Makes a girl weak in the knees ! Chariot \/ Stripped is his defining album wether he becames more famous or just a one CD wonder . The second CD is like icing because it showed the process of coming up with the finished product . It was a nice bonus , highly recommend you listen to this one also . Each song so masterfully crafted , so poetically written , most are about longings , falling in and out of love but my favorite is \" Over rated . \"   about how after meeting that special someone , everything else seems so ordinary .

It 's so innocent . I think it 's a stronger song than Follow Through but they 're both good . Just Friends - 3.5 stars . This song is weaker than the 2 previous tracks . It has alright lyrics though . ( Nice to Meet You ) Anyway - 3.75 stars . Stronger than Just Friends , weaker than Follow Through . It makes for a decent song though . Chemical Party - 3.5 stars . This is a good song . It speaks about a girl who has fun at a party and enjoys everyone but Gavin . He 's drunk and she is high ... too high to realize him . This song is kind of weird . I do n't really know much about it besides some person defended and captured Gavin 's heart ... But the lyrics : \" When you came to my defense \/ With a knife \/ In the shape of your mouth \/ In the form of your body ... \" does n't make too much sense to me . I do like the ending though . Crush - 4 stars . Thank you , Gavin . You delivered another strong track . I love the composition of this song . Once again , good job ! I Do n't Want to Be - 4.25 stars . Gavin 's first single . It 's a great one at that . Gives off a good message . This song does n't really do much for me ... it 's skip - able . More Than Anyone - 3.25 stars . This song is a step up from Meaning but that 's not saying much . It really drags on ... \n\n Over - rated - 4 stars . This song gets a higher score than some because I really like the lyrics . The average is 4.20454545454545 . \n\n 4.2\/5 \n\n Final Grade : 4.2 stars . P.S. did n't really liked the actual stripped CD with the bonus remake track because the arrangements changed , and became less memorable . I have n't listened to it since . February 27 , 2008 : Much better ( the main CD ) these days .

Because it seems like for much of the album he just bangs away at his piano . The songs sound quite alike and at times he seems too sorry for himself , this is n't saying the album is bad . Hopefully on his next album he will learn from some of the mistakes he made on this album . Some parts of the album are perfect , it 's just not all of it is . Some of the lyrics seem a bit out of proportion for this album and do n't seem to fit . Like the lyrics on \" Belief \" are a bit sexually driven and are quite stupid and lame . The whole album does n't have a very sexually driven attitude at all , anyway that song is the only one that appears a bit out of the ordinary . \" Chariot \" has a very mature and overall wholesome feel to it . DeGraw seems to have real talent , writing all the songs himself in all , yet the comparisons I can make to Destiny 's Child is unforgivable . Some of the songs are really amazing though , such songs as \" Follow Through \" and \" Chariot \" .

But anyway , the first time I ever heard of Gavin DeGraw was when I saw him on Last Call with Carson Daly ( do n't ask me why I was watching that ) . And his song \" Follow Through \" is pretty good , so I decided to see what his album , Chariot , was like . There are some other good songs on here , like the title track and the song he has out now , \" I Do n't Want to Be \" . And when I looked at the lyrics to \" Meaning \" , I said , \" Oh boy , not another we - are - the - world song . \" But that song actually works pretty well . My favorite song on the album , though , would have to be the smooth \" More Than Anyone \" . As far as the rest of the songs go , they leave something to be desired , especially the filler track \" ( Nice to Meet You ) Anyway \" . \" Chemical Party \" and \" Belief \" have rather stupid lyrics , and \" Just Friends \" is fine until Gavin says something about that her body fits him like a glove . I do n't really Chariot is worth ALL the hype , but it 's still a nice album to play to pass the time .","summary":"3-1\/2 stars -- Not bad, not bad","unixReviewTime":1085529600,"image":null}

While a modest success saleswise as of yet , a thorough listen to the album proves the undeniable fact that this artist and album are destined for bigger , better places . Degraw has been at this for quite some time , despite having recently released his debut album . A native of Manhattan , he has been an integral part of New York 's music scene for a while now . His music being unique yet comfortably familiar , hometown fans have come in droves to see his local shows . While at first glance one might think they could lump him with other successful male singer \/ songwriters of lately who should n't even be being generalized in the first place such as Jason Mraz , John Mayer , Jack Johnson and , most recently , Josh Kelley , Degraw separates himself immediately from them with his smorgasbord of veering song structures , uniquely quirky lyrics and signature voice . It also helps that his album is n't produced by John Alagia and that his name does not begin with J. \n In the oddball \" Chemical Party \" he gives you a bird 's eye view of what it is to be \" too high to see the point \" , while the lead single \" Follow Through \" is a catchy tale of mutual sincerity in what could be the start of a rewarding relationship . \" I Do n't Have to Be \" , the set 's easy highlight , is an ode to individuality . \" All I have to do \/ Is think of me and I have peace in mind \/ I'm tired of lookin ' round rooms \/ Wondering what I 've got to do \/ Or who I 'm supposed to be \/ I do n't want to be anything other than me . \" \n One song with particular hit potential is the endearing \" ( Nice To Meet You ) Anyway \" , which could be considered an optimistic follow - up to the situation presented earlier in \" Follow Through \" , which did not work out in the scheme of things , resulting in his finding a more nurturing , special relationship . Also , in \" Over - Rated \" , the uplifting finish to CHARIOT , Gavin tells his companion that , because of her , he now sees the stuff of life to be materialistic and , as it turns out , not so important . Other definite highlights include \" Belief \" , a stream - of - conscious tune that features Degraw 's soaring vocals at its conclusion , and the album 's title track , which is delightful to the ears and can not help but bring a smile or even perhaps a chuckle to the listener . \" Your favorite fruit is chocolate - covered cherries \/ And seedless watermelon \/ Nothing from the ground is good enough \/ Body Rise \/ Look what 's over me \/ Oh chariot \/ Your golden waves \/ Are walking down \/ Upon this face \/ Oh chariot \/ I'm singing out loud \" . Hopefully Gavin will break into mainstream success similar to Jason Mraz , who did so quite a while after his debut album was released . With an excellent album , a strong local fan base and constant self - promotion , all the right things seem in place for fate to its course . One thing is for sure : This is definitely the start of something good .","summary":"A Gem of a Debut from NY Singer\/Songwriter","unixReviewTime":1069027200,"image":null}

There 's a dynamic chemistry found here , created from low end vibrations , Jimmy Page hooks , and Middle Eastern influences that do n't so much build in momentum ... rather they steadily carry you forward with an intoxicating obsession . As dark and lustrious as this album is , it feels very warm , nuturing , inviting , and impressive ... at times startling , fuzzed out , and breathtaking . But you see , I 'm trying to describe an acid trip , or a head full of mushrooms , and that 's just about impossible ... you 're either on board and know exactly what I 'm talking about , or you 're at the station , ticket in hand , waiting on sixty tons of locomotive to pull up , drop the steps , punch your ticket , and take you for the ride of a lifetime . Interesting Note : The Black Angels , like many others , have been heavily influenced by The Velvet Underground , copping their band name from The Velvet 's track \" Black Angel 's Death Song . \" And as if that were n't enough , they drew the connection even tighter by naming their publishing company Death Song , thus completing the song title in full . \n\n Review by Jenell Kesler","summary":"The Black Angels - Directions to See a Ghost","unixReviewTime":1354492800,"image":null}

It 's the drone , the psychedelic dirge , and attention to details that will mesmerize you to the core . I have since listened to this album hundreds of times and am amazed to discover new things to appreciate , be it the arrangements , the vocals , everything .

Granted there is n't much new to TBA 's sound , but this does n't bother me . They have such a distinguished sound already that varying it too much after just two releases was never necessary . As with the debut , the songs tend to flow and groove endlessly . The ` drone machine ' saturates everything , the drums are powerful and locked , the guitar tone is perfectly fuzzy and Maas ' piercing , nasally delivery is wonderfully fitting . Some songs have the tendency to drift on , but there are some real gems here . The one - two punch of \" You On The Run \" and \" Doves \" is a grand opening , with the former setting up a brooding , melancholy Velvet Underground atmosphere , only for the latter to cut through with some feel - good , sunshine pop psychedelia . Other highlights include the sombre \" 18 Years \" and the sitar - laden \" Deer - Ree - Shee \" . Generally , there is n't a bad song to be found here . \" Directions \" is another great album from The Black Angels that firmly cements them at the forefront of modern psychedelic rock .","summary":"More luscious psychedelia","unixReviewTime":1230854400,"image":null}

I would not be not disappointed . ( I confess that I have not heard the band 's first album , 2006 's \" Passover \" , yet at this time , but I will seek that out shortly . ) \" Directions to See a Ghost \" ( 11 tracks ; 71 min . ) starts off with a blast , \" You On The Run \" , which at first reminds me immediately of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club , but then the song evolves . \" Doves \" kicks off with thundering drums , only to be joined by even more thundering guitars , awash in reverb , just great . \" Science Killer \" starts with a great bass line , and eventually works into a frenzy , just great . \" Mission District \" reminded me of early Pink Floyd ( Syd Barret - era ) . The energy throughout the album is fantasic , shoe - glazing psychedelic - influenced music at its best ( and it 's not a coincidence that the Black Angels are now on the same label as Brian Jonestown Massacre ) . Other highlights for me include the hard - charging \" Vikings \" and the closer , a 16 min . epic \" Snake In the Grass \" which goes on forever , but you never want it to end anyway , fabulous . In all , this album is just great , and sure to make my \" best of the year \" list . Please note that simultaneously with the album , the band released an EP \" Black Angel Exit \" ( 4 tracks ; 24 min . ) , which you could get by pre - ordering the album , or now at the band 's shows ( which is where I got it ) . It is a great companion to ( and in the same vein as ) the album , with the 9 + min . title track as the highlight . I had the good fortune to catch the Black Angels in concert here in Cincinnati recently in support of the new album , and they were nothing short of fantastic , a delight for any fan of live music . Meanwhile , \" Directions to See a Ghost \" is HIGHLY recommended !","summary":"The Black Angels are the real thing","unixReviewTime":1214524800,"image":null}

Well , my question was answered after hearing their Bad Boy debut , Living Legends . I just finished listening to the album , and it 's like this : if you 're a hardcore fan of Ball and G , then you wo n't hesitate to pick this up . As for the rest of us ... \n\n Lyrically , Ball and G are still impressive for the most part . But since this a Bad Boy record , you ca n't really expect this to be like their other albums . You have to be ready for one or two radio - friendly joints . But sometimes songs like that are just blatant . This is especially evidenced by the song featuring Bun - B , which rides an obvious made - for - radio beat , yet is called \" The Streets \" . And then there are some questionable songs for the ladies , \" Forever \" featuring Lloyd ( note to those that still do n't know : Lloyd and Lloyd Banks are NOT the same person ) and \" Trying to Get At You \" featuring 112 . Love - oriented rap songs featuring 112 usually are n't more than filler ; ask Mobb Deep . Another filler track is the obligatory song about cars , \" Look At the Grillz \" ( featuring T.I. and Twista ) . It 's hard to enjoy the first verse especially , because whoever is rapping ( T.I. or MJG ) is doing it so low that I can barely hear him . And as far the interludes go , note to Diddy : \" Mad Rapper \" still is n't funny . Like I said before , 8Ball and MJG still have it lyrically , except for maybe some of the choruses ( \" Do n't Make \" , anyone ? ) . But questionable production , dry subject matter , and lame guest stars damper the party . Other reviewers see it debatable as to whether they should be calling themselves living legends ( but I do n't agree with the person that said Onyx is a living legend ) , but as far as I'M concerned , it 's like this : judging from this album , if one person says to another person , \" Man , 8Ball and MJG are living legends ! \" the response would n't be , \" And they 're still making great music ! \" It would be more like , \" O ... K ... Nice to know it .","summary":"Not as legendary as I'd hoped","unixReviewTime":1092096000,"image":null}

Highsmith","reviewText":"Although I had known about their CDs like \" On The Outside Looking In \" , \" Coming Out Hard \" , and \" On Top Of The World \" , I never had bought an 8Ball & MJG CD . In 1998 , I was heavy into No Limit Records and I heard a track on the \" I Got The Hook Up \" soundtrack called \" Let 's Ride \" that was pretty tight . Then once I heard \" Pure Uncut \" which was a track with 8Ball , Master P , Mystikal , Silkk The Shocker and Psycho Drama , I was sold on finally purchasing their CDs . I bought 8Ball 's \" Lost \" CD which included my favorite song \" Coffee Shoppe \" with 8Ball & Redman , MJG 's solo CD \" No More Glory \" and eventually once they were relased , \" In My Lifetime Volume 1 \" and \" Space Age 4 Eva \" . Two of my favorite 8Ball collaborations are \" Where I 'm From \" w \/ Mobb Deep on their \" Murda Muzik \" CD and \" Ride(Down South ) \" w \/ Foxy Brown , Juvenile and Too Short from her \" Chyna Doll \" CD . You also ca n't forget about the 8Ball & MJG collaboration from Mase 's 1st CD , \" The Player Way \" . When I first learned that 8Ball & MJG signed with Bad Boy I was a little skeptical at first . I know that Bad Boy does well as far as marketing their artists but I was worried that P Diddy might try to water them down a little bit . However , I was wrong . I happened to be watching Rap City one day and the video for \" You Do n't Want Drama \" came on I was nearly speechless . I just remembered turning the volume on the TV real high and nodding to the beat of the track . \" Living Legends \" definitely will reclaim 8Ball & MJG 's spot in the Dirty South game , not that they ever lost their spot , but it had been a minute since they had the beats to back up their potent lyrics . The first single , \" You Do n't Want Drama \" is clearly the best song on this CD . Shondrae definitely deserves props for this head nodding beat . Shondrae strikes twice on \" Do n't Make \" . In the video for \" You Do n't Want Drama \" , the video leaves from the club and then moves to the street , so I am thinking that they are still rapping the same song , come to find out that they had switched to \" Do n't Make \" . If you are a fan of any 8Ball & MJG singles , then you definitely need to get \" Living Legends \" for these two songs alone . However , they have more bangers for you as well . \" We Do It \" is produced by Nasheim Myrick , who has been making beats for Bad Boy artist for years . This song is as grimy as \" Do n't Make \" as you are able to tell the chemistry that 8Ball & MJG have since they have been rapping together for so long . This is another song that can contend as best song on this CD . \" Shot Off \" features Ludacris as 8Ball & MJG join Luda for a lyrical free for all as all 3 rappers hold their lyrical weight throughout the song . \" When It 's On \" features a nice beat by Yogi as you hear the beat and they have a nice piano drop throughout the song . Lil Jon actually makes a beat where he 's not screaming Yeah ! and OK ! throughout the whole track . This song should be the next single in my opinion , as TI and Twista are 2 of the folks that are holding the rap game down in their region right now . 8Ball & MJG are allowed to speak about their \" Memphis City Blues \" as well and to tell some personal \" Confessions \" . The beat for \" Memphis City Blues \" has an old school feel to it as 8Ball & MJG speak a few lines about the town they represent . Overall , if you are a fan of 8Ball & MJG 's earlier CDs , you ca n't afford to pass up on \" Living Legends \" . Being with P Diddy and Bad Boy has not watered them down at all and as a matter of fact they might be better than ever before . If you are a fan of the New South which would include Ludacris , David Banner , Lil Flip , Lil Jon & The Eastside Boyz , TI and others then their is nothing wrong with going back to your Down South roots by picking up \" Living Legends \" . Believe me , it will be worth your time .

Even with a handful of singles and guest appearances and years of making classics and hits they still have n't ' blown up ' . Now seems to be the time for them as they have the marketing talent of P. Diddy and Bad Boy South this time out . And this time there 's no excuses . Right out the gate Eightball & MJG show that these are the same ol boys from Memphis with ' You Do n't Want Drama ' , a menacing club track with aggressiveness we have n't heard from them since ' Lay It Down ' . Now THIS is a comeback track , letting people know that can hang in today 's industry . They get down with Bun B on ' The Streets ' , which is arguably the best song on the album . Eightball delivers the tightest verse and the beat is beyond greatness . Shot Off feat . Ludacris is also a 5 star track with another magnificent beat and gangsta flows from everybody . Look At The Grillz has Twista , TI , and Eightball & MJG completely ripping it up ; especially Twista . They spit over a thumping Lil John beat ( no adlibs ) . THis is destined to be a classic down south . Forever feat . Lloyd is insanely tight . When I first saw this collaboration , I thought it would be sappy because Lloyd is kind of a new school Ralph ' Sensitivity ' Tresvant . Not that that is bad , I love some Ralph Tresvant , but it did n't seem like it would work for the album . But it does ... perfectly . Every friggin song is off the chain . Just check the gangstaness of When It 's On , or the crunkness of ' Do n't Make ' , or the flyness of Trying To Get At You , or the introspectiveness of Confessions . Whatever these boys touch on the album is pure gold . This album ranks as one of Ball & G 's best , right up there with On Top Of The World & In Our Lifetime Vol . 1 ; it 's that good . The only problem I have is the interludes and the fact that they did n't rap over the ' Get A Kit ' beat , that would have been a vintage , classic Ball & G ridin track . But Anyway , this album is easily a must have for 2004 and beyond . One of the year 's best !","summary":"Somebody Done Made Me Hot!","unixReviewTime":1085270400,"image":null}

Szell never falls below the high standard of execution that made the Cleveland Orch . world class , so ensemble and balances are perfect . But for some reason he seems dispirited . The opening movement , whose first theme sounds disjointed here , does n't soar : it 's just one note after the other . This literalness is even more apparent in the slow movement , which seems to be sleepwalking . I was shocked , given that Szell generally followed Toscanini 's model in Brahms , which is swift and tense . The Scherzo catches a spark or two , but the phrasing remains foursquare rather than flowing or exciting . When the finale arrived and I heard the opening bars played with every chord at the same volume , with no attempt to express the shape of Brahms 's great passacaglia , I gave up . From college I remember Szell 's Academic Festival Over . being one of the best , and it has more sprightly energy than the symphony by a long shot ; recording and inner detail are marvelous also . But you 'd never guess that Brahms had written a celebratory piece . Likewise , the Tragic Over . , which is the best thing on this budget CD , is forceful and well recorded but short on real tragedy . In all , this is the least successful installment in Szell 's Brahms cycle , which includes a riveting First and Third .","summary":"Szell often excelled in Brahms, but not here","unixReviewTime":1164412800,"image":null}

Sad ? Not really , she still rakes in the big bucks . But this little song was her crowning jewel , and showed that she just might be a real artist after all ... those thoughts quickly faded though . And even though that song is considered underrated , it 's been covered this way and that way , from Spoken to Rob Thomas , to a plethora of other artists . However , while all great , none of them take it to this level . Nope , Quietdrive hit gold here . What sad is the fact that this is their biggest song , and they did n't even write it . Ironic , no ? The first thing that grabs me is the modern feel they add to the song , more pop \/ punk ballad , just more updatedness . Then the lyrics will grab you , with those appropriate vocals that do n't over do it , but do n't under do it either . It 's just perfect here . Then the chorus really takes off into a total emotional experience , making the song the band 's own , and taking it to new heights . The picture I get in my mind when I think of this song , is two lovers holding hands , trying to hang on while on a spinning carousel . Pretty cool image , but that 's what this song conveys . The joy and wonderfulness of love a such a great emotional level . Then the part right after the 2nd chorus just comes to an emotional climax , and if that could n't get any better , it unleashes it all in the 3rd round of choruses . Pretty awesome and well - done to say the least . Although it probably ends too fast . They could have gone about 30 - seconds longer . So overall , Quietdrive really puts their heart into this underrated pop \/ punk ballad that works in amazing ways to say the least . I just loved hearing it on its few short months on radio . And I 'll probably never forget it . It 's a wonderful song , and if you loved the original , you should probably check this out .","summary":"Time After Time, I Still Love This Song","unixReviewTime":1209513600,"image":null}

This song is basically about someone wanting to have sex with you in a very passionate and aggressive way . Like many others , I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager . I honestly found the music video very eccentric ( in a positive way ) , but creative at the same time , and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more . I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video . The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it , and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song ( there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative :( Through every forest , above the trees Within my stomach , scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive ) . Obviously , many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means . I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting .

Originally known for stretching the capabilities of early synthesizers , the ' 70s Tangerine Dream , led by keyboardist \/ guitarist Edgar Froese , constructed a trademark sound of free - form washes of audio smears , frantically beeping sequences , symphonic electronics , and subterranean motor rhythms . Subsequent decades found the band stuffing its catalog with blander , poppier , Yanni baloney . So does Booster really redeem the band ? Maybe . Several tracks , such as the Floydish \" The Greek Mirror \" or the 14 - minute episodic \" Hyper Sphinx , \" do recall the throbbing oscillations that made Phaedra a theme song , to this day , of WXPN 's long - running space - music show Stars ' End . But several tracks trip over their drum machine laces and major - key feet , falling into sun - drenched flowerbeds rather than an orbit around the dark side of Neptune . Phaedra * * * * * , Rubycon * * * * , and Ricochet * * * * remain the untouched trio of Dream classics , supplemented by Froese 's first two solo discs , Aqua * * * * and the rare Epsilon in Malaysian Pale * * * * * .","summary":"A rooster for the rest . . .","unixReviewTime":1234310400,"image":null}

Could n't stand the band 's eventual drift into new age , mixes , and whatever else . But when I read about this album , I was intrigued , and so on a whim really , sound unheard , I purchased this from Amazon recently . I must add that I 'm into another phase of being into electronic music from watching the excellent \" Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution \" DVD , which explores the German music scene in the 70s , including of course Kraftwerk , but also Klaus Schulze , Cluster , Harmonia , and Tangerine Dream , among others . \" Booster \" ( 2 CDs , 16 tracks , 114 min . ) is a curious mix . I was immediately skeptical when I read the liner notes , which tell us \" Some titles have been exclusively compiled 2007 from various Tangerine Dream releases \" , and then that only a couple of tracks ( 3 in fact ) are unreleased . After a tentative opener \" One Night In Space \" though , I am very charmed by the 14 + min . \" Hyper Sphinx \" , which reminds me of latter 80s Tangerine Dream , nicely done . The re - recording of classic tracks \" Logos \" and \" Tangram \" are worthless , as they only want to make you want to listen to the original tracks . But there are several other highlights , none better than the 14 + min set closer \" Bells of Acra \" , which I really like . It is surely not a coincidence that I liked the 2 longest tracks on here by far . That said , this is not the return of the Tangerine Dream of old , but it surely is the best new music I 've heard from Edgar Froese in , well , forever .

The closing theme to the show became the title song for this album , and both Parks and the music are better than they have a right to be . Parks has a quiet and rough quality to his voice - rather like his character - and it serves this collection of less - known and well - known standards , as well as the originals , well . He even tackles ' Melancholy Baby ' and pulls it off . It does n't hurt to have James Burton backing him up , along with other fine musicians . The arrangements and overall sound are dated , but entirely appropriate for the time in which this was recorded .

It 's like his own audio museum where you move from painting to painting . You recognize the brush strokes and the technique while the subject and colors are in constant transition .

It 's hard to imagine being shocked by anything Nine Inch Nails puts out , but I would have to say I was at least surprised by this new album from Trent Reznor 's brainchild . NIN has always been somewhat of an experimental outlet for Trent . Yet even as minimal of a change it is in theory to go instrumental , it 's the actual material here that I find so different and so interesting . For starters , there is much more of a progression from song to song than on other NIN albums . Even as an instrumental work this seems more like a concept album than anything else he 's ever done . There 's a full range of songs and tones here , almost like an opera or a symphony . This is truly mesmerizing . I also enjoyed the fact that so much of this album is more \" mellow \" than what NIN usually does . It produces something that I feel is almost more accessible than most previous albums . Anybody who is into Jazz and even people who are into newer classical music could probably get into this . And that 's the other thing , the pricing for this is awesome ! Not only is there an MP3 download for only $ 5 but you can get the whole set on disk for $ 10 . When you consider what 's been going on in the record industry lately this is a breath of fresh air . But I think most people who heard individual tracks would n't even know it was NIN . If anything the appeal is broader for this instrumental set . You can download other stuff including a pdf document from the NIN website . This is a great set that I plan on listening to and studying for a while .

The God of Anger Pop , who once created the singularly perfect musical moment that was Pretty Hate Machine , must have reached his seventh day of creation : for he is clearly resting on Ghosts . This is Reznor on a lazy day , bored with nothing better to do . Ghosts I - IV is an organized chaos of happy ( and angry and sad ) accidents . I imagine a herd ( or pod ? ) of Macs and samplers , pots and pans ; left to their own devices , could produce something akin to Ghosts if they tried real hard . And I suspect Trent made exactly what he intended to make . I admit that I 'm still a pathetic hold - out waiting for Pretty Hate Machine II - The Revenge . Thus , nothing less will ever truly satisfy . Ghosts is neither fixed nor broken . It 's really not that bad , but it 's just not that good . And for a small fistful of dollars , I should n't complain . I certainly like the progressive and revolutionary distribution ( a la Radiohead 's Rainbows ) where the evil middle - man record company is kept out of the artist 's and fans ' relationship .

Well , maybe he had lots of help and a few Talking Heads fans to back him up , but he has done it , RIGHT ! Fork over 5 dollars on the NIN site and you get 320 kb download with a large free collection of above average landscape photography , PDF , and the whole thing is carried off but with hardly any pretense minus that of being a premier musician and all around artist trying to expand their box , a prison that Trent Reznor has finally busted I might add . NIN have taken things to a new level that has actually set precedent for the paradigm . And to boot , if you want bigger and better CD \/ Vinyl sets he says 10 dollars to 300 dollars , depending how rabid you are over his sexual presence on this earth , of course with various trinkets and the obligatory signature signed with His own blood . Ghosts 19 I stole because it TOTALLY sounded like superior Skinny Puppy 1990 . You figure the terrible ninties . HAHA . Ghosts 6 I come back to because it reminds me of the good ol' days with SAW Vol . How it so could fit on there , perfectly , and yet it sounds as if TRez had these sound in him his whole life , which , he has , only he was forced into making texture pop with voice , ( damn that voice ) decrepit and decayed as his pop may be . 31 Ghosts is amazing for the wailing banshee guitar , courtesy of Adrian Belew ? , and it is welcome that one of my favorite King Crimson guitarists is given more due NIN time than usual , as he appears on many tracks . Reverse that and 13 is a beautiful piano driven peace ode to death , breathing courtesy of Trent ? What a great track , though , I really dig the Fragile leftover Ghosts 34 : a compliment that was , because the sound is reminiscent of certain tracks that were Tony Tiger GREAT back in 1999 , I even hear them using some of the same equipment I think . Ghosts 28 is tonal and tribal , a stark representation of landscape maybe , gently rolling along the hills , the sound invading every crack and crevice , raw and harsh . Another track I truly enjoyed was Ghosts 24 from III that does what Prodigy should have been doing after Fat of the Land NO * * * * * * * kidding . Ghosts 5 , to take a stark detour , is mostly Sergio Leone leftover depression .... yeah ... most people do n't have this type of depression .... 21 is like a mishmash of Into the Void and every trick Trent has learned from two decades of experience in layering his music . All the material is excellent , in my opinion , and if you are familiar with Still , than you know where this collection is going , just above and beyond the pretty and sombre lamentations found there . Ghosts I - IV looks very promising , and the entire package is worth any music lover 's time , and that it will for all this to sink in . Just Being a NIN fan of The Fragile and TDS in particular , this new work is complex as those and even more stunning in many other respects , just as Still was a nice complement to And All That .... Ghosts is the complementary side of Year Zero , evoking everything from Debussy 's La Mer to Autechre 's Confield to Aphex Twin Druqks ; even the buzz saw guitars and streaming bass lines of punk and new wave era Cure come through with ZING on Ghosts 4 . I honestly do n't know what to say about the preceding track because it alone is worth the price of admission to download this whole album . Ghosts 3 is amazing . Very Richard like but then again it is wholly the creation of Trent . I love the sickly tangy guitar instrument at 2:00 , with the overlaying distortions , voices , synths , etc . and of course the bassline ! Ca n't forget that NIN bass line , morphing into guitar , swooning around beats and loops and Lalalalalal yeah the point is that many of the tracks are evocative mind trips that serve headphones , amps , and darkness well . TDS is almost universally admired if not for songwriting then production and arrangement . The Fragile was a masterpiece in its own space and mind , forging ahead the new digital era with samples and tracks galore , incisors bared solemnly with nary a hint of hope to be redeemed ; Left disc ended on The Great Below , one of the most poignant and interesting odes to love and death that NIN has ever written . THAT was followed by something we previously had n't heard from NIN . The Right disc was amazing and fresh , including a rap , a shoutout , and complex instrumentals that further divided NIN from the LAME industrial landscape . The gigantic transducer eating beats surely convinced the bassheads of the blatant talent , too . I began to get the feeling that The Fragile was something special , broken and marred , but put together and soothing in the way that suffering , knowing suffering , leads eventually to change , slow as it might happen . So after that whole experience in my late teens , five years later With Teeth was slightly disappointing , and a bit weak in the lyrical department . I kept wanting to hear the vicious instrumentals from before , or even unsubtle rage of Somewhat Damaged ; instead , it was all chorus and pomp , and the raw emotion was definitely missing , though , some songs were inevitably quite provoking . Year Zero was definitely the Rockstar side revived , I enjoyed it because of the abrasive beats and the creativity of the song lyrics ; the choruses seemed more appropriate and less in your face and that helps when you tire of a songs pop structure with repeated listening . But this , this record I do not hold , Ghosts I - IV , is the Miles Davis spectre of an unconventional time working through world wide conflicts that affect individuals , as we may reflect in our art as the Jazz Master did with his bands for decades : the poets , painters , directors , etc . all do this is different ways . We who love to learn and share want something better than what currently is , and we are working on all levels to adjust our realities to what is happening , the tragedies that we know should not be taking place in our human world , the idea that things changed on an invisible level lead to change beyond , and if that thin line of inspiration comes from these little pieces of plastic and paper then YAY , the world is getting better right ? Are you full of BULLSH * * , crank ? Are all artists full of this stuff you call Bullsh * * ? Well , I do n't know , but the record is supremely satisfying ; an aura exudes from this album that is the perfect representation of NIN 's instrumental vision . They are pioneering not quite radical but comprehensive postmodern sound . Good things can only come from this , along with other artist 's to follow , even novelist 's and poet 's should take notice , the internet is the Argus , you are a part of us , taking this music industry beyond what it is now , taking the entertainment industry and edging one notch for the artist alone , as   a man or woman , only 400 more blows till we kill the uncouth blubbery PIG that never wanted to share its profits . I , Disciple 16 , rarely buy in stores anymore ; actually I do n't at all , though , BMG online has enabled me to collect dozens of double sets , remasters that I could not get any other way . I do n't think , if you look hard enough , the industry is dead , it was just waiting for the intro to a new AGE . As a consumer , you had to be wary , and if you were n't , BubblePop METAL would and will be sold to you with dumptrucks , peddled on the radio because you have n't the time to choose . Oh well whatever nevermind crank get on with it OKAY this is n't going to change everything , but at this stage corporate rock has killed the radio and we all know it . Radio aversely affects what is popular and ' they ' want to sell us everything we do n't need to hear , nothing daring , all angst and facades , veils of illusion . This distribution model shows us that ART carried off with great taste can survive by the consumer alone . The late 60 's period this is not . We have to start choosing what we want , and now we have a line that has been crossed , successfully . So beyond the advertisement for this album , Ghosts exists in the senses that imply change , reflection , and the will to follow through these harsh times . I can recall instrumentals like Just Like You Imagined , Complication , and A Warm Place that changed my mind on who Trent was becoming . Indeed , like the reformation of classical music in the 1900 's , but fully modernized with an even larger palette , this album tries to do what pioneering artists like Schoenberg , Cage , and Eno were doing then , not aversely changing everything , but doing things in slightly esoteric ways . After the press reviews and eventual release , people will start changing their minds about NIN again . And that is because all great artists are dynamic , and those who pigeon hole people like Trent deserve to get that slap in the face , though , they can still hate and fill their life with super indie SH * * , this is the record that set the benchmark . I feel that the music is alive in the artist here , and very well recorded , mixed , and mastered . There is no way a site like Pitchfork should be giving this anything below a 9 , and we shall see about that soon ......... Yes ! the reviewer is obviously a syntactical genius who obviously knows NIN by heart , just read the review folkie , there need be NO CONvincing . I fully award this work five stars for the 1 free side alone . Terrific setup and expert presentation for all the various packages laid out perfectly on NIN 's website . A great surprise . A better foundation . I will now actually go listen to the album . Trent , Trent , can I leave now ? ( weeping )","summary":"Paradigm Shifter","unixReviewTime":1204502400,"image":null}

Phillips","reviewText":"Believe it or not , this was my first time purchasing a Trina album . It 's not that I have n't liked any of her songs in the past , because I have . I guess she was just never one of my top priority artists . I immediately took notice of her , though , with her 2000 ( or maybe 1999 ) debut single , \" Da Baddest Chick . \" I actually liked the song initially -- although it sounds a bit dated today -- and the video , which showed her smashing all kinds of things with a baseball bat , was pretty amusing , too . The next single was the summer - anthem , \" Pull Over , \" which had my head bobbing for quite awhile . I pretty much enjoyed most of her singles , including \" Told Y'All , \" the song she did with Tweet and Missy Elliott , and of course \" Single Again . \" I 've thought about buying her past three albums when each came out , but I became uneasy about them after listening to samples . They just did n't affect me the way her singles did and the production sounded a bit sub - par . However , the samples for this album sounded much better , and with her initial success with this album -- debuting at her highest Billboard chart position ever -- I decided to finally give one of Trina 's album a try . The album opens with a terribly stupid and useless intro , which is just here to take up an extra minute . The smarter choice would 've been to just begin the album with the first full - length track , \" Still Da Baddest . \" The superb production is upbeat and dramatically triumphant , a perfect canvas for Trina 's confident and boastful lines about her survival and success in the music business . ( Believe it or not , this female emcee has been in the rap game for one or two years shy of a decade ) . The first single , \" Single Again , \" is also one of the best tracks from this set ; it has a catchy chorus and is a bonafide ladies ' anthem . I really ca n't understand why the song was n't very successful . \" Look Back At Me \" should definitely be a future single , with its simplistic , dirty South production mixed with chopped and screwed vocals . \" I Got A Bottle , \" which features a guest appearance from Missy Elliott , is a fun and playful club song . On \" Clear It Out , \" Trina gives us a piece of her mind , stating how she is fed up with haters , critics , and aspiring female rappers who think the life is easy . And \" Hot Commodity \" is a great closing track ; it 's just as upbeat and proud as the opening song . Unfortunately , those were the only tracks that I was really pleased with . The rest are pretty unexciting . \" I Got A Thang For You \" and \" Wish I Never Met You \" both desparately try to replicate her most successful single to date , \" Here We Go Again . \" ( Which I did n't think was that great in the first place ) . The production is n't great , and Trina 's rhymes are way too laid - back and lazy . \" Killing You ... \" is bland and very repetitve and \" Phone \" is simply here for shock value , nothing more . Last , \" Stop Traffic \" suffers from subpar production and a really lame hook . ( Yeah , yeah , yeah ... I know green means \" go \" and red means \" stop . \" That 's not clever ! ) The bottom line : So ... I 've finally bought a Trina album . While it 's a bit better than I was expectting , Still Da Baddest is far from flawless . It has several excellent tracks that I thoroughly enjoyed , but there is no medium on here . It 's either really good , or really bad , and there are just as many bad songs as there are good . Most of the time Trina 's rhymes are okay and even sometimes great ( except for the somewhat pitiful deliveries on the two ballads ) . What really causes this album to suffer is the lack of quality in production , hooks , or song ideas . If you 're a Trina fan , buy it . If not , I would n't really recommend it . Sure there are some good tracks here , but they are barely worth it for me . Key tracks : Single Again , Look Back At Me , Still Da Baddest , Hot Commodity .","summary":"2 stars - Half good, half bad, nothing really in between.","unixReviewTime":1211068800,"image":null}

I thought her debut was decent , but not at all groundbreaking , so I thought this album would be along the lines of her debut , but oh no ! It 's a lot better . \" Still Da Baddest \" is definitely a solid album . Trina is still talking about sex , how pretty she is ( and she is pretty ) , how great her sex is , and she reminds us that she 's still \" da baddest b * * * * . \" Ironically , though , when I read her interviews , she does not come off as b****y at all . She seems to be a very kind , gentle and mature woman . I know there is another side , but it 's nice to know that she is a sweetheart beneath the sassiness . Up - beat tunes and good lyrics fill this album . Trina 's delivery is as energetic and confident as ever , and trust me , you will be dancing and\/or snapping at some point when listening to this album . Sure , this album is on the experimental side and Trina 's voice serves as an annoyance because it is unusually high - pitched   sometimes , but , as a unit , rap fans should be entertained by this LP . \" Single Again \" was the album 's first release . The catchy hook will really help you get into this song , particularly its melody . Also , this is one of Trina 's best songs lyrically . She apparently sat down and thought this song out before penning it . Nice beat , too . Trina is a product of Miami and it was a nice touch for her to speak with a southern drawl on \" Killing You H * * * . \" In this song , Trina informs her listener that she is hot and these other women are n't on her level nor are they doing anything for her . Again , the beat is nice and the hook is alright as well . Pitbull lends his talents on \" Stop Traffic . \" His voice is so easy to listen to and he adds flavor to the song . Every song on this album is at least decent , therefore , you can press play and listen to it from track one to track twelve . Trina is definitely improving as a rapper . This is a really nice LP and is recommended by me . You have a supporter in me .

Reid","reviewText":"Trina 's ' Still Da Baddest ' may be part of the rap genre but the music on this release is n't as hardcore and ' rap ' as one would expect , which I actually think is part of this release 's strength . My main criticism that makes this average is that even after a few listens , a lot of the songs blend in together and fail to stand out . The sound , production and lyrics are rather bland and are n't exciting . A positive thing about these songs is that , to me , it 's more of a blend of pop and rap than straight forward rapping . Even with the ' explicit ' label , there 's only one or two songs that are from start to finish explicit as we 'd come to expect from Trina . She does manage to dabble with a rap - ballad in ' I Got a Thang For You ' and full - blown pop in ' Single Again . ' The title track ' Still Da Baddest ' is another rather pop - sound with Trina proclaiming and listing reasons why she 's at the top of her game . Other stand - out tracks are ' Killing You Hoes ' and ' Hot Commodity ' . As a whole , ' Still Da Baddest ' is just average . It 's good , but I wish there was more variety and that the songs stood out more from one another . She 's at her best when she 's trying out new sounds and genres like on songs ' Single Again ' and ' I Got A Thang For You ' but falls flat when she 's intentionally trying to shock the audience with something dirty and explicit , like on ' Look Back at Me ' . I also wish she had dug deeper lyrically because on many tracks she 's simply rapping about her body and how she 's better than others out there ; it 's good on one song but sounds tired after two or three . A decent release though with some really good tracks and the some that could have been left off due to a lack of creativity and production .","summary":"Review of 'Still da Baddest'","unixReviewTime":1207008000,"image":null}

Part Saturday morning cartoon , part suburban punk , Be Your Own Pet pack relentlessly raucous rhythms and frenzied attitude into twelve songs that rush by like a Japanese Bullet Train . It takes less than thirty minutes to play all of ` Get Awkward , ' but that 's enough to leave a permanent mark . Most of the bandmembers have reached their golden ( post - teen ) years since their debut album was released two tears ago , but thankfully , they have n't quite yet settled into maturity . There 's still plenty of songs about feeling awkward ( see the title ? ) such as \" The Beast Within , \" and goofy youth fantasy tunes like \" Zombie Graveyard Party , \" but most of the album revolves around experiences that have befallen them since their rise to recognition ( or are they already ` famous ' ? ) , combining lots of attitude with a generous dose of humor . \" Bitches Leave \" is a funny and poignant rant about girls who bring their attitude backstage . \" You 're a Waste \" summarizes a blown relationship with an idiot ex , with these lines ; \" Go ahead and tell your sob story , all I have to say about it is ` Blow Me ' . As sung by female vocalist Jemina Pearl , the line cuts to the bone while it makes you laugh . Perhaps the best thing about Be Your Own Pet is their ability to communicate beyond their own peer group . Anybody who listened to early Blondie or the Buzzcocks will appreciate the intelligent songcraft of this band 's songwriting .

Of course there are are other excellent recordings of all three pieces ( Giulini 's \" Pictures \" with the Chicago SO and his \" La mer \" with the Philharmonia , for example ) but as a collection this is a testament to both the sonority of the Berlin Philharmonic at its peak under Karajan and to that conductor 's chameleon ability to empathise with and elucidate music from outside the late German Romantic tradition in which he excelled . His brief dalliance with the Orchestre de Paris confirms his attachment to French music and his ability to pace and colour both the Debussy and the Ravel emerges as a thing of wonder . There is of course a neat link in the programming here between the Mussorgsky and \" Bolro \" as the composer of the latter orchestrated the \" Pictures \" brilliantly ; originally these recordings , made between 1964 and 1966 in the warm ambiance of the Jesus - Christus - Kirche , were issued on two separate LPs , one of French music by Debussy and Ravel and the other with just the Mussorgsky and \" Bolro \" . Any attempt at musical criticism of such seminal recordings would be superfluous after such a long time ; it is sufficient to note that the delicacy and nuance of Karajan 's evocation of the sea remain extraordinary , and the peroration of the \" Pictures \" in \" The Great Gate of Kiev \" remains one of the greatest expositions of the symphony orchestra in full flight ever committed to disc .","summary":"An unassailable classic","unixReviewTime":1413158400,"image":null}

While there are many outstanding renditions of Debussy 's \" La Mer \" by the likes of Charles Munch , Arturo Toscanini , Pierre Boulez and others ; Karajan certainly seems to hold his own , in a fine and very well polished reading that falls just a little bit short in terms of not fully capturing the essence of Debussy 's dream - like quality . Likewise , while a shiny and well - formed \" Pictures at an Exhibition \" seems to be good enough , there are other recordings of \" Pictures \" ( i.e. Bernstein \/ NYPO ) that seem to shine brighter and probe deeper . As for Karajan 's recording of Ravel 's \" Bolero \" ; it is excellent ; perhaps even better than Karajan himself intended it to be . Something must have been right on the day that this recording of \" Bolero \" was made where the Berlin Philharmonic happened to put together a wonderful recording that fully captures a very raw feeling of intensity despite the fact that the music is all polished and waxed in typical Karajan fashion . It is indeed an irony that while Karajan worked hard to perfect his Beethoven , Brahms and Tchaikovsky , with as many as four or five recordings of the same pieces throughout his lengthy career , that he was able to pull off an ideal \" Bolero \" in one shot .","summary":"Four and One-Third Stars...","unixReviewTime":1176940800,"image":null}

Loscheider","reviewText":"I 'm one of the rare Sevendust fans who does n't buy the Cubs \/ White Sox - like dichotomy that you can only like Sonny Mayo 's or Clint Lowery 's guitarwork . This is Sonny 's final album with Sevendust , and it is for the most part excellent . That said , too much attention goes to the Sonny \/ Clint thing . John Connolly is an excellent guitarist by any standard , and Vinnie Hornsby on bass is utterly insane in the best bassist kind of way . While Morgan Rose 's powerful drumming and backing vocals and Lajon Witherspoon 's sometimes - raging sometimes - gentle vocals often take center stage , John and Vinnie together form the solid sinews of each song , whether with Sonny , Clint or any of their guest instrumentalists . That kind of flexibility for a rhythm duo should not be passed up . To the album itself : \n \" Chapter VII \" is the most brooding and mood - changing album since \" Animosity \" . It reflects the band 's maturity and that they are consummate artists - something that may not be appreciated by fans who stopped listening after the viciously good \" Home \" or who did n't tune in until the mainstream - friendly but deliciously experimental \" Seasons \" . Where \" Alpha \" was pure aggression ( listening to the title song is like kickboxing on four shots of espresso ) , \" Chapter VII \" remains agitated but is consciously brooding and sometimes defiant . \" Inside \" is an awesome opening track ( though I would have put \" Enough \" later in the album , since it shares the same energy and made me wonder whether they were two movements on the same theme ) . I can picture the lights slowly coming up as Morgan 's drumming agitates further to the driving guitar crescendos , followed by Lajon 's terse argument and his more melodic self - rebuttal as John , Vinnie and Sonny blend into a tempo change that at once foretells and anticipates the complex harmony at the core of the song . \" Hope \" is , ironically , the darkest song on the album , though Mark Tremonti 's guitar work adds a stunning narrative that makes me wonder if the band will tap him if Lowery takes on another project . There 's something in the pacing of \" Scapegoat \" that does n't seem to mesh as well with other tracks ; \" Prodigal Son \" is the opposite - strongly driven by Lajon 's own vocal rhythm . \" Lifeless \" and \" Walk Away \" are both masterful and let each member of the band shine - blends of minor and power chords , alternatingly intense and soulful drumming , shifting bass lines that both lead and drive the melody , and Lajon 's incredibly expressive range . In short , \" Chapter VII \" is an excellent album that , while not as singles - friendly as \" Animosity \" or \" Next \" , holds together in a cohesion that good albums should and rare albums do .","summary":"More cohesive than singles-driven, still excellent","unixReviewTime":1209081600,"image":null}

The other being In Flames \" A sense of Purpose . \"I'd say with a little more time this album could have been that much better , but like all Sevendust albums it 's still quite good . They throw in quite a bit of variety which I love . There are also more guitar solos than any other Sevendust album , as far as I remember . On a scale of of 1 - 10 I 'd give this a solid 7 maybe 8 . I 'm enjoying this one more and more every time I hear it . Inside - this one has an intro that goes on a little too long for my taste , but when the song gets going it 's one of my favorites on the album . It 's a kind of alpha - esque song with a solid riff and good drum beat . Probably the heaviest song on the album . I wish they had expanded on the bridge a little and maybe put an instrumental break , but still it 's a great song . 9\/10 \n\n Enough - This one 's a decent enough rocker . I do n't have a whole lot to say about it except that it 's an enjoyable song . 7\/10 \n\n Hope - This is probably my favorite song , either this or inside . Musically I think it 's the most diverse on the album . I like the main riff and the solo . The stringed instruments during the solo were cool as well . 10\/10 \n\n Scapegoat - This one has kind of quieter verses with some electronics and a heavy very catchy chorus . but I 'm a sucker for a catchy chorus and it is still a good song . 8\/10 \n\n Fear - Another good song . This one like Enough I do n't have a whole lot to talk about . It 's kind of a mid - tempo rocker with some cool musical pieces thrown in   7\/10 \n\n The Past - My least favorite song on the album , not because of the writting . The song is well written . It 's an acoustic song . I just ca n't get into Daughtry 's voice . It reminds me too much of the guy from Shinedown . Still it 's not a bad song and right now I 'm not minding hearing it . 6\/10 \n\n Prodigal Son - A mid - tempo rocker that I really like . There 's just something about the vocals in this one that I really like . Something about them just sound different from what Lajon has done in the past , but I ca n't put my finger on it . There 's also a short , but decent solo . 8\/10 \n\n Lifeless - This one 's a little faster than a mid - tempos song . It 's a rocker with a quieter chorus . There 's also another decent guitar solo . I hope they keep using solos from now on . 8\/10 \n\n Sorrow - This one 's another slower one with the lead singer from Alter Bridge . Yesterday at work I had this one going through my head . I like the main riff . They use a cool effect , I think it 's either a chorus or flange , but it 's been a long time since I 've played with guitar effects so I ca n't remember . Kennedy 's voice sounds different than I remember on any Alter bridge album . I hope for their next one he uses this style for a song or two . 8\/10 \n\n Contradiction - This is another of my favorites . I like the chorus it 's kind of different from a typical Sevendust chorus . 9\/10 \n\n Walk Away - This is another solid track and a good album closer . There 's more screaming in this one than any other song except maybe for Inside . 9\/10 \n\n I 'd review the bonus tracks as well , but I do n't feel like it . I 'll just say that they 're pretty solid as well . You 've got Lucky One and Disgust which are heavier and Heart in your hands which is slower . Still they 're enjoyable . This may not be my favorite Sevendust Album , but it 's certainly not a bad one . I think most Sevendust fans will find this one a good addition to their collection .","summary":"Another good Sevendust album","unixReviewTime":1208908800,"image":null}

Sorrow , for the band has parted ways with guitarist Sonny Mayo not even a week prior to the album 's release . Hope , however , that with original guitarist Clint Lowery back in the fold , that the band will stop rushing out albums so quickly and take their time to put out a stunning chapter eight . Truth is , listening to Sevendust is like getting together with old friends . There 's a certain sense of comfort , of knowing what to expect . More or less , Sevendust have n't drastically altered their sound over the years . Each album has been marked with a significant growth , but not enough to turn off the fanbase . It should come as no surprise , then , that \" Chapter VII : Hope & Sorrow \" -- rushed out 13 months after \" Alpha \" -- has the band going through the motions . Usually , with two years between albums , any band can come up with something that is both satisfying and refreshing . Being the first time Sevendust have released two albums so closely together , it is also the first time they have fallen short of expectations . That 's not to say that their seventh effort is a bad one . It 's a totally listenable album , especially for the faithful fan , but there is nothing here that has n't been done already on the previous six efforts . It 's got a strong start with the intense \" Inside \" -- which would make a perfect set opener for their upcoming tour -- and songs like \" Hope \" and the groovy first single , \" Prodigal Son , \" stray from the \" Alpha \" formula , turning out to be the most interesting tracks . In fact , the main problem with this album is that it 's basically \" Alpha \" redux . Had they taken more time to tour with that album and record this material , we might have something a little more interesting to listen to . Then again , if they had waited , Sonny would n't have gotten his part in this , his closing chapter with the band . In an attempt to up the ante ( and perhaps have a bid at rock radio success ) the help of American Idol 's Chris Daughtry and Alter Bridge 's Miles Kennedy and Mark Tremonti is enlisted . Tremonti 's contribution to \" Hope \" is definitely a highlight , but Miles and Daughtry both seem to have trouble meshing with Lajon 's vocal style . These collaborations have nothing on the likes of Skin , Chino Moreno or even Aaron Lewis , and each respective singer tends to overpower their song . Definitely a downer . Overall , the album is n't terrible , nor does it have vultures circling above the band 's head . It 's just a slight mis - step is all . Hopefully with the original line - up intact , the next chapter in the band 's story will be a more exciting one .","summary":"Hope & Mayo","unixReviewTime":1207094400,"image":null}

The Stones are in superb , coiled form here . Yes , there are not a lot of songs , but the band was exploring jams at this point , tinged with Jamaican vibes , dance floor repetition and nuance in the shifting layers of sound and rhythm . \" Hot Stuff , \" \" Hey Negrita \" -- both are brilliant . Crazy Mama , particularly in the remaster , is an overwhelmingly joyful rocker from the Faces school . \" Melody \" is a great lost Stones song , and the semi - duds ( \" Hand of Fate , \" which some love , and \" Cherry Oh Baby \" ) certainly are not embarrassing .

Reardon","reviewText":"The Rolling Stones ' fifth studio album of the 1970s ( and sixth overall for their Rolling Stones Records label which was distributed by Atlantic Records ) entitled Black and Blue was released in April of 1976 . This particular Rolling Stones album was the first studio album for the band since the abrupt departure of guitarist Mick Taylor who left after the It 's Only Rock and Roll album 's releaseand promo videos shot for the album . Some have called Black and Blue \" the guitar audition album \" because Wayne Perkins , Harvey Mandel ( of Canned Heat ) and Ron Wood ( of Rod Stewart 's Faces ) all took turns auditioning for the guitarist spot abandoned by Taylor ( and Wood would eventually acquire the spot as of 1975 ) . Lead singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote all but one track   ( \" Cherry Oh Baby \" ) on this album and the album is a classic ( as I found out when I grabbed the album for Christmas in 1989 on cassette when it was on Rolling Stones \/ Columbia \/ CBS Records ) . The Black and Blue album was recorded between December of 1974 and December of 1975 in Germany at Musicland Studios and at Mountain Studios in Montreux with Mick and Keith producing and the late Keith Harwood recording and the legendary Glyn Johns mixing in February of 1976 at Atlantic Studios . Bass player Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts played well on this album as well . The Black and Blue album opens with the funky opener \" Hot Stuff \" which featured lead guitarist Harvey Mandel which stiffed as a single . Next is the rocker \" Hand of Fate \" with Wayne Perkins doing some great fretwork . We follow with the reggae version of \" Cherry Oh Baby \" featuring Nicky Hopkins on organ . Side one closed with the superb ballad \" Memory Motel \" featuring Mick on piano as well as vocal with Keithalso singing the refrain at the end of the choruses . Next is the jazzy duet with Billy Preston called \" Melody \" which sounds like something from a jazz club complete with horn sections . Next is the hit ballad from the album entitled \" Fool to Cry \" featuring Jagger on vocals and Fender Rhodes piano and Nicky Hopkins on grand piano ( the song was a Top 10 hit in the US ) . We close with the rocker \" Crazy Mama \" with a great guitar riff from Mick Jagger whom played rhythm guitars on the track and also sings like no tomorrow .. The Black and Blue album did very well hitting # 1 making it the fifth Stones studio effort in a row to top Billboard and was the first Platinum album for the band . Some fans hate this album , but others like me , love it . The remaster has all of the original LP credits and artwork restored . This album is highly recommended .","summary":"Why this album gets a bad rap I'll never know","unixReviewTime":1353110400,"image":null}

Listen to the samples , you 'll see what I mean . The samples do n't do justice to every song here but you 'll get an idea of this album 's groove . Song for song I prefer it over \" Goats Head Soup \" or \" It 's Only Rock & Roll \" ( although both of those do have a number of Stones classics ) . And \" Some Girls \" , half its album cuts sound boilerplate thirty years on , but of the eight songs on \" Black and Blue \" , the only throwaway would be \" Crazy Mama \" . The track most frequently included on my car CD compilations is the funky workout \" Hey Negrita \" , with \" Hot Stuff \" a close runner - up . It 's worth noting that most collections ( like \" 40 Licks \" or whatever it was called ) include the edited single versions of \" Hot Stuff \" and \" Fool to Cry \" . \" Melody \" is another favorite , distinctive within the Stones ' catalog , a good song for hanging out with friends late at night . Years later UB40 would also cover \" Cherry Oh Baby \" , but listen and compare , see if you do n't agree that the Stones version is far better . If you 've picked up a few Stones albums and you 're at risk of tiring of their sound or you think you have what you need already , try \" Black and Blue \" on for size . After the four albums that are the pinnacle of their career - Exile , Let It Bleed , Sticky Fingers , and Beggars Banquet - this would be the next one on my list .","summary":"Favorite of the Stones' post-Exile albums","unixReviewTime":1280534400,"image":null}

Still , it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers ( and as high , most of the time , as Georgia pines ) . This album from the tail end of their most creative period , moreover , unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer , is the ` golden era \" of the Stone Age . The album , however , is a little uneven in spots reflecting , I think , a certain exhaustion of material that they could call their totally their own unless the time when they owned a big chunk of rock ' n'roll in the late 1960s and early 1970s . The age of a more sedate music ( at least technically ) was approaching and I think there was some confusion about whether to embrace it or \" spoof \" it . Still \" Cry Baby \" and \" Memory Motel \" ( the stick outs here along with \" Fool To Cry \" make any Stones \" greatest hits \" list .

On the other hand it certainly did n't gain as much recognition as a lot of recognition that the somewhat more popularly focused P - Funk girl group Brides Of Funkenstein would . This entire idea of intense competition among the many satellite groups coming out from under the P - funk banner took an enormous toll on George Clinton 's entire concept . And by the time Parlet were about to unleash it 's second album in 1979 , this became more than obvious . In addition to that newcomers Shirly Hayden and Janice Evans were just breaking into this chaotically conceived group . On the other hand , with further help from Ron Dunbar and a rather larger group of musicians playing on this album Parlet did gain a new and vital musical focus on this album that more than had the potential to push their momentum forward . \" Ridin ' High\"is actually my favorite Parlet number . It has one of the strongest dance - funk beats around , right on time horns and bass lines and a great hook exploring the songs themes of \" disco highs and disco lows \" . \" No Rump To Bump \" continues the concept with a heavier Parliament type funk groove again - working a classic school yard taunt into the intro and refrains . \" Do n't Ever Stop ( Lovin' Me , Needin ' Me ) \" blends the vulnerable side of the sexual revolution that stands as an interesting contrast to the \" free from the need to be free \" Clinton attitude through a well arranged dance \/ funk ballad . \" Booty Snatchers \" makes it clear P - Funk 's outlook on the disco scene - to a stomping 4\/4 beat the albums concept is illustrated through a perception of disco dancers as \" body 's who need bootys \" . \" You 're Leaving \" gets into some deep bluesy flavored funk - again exploring need in context of a human journey . \" Huff - N - Puff \" is a rocked out funk epic - using the Three Little Pigs concept of the liberated women dealing with hirsute male figures . Not only is the vocal mix quite a lot tougher , but the music - even the disco friendly aspects , are much higher on the funky groove quotient compared to the sleeker jazz influences of the previous album . Mojo magazine once proclaimed this to be Parlet at their best . And since they only recorded three albums in as many years , that is saying a lot . At that time anything from the P - Funk satellite groups were only to be found on vinyl and extremely difficult to locate . Luckily Real Gone Music has made this renowned and Iconic P - Funk album available for those in the digital age . And its worth hearing especially now . This album caught P - Funk and the funk era in general in an interesting transition as the 70 's were about to spill over into the 80 's . This was a time when many felt they would have no choice but to pimp the pleasure principle to gain creative and commercial recognition . And even at this point , both musically and lyrically , this album seemingly seeks out to try resolving these temporal conflicts within its own context .","summary":"Parlet Riding High On Their Second Try","unixReviewTime":1377475200,"image":null}

His last album had been for Federal in 1964 , but with a new lease of life on the mighty Atlantic label , he produced two much revered LPs in rapid succession . The first was \" Freddie King Is A Blues Master \" released in 1969 on SD 9004 - and then this peach - \" My Feeling For The Blues \" on Cotillion SD 9016 released in early 1970 . This 1991 Repertoire CD ( REP 4170 - WZ ) is a straightforward transfer of that second 11 - track album ( 36:03 minutes ) . Ace saxophonist KING CURTIS produced the record - with all arrangements by Atlantic 's newest soul protg DONNY HATHAWAY ( except \" Woke Up This Morning \" which was Arranged by King Curtis ) . The musicians for the sessions were : \n Lead Guitar & Vocals - FREDDIE KING \n Rhythm Guitar - CORNELL DUPREE \n Tenor Saxophones - GEORGE COLEMAN and FRANK WESS \n Tenor & Baritone Saxophones - TREVOR LAWRENCE and WILLE BRIDGES \n Trumpets - ERNIE ROYAL and MARTIN BANKS \n Piano - GEORGE STUBBS \n Bass - JERRY JEMMOTT \n Drums - KEVIN RICE \n \" What 'd I Say \" features Bass Marimba and Sax Solo by KING CURTIS \n \" You Do n't Have To Go \" and \" The Things I Used To Do \" feature Harmonica by HUGH McCRACKEN \n\n The 3 - way foldout inlay has a brief but informative history of King 's career by BERND MATHEJA that is sided on Page 3 by a selected Discography . Although licensed from East West , it does n't advise who remastered what - but the sound quality is great nonetheless - clean , muscular and so enjoyable . Repertoire as a label has always had a good reputation when it comes to transfers . Side 1 opens with the down and dirty \" Yonder Wall \" which not surprisingly for the date it was recorded name - checks men coming home from the Vietnam War . It 's followed by a cracking Freddie King instrumental called \" The Stumble \" - the kind of cool boppin ' blues tune that turns up on those hip compilations you read about . \" I Wonder Why \" and \" Stormy Monday \" ( BB King and Jimmy Witherspoon covers ) get the brassy treatment like \" Yonder Wall \" to great effect , while Side 1 ends with a wonderful take on Willie Mabon 's \" I Do n't Know \" with the bass really forward and funky in the mix . Side 2 opens with a version of Ray Charles ' \" What 'd I Say \" that builds like the Atlantic original did , which is followed by one of my favourites , a fabulous soulful take on Jimmy Witherspoon 's standard \" Ai n't Nobody 's Business What We Do \" ( lyrics above ) . It 's followed by a superb harmonica driven shuffle , a cover of Jimmy Reed 's \" You Do n't Have To Go \" which features Freddie giving it some funky blues - such a cool number . The pace is then expertly changed to another \" ... my baby is gone ... \" song , a cover of B.B. King 's \" Woke Up This Morning \" with punchy brass fills ( you can so hear Hathaway 's soulfulness in a lot of the arrangements ) . This album has been reissued subsequently in 2008 by another company but apparently the sound is n't the greatest ; the only other stop is the July 2009 Bear Family Box Set called \" Taking Care Of Business \" that covers everything from 1956 through to 1973 across 7 CDs and a Hardback Book - a Christmas treat I feel certain I 'm going to allow myself . Born in 1934 , Freddie King suffered a heart attack whilst playing a Christmas concert in 1976 and passed away in hospital two days later . Name - checked by luminaries such as Eric Clapton and Peter Green , on hearing this totally forgotten peach of an album , it 's easy to see why this bluesman is remembered with such affection . A nice CD and worth seeking out - next stop the bank - manager and Bear Family 's stupendous box set ...","summary":"\"...One Day We Have Ham And Bacon...And The Next Day...Ain't Nothin' Shakin'...\"","unixReviewTime":1261267200,"image":null}

And this song showcases that to the nth degree . Yep , like it or not , those days are making a comeback . The song is an universally inspirational ballad , in the same vein of \" You Raise Me Up , \" and so many others , complete with huge chorus and finale . Taken from the famous poem I believe , Leona belts out the song in such unoriginal fashion , most people will have serious deja vu , but that wo n't stop them from eating it up . It could be a huge song on any number of radio formats , and it 's the perfect world eating follow - up to \" Bleeding Love . \" \n\n Overall , if you love this type of song , this is about the best thing that 's ever happened to you , it rivals Josh Groban , and if they play their cards right , it could dominate radio for years to come . As for me , I 'm a little on the blah side , although it does n't irk me as much as the 90 's divas . Nope , Leona is better , and she could be the next big thing . Look out 90 's divas , you have some much - needed competition .","summary":"Meet the New 90's Pop Big Voiced Diva","unixReviewTime":1210636800,"image":null}

This follows the club hit \" I 'm a fire \" which topped Billboard 's Hot dance club play charts ( her 13th # 1 there ) , in the process making her the only artist ever to have topped those charts in every decade from the seventies to date . While that effort was vintage Summer ( very retro cool ) , \" Stamp your feet \" is very different , much more contemporary sounding ; a player 's anthem with a slight Hip hop \/ Pop \/ Dance feel ( thankfully without a rapper in sight ) , stomping beats , electronic flourishes , and an incredibly catchy sing - a - long cheerleader - style chant and chorus . The lyrics ( especially the free - form verbose verses ) are fun , yet inspirational , urging on the down - and - out in life to get back up and into the game and win , using an athlete \/ sportsman as a metaphor . As ever , Summer shines vocally , ( there 's some slight vocoder effects ) singing mainly in a lower register . The potential for this song is enormous , and if there 's any justice , it should be a massive hit ! Co - written by Summer with some young songwriters Greg Kurstin ( Lily Allen , Kylie Minogue , P!nk ) and Danielle Brisebois ( Natasha Bedingfield , New Radicals , Kelly Clarkson ) , this is just one of the different colours ( or sounds ) Summer promises her new CD will contain , and with the two teasers off the album being this great , I ca n't wait to get my full box of \" Crayons \" .

New Day Rising is sort of like Zen Arcade meets their later , but still brilliant , poppier work . It 's not as dark as Zen Arcade , but it has just as much power and emotion . But probably the most stunning thing about this album is that it was made over 15 years ago , and it does not sound dated one bit . New Day Rising blows away the crap that tries to be passed off as music these days . \" Celebrated Summer , \" \" 59 Times The Pain , \" \" Terms Of Psychic Warfare , \" \" If I Told You , \" \" Folklore , \" \" I Do n't Know What You 're Talking About , \" and \" Plans I Make \" should blow your mind . And while the production may sound lacking at first ( the drums sound kind of muffled at times ) , it actually does the album justice upon further listening . Forget the marketed fake angst of much of today 's rock and listen to New Day Rising . This is arguably the best Husker album out there .

But , not surprisingly , this record gets love it or hate it reviews . All hardcore punk rock enthusiasts love it ( how can you not ? ) and all heaven 's to Murgatroid alt post punk lovin' musical sweethearts ( we could use other terms but maybe you get the idea ? Sure we do ) hate it because it is so intense and unrelenting . There 's less time between songs on this baby than possibly any other record . Cool man . \n\n 2 ) Actually , it 's very fast rock . That may not be obvious . If you slowed this stuff down it 'd just be a rock ' n roll album . But the breakneck pace launches it into the world of hardcore punk rock . Virtually by the speed of the music alone . Let 's just say that 24 or so years after its release it still deserves its title of a speed record . Sure , there 's probably some bands that have performed faster ( NEIGHBORS of San Diego did a 22 song set in about 24 minutes about 4 years ago and I thought the singer would have an anurism - that his blood vessels would explode - while he was singing and the other 4 band members were each going at maximum possible speed every single song . By the time the set was over everyone in the place was fully satisfied . I still regret not video taping that gig .   Unbelievable ) . But for the year this came out it was stupendously stunning then and I 'll still put it on once a year or so and revel in its full out blasting of some high quality music . 3 ) Sure , it 's not the highest quality recording quality . Although it 's actually higher than a bunch of punk rock that was released back in the day - late 70 's , early 80 's . Mainly cuz so much of it was Think about it , SST is a giant indie punk rock label . They remained , all these years , and certainly then , a label for and by punx with a very eclectic range . Ok , so most of their records blew . But this is a classic that will stand the test of time . Of course , so will SST 's BLACK FLAG Damaged and earlier records and their MINUTEMEN records . Virtually everything else they released is suspect ( see HUSKER DU 's post Everything Falls Apart records as a for instance , yuk ) . When big business is not involved , \n\n A ) the artist makes what they want , with no filtering by big business producers trying to make the music more appealing to the masses ie . watering it down , popifying it \n\n B ) there is less money to work with so live recordings like this one do n't always get recorded with expensive equipment so the recording quality is less than what we 're used to hearing from big name artists and \n\n C ) there 's fewer copies of DIY records because only a thousand or 10,000 are made rather than 500,000 copies . As it is , this recording quality is quite nice compared to a number of other DIY punk live releases . Quite listenable I 'd say and I do n't care to hear poorly recorded live recordings . Thank you SST and HUSKER DU for making something that still today brings a mighty smile to my face and 1000 's of other hardcore fans today and into the future . The rest of you who ca n't take this sort of thing , do n't . Go buy a nice GUIDED BY VOICES album . The existance of this album does n't diminish what HUSKER DU did later . It just shows us they sailed a different ship and left us this , their one pure classic . DRI and DIE KREUZEN , each with an amazing first 7 \" of defining , everlasting pure hardcore and then both bands just flaked off into , well , they left and made music that is still an embarrasement to listen to , at least to a punk .","summary":"I love this album with all my heart.

Many will look at the set list here ands see two things - the hit single WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN and the huge TSOP by MFSB which featured The Three Degrees . But what we really have here is the debut US album by the queens of Philly soul who managed to merge heavenly soul and r@b with disco to produce harmonies and tracks that were mesmerizing . The opening DIRTY OL MAN is stupendous and was a huge dance hit . Other gems here are CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME , A WOMAN NEEDS A GOOD MAN and the totally overlooked masterpiece IF AND WHEN that should have been another huge hit . Their harmonies blend perfectly on every track but here they manage to even add a touch of rock to their style . Of course due to the time period we do have one very dated track and it is the silly I LIKE BEING A WOMAN . But it is such fun to hear it and see how it fit in during that time in music 's history . This cd is digitally remastered for superb sound quality and has great bonus tracks and liner notes . There are certain albums that show a time period in all it 's glory . Here we have a uniquely talented female group with exsquisite harmonies . They represented Philly soul at its finest and this cd is a must for any music historian or fan of the genre . When music is good it is good and these ladies are great and this set provides a superb listening experience .","summary":"Amazing Philly soul","unixReviewTime":1277251200,"image":null}

A couple of years ago after I established my Laketon Crossing website , I wrote a blog about what gave me the strength to do that . I wanted to help others shrug off the terrible yoke of addiction . I highlighted most of my blogs with a link to a song that emphasized musically the point I was making with the written word , and chose The Rainbow Connection for that specific blog to demonstrate the spiritual aspect of my success . I also added the song to my iTunes collection and chose   Sarah McLachlan 's version because it is quite simply the best out there . Bless Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher for writing it , Sarah McLachlan for singing it , Amazon for making it available in a quick download and the song itself for making me - and hopefully others - understand that we all have addictions of one sort or another but it is possible to walk away from one that is destroying you .","summary":"You Can Walk Away","unixReviewTime":1366243200,"image":null}

This is * phenomenal * instrumental playing . It 's not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination . These band members had a unique ability to really make you open your mind and appreciate instrumental chops played tastefully and creatively , and chops that are constantly full of passion and energy . You feel like you 're getting a complete experience when you hear albums like this one . This is perhaps one of the finest recordings from the mid 70 's you will ever hear , right next to the Mahavishnu Orchestra 's Visions of the Emerald Beyond . I seriously mean that . Yes , I 've heard quite a bit of albums around the same time Where Have I Known You Before was released , and despite the fact this album was n't exactly popular does n't really MEAN anything when it comes down to it . What matters is that I 've heard the album , and I 'm trying my best to convince YOU why you need to hear it . The fact that instrumental skills of THIS caliber actually exist , and have been laid down on tape for this recording , really proves to me Return to Forever were more than just a talented group of fellows . This is a band that really gave listeners a challenging and lasting experience . The keyboard playing is a constant feature of the album . Tastefully played , engaging , and always being displayed in a way that proves the keyboard player is giving everything he has and then some . The guitar playing is the same way . More passion than most guitar players would be able to lay down , that 's for sure . Again I have to ask the magic question- The lengthy and intense keyboard and guitar jams that come and go are considered jazzy ? Are you sure this kind of music does n't belong in the rock camp ? Perhaps rock fusion is the appropriate choice of words . The album cover shows a sun appearing in a hazy red sky . The only thing hazy about these compositions are the images you get in your head . The music is certainly nothing hazy , or unorganized , or played lazily , or ANYTHING like that- this is just a straight up perfect example of jazz that at one point in time was n't afraid to be as experimental as possible . Does Where Have I Known You Before leave a lasting impression ? A positive one at that . I 'm more than happy giving an album with such brilliant instrumental playing a perfect 5 stars . Replay value is important to me as well , and this album most certainly delivers in that respect . If you 're someone just getting into jazz and would like to hear a fantastic piece of music , check out THIS album . You will be blown away by many moments among all the instrumental jams , I guarantee it . You simply must check out the Mahavishnu Orchestra , Jade Warrior , Camel and Santana as well because these bands have their fair share of music focusing on jazzy and tasteful instrumental chops as well .","summary":"what a band these guys were","unixReviewTime":1259884800,"image":null}

The style of music on Where Have I Known You Before ( 1974 ) is somewhat similar to Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy ( 1973 ) although there is a bit more in the way of softer textures , making for a very balanced listening experience . The lineup at this point included Chick Corea ( Fender Rhodes electric piano , acoustic piano , clavinet , Yamaha organ , ARP Odyssey synthesizer , and percussion ) ; bassist extraordinaire Stanley Clarke ( Alembic electric bass guitar , Yamaha organ , bell tree , chimes ; excellent drummer Lenny White ( drums , percussion ) ; and newcomer Al Di Meola ( electric and acoustic guitars ; acoustic 12 string guitar ) . These guys are all unbelievably talented , with Stanley Clarke setting new standards for performance on the bass that would be equaled by few - this guy is mind - blowingly fast . For his first time playing with RTF ( Al was 19 at the time ) , Al does an incredible job , although his playing is not as dominant in the mix as it would become on later albums . With this album , Chick had started weaving synthesizers into the RTF sound and he gets some great tone colors out of the ARP Odyssey on this album , which is plastered everywhere . As a huge fan of progressive rock and electronica , I do not mind the analog synthesizer use at all , although some jazz fans might be turned off . In terms of the music , it is an incredible amalgamation of jazz ; jazz rock ; progressive rock ; space rock ; funk and even a tiny bit of classical - more like a proggy jazz rock actually . In fact , as a progger , I really appreciate the dense arrangements and virtuosity . Speaking of which , just about every odd time signature under the sun is used on Where Have I Known You Before and there is some incredibly complex ensemble work . Sandwiched in - between the highly electric rave - ups are three of Chick 's acoustic piano improvisations including Where Have I Loved You Before ; Where Have I Danced With You Before ; and Where Have I Known You Before . This is the closest this album comes to sounding like traditional jazz and showcases Chick 's considerable talents on the acoustic piano . The softer acoustic tracks provide a nice contrast with the highly charged electric tracks . Earth Juice is the \" funkiest \" piece on the album , although this funk is pretty far removed from Sly and the Family Stone . Of course , Chick 's work on the clavinet here and there on the album really lends to the funkiness . The suite that closes the album out is a high point for me and opens with a great synthesizer arrangement , which then launches into some extremely complicated ensemble work that sounds very similar to some of the music that was coming out of the English progressive rock scene at the time . Although there are solos on this lengthy track , they are really very interesting and are seamlessly integrated with the arrangement - in fact , they sound pre - composed . Although it may not appear to be the case , this Verve release was remastered ( albeit a low budget remaster ) , and the sound quality is very good . There are a few photos of the band and a lengthy bit of \" cosmic \" verse from Neville Potter . The imagery of the words is both colorful and evocative . All in all this is an excellent RTF album ( my \" new \" personal favorite ) and is very highly recommended along with Romantic Warrior ( 1976 ) . Proggers should definitely check this album out .","summary":"Incredible proggy jazz rock","unixReviewTime":1181088000,"image":null}

One group that undoubtedly ruled the ' 90s scene -- Green Day , in October of 2000 , would issue a nearly - all - acoustic record ( \" Warning \" ) , which , while being okay , seemed to signal a change in direction , that could have been seen as a death - knell for the genre . Were it not , that is , for a new crop of young bands , all of whom were just pre - teens in 1994 when Green Day released \" Dookie , \" that emerged around this time to save the day and inject some much - needed youthful vitriol to the sound . Perhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto , Ontario 's Sum 41 , who began recording their second release and the album being reviewed , \" All Killer , No Filler \" , in October of Y2 K , just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew . Wow ! Talk about this record being a return to form for punk ! After a mood - setting intro , on track number two \" Nothing On My Back , \" the listener is introduced to the band 's striking , distinctive , and razor - sharp guitar sound , which was equal parts traditional punk - rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude . It is a guitar tone that is truly raw , inspired , and decidedly \" old school \" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow . Often imitated , but never duplicated , because no one ever did it again like Sum did . And yet , on this same opener , it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up , and then some ! From vocalist \/ co - guitarist Deryck Whibley 's ultra - memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone 's well - placed and twanging mid - song interlude , these guys prove they 're the real deal , and it does n't let up from there . This cut segues into the 50 - second \" Never Wake Up , \" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I 've heard . The two best songs , though , lie in the disc 's second half . One is \" Summer , \" a rerecording from the group 's debut \" Half Hour of Power , \" and boy , is it a masterpiece ! The main driving force in it is a simple , three - chord progression , but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective . And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days ! No doubt , one of Sum 's signature tunes . Perhaps my all - time favorite , though , is track number ten , \" Crazy Amanda Bunkface . \" This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss , and Deryck 's raging guitar solo , which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day 's earlier \" Haushinka , \" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria . Again , a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk . And there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music , with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found , that will surely have you putting \" All Killer , No Filler \" on repeat . I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily , and almost exactly 15 years on from its release , it has n't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you . I want to add that I 'm 41 ( incidentally ) and have been listening to underground punk rock ( Dead Kennedys , Government Issue , the F.U. 's , et al ) for decades , and I still think that \" All Killer , No Filler \" is among the best - crafted punk LPs in my collection , with perhaps the highest replay value of them all . A masterpiece that started a wave of imitators ... If you do n't already own this one , well , what are you waiting for ? !","summary":"Pop be damned, one of the best PUNK albums ever made","unixReviewTime":1460419200,"image":null}

The band received radio and televised airplay like crazy . Sum-41 also landed soundtrack spots for copilation CD 's , the film Spider - man , and the television show Malcom In The Middle . It was clear that the public had finally come around to listening to the punk group 's music . The public had good reason . Sum-41 has a great sense of when and how much distortion to use in their very interesting and fast paced rhythm changes . The guitars have a great taste in creating simple but very unique melodies . The bass gives the extra fill in creating the band 's harmonies , and the drums keep everything together . The lyrics to ALL KILLER NO FILLER are amusing and can even be considered to be slightly contraversial for the track \" Fat Lip \" . The lyricist makes honest and \" in your ears \" remarks about society and its expectations of its citizens . ALL KILLER NO FILLER is a fun piece of work , and one I highly recomend hearing in its entirity . \n\n Stand out tracks include : \n \" Fat Lip \" \n \" Rhythms \" \n \" Motivation \" \n \" In Too Deep \"","summary":"Sum's All Killer","unixReviewTime":1151625600,"image":null}

This is music to explore , like a boy explores the cliff in the woods outside his house , delighted to find so many things to do and see . Much has been made of the resemblance between Luke 's voice and that of the lead singer of Coldplay . Indeed , his voice is eerily similar ; fortunately , this is not necessarily a bad thing . Chris 's voice is emotive and anguished , and Luke 's is much the same , which suits this lovely music perfectly . Some might persuasively argue that it would better serve Blue Merle to have a vocalist with a voice more uniquely his own . While a voice less reminiscent of that of Coldplay might be desirable for some , ultimately , no one can deny the power and maturity with which Luke uses his voice . Probably . There is no crime in that . Could Luke have chosen to sing in a different style ? Perhaps . But would that have suited the music as well ? Probably not . I think that he was blessed with a voice that performs well in the style in which he has chosen to use it , and we should be grateful . Maturity and further listening will probably help to separate the two in our minds as the bands grow in different directions . Musically , the two bands are not that similar , although there is much to admire in Blue Merle for fanatics of Coldplay . At the risk of sounding trite , the   guitars really do shimmer , the banjos sparkle in a setting of solid drumming and inventive bass . The lyrics are excellent , and reveal more on repeated listening , which is a benchmark which I use to decide who gets my 5th star or not . The entire album is excellent , no weak tracks , and the more I hear it , the more glad I am to listen to it . Some might consider it a flaw that there is no one \" stand out \" track -- no one track that is so instantly memorable or catchy as to be the obvious single . But this is not music for singles , a treat to be digested quickly and best given with insulin -- it is music for sustenance . For fans of Coldplay , John Mayer , Dave Matthews , Counting Crows and Jeff Buckley , this is likely a band to watch and an album to love instantly , suitable to for enthusiastic recommendation to friends . For fans of the well crafted pop song , this album is reason for excitement as well , especially if you like your pop drenched in complicated guitar work and gilded with a newgrass sensibility . For everyone else , find out what you are missing . Blue Merle are worth the ride .","summary":"Marvelous, and hints of so much to come","unixReviewTime":1111363200,"image":null}

Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title . Christmas does n't have to extravagant but it should be happy , nice , peaceful , comfortable , and enjoyable . If it were n't for Frank Sinatra we would n't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today . Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I 'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging . The original version had somewhat different lyrics . The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung . \" In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow . Until then we 'll just have to muddle through somehow . \" Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him \" I like your Christmas song \" but that he needed that line \" jollied up \" to include the piece on his Christmas album . Sinatra said \" The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas . Do you think you could jolly that line up for me ? \" And , of course , as Martin put it \" You do n't say no to Frank Sinatra . \" The new lyrics in this line became \" Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow . Hang a shining star upon the highest bough . \" Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics . Frank Sinatra 's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is THE original version of Have Yourself a Merry Christmas and gets 5 out 5 stars hands down . :)","summary":"The original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas as we know it.","unixReviewTime":1380153600,"image":null}

The lyrics are so beautiful as well as meaningful that they can bring tears to your eyes , if you are in the right frame of mind . The music too matches the lyrics , in that , it too is beautiful . It far outstrips Candle in the Wind , for beauty . It is a song about giving God Thanks , for certain people in his life , that have changed the person 's life for the better , no matter what happened to the contrary . It is truly a work of art . Elton was definitely inspired when he wrote this . It will be forever on the top of my all time favorite songs of all time list . At least , give a good listen . Maybe a second and a third , until you can hear all the words clearly . He sings things like \" I know why roses do n't grow in New York \" and other things like that you probably are n't expecting .

The album is a decent effort , but does n't match up to his quintessential early 70 's albums . One big reason is that he severed his writing partnership with Bernie Taupin . Together they created unforgettable songs , but apart , they 've been hit and miss . A Single Man falls into the hit and miss category . Songs like \" Shine On Through \" , \" Ego \" , \" Part - Time Lover \" and the gorgeous and heartfelt \" Song For Guy \" ( a tribute to his young messenger who was killed in a motorcycle accident ) are quite good while others like \" Big Dipper \" , \" Georgia \" , \" Madness \" & \" Reverie \" fall short of the mark","summary":"Elton less Bernie","unixReviewTime":994896000,"image":null}

There have been so many classics that have been so strong for both of them . But of all of them from the 80 's , the one that stands out intimately the most is Sacrifice from his 1989 album Sleeping With The Past . It is a very classic piano ballad that sits well , where in a era of songs that were tacky and not as strong from Elton , because of his abuse and marriage ended , it still stands absolutely tall from Elton in voice and harmony . If you 're new to Elton John , this is a nice download as well as for die hard Elton John fans , and that is a sacrifice worth taking .","summary":"Classic Elton","unixReviewTime":1331251200,"image":null}

I 'm going to pick this song apart and explain why each and every part of it is so irresistibly awesome . \" Reflections \" might just be the greatest song Diana Ross & the Supremes ever released . This song must have come on the radio a million times throughout the country over the years , and I would n't mind listening to it a million times myself . Here we go ! It starts off on an unusual note for the first few seconds with swirling machinery - type sounds that seems totally out of place at first but now that I 've heard the song so many times , I believe these chaotic sounds are supposed to represent the confusion and emotional distraught that Diana Ross feels through her rollercoaster emotional state of mind . Then Diana Ross begins to sing ... and her voice * alone * is brilliant . It sounds so tender with * just * the right hoarse sound . Like a young woman who 's finally had enough of having someone hold her down , so she 's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels . Like she 's on stage and it 's her turn to speak , or sing in this case , what 's on her mind . I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it 's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger . I LOVE it ! Then we have the Supremes providing the really somber and suspense - building \" ooooo , oo - oo - oo \" behind Diana 's powerful vocals . Listen to the perfectly executed way the \" oooo \" dreamily soothes and creates tension during the way Diana sings the line \" Through the mirrors of my mind , through these tears I am crying \" . With the Supremes providing back - up , now this song takes on a whole new meaning . Without the Supremes Diana 's vocals would have been great as it is , but WITH the Supremes ? Now it 's just insanely good ! What proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line \" I 'm all alone now , no love to shield me , trapped in a world of distorted reality \" . Suddenly , during this particular line , the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone . What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who 's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past , they feel cold and angry . If my words are n't clear , this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it 's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is . It took me a LONG time to notice there 's a speedy bass section playing in the background , and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change . It 's brief and easy to not notice unless you 're playing REALLY close attention . It 's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana 's emotions all coming to a head and she 's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible . This is ANOTHER really powerful moment . Granted , my interpretation probably is n't the same as Diana 's , but that 's okay- we all interpret music differently . The song finishes on a more optimistic note with dramatically more promising vibes the way Diana Ross demandingly sings \" Reflections of , the way life used to be \" with a pounding rhythm illustrating a brighter future . The tone of the song right here at this point seems to paint a picture of someone who 's learned to move on from a troubled relationship and wo n't dare repeat the same mistakes again . And just to throw in some humor , it 's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- No Diana is actually saying \" In the you and I \" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here . If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions ( in the beginning and when Diana sings the line \" happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories \" and the line near the end \" I see a dream that 's lost from the hurt you have caused \" ) you could actually be led to believe she 's singing about UFO 's , haha . So what is it about \" Reflections \" that is so magnificent ? It 's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned . Sadness , optimism , worry , fear , deserted ... these are just some of the feelings I experience . If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do , you should be able to detect all these emotions and more ! Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3 - minute song , and that my friends is downright amazing .","summary":"what a song!","unixReviewTime":1399075200,"image":null}

The Last Song definitely still shows that . It is still as beautiful and simple from Elton 's talent , singing about A.I.D.S. after losing his friends and loved ones from Freddie Mercury of Queen to Ryan White , he definitely still knows that even after 20 years after this song came out , it still clicks very well and intimately with Elton 's voice and sonnet . If you 've have n't heard any of Elton John 's songs from the 90 's , this is absolutely one worth checking out .","summary":"The Somber Song","unixReviewTime":1360627200,"image":null}

Of all the slow songs Elton John has done this one has to be the most unique of the bunch . It has that 80 's New York blues feel to it and plays with chord progressions that move in unexpected places ; making a melody that is both complex and familiar . Elton 's singing is at its best here . He sings like a smooth and mellow crooner , giving a little edge just where the song needs it . I am baffled this track was n't included in any of the greatest hits collections . It was a top ten song on the UI.K. and and top 15 in the U.S. \n\n If you love ballads or mellow songs that are a cut different than your standard pop tune that are still catchy and beautiful you must do yourself a favor and check out Blue Eyes .","summary":"One of my favorite ballads from Elton","unixReviewTime":1386633600,"image":null}

It justed missed the top 20 ( in the US ) upon its release in May , 1981 . It also marked a transitional period in his career , coming off the sometimes successful but ultimately unfocused albums like 21 at 33 to the more straight ahead pop smarts of Too Low for Zero . Although The Fox leans much more toward the unfocusedness of 21 at 33 , due to the mishmash of writing partners and use of outside musicians in places , it is a much more interesting and satisfying experience than anything he had turned out in years . I find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit , prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory . As a few reviewers have noted previously , this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas ( who would also produce his next 3 albums ) . Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement . This ambition shows up in songs like \" Fascist Faces \" , the beautiful instrumental trio \" Carla \/ Etude \/ Fanfare \" and the more traditional love ballad \" Chloe . \" The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir , a full string orchestra , and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this is n't meant to be a cohesive statement , but meant to try to satisfy trends and make \" the cutting edge \" for 1981 . Most of the time , it acheives this due to Elton 's tunefulness and ultra - competent instrumentation . Highlights of the album are many and scattered throughout . It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit . While \" Just Like Belgium \" is fun and lively , it really does n't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks , and \" Heels of the Wind \" seems unneccessary , almost like an afterthought . Big departures from his previous work are the tracks \" Heart in the Right Place \" with its forceful , blues - rock tone and \" Fascist Faces \" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir . Both tracks are propelled by the biting , metalish guitar play of Richie Zito , which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton 's canon . In the end , The Fox is far from a masterpiece along the lines of Honky Chateau or Yellow Brick Road , but it is one of the most interesting in Elton 's now 35 + year solo career . I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the more arty side of what would become \" I 'm Still Standing \" and \" Sad Songs \" just a few years down the road .","summary":"The Lost 80s Elton Album","unixReviewTime":1121472000,"image":null}

Nice melodies , mot so much passion , but a lyrics sheet that , no matter how one tried , could not find a single reference to his sexuality , except Big Dipper . And so ' The Fox ' goes , his usual servings of pop , still using self - serving metaphors ( But ' The Fox ' is a long way to plummet from ' Captain Fantastic ' do n't ya think ? ) ( And who 's fault is this anyway , It 's not as if Elton writes the lyrics , or does he ? ? Did Bernie Taupin really bestowe the crown of ' Captain Fantastic ' on Elton , while relegating himself to role of ' Brown dirt cowboy ' ? ) But The Fox is a surprise . Although it is not an experimental album , fairly straight - forward , it is still a very inspired album . From the sleazy - journo ode ' Heart 's in the right p;ace ' to classical music ' Carla Etude ' and the all - our rocking opener ' Breaking down barriers ' , the songs on ' The Fox ' are very solid and enjoyable . There is also a lot of diversity here too . Rating 3 1\/2 or 3 3\/4 or something like that , worth rounding up . But if you are hoping for a return to his country - rock days ; you 'll be disappointed , you 'll have to wait for the last song and even then you wo n't get any humility : \" And for mile after mile you 'll never see me tire You 'll never see me slow down , for a while \n 'Cause I am the fox , like it or not \" .

This song is basically about someone wanting to have sex with you in a very passionate and aggressive way . Like many others , I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager . I honestly found the music video very eccentric ( in a positive way ) , but creative at the same time , and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more . I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video . The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it , and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song ( there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative :( Through every forest , above the trees Within my stomach , scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive ) . Obviously , many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means . I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting .

On the other hand it 's both historic and great music . The historic aspect is this is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come . Listen to the sound samples on this page and even those short snippets will reveal the magic of this album . I am not going to try to dissect the music or impose my personal taste on you , but if you love swinging and tight quartets with a piano and vibraphone in front you will be more than pleased with this album . While I promised to not dissect the music I will say that the intensity that Jackson brings to the performances match the backing trio - Peterson and bassist Ray Brown in particular were renown for intensity even on ballads , and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well . So the chemistry among the four is natural and one of the reasons why this album appeals to me . Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions , two of which are logged as ' untitled Peterson originals ' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue . Regardless , the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile .","summary":"Short,  but great","unixReviewTime":1437523200,"image":null}

Musically , it does n't disappoint . From the very first track , \" On Green Dolphin Street , \" Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint , drawing the listener in as on few other recordings ( he 's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis ) . And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes , he 's neither intrusive nor overwhelming . In fact , he 's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session . And Bags is , as usual , the master of bop and blues , a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets ( Gary Burton would cut the rotators , add two more mallets , and take the instrument in a different direction ) . As recently as 5 years earlier , Milt was still playing with fast - spinning rotators , but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place . ( To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ , if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis , check out \" Bags and Trane . \" ) One caveat : the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment . Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of \" stereophonic sound \" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms . Oscar 's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted ; Ed Thigpen 's drums lack dispersion and upper - register presence . In fact , there 's a slightly \" canned \" quality to the overall sound , making you want to take the lid off . I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording , they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound . ( Sometimes it 's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import . Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money . )","summary":"Comes up short sonically","unixReviewTime":1206057600,"image":null}

This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing . Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson 's very restrained and delicate Piano solo . Even when the solo reaches the swing section there are n't the torrents of notes that you might expect . This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent . Of course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers . In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell . Milt Jackson plays with a fire that , to me , was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ . Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming . He really hits some great accents when you really do n't expect them - and they work ! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good . Sadly only Oscar Peterson survives from this marvellous quartet at the time of writing . This disc captures them all at the height of their abilities and is an essential purchase .","summary":"Brilliant","unixReviewTime":1177113600,"image":null}

Adams","reviewText":"When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961 , along came the other two members of Oscar 's trio , Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums . While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD , Brown and Thigpen were great players , and add a lot to the success of this effort . The opener , \" Green Dolphin Street \" is relaxed , but \" Heartstrings \" and \" Work Song \" jump . Then comes the wonderful , almost eight - minute take on \" John Brown 's Body \" that soars . The final two cuts , \" A Wonderful Guy \" and \" Reunion Blues \" are also superb . Milt and Oscar , of course , went on to do great work up to the mid-90 's , but they were already old pros 41 years ago . If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz , play this for him or her . It 's a perfect blend of the four instruments and a great introduction to the category .","summary":"Four great guys, not just the two principals...","unixReviewTime":1020729600,"image":null}

This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can , and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life . I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think ( also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would ) . Last , but not least , this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong ( thick - skinned ) , and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine . My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner : \n\n It just takes some time \n Little Girl You 're in the middle of the ride \n Everything , everything will be just fine \n Everything , everything will be alright , alright \n\n   \" The Middle \" is a brilliant track that applies to both men and women from all walks of life even with taking the \" little girl \" metaphor into account . I suggest this song ( with absolute self - confidence ) if you know that events in your life are going to unfold perfectly and in a joyful manner , but you also crave listening to a song that powerfully gives this reminder ( in addition to sending the message to always see your personal beauty and unlimited power regardless of how others may treat you )","summary":"The Powerful Middle","unixReviewTime":1299110400,"image":null}

I heard this song a few years back , it was playing in the background of a car commercial and everyone in the room wanted to know the name and who sang it . Since then , I 've heard it on 3 more commercials and it was on Lincoln Lawyer soundtrack , and featured in the movie The Italian Job . From the time the music starts playing , you know you 're in for a treat and you get it . The music is upbeat and the melody is sweet . Marlena 's voice is on point ; it 's uniquely powerful and full of soul . She has great control of her instrument and you get swept up in the soulful way she delivers each and every note . This song is still going strong and this is a testament to how great of a singer she is . It 's no wonder - California Soul has been sampled over and over by rappers ( Gang Starr , The Game , etc . ) , beer manufacturers , Dockers , countless television commercials and a driving game - Driver : San Frisco .

You still get angst in the tone so as a vehicle to express a frustration through song , you can consider it .
