The melody and how every thing comes together was done very well . Nelly 's voice is crystal clear .

None the less I like this type of song from Nelly . I 've been a fan off Nelly since she started in the late 90 's . I was in high school and normally listened to rock music like Guns N ' Roses , Metalica , Aerosmith , Pink Floyd etc . I hated when she changed to more \" dirty \" type music . But she had to grow up and wish she would make more of this types of songs . This is more classy Nelly and I like a well orchestrate song with melodies .

The CD cover is blah , but the music is what matters . I am not going to be overly critical of the music like some people have been because bottom line this is rock ' n roll , it has passion , and some great riffing , and it is Anvil and they are BACK .

Which is kind of sad , because if this is the best they have , they 're in trouble . The song itself does n't break any ground , and while its melody and overall musical structure may be fine , albeit a little radio - friendly , I think what really draws people into the song is the vocals . They 're kind of different , and they grab your attention . They 're not stunning in the least bit , but it 's different . And some might consider the song a nice change . However , wiser heads would look at the song and say , yeah , it 's alright . Overall , the song does n't break much ground , and seems in the mold of a thousand before . However , the vocals grab you , and pull you into the song . In the end , Buckcherry may be a one - hit wonder .

The material is crisp , his delivery and timing are perfect , and his \" little voice of confused audience member \" thing is a genius idea that he uses to full effect . His wry accents and pregnant pauses are unbeatably tight . I love all of his dvds and cds , but DMT may be his funniest . [ I will say , however , that I 've never seen a comedian milk the same bits over and over on so many different cds . Nearly every bit he 's ever done is on at least two and sometimes three or four different cds , providing less value than one might want . In that light , I 'd recommend this , King Baby and Beyond The Pale , as they have almost every bit from his first four or so collections as well as new material . ] No other American comic seems as adept at pointing out our endless national foibles yet making them seem so endearingly moronic . Hot Pockets is pricelessly funny ; I almost fall over laughing every time I hear it . In fact , to avoid that today I woke up and decide to start the week off right by laying in bed five minutes longer and listening to Hot Pockets on headphones . As usual I cracked up time and again , but was fortunately unable to fall over . I did roll over a few times though . Any comedian who can make me crack up time and again at the same bit is clearly doing something right . Bill Hicks and Carlin and Chris Rock can , and a very few others . Jim 's in that small group , no doubt . Great comedy is a combination of smart material , timing , and that x factor that separates the good from the great .

What 's funny today might bore you tomorrow . Some jokes are only funny the first time . My Time , \" scores high on the replay factor . Perhaps it 's his delivery ( dry self - deprecation with a twist of smug ) . Perhaps it 's his avant - garde style of humor ( he spends about a quarter of the time pretending to be a critical female member of his own show , weaving \" her \" comments with his ) . Perhaps it 's just his voice , which has a malleable whine to it that never gets annoying and which makes his self - mockery seem humorously authentic instead of just patronizing or pathetic . Part of it is definitely the humor itself . Whether his jokes make bizarre 180 's ( \" I used to smoke . Yeah . Smoking 's real addictive . But you know what 's REALLY addictive ? Heroin . \" ) , or whether their humor lies in their dead ends ; whether they take the \" didja ever notice ? \" concept and snap it in half ( his \" Hot Pocket \" and bottled water \/ Mexican food bits are a good example of this ) , or whether they 're just plain crude , grouchy , silly and dumpy , they all stand up to repeated listenings . There are a few times where you get the impression that the joke -- such as his bit on glasses -- would work a lot better if you could see the man ( and , in fact , most of them are like that ; Jim is almost as much fun to watch as he is to listen to ) , but none of them fail to be laugh - worthy because of it .

All in all , some of my favorite musical touchstones that have been part of the soundtrack to my life . \" Call To Arms \" opens in classic AvA style , widescreen and epic , beautiful chiming guitars and pulsing keyboards building up into a huge song with big choruses and gorgeous Hammond organ . \" Everything 's Magic \" has become sort've \" our song \" between my girlfriend and I. I heard it for the first time just days before we met , and it was played quite a bit in the car during our first few months . Everytime we hear it come on in a department store or the mall , we give eachother this look and a smile that is priceless . There 's a nice pop - punk quality to it ( which is different from anything on their first album ) , although the chorus is a pure adrenaline rush reminescent of early Asia . \" Love Like Rockets \" is another \" classic AvA \" song , with those trademark sequenced keyboards and drums . The intro is perfectly epic , utilising sound samples of President Eisenhower , astronauts , and various radio chatter and feedback that brings to mind the Space Race of the 50 's and 60 's . Tom seems to be making a parallel between the giddy rush of new love , and launching on a rocket into an unknown frontier . \" Breathe \" is sort've a ballad with nice soft keyboards . \" Sirens \" is fast - paced and frenetic and the chorus reminds me of The Proclaimers . \" Secret Crowds \" has a huge chorus , although I love the music and words during the verses a bit more . \" Star of Bethlehem \/ True Love \" was originally recorded for a compilation CD in late 2006 , and is mixed a little differently on I - Empire . Another mini - epic , with trancey sequencers and Edge - like guitar effects . \" Lifeline \" has a keyboard sound that immediately brought me fresh memories of 1985 , considering that it sounded exactly like the intro to Reading Rainbow . \" Jumping Rooftops \" is a cut - and - pasted percussion and keyboard interlude that leads into \" Rite of Spring \" , which is another relatively experimental song , sounding more raw and punky as Tom reflects on his teenage life . ( He said that he wanted to write a song that would sound like a garage band 's first tune , written in high school . ) The album ends with \" Heaven \" , reprising musical and lyrical themes from \" Valkyrie Missile \" , the opening track on We Do n't Need To Whisper , effectively ending the two - album concept and bringing things full circle . The lyrics continue in the same vein of We Do n't Need To Whisper , and are positively infectious in their optimistic spiritual outlook , topics of reformation and reinvention , living your dreams , and never giving up . This is a message that I wish more Top 40 bands would preach , and is vastly needed during the hard times we live in . Being a grounded but optimistic person myself ( as well as having a love for the 80 's , Sci - Fi , and prog - rock ) , this band is perfect blend of my favorite things . Overall , I - Empire sounds quite a bit like their last album , although has a couple of curveballs and is a little more organic sounding . New bassist Matt Wachter ( formerly of 30 Seconds To Mars ) and guitarist David Kennedy do n't stand out too much ( being buried behind layers of effects and keyboards , not to mention Tom 's own playing ) , but drummer Atom Willard continues with greatness previously seen before , with a fiery , explosive energy , awesome fills , and a rhythmic groove that very nearly puts him in the \" virtuoso \" category . Check out his electronic \/ acoustic percussion showcase throughout the first few minutes of \" Star of Bethlehem \/ True Love \" ( notably performed just as perfect in a live setting when I caught the band live in early 2008 . ) The album artwork is a departure from the last one , instead featuring a painted montage ( by Drew Struzan , famous movie poster artist of Lucas and Spielberg ) of the band over a sunset horizon . Yet another reference to a positive 80 's childhood . If AvA fans ca n't get enough of this type of sound , I 'd strongly recommend some other prog - rock bands such as Pendragon ( Believe or Pure ) , 30 Seconds To Mars , It Bites ( The Tall Ships or The Big Lad In The Windmill ) , Rush ( Grace Under Pressure or Power Windows ) , dredg , Coheed & Cambria and Asia .","summary":"\"Watch your words spread hope like fire...\"","unixReviewTime":1264291200,"image":null}

Well , Tom 's register did n't change at all . There 's nothing wrong with that per se , but , well , serious songs and that kind of voice just do n't gel like they should . This is especially evidenced when the band shoots for romantic tunes like \" Love Like Rockets \" and \" Breathe \" ( \" True Love \" works out pretty well , though ) . While none of the songs are bad , the songs that stand out the most are the final two tracks : \" Rite of Spring \" and \" Heaven \" . The opening track \" Call to Arms \" is pretty good too , as are the instrumentals \" Jumping Rooftops \" and \" Star of Bethlehem \" .

While most convert albums suffer a bit from the \" noise \" of the crowd 's cheers , in this case they actually add to the experience rather than distracting . Discovery was a sweet box of evolving melodies , but this is a driving , thrumming , buzzing beat box of awesome ! I always loved how the melodies of Discovery melded into each other , making you want to listen to the entire album . This is a series of Daft Punk 's best songs mixed together perfectly with enough wonderous glorious bass to benchmark any speaker system . If I have a single complaint , it 's the that the Close Encounters of the Third Kind opening is missing from the audio recording , and should be included . Other than that , listen to this and enjoy . It 's awesome music for just listening , but it 's REALLY great for exercise , doing chores , or ( obviously ) having a dance party . Highly , HIGHLY recommended . Final note : If you have a record player the complete Alive Boxed Set is totally worth it as it includes a backstage pass , stickers , bonus tracks , a turntable pad , and a gorgeous art book .","summary":"The Best Daft Punk Album Since Discovery","unixReviewTime":1440201600,"image":null}

Alternating between cushiony pop , unabashed folk and guitar rock , \" Cease To Begin \" cuts a wide swath musically . Sometimes the jumps can be jarring , like when the bashing guitars of \" Cigarettes Wedding Bands \" slips into the country ballad \" Window Blues , \" complete with a banjo . There 's a great opener in \" Is There A Ghost \" that mixes both the dream - pop with an eventual cascade of guitsr , combing the band 's strength in the best offering here . What ties this all together is Bridwell 's voice and an uncanny sense of melody ; even his brashest songs have underlying hooks . Add some really gorgeous harmonies ( \" Window Blues \" again ) , you get one of those indie bands earning their cred the hard way , by working outside the system . \" Cease To Begin \" is a relaxed and understated album .","summary":"Band at a Gallop","unixReviewTime":1364428800,"image":null}

Despite pretty much non - stop touring since them the guys are back already with a new album . \" Cease to Begin \" ( 10 tracks , 35 min . ) is an equally impressive album . The opener \" Is There A Ghost \" starts off very BoH - like , only to crash into electric guitars and very up - tempo about 1 minute into the song , bringing the message that these guys have expanded their musical pallet . \" Ode to Lag \" follows , with equally strong music . The good tracks keep coing : \" No One 's Gon na Love You \" is a great pensive tune , as is \" Detlef Schrempf \" ( yes , he the German former NBA basketball player ) , and \" The General Specific \" closes the first half of the album , an exuberrant tune . After a short instrumental , the second half kicks off with a rousing \" Islands On the Coast \" , followed by a great , somber \" Marry Song \" , with superb underlying keyboards . Yet the best is still to come ! \" Cigarettes Wedding Bands \" is THE stand - out track of the album , sure proof how much BoH has matured musically in just a year 's time . The closer \" Window Blues \" is too twangy \/ country for my liking , and the least interesting track on the album . \" Cease to Begin \" is an outstanding album , and equal , if not better , than \" Everything All the Time \" . They have not so much abandoned their early - My Morning Jacket - soundalike style , but expanded on it , to great effect . I 've had the good fortune of seeing Band of Horses last year during the \" Everything All the Time \" tour , and if you have a chance to see these guys in concert , do n't miss them , you will be blown away .

They do sound different , do n't get me wrong , with over a hundred years between them .

When Peter Steele died , I felt like I had just lost an uncle . But enough with the biography , let 's get on to the review ... \n\n I picked this album up when it first came out , and I honestly was n't very impressed . I liked the fact that they had gone back to the long , complex song structures , but other than that , I really was n't feeling it . Recently , I started throwing this album in more often and found myself loving it more and more . At this point , I would have to say that it 's my favorite next to Slow Deep and Hard , and Bloody Kisses . Musically , this album is a complete success . Their maturity really shows , and the gothic Beatles - esque melodies that were absent from Life is Killing Me have returned . I would go so far to label these songs as \" beautiful \" . With the exception of Halloween in Heaven ( it 's waaaay too cheesey ) , I would give these songs 9 and 10\/10 each . My absolute favorites are : September Sun , These Three Things , She Burned Me Down , and Hail and Farewell to Britain . I may even have to say this album is tied for 2nd place with Bloody Kisses only because this album flows better where BK was kind of all over the place stylistically .

I 'm saddened beyond words at the untimely loss of Peter Steele just last week . I 'm convinced he had a lot of great music ahead of him . That said , it 's my opinion that he went out absolutely on top with \" Dead Again \" . When this disc came out , I listened to it nearly continuously for two years -- no lie . I 've never had such a strong reaction to any Type O Negative CD , not even \" Bloody Kisses \" and \" October Rust \" , my two other favorites . While there may be some Type O fans who might disagree with me , \" Dead Again \" is so phenomenal that it 's practically beyond criticism . The \" highs \" have never been higher , and the overall level of quality is tremendous , with the exception of \" She Burned Me Down \" which seems to go on a bit pointlessly . Standout tracks include \" Dead Again , \" \" Tripping A Blind Man , \" \" Profits of Doom , \" \" September Sun , \" \" These Three Things , \" \" An Ode To Locksmiths , \" and \" All Hail And Farewell To Britain . \" \n\n I could be barking up the wrong tree , but I 've long thought that Peter Steele has to have had significant exposure to classical music . This is n't a new opinion for me , but his development as a songwriter suggests to me he was drawing on an awareness of symphonic masters . Two tracks in particular bear this out . \" September Sun \" is an astonishing song that became something of an obsession . The very first time I heard track four , I literally groaned and said to myself , \" they ca n't be serious ! \" \" September Sun \" starts like a \" hair band \" power ballad , with a simple nice piano intro -- totally not Type O. And then it occurred to me , knowing that this is Peter Steele , this has to be a joke and it 's going to get turned inside out and trashed . And actually something very different happens . Steele does something profoundly Brucknerian with \" September Sun\"--he takes a very simple basic theme , expands upon it , puts it through a metamorphosis , and it ends up becoming something far more imposing , grander , astonishing , and even menacing , than you can have even been lead to believe it would become , by the time the song is over nearly 10 minutes later , and really takes you somewhere . \" September Sun \" has to be heard in its astonishing entirety , and for me it is an especially imposing , threatening , beautiful , and entirely unnerving piece of music . It haunts me while still blowing me away . \" These Three Things \" is also a musical standout ( I usually do n't pay attention to the words , and listening to Peter Steele rant against abortion is more humorous than anything else -- and it was not intended as a joke ) . At just under 15 minutes , it 's the longest song that Type O ever recorded . And unlike some of their lengthier songs which are really just a collection of several smaller songs strung together , \" These Three Things \" takes musical ideas and works them out over the length of the song , transforming them by the end . Beyond the drone introduction , the initial section of the song is musically one of the most brutal things that Type O has ever done -- relentless , overpowering , and raw . And then the music takes a 180 , introduces a new musical theme , and then transforms it over the remainder of the song . I was n't overwhelmed by \" These Three Things \" initially , but almost more than any other song on this CD , it grew on me to the point of becoming one of the very highlights . I 've long had the opinion that \" Dead Again \" is Type O Negative 's finest work -- which is not to diminish \" Bloody Kisses \" or \" October Rust \" in any way , as great as they are . In \" Dead Again , \" Type O pushed themselves hard , not settling to re - do what they have already done , and I think they made real breakthroughs and succeeded on every level . To Peter Steele , let me say this :   THANK YOU , Peter , for giving us such outstanding music . Words will never express how grateful I am . I also feel very fortunate to have seen Type O play live numerous times . You did n't do it by yourself , Type O clearly was a band , not a man with three backup players , but you were the creative force , the vision , and the voice . I will be listening to your music likely for the rest of my life , and I have no doubt it will stand the test of time . Many musicians have made a name for themselves , but few have had the capacity for such an original vision , and the talent to achieve it . You did , and I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart . At the end of several of a number of Type O 's concerts , you would say right before leaving , while grasping your heart , \" Thank you , for without you , we are nothing , \" and it never came across as anything but heartfelt . Hearing more about you after your passing , about your truly humble nature , I am more sure than ever that those words were your truth . But my truth is , it was not you in our debt , but the other way around . We are lucky to have had you sharing your gift with us . Thank you , Peter . If there is an \" other side \" ( and I have a hard time believing there is ) , I hope you had a good journey and are at peace . Peace , Green Man .","summary":"Peter went out on top with \"Dead Again\"","unixReviewTime":1271808000,"image":null}

For a band with such a self - deprecating sense of humor and such a choppy musical history , Type O Negative creates powerful , emotional music that transcends the goth stereotypes it wallows in ( and helped create ) . And Peter Steele 's dark vocals , once sort of a gimmick , have become integral to their brooding sound . Anyway , like I said , \" October Rust \" is the best album ever . But the follow - up , \" World Coming Down \" , was rather disappointing . I was losing hope for the band when their last album , \" Life Is Killing Me \" , turned out to be a significant improvement . While not as uniformly brilliant as \" Rust \" , it had some excellent songs and brought back their sense of humor . So I had high hopes for the newest release , \" Dead Again \" . The album is surprising in a lot of ways . First of all , many of the songs are much faster than previous Type O material . Peter does n't sing quite so deep and gloomy this time around , and guitarist Kenny Hickey does much more singing than before . A few songs break the ten - minute mark , something they have n't really done since their first record . And while much of their sound remains typically Type O , many of the lyrics deal with new themes and ideas . According to recent interviews , Peter Steele has returned to his Catholic upbringing , and so much of the album deals with Christianity and religion . \" The Profit of Doom \" uses an asteroid striking the Earth as a metaphor for the Apocalypse . \" These Three Things \" deals with abortion and the Jewish state of Israel . \" An Ode To Locksmiths \" offers a rather twisted version of Genesis . \" Halloween in Heaven \" is a bit lighter in tone , dealing with all the dead great musicians playing a concert in Heaven . And as usual , some of the songs are simply about Peter Steele himself and his personal problems . The title track \" Dead Again \" is about drug addiction , and \" Some Stupid Tomorrow \" deals with his anger management issues . Thankfully , their sense of humor has not disappeared or been overwhelmed by the serious subject matter . I laughed out loud at some of the song titles , such as \" Tripping A Blind Man \" and \" Some Stupid Tomorrow , \" and several songs have some hilarious lines . Among my favorites : \n\n \" I had no pulse last time I checked \/ I 'd trade my life for self - respect \" ( from \" Dead Again \" ) \n\n \" Elvis ai n't dead , so he is n't here \" ( from \" Halloween in Heaven \" ) \" If only I 'd known how cool death is \/ I 'd have killed myself sooner \" ( from \" Halloween in Heaven \" ) \n\n And let 's not forget their album liner notes . The band photo from Life Is Killing Me featured four sets of feet with toe tags on them . Not to be outdone , Dead Again shows a picture of four mangled chalk outlines opposite photos of skeletons inside coffins . And in the section for equipment used , it says \" Type O Negative has yet to learn how to use the following equipment . \" I always get a kick out of that sort of thing . Even though I think \" Life Is Killing Me \" had some better individual songs than \" Dead Again \" , I think \" Dead Again \" is a better album as a whole . The whole tone of the album sounds more concise and uniform . But that 's just me . It is a bit on the long side , but that 's my only real complaint . As a whole , fans of Type O should be happy with this release . The band they know and love has clearly matured over the years , but their style is undeniably intact . However , some people might be put off by the religious content of many of the songs . People bravely hoping for a return to \" October Rust \" territory will surely be disappointed as well .","summary":"still not as good as october rust","unixReviewTime":1193875200,"image":null}

I really did n't even care for September Sun , reminds me of Adam Sandler 's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie \" Wedding Singer \" . This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like . I only like one song off the album , and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit .

The lyrical theme is entirely seperate to the aesthetic , which makes them both distinct unto themselves : \n\n Musick \n\n Track List : 1 . Dead Again 2 . Tripping A Blind Man 3 . The Profits Of Doom 4 . Halloween in Heaven 6 . She Burned Me Down 8 . Some Stupid Tomorrow 9 . Hail And Farewell To Britain \n\n Dead Again preserves their evocatively best style , with rhythmically crunching and echoing guitars , haunting cathedral keyboards , the darkly erotic inunciations and deep reverberations from Peter Steele , and the hypnotic beat of the drums all combine to create another Goth - Metal masterpiece akin to Bloody Kisses . As is typical TON , each song takes its time , coursing and describing the emotions , while stimulating a sense of sweet euphoria . Of note , The Profit of Doom , dealing with The Antichrist Beast of Revelation complete with references to the six triumverate ; Halloween In Heaven , a jaunty tune featuring a female voice { Tara VanFlower of Lycia } complimenting Steele 's well with a pleasing contrast . September Sun , & These Three Things combine ponderous ballad moments with sudden bursts of energy creating a perfect mix of melancholy and rage . Also , I was pleasantly surprised to find an additional disc contained inside with a Live recording featuring tracks from Bloody Kisses { Christian Woman , Love You To Death , Black No . 1 } , October Rust { Everything Dies \/ My Girlfriend 's Girlfriend } , Slow Deep & Hard , { Gravitational Constant } , and Origin of The [ ... ] { Are You Afraid } , all of which sounds extraordinary . Overall , Dead Again contains a mutiplicity of content from the art { even the thorny vines on the CD itself is a very nice touch } to the quantity of music , which hearkens to Bloody Kisses and October Rust while standing upon its own merit . Highly recommended . Aesthetics \n\n The cover art features Grigori Efimovich Rasputin , Mystic , so called \" Holy Devil \" and \" Mad Monk \" , deriving from The Khlysty , a sect who practiced self - flagellation , although he disagreed with their masochistic methods and basically became a renegade monk with a penchant for carnal indulgence - from imbibing in copious libations , passionate dance { it was rumored that he even celebrated a phallic cavort with the legendary ample appendage } , to sensual pleasures with many of the local women who admired his extraordinary abilities , as well as his libertine lifestyle , in which he revelled , and was more than willing and able to satisfy on a frequent basis . His influence pervaded the Russian Aristocracy , wherein he had the Czar and Czarina transfixed . Briefly , extremely fortunate for them , he attained the power to heal , and used that ability to cure the Czar 's son Alex , which gained their unyielding loyalty . From the beginning , there were those who resented him , claiming he was in league with The Devil . Through treachorous subterfuge , he was tricked and betrayed , and eventually excarnated after displaying apparent invincibility , to the fear and trepidation of his detractors . He lived his life to the fullest , attained a passionate joie de vivre , employing lesser magic principles to charm and confound when it served his purposes , and excelled in his chosen endeavors , all of which designates him a de - facto Satanist , in My estimation . The back cover features the images of Olga , Tatiana , Maria , Anastasia and Alex , the unfortunate royal children who were assassinated { with the exception of Maria , who would later write a book entitled \" Rasputin : The Man Behind The Myth \" } in Yekaterinburg ( Sverdlovsk ) on 16th July 1918 , by the filthy hands of stuporstitious peasants wanting to rid the kingdom of anything to do with Rasputin . The ignorant frightened cowards . The green font used on the entire album can be a bit distracting , which is something of a Russian version of the English alphabet , with several reversed letters . Also mentionable , the booklet is a fold - out cross design containing full lyrics and liner notes .","summary":"Rasputin rocks!","unixReviewTime":1174521600,"image":null}

Enough about the exterior , this album dredges up sounds reminiscnet of Slow Deep and Hard and Bloody Kisses Smashed together and angrier than ever . The album has 10 tracks and clocks in at a dredging 77 minutes of Highs and Lows . Personal favorite tracks are \" Tripping A Blind Man \" , \" Some Stupid Tomorrow \" , and the best track for me \" Ode To Locksmiths \"   a fast and swinging ditty that even dredges memories of Carnivore . There are two tracks that move in at 10 plus minutes ( Profit of Doom , and These Three Things ) . These tracks have about 3 - 4 tempo changes each and would make for great live tracks . Halloween in Heaven , Dead Again , and Some Stupid Tomorrow will likely be good candidates for singles to push radio play of the group , being the shorter tracks on the album . Finally , the track September Sun is a close second for my favorite track , a slow burner that is ballad like in only a haunting type o negative way . The album is mixed brilliantly , just a great venture for these guys . Buy this album , good intro to the band , and a must for fans . FYI : for those of you curious about the 5 live tracks available at a large retail store , The CD clocks in at around 44 minutes , and has the tracks Everything Dies\/ My Girlfriends Girlfriend , Are you Afraid \/ Gravitational Constant , Christian Women , Love you to Death , and Black Number One .

I 'm not literally a code monkey , but there 's not doubt that I 'm a nerd , the proverbial nice - guy who comes in last and ca n't get the pretty receptionist to pay any attention to me , who works hard in a job that 's boring and unappreciated . Goodness , I even like to drink Tab and eat Fritos . I 'm not the only person like this . So , I just love it for being a good song acknowledging my experience of the world , while being funny and hopeful , too . It 's a great song that I 've found myself passing along to my nerd friends who love it , too .","summary":"A Nerd Anthem by the Nerd Minstrel","unixReviewTime":1307404800,"image":null}

I couln't believe it ! After 43 \n years this rockabilly star from the heydays of Rock & Roll sat there \n and sang a wonderful country song called \" My first taste of Texas \" . I immediately consulted all Billboard books and found out that he \n turned to country in 1967 and had built up quite a carreer until 1987 . The next step was to look at Amazon 's music chapter and there were \n several CD 's available being this one the chosen one because of the \n previous mentioned \" My first taste of Texas \" .

I borrowed this album from my local library and to be honest I had never heard of this singer \/ musician before . Ms Wainwright is an accomplished vocalist and a very good lyricist . However , her lyrics can become a bit meandering at times and she seems to happy singing about subjects that just go on and on . At times I have really no idea what she is singing about at all but it sure sounds beautiful . The production value on this album is outstanding and the sound is crisp . The book - let is a mixed bag and the photo on the cover is terrible and looks like it has been taken by some high - school kid or shot with a cheap instant camera . The font is easy on the eye and the lyrics are therefore easy to read .

There are occasions , however , when I buy a CD and it really grabs a hold of me . On these rare occasions , I become engrossed , almost addicted to the album . Because of who her family is , it would be easy to immediately dismiss her as \" the sister of Rufas , \" or \" the daughter of Louden and Kate McGarrigle . \" This would be a mistake , because Martha Wainwright 's music is distinctly unique and she is a huge talent in her own right . Her voice is gorgeous , but not in a traditional sense . Her voice has a soulful , high - pitched , eerie beauty , like nothing I 've ever heard before . In her delivery , there is a real sense of emotion and feeling that really connects with the listener . With most albums , when you are done listening , you are done . When you are finished with Martha Wainwright 's album , you feel as though you had just been visited by a presence , and that feeling stays with you , long after the CD has ended . From the opening \" Far Away \" , the listener is immediately swept into the CD . This song is subtle , building up ever so slightly , and is slightly underwhelming , which gives the song the perfect effect . The hauntingly beautiful background vocals add a nice touch . The more upbeat \" G.P.T. \" has an infectious , singsong verse before going into its ' soulful chorus . The bluesy morose \" Factory \" shows a more vulnerable side to Martha Wainwright . \" These Flowers \" has a kind - of a dream - like lullaby atmosphere . \" Ball and Chain , \" ( not a cover of the classic Janis Joplin song ) sounds somewhat Janis - Joplin like . It is here that Wainwright lets down all restraints and finally lets all that had been building up inside her explode . \" Why does this always happen ? \" she yells , demanding an answer , yet knowing none will come . The album comes back to earth with the beautiful \" Do n't forget \" a song about lost love . These types of songs are so clich , ' but Wainwright sounds so sincere , and this song feels so lived in , that it 's impossible not to be moved . The tongue - in - cheek \" This Life , \" tries to answer the question of whether the monotony of life in general is worth living . The light percussion over the subtle strumming of the acoustic strings creates the perfect backdrop for the song . Although it is asked whether or not suicide is the answer , this seemingly heavy - handed topic does not emotionally drain the listener the way an Alice In Chains song might . It 's as though these suicidal ideas are just passing thoughts , not to be taken seriously . The catchy mid - paced \" When the day is Short , \" keeps the momentum going . The brutally honest \" Bloody Mother F***ing A * * Hole \" is one of the album 's centerpieces . You 'd expect a song with a title like that to sound like Hole or Babes In Toyland , but that 's not the case at all . This acoustic song starts out very subtle , building up angst as it rolls along , as though the hurt and resentment inside had been building up a long time and now is being vented out . But when Wainwright delivers the main lines \" you bloody mother f***ing A * * hole , \" she sounds more hurt than angry . \" I will not pretend , I will not put on a smile , I will not say I 'm alight for you , for you , whoever you are . \" In other words , she is taking a stand , against anyone who would try to supress her , or not let her be herself . The explicit content sounds especially powerful because it comes out of left field . It 's really unexpected . It 's not like an Eminem album where every - other word is f * * * this and f * * * that . The bluesy easy - going \" TV Show \" has an engrossing stream - like lyrical flow . There 's an array of strings in the background that are effective , yet subtle . The singsong \" Maker \" is enchanting , especially when the lush array of background vocals in the chorus kick in . The somber stripped - down acoustic \" Who was I kidding \" is heavyhearted , yet not overdone . The elegant piano balled \" Whiter I Must Wander \" is the perfect way to close out the album , ending on a whisper . Martha Wainwright 's debut is a truly wonderful listen , through and through . It 's brutally honest , yet not melodramatic , confident , yet never cocky . Martha Wainwright is an amazing and very promising talent . One of the best CDs of 2005 .","summary":"One of the best CDs of 2005","unixReviewTime":1116633600,"image":null}

Other victories include \" This Life \" and \" G.P.T. \" Although the album 's resilience is that of a purely melodic and lyrical sense , Martha Wainwright is without palpable singles . Nonetheless , this coffee shop favorite is not set to whither away , with both her parent 's fan base and her brother 's loyal followers to aid her . The code , here , is not hard to crack , however , it takes time for Wainwright 's vocal stretching and folkie approach to latch on , much like her bother 's latest Want Two .","summary":"Family of geniuses","unixReviewTime":1116547200,"image":null}

Upon listening it becomes clear very quickly she has not only the voice but also the songs to back up this confidence . If I did n't know any better , I 'd have just as easily guessed this was from 1978 than 2005 , sharing as it does a real kinship in sound to ( then ) emerging singers like Chrissie Hynde , Debbie Harry and in particular Kate Bush . Like Bush 's debut ' The Kick Inside ' , arrangements here swoon and soar , choruses surprise and there 's an almost frightening level of intensity at times , which makes for riveting listening throughout . It 's also an album that 's unafraid to tackle difficult subject matter , though for me , much of it is simply about attempting to transcend life 's limitations . After all that verbosity , all you really need to know is this is a beautiful collection of songs by a striking new artist - and if you like her brother Rufus , then odds are you 'll like Martha Wainwright too .","summary":"Strong first outing","unixReviewTime":1116288000,"image":null}

You will play this one again and again . This hauntingly beautiful CD reminded me once again that most of the so - called music coming out of Nashville today masquerading as \" country \" and\/or \" bluegrass \" is pure ( junk ) . No tight jeans and cowboy hats here . Just first class music . The pickers play a lot of older songs : \" What Would You Give In Exchange For Your Soul , \" \" Who Will Sing For Me , \" \" Soldier 's Joy , \" \" The Storms Are On The Ocean , \" \" Foggy Mountain Top , \" \" Roll In My Sweet Baby 's Arms . \" These men are as good as pickers get . Having Alison Krauss join them on some of the cuts only makes this CD better . Difficult as it is to pick a favorite , I would probably vote for \" Down In The Valley To Pray . \" Doc Watson begins this hymn , as simple and pure as your grandmother 's pound cake , and is then joined by the voices of Skaggs and Scruggs , along with Krauss , in an a capella arrangement that will send chills down your spine .

L. Burnside 's A Troubled Mind ( one of the two best I bought from Fat Possum records --the other was Robert Balfour ) , and this album . In other words , I bought three outstanding albums , all at the same time . So which one do I listen to most often ? I 've been a fan of Earl Scruggs for a long time . His albums with Lester Flatt are incomparable . They 're the only blue grass albums that compare to jazz in my opinion , like listening to early Louis Armstrong . I like Ricky Skraggs , mostly for his background work on the Evangeline album , by Emmy Lou Harris . ( I do n't greatly like the one album I bought by Ricky with his own group . ) I know that Doc Watson is a giant and I love his voice and manner but I 've never spent time listening to him , principally because C&W and folk are n't my first thing . I 've spent fifty - five years listening to jazz first and classical music second . It 's not that easy changing gears . I bought this album first because Earl Scruggs was on it , second because Ricky and Doc are premiere players , and lastly because it looked pure and unadulterated , just world class performers playing together for fun . All three pickers are in good form . They are having fun . It 's clear they like being together . All of the songs they play are good , some wondrous . I like the cuts with Ricky Scraggs ' group least , those with the three of the pickers and with Doc and his son most . Doc Watson has a beautiful tenor - baritone voice ; he plays fine guitar both in background and solo . Earl Scruggs still plays with the fire and passion he had thirty - five years ago . What technical control he has ! Ricky Scraggs is a first rate instrumentalist and very good in ensemble singing , but less successful as a solo vocalist . I wish I liked Ricky 's group better --it 's good but the cuts with the other groups are better . Alison Krause is on some cuts but does n't have much to do . I usually do n't like chatter on a music record but here it fits . The love --for the music they are playing and among the three men themselves -- is transparent . It adds a warm glow to an exceptional record .","summary":"No Matter How You Classify It, It's Just Good Music","unixReviewTime":1122768000,"image":null}

It was released in 1998,but is really Folk Music of the 60 's , all of it written by the person who was the central figure of the Folk Music scene at the height of its popularity . It was the music that represented the thoughts , experiences , hopes , fears , dreams , heartbreaks , protests and just about everything that the music scene portrayed during the sixties . However , anyone familiar with this music is in for a big surprise and treat when they listen to this album . While everything , all 39 recordings , are from Seeger , all but one,\"And Still I 'm Searching \" are other artist 's interpreting Seeger 's songs . It will be a great surprise for you , as it certainly was for me , to hear these artists singing Seeger 's songs . Also , you will find many songs in this collection that will probably be totally new , or at least somewhat forgotten . There are songs that have become so familiar to long time Folkies as well as mainstream listeners , that when done by others will , to use an old expression,\"knock your socks off \" . Just to captivate your curiosity , can you imagine : \n   Jackson Browne & Bonnie Raitt singing \" Kisses Sweeter Than Wine \" \n   Bruce Cockburn singing \" Turn , Turn , Turn \" \n   Nanci Griffith and Friends singing \" If I Had A Hammer \" \n   Bruce Springsteen singing \" We Shall Overcome \" \n   Studs Terkel doing \" Blessed Be The Nation \" or \" Oh , Sacred World \" And what would a Folk Music collection be without \n Peter , Paul & Mary , The Weavers and \" Wimoweh\",Odetta and \" One Grain Of Sand \" \n  Then to wrap it all up , Pete tells us what his long journey in Folk Music has been all about with \" And Still I 'm Searching . If you are a Folk Music fan , or a fan of American Music heritage;you'll treasure this collection .

For me , I loved Studs   Terkel reading \" Blessed Be the Nation , \" Jackson Browne \/ Bonnie   Raitt singing , \" Kisses Sweeter than Wine , \" and the deeply   haunting \" My Father 's Mansion \" as sung by Billy Bragg and Eliza   Carthy in a celtic flavor . Hearing Donovan 's version of \" My Rainbow   Race \" was refreshing , and Dick Gaughan 's dramatic rendering of   \" Waist Deep in the Big Muddy \" knocked my socks off . Surprising me   was Tim Robbins ' \" All My Children of the Sun . \" So he can sing ,   too ? Amazing . \n\n Listen to Greg Brown singing \" Sailing Down My Golden   River . \" He has a Johnny Cash thing going on when he sings it , do n't   you think ? Very cool .

Blige - Growing Pains ( Geffen , 2007 ) Whenever you release a big album ( be it classic , certified platinum or both ) , expectations are always gon na be high for your follow - up . How do you exactly follow an album like Mary J. Blige 's 2005 hit,&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/The - Breakthrough \/ dp \/ B000BNTM32 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a > ? Well , she must not have worried about it , as Growing Pains is another great album . Although her first single , \" Just Fine \" , was n't exactly the smash that \" Be Without You \" was , it showed her on a more fun and upbeat track than usual . But for everyone who says that she sounds best on tracks about drama , \" Hurt Again \" and \" Talk to Me \" are right up your alley . The only problem is that after 16 years of albums , some of these topics can start to sound redundant . That 's why that tracks like the NE - YO \/ StarGate - produced \" Fade Away \" and \" Come to Me ( Peace ) \" are a nice change of pace . Even the duet with Usher , \" Shake Down \" , while only a fair song , adds a little bit of love into the mix . You can still rely on Mary J. Blige to deliver that great R&B in a time where R&B is losing the battle with hip - hop and country music as the leading genres . The only question is how Mary will follow up this album .","summary":"Jason and Maggie ain't got nothing on this","unixReviewTime":1218412800,"image":null}

The rest of CD is good as well , but this song is her , Be Without You , on this CD . I look forward to seeing how it gets mixed at the clubs , I did n't think they could improve Be Without You , but the Blanco version would wake up the dead , so i m hoping he does a mix of this as well . Ms. Blige puts so much of herself into her music , you feel her power and the feeling that yeah , I may be rich now , but i did n't forget where I came from , and i m still a work in progress ; I love that about her , she is no sale out .

After so many years it 's just nice to still have Mary in the \" game \" putting out good music . Overall I love this album and have already put quite a few songs on repeat . I love the album cover & rear cover art with Mary lounging on a classic vinyl collection and I love how each song melds into the next one . I got the copy with the bonus dvd and while I did n't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the disc included with her LOVE & LIFE cd , I still enjoyed hearing Mary speak about the album 's concept and what each track meant to her during the recording of the album . My favorite tracks are :   JUST FINE - great lead off single , it got me hyped about the album 's release \n\n IF U LOVE ME ? - produced by Bryan Michael Cox and although his songs are becoming easily identifiable with the pretty piano riffs , this is still a uniquely \" Mary joint \" \n\n FEEL LIKE A WOMAN , STAY DOWN , HURT AGAIN , SHAKE DOWN ( great duet with Usher ) , SMOKE , COME TO ME ( PEACE ) , TILL THE MORNING ( love the beats & musical production ) & FADE AWAY - very moving song , the lyrics made me cry & Mary sounds terrific ! Overall , this is a strong collection of songs , Mary sounds great and I 'd recommend it to any any fan whether you 're a Mary - newbie or a long - timer .","summary":"Growing Pains","unixReviewTime":1205452800,"image":null}

Throughout this album , we can hear Mary pushing herself in ways she never has : especially vocally . There are jazzy inflections , girl group coquettishness , nuanced phrasing : a full range of tones and textures .

Blige returns with her eighth studio album , \" Growing pains \" . I 've been a fan of hers ever since she burst onto the scene singing about \" Real love \" . Sixteen years later , she 's still as strong as ever ; \" Growing pains \" became her fourth US chart topping album and has sold over a million so far . It 's the latest instalment in a musical journey , which intentionally or not has chronicled the state of her life at the time of each release . This is no different . Very much in love ( with her husband and with herself ) , the songs reflect this . From lead - off single , the upbeat joyous hand - clap filled \" Just fine \" where she states she 's just that , thank you ( from the same team that gave Rihanna her chart \" raining \" hit \" Umbrella \" ) , opening cut \" Work that \" ( a song of female self belief \/ assertion no matter what you look like , lovely song ) , the more sparse guitar driven \" Grown woman \" ( with Ludacris ) , There is a bit to dance to . \" Roses \" is an angry mid tempo song with unsettling beats ( where you would n't want to mess with her ; she 's having one of them days ) , and closing cut \" Come to me ( peace ) \" is a lovely song with a hypnotic throbbing bassline and a pop feel ( Love it ! ) . For ballads , we have just about everything else , with lyrics dealing with unabashed love ,   or vulnerability ; \" Shake down \" ( a duet with Usher ) , \" Feel like a woman \" , \" Stay down \" , \" Hurt again \" ( lovely harmonies ) , the string swathed \" What love is \" , \" Work in progress ( growing pains ) \" ( with autobiographical lyrics , the title says it all ) , \" Talk to me \" ( where she 's trying to rekindle conversation in the relationship ) , the piano sprinkled \" If you love me \" , and the pseudo jazz feel of \" Smoke \" ( with a slightly off kilter beat ) . My favourite cut is her song about wanting to get away from it all when things get tough ; \" Fade away \" , a dreamy plodding mid - tempo number ( a bit like \" Everything \" from \" Share my world \" ) with soothing harmonies . It 's like sailing on a calm sea . Outstanding ! Mary has been on an upward tangent ever since the day she appeared on the scene , a tangent that shows no sign of dipping any day soon .","summary":"Growing in leaps and bounds...","unixReviewTime":1202860800,"image":null}

And the duo with Usher really demonstrates how well they both have mastered their craft . I truly enjoyed this even much more than the Breakthrough which I felt was more experimental taking many directions , probably in an effort to gain universal appeal but I thought it was just a tad too complex , but   not Growing Pains sets one mood & vibe and does not deviate . Each track simply builds upon the other . The title is befitting as well , especially the reference to Growing . She has definately Grown and she has I as she has stated she has experienced some Pain . Much love to Mary and her dedication to her music .

Blige continues to bring it on practically every album she releases these days . And Growing Pains is no different . She busts out with the highly energetic and super sassy \" Work That \" to lead off the album . Then , like a well - produced mixtape , it seamlessly segues to the equally groove - happy \" Grown Woman \" featuring a decent rap from Ludacris . We are then delighted with the first single \" Just Fine , \" a simple ditty with a happy - go - lucky Mary expressing herself like only she can . \" Feel Like A Woman \" is a slower cut that basically tells men to treat her like a lady . \" Stay Down \" is a more serious track about pushing on through the tough times and not giving up so easily . Those same sentiments are reverberated on the songs \" Talk To Me \" and \" If You Love Me . \" \" Hurt Again \" is a smooth track that discusses the inner battle between being in love and not setting yourself up for a broken heart ... yet again . Usher has the album 's only other cameo appearance for the straightforward \" Shake Down . \" \" Till The Morning \" has an old school bounce to it , with lyrics from Mary to match . \" Roses \" is one of Mary 's most powerful songs of recent memory , essentially saying that it takes more than just the little things to make a relationship work . \" Fade Away \" speaks about losing a love and having trouble facing the world again and moving on with all the heartache consuming your spirit . \" What Love Is \" is a very deep and analytical song about the different emotions and moods that truthfully depends on your current status with love . \" Work In Progress ( Growing Pains ) \" is a self - explanatory track about Mary still being just as imperfect as the next person . Mary gets a little abstract with the simple yet cryptic track \" Smoke , \" leaving room for the listener to draw their own conclusions on what she 's really talking about . The subdued power ballad \" Come To Me ( Peace ) \" closes out the album on a positive note . Growing Pains is definitely closer to her classic material even though it does n't quite reach those heights on it 's own . Nevertheless , MJB brings us another solid effort to enjoy until the next album comes out . And with a formula that is obviously working , Mary J. Blige will certainly bring it once again .","summary":"No Pain.....No Gain!","unixReviewTime":1200614400,"image":null}

Highsmith","reviewText":"I instantly became a fan of Mary J. Blige once I heard the song \" You Remind Me \" . Her debut CD&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/What - s - the-411 \/ dp \/ B000002OME \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">What 's the 411?<\/a>&nbsp;was an instant favorite of mine because of the way that Mary mixed r&b songs with hip hop samples . Obviously , the direction of the production had something to do with that but since I am also a rap music fan , I was able to appreciate Mary J. Blige even more . My favorite tracks ended up being \" Love No Limit \" , \" Reminisce \" , \" I Do n't Want To Do Anything \" w \/ K - Ci , \" My Love \" , \" Real Love \" and Mary 's remake of the Rufus & Chaka Khan classic \" Sweet Thing \" . In 1994 , Mary J. Blige released her 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/My - Life \/ dp \/ B000002OU8 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">My Life<\/a > . This is clearly my favorite r&b CD of all time . Mary not only surpassed my expectations after her debut CD , but she definitely had gained a fan for life as she did her best to chronicle the good times , the pain and everything inbetween to put together a fantastic CD . My favorite track was \" I Never Wanna Live Without You \" but I could play the CD in its entirety . My other personal favorites include \" Mary 's Joint \" , \" I 'm The Only Woman \" , \" Be Happy \" , \" Mary Jane \" and \" Be With You \" . The alternate versions of the tracks were phenominal as well . I am sure everyone remembers Smif N Wessun on \" I Love You \" , LL Cool J on \" Mary Jane \" , and the late Notorious BIG ( Biggie ) ripping the \" I 'm Goin' Down \" ( Remix ) ) which used the beat for the track \" The What \" that was featured on Biggie 's \" Ready To Die \" that also included Method Man . Mary J had plenty of other releases : \n\n < a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Share - My - World \/ dp \/ B000002P64 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Share My World<\/a>&nbsp;(1997 ) < a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Mary \/ dp \/ B00000JWQH \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Mary<\/a>&nbsp;(1999 ) \n < a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/No - More - Drama \/ dp \/ B00005V9DW \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">No More Drama<\/a>&nbsp;(2002 ) < a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Love - Life \/ dp \/ B0000AQS8W \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Love & Life<\/a>&nbsp;(2003 ) \n\n From these 4 releases you had my personal favorites such as \" Seven Days \" , \" All That I Can Say \" , \" The Love I Never Had \" , \" Special Part Of Me \" , \" Ooh ! \" , \" Everything \" and \" Share My World \" . Mary J. returned in 2005 with&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/The - Breakthrough \/ dp \/ B000BNTM32 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a > . She enjoyed tremendous success with her 1st single \" Be Without You \" . \" Darkchild \" blessed her with my favorite track , \" Enough Cryin ' \" and my other favorites included \" I Found My Everything \" , \" Take Me As I Am \" , \" No One Will Do \" and \" Father In You \" . Mary 's record company got a little greedy with&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Reflections - A - Retrospective \/ dp \/ B000JU8HHE \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Reflections - A Retrospective<\/a > . The CD started off with 4 new tracks which included the single \" We Ride \" , the title track and \" King & Queen \" w \/ John Legend . Then Geffen tried to conduct a greatest hits CD with the rest of the CD which was a mere 11 tracks , with 2 of the tracks being songs that were never on her CDs but were quality collaborations with the remix to Method Man 's \" All I Need \" , that was featured on \" Tical \" and \" 911 \" w \/ Wyclef Jean . \" Growing Pains \" was released on December 18th , 2007 . The CD starts off with the uptempo \" Work That \" . Mary makes an uplifting anthem for the ladies that tells them to be happy with themselves and not to live everyday trying to please other people . Do your best to work with the best attributes that you have . Ludacris appears on \" Grown Woman \" to return the favor for Mary J. appearing on the track \" Runaway Love \" that was featured on Ludacris ' last release \" Release Therapy \" . In my opinion , \" Grown Woman \" is basically a continuation of \" Work That \" . You have to come to a point in your life where you are happy with yourself as a woman , mentally and physically . Mary J. has struggled with that fact for many years in her life and she is trying to be a positive example for ladies , young and old around the world . Luda does a decent job with his verse but he is trying to talk about some things that could be done with this woman instead of adding to the positivity that Mary is trying to bring to the track , with a touch of attitude . \" Just Fine \" is basically Growing Pains ' \" Family Affair \" . It does n't matter how the week at work was or what trials and tribulations that you went through during the course of the week , it 's Friday night and this beat comes on , go out and have a good time or just do the infamous 2 step like I do . \" Just Fine \" is a nice , uptempo feel good jam . \" Feel Like A Woman \"   has Mary talking to her man about making her feel appreciated as a woman . Whether it 's a shopping trip , making love to her through the night or just making a nice gesture , tonight she just wants to feel like a woman . The slow jam man , Bryan Michael Cox shows up to produce \" Stay Down \" , which is a thoughtful slow jam . No relationship is perfect . The relationship is enduring one of those down times and Mary is asking her man to try to keep putting up with these down times so that they can receive the greater award at the end . \" Hurt Again \" has Mary describing a situation where she is starting to have feelings for someone but she is hesitant in letting him know that because of all the times that she has been hurt in the past . \" Shake Down \" is tolerable but when you see Usher and Mary J. Blige on a track , you have huge expectations . Just like when you saw Usher and Alicia Keys on the track \" My Boo \" , you expect the artists to make the collaboration memorable . On \" Shake Down \" , it 's decent but nothing that you would expect when you have Mary and Usher on the same track . Pharrell does his best to try to take you back to the 80s on \" Til The Morning \" , but for the most part , unless you want to grab some old fashioned roller skates and go to the skating rink , this song wo n't work for most Mary J. Blige fans . On \" Roses \" , Mary has to get a point across to her man that she is fed up with all of the confrontations with her man and today she is not having it for any reason . I can definitely relate to this track . Men :   You 're in a no win situation when this day comes so let her vent and this type of day will go by faster and be much easier for you to handle ... lol \n\n Clearly , my favorite track on \" Growing Pains \" is \" Fade Away \" . Stargate , who has produced multilple Ne - Yo songs , Joe 's \" It 's Me \" , Chris Brown 's \" With You \" , Rihanna & Ne - Yo 's \" Hate That I Love You \" , Trey Songz ' \" Ca n't Help But Wait \" and most importantly to some people , Beyonce 's \" Irreplaceable \" , produce this memorable Mary J. track in \" Fade Away \" . Ne - Yo co - produces and writes the track as well . Mary finds herself at times , because of all of her troubles not even wanting to be here on Earth . That 's how bad times have gotten for her in the past . Although , her life is definitely much better than those times , she may still have moments where she feels like she did before irregardless of her success because of her past transgressions . Ne - Yo does an excellent job of reaching back so to speak in times in Mary 's past to capture these moments . Here 's the bridge : \" Could n't look myself in the mirror , asking myself how dumb could you be . \" \" Maybe everything would be much clearer , if no one could see me \" . Mary 's times in the past were so bad she did n't even want to me amongst the living at times . There were times when she just want to take herself out of this world and not even be here anymore . That 's where I feel the \" .... invinsibility would be great \" part comes from on the track . \" What Love Is \" is another memorable Mary , Stargate and Ne - Yo collaboration as Mary writes her rendition of what she feels the four letter word means just like Alicia Keys did on \" The Thing About Love \" from her \" As I Am \" CD . The effects at the end of the track add to the track as well . \" Work In Progress \" ( Growing Pains ) is also written by Ne - Yo as Mary walks you through how she is getting through life day by day the best she can . She is clearly trying her best , but she also wants to let women in the world know that she is just as human as they are despite her success . \" Talk To Me \" deals with Mary wanting to receive better communication from her man and the benefits of effective communication in a relationship . \" If You Love Me \" is a decent track but it sounds too much like \" Be Without You \" Part 2 to me . \" Smoke \" is clearly unlike any Mary J. Blige track that I have ever heard . This track seems to be a part of Mary J. 's musical maturity . You never would have heard Mary on a track like this in the What 's The 411 and My Life days . As a matter of fact , she would have had a profanity laced tirade ready for Puffy if he even tried to bring her a track like this . In the end , it clearly works for me and it 's nice to see Mary trying different things . \" Come To Me ( Peace ) \" ends \" Growing Pains \" on a good note as she is trying to win over the affection of a lost love from the past . Overall , \" Growing Pains \" may not be Mary J. Blige 's best CD , but if you look at her career since 1992 's \" What 's The 411 \" to now , you see alot of progression in her music and lyrics in 2007 . Not only do you see a growth process with Mary as a 37 year old woman but you also hear the growth process through her lyrics and her production . If you are a fan of the majority of Mary J 's releases , then you should also add \" Growing Pains \" to your collection .

You can now listen to her latest cds without skipping over tracks that interrupt the flow . Aside from \" What 's the 411 \" and \" My Life \" , her albums were littered with junk that were just plain unlistenable . Of course every mary J. Blige album has at least a couple of good songs on it , but \" Breakthru \" and \" Growing Pains \" are a complete journey you can play from start to finish . I do n't really like the title of the album though , \" Growing Pains \" reminds me too much of the old 80 's tv show and it sounds too harsh like \" groin pains \" . I love the cover of the cd . I love Mary 's pose , it looks retro and Egyptian and she 's also laying on a bunch of records which is great for me becuz As for the songs on the cd , I love \" Work That \" , I could listen to this song a million times , \" Just Fine \" , \" Roses \" , and \" Til The Mornin ' \" are other standouts for me . \" What Love Is \" and \" Fade Away \" are some of my all time faves from Mary J. \" Fade Away \" sounds a little alternative like Depeche Mode sounding , the background music is moody and deep . Towards the end of the cd , some of the songs go in that direction which is strange considering her R and B roots . It 's unique and groundbreaking , giving her music a fresh sound while remaining innovative . The only song which does n't do it for me is \" Grown Woman \" . It 's not exactly groundbreaking material , the rap thing is so dated and played out at this point . My favourite lyric on the album where Mary really hits you with it is on \" Roses \" . \" Sometimes I need a hug ! \" Who does n't .

Garrard","reviewText":"Most popular singers can attest to that one album that is considered by fans and critics alike as being their apex . Michael Jackson had \" Thriller , \" Prince had \" Purple Rain , \" and Mary J. had the multi - Grammy - winning \" The Breakthrough . \" It is unfair to the singers to always compare each successive release with its predecessor for the artists may have different directions and concepts that they wish to pursue . Mary J , though traveling some of the same roads as her previous works , branches out somewhat with \" Growing Pains \" with an album that is possibly more pop - oriented than anything that she has previously done , including \" The Breakthrough . \" \n\n \" Growing Pains \" is a bit of everything that will , no doubt , increase her already large fan base . Riding high on the strength of the first single \" Just Fine \" and its eye - popping video , the album is a well - crafted blend of R & B , funk , pop , and female angst and strength that can only be done by Miss Mary . EVERY single song is a winner and each makes a seamless segue to its successor . Besides that , she looks MIGHTY FINE on every photo in the liner notes ! We all should grow so well !","summary":"Not \"The Breakthrough\" but it shouldn't be expected to be!","unixReviewTime":1198540800,"image":null}

She knows what her audience likes and why fix something that is not broken . She delivers and does it with 110 % on ` Growing Pains ' . Every song on here is a stand out that it 's hard to single out any song . There is everything from classic slow Mary jams to the upbeat dance tracks to songs with a rock twinge fused into them . My favorites on here include : \n \" Work That \" which has a great beat to it and promotes a good motto - to be yourself ! \" Roses \" is THE cut ! ! WOW ! Great melody , great lyrics and amazing vocals ! \n \" Work In Progress ( Growing Pains \" is a song that we can all relate to . Very good \n\n I think the biggest appeal of MJB is that she is very relatable . She sings from the heart and it feels like every song was written for us ; the listeners . She is your neighbor , your friend , your sister . Mary deserves every bit of success she gets and this CD is living proof of that ! Amazing ! !","summary":"MJB the MVP","unixReviewTime":1198022400,"image":null}

I mean , most of the songs are ballads , and he does not improve upon the originals . I liked this album , but that 's about it . I do not understand why Rick chose to remake songs almost identical to their originals . I really did not enjoy his version of The Dream Academy 's \" Life In A Northern Town \" or Foreigner 's \" Waiting For A Girl Like You \" . I did not understand why he got Richard Page of Mr. Mister to redo \" Broken Wings \" . I mean , why get the vocalist of the song to do the song again ? His version of Human League 's \" Human \" also failed . However , there was something likeable about his version of The Church 's \" Under The Milky Way \" and John Lennon 's \" Imagine \" . The only original song , \" Cry \" , can not hold a candle to the other classics on the disc . Why is that Rick would do an album of covers not even two years after releasing his first album of original material in five years ? All I can say is that I am glad he got this out of the way so he can move on to better things .","summary":"You,Too, Can Have Rick Sing At Your Wedding.","unixReviewTime":1121385600,"image":null}

Walsh","reviewText":"I agree with the reviewer who says he buys every release Rick does ... I am the same way , as are most diehard Rick fans . That said , just because I am a diehard does nt mean I will like everything Rick does ( not saying all diehards blindly love everything he does , but MANY do ) . Rick is one of my all time favorite songwriters ... I have no reason to be lackluster in any review unless it is how I really feel ... This is not a bad release . Unfortunately , its not a good release either . It 's a solid \" ho hum \" . It 's main problem is it and its songs is generally boring . The songs are either slow or most are lacking in emotion . Most are also very close to the originals in arrangement but a lesser finished product ... in the way you hear when some studio band cranks out the top 40 hits \" as performed by _ _ _ _ \" that you used to see for $ 1.99 at department stores . For me , it makes me think of the originals and why I like them better . Broken Wings and Waiting For A Girl Like You are great songs originally ... but they sound very similar here and in the case of WFAGLY , it was simply BETTER , with Lou Gramm singing it . Unfortunately , there is not one cover here that I think is an improvement upon the original ... ( unlike how Rick made \" I 've Done Everything For You \" and a few other covers through his career so much better than their originals ) . Few here even get me remotely excited . Here , the standout covers are Human and Baker Street ( which is a lighter more heartfelt version than the one put out a few years ago by Foo Fighters ) . The whole album is so lacking in intensity . I know he intentionally chose songs that are mellow , but I just do n't think that was wise and it makes for a release that is easy to file in your collection and forget . There is n't any cover song except Baker Street that makes me want to hear it again . Rick is a master of intensity in the right places ... Shock Denial Anger Acceptance seemed to reiterate that point both to Rick and to the fans . Had he done a cover CD with some more rocking tunes mixed in , I think it might have been at least more interesting if not downright good ... this one just is n't and I can only hope this has n't kept him from working on new songs for the next real CD . The one gem on this release is Rick 's own song Cry , and that alone really makes it worth something to the diehards ( in addition to the fact that diehards will buy anything he does anyway ) . It is a very good song that is emotional and has some great vocals upon it . I find it only adds to my wish that Rick would have spent this time recording his own work than doing this ! Unless you have all other Rick albums already , you are better off putting your money into them than this album . Especially be sure you have Shock Denial Anger Acceptance , Living In Oz , or Working Class Dog before even considering this one ... those are Rick at his best . ( Again , this is n't a bad CD ... but Rick 's real work is so superior and an average release for Rick is n't indicative of his abilities . I 'd hate to see someone buy this as their introduction to Rick and come away thinking he is n't all that good . )","summary":"One for the diehards","unixReviewTime":1121299200,"image":null}

THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is , unfortunately , a largely bland effort . Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker ( there are some excellent guitar riffs in here ) , but his voice has gotten worse ( worked well on SDAA , but a raspy , spoken - voiced version of \" Imagine \" ? Therefore , this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans , nor please his old ones ( especially since it 's a cover album , and he has only one original on here that does n't measure up to his usual songwriting standards ) . The main flaw of the record is this : Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit \" Human Touch . \" In fact , this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record , with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory . And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality , and while a few of his performances shine ( \" Life In A Northern Town \" and \" Miss You Nights \" specifically ) , THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let - down . Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield , if not in his finest vocal form , at least writing his own tunes again , and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits , or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA .","summary":"One of our favorite rockers goes easy listening","unixReviewTime":1123113600,"image":null}

For me personally , this is a very special song that has so much truth to it . I downloaded the words to this song from AZLyrics.com before I purchased this song from Amazon and so glad that I had all of the lyrics . Then my volunteer group went to a Senior Center and sang this song to the participants . And since there are so many kinds of love and because love is so important , this song says it all : : \n\n The song speaks of whispering love yet so loudly so that every heart will understand that love and only love joins man . And it goes on to say when we stand together , it is our finest hour -- we can do anything we set our minds to do because it is love that gives us power . This song is so inspiring to me and gives me hope and joy when I listen to it . And it keeps me so reminded that love is really all that matters at the end of the day .

Fowler","reviewText":"From what I gather about Jeanne Robertson , she does n't consider herself a \" stand - up comic \" so much as \" public speaker , \" but make no mistake about it - she is as funny as anyone in the business . She comes from a little corner of North Carolina , and if Mayberry actually existed , you would n't have difficulty imagining that her home must be just up the road a spell from Andy and Barney . I recently had my first exposure to the Sirius radio network , and tracks from this \" Flat - Out Funny \" recording were prominently rotated between Bill Cosby and Jeff Foxworthy . It is no faint praise to say that Jeanne Robertson is as funny as any of them . Her stories are full of wry and hilarious insights into the human condition , and it appears that any obstacle in her life simply becomes \" new material \" . This also seems to mean that anyone in her life is \" fair game \" for inclusion in her routines . We hear many details about her husband , Jerry \" Leftbrain \" , including his hesitation to accompany her on a near - disastrous eight - day rafting trip through the grand canyon , which included recreational opportunities such as hanging precariously from the side of a cliff , using AARP - vintage hands that at home would have difficulty opening a jar in the kitchen . This recording is an absolute obvious choice for that person or family or group who wants to hear \" flat - out funny \" comedy that is suitable for all ears , but the truth is that she is also as funny as the comedians who use the full spectrum of language . Flat - Out recommended .","summary":"Where has she BEEN all my life!","unixReviewTime":1246838400,"image":null}

With that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this , or . I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool , but make little sense when it comes to music . Music is a personal thing . It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself . Granted it is only a 30 second sample , but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music , or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version . If you want to listen to a sample , simply hover over the track you are interested in , and press the play button . I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon . That s right ! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums . A great way to construct an entire music library , and admittedly , the way I obtained most of my own music . But quite honestly , a wonderful way to explore new music , too . In fact , some of the songs that I ve obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band , and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag . Anyway ... enough of my rambling . This song is great ! At the very least , give it a 30 - second listen ? \n\n And do n't forget , if you are in the market for freebies , you can always check here \n\n FREE MUSIC : \n From Amazon Home page -- > Shop by Department -- > ( Digital and Prime Music ) Deals -- > Songs by Price ( on left side of screen)--- > Free","summary":"5 stars!","unixReviewTime":1452556800,"image":null}

We do n't take the time , as Jeanne has done , to actually NOTICE the things that are funny in the world . Like the absolute greatest masters of the comedic form , Mrs. Robertson does n't \" make up stuff \" or \" tell jokes \" . She simply lets us take a glimpse at the world at she sees it . She holds a mirror up to life and finds hilarious that which is looking back . She has several funny , FUNNY recordings which you can get as audio or DVD recordings , but \" Southern Style \" is easily in her top 2 or 3 and includes perhaps her most famous story of all : \" Left Brain 's Grocery List \" could stand toe to toe with Bill Cosby 's \" Noah \" or Richard Pryor 's \" Mudbone \" or Andy Griffith 's \" What it was , was Football \" . Mrs. Robertson 's husband is named Jerry , but she calls him \" Left Brain \" and if you do n't understand that , as she says , you may be one too ... Jeanne has been drafted into making several of her famous 7 - up pound cakes , and needs to dispatch Jerry to the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients . You 'll just have to hear the results , but as the tears roll down your cheeks with laughter the part of your soul that recognizes the truthfulness of things will know there is a little Left Brain in most of us . Thank Heaven for BOTH of the Robertsons and for Jeanne 's gift for sharing her magnificently cultivated sense of humor .

Their bright , sweet choral harmonies are enough to capture any listener 's attention . This was one of the bands that I had grown up with alongside Madonna , The Go Go 's , and other 80 's artists . After three albums of mega smash after smash , they unfortunately imploded and took a 13 year absence . Susanna Hoffs would create 2 solo albums , and Vicki \/ Debbi Peterson would create their own records under the pseudonym Continental Drifters . So once they reunited in 2003 and released this then - new LP , it was as if The Bangles had never left . Although their voices sounded a bit older , so has their sound matured . This CD starts off with a fiery one - two punch of the title track sung by Susanna . Other songs would be very energetic as well -- Debbi 's \" Stealing Rosemary \" , Vicki 's \" Mixed Messages \" , and Michael Steele 's 2 very important songs ( and my personal favorites as well ):   \" Nickel Romeo \" and \" Between The Two \" . Check out the lyric \" a Cheshire Cat in yellow Beatle boots ... \" The only 2 songs I did not like were Susanna 's \" I Will Take Care Of You \" and Debbi 's \" Lost At Sea . \" But that is only from my personal taste and bears absolutely NO reflection on the band itself ! I was very saddened \/ disheartened when Michael Steele eventually left The Bangles permanently , before this decade even started . So , in other words , you wo n't hear any of her tracks on the band 's 2011 LP , \" Sweetheart Of The Sun . \" I am somehow okay with that , because in all fairness , each one of the four female members DO have a very unique , distinctive voice and incredible instrumental talent that attracted droves of fans in the first place . Other than Susanna 's recent 2012 solo release , \" Someday \" , I 'm still betting that The Bangles have some more songs left in them for the rest of this decade to follow ! !   :)","summary":"A fresh new sound after a 13 year absence.","unixReviewTime":1391040000,"image":null}

It 's been 15 years since they recorded an album together , and when I looked at the liner notes -- actually , there really are n't any , which makes you wonder if they just rushed into the studio to put this album out . Also , this album is on Koch Records , and Koch seems to be the place where everyone eventually ends up -- well , either there or TVT . All the other three - star reviews for this album are pretty accurate , and each person seems to have a different opinion of which song(s ) stands out . To me , the best song on here is the song they have out now , \" Something That You Said \" ( its video also appears on the bonus DVD ) . And \" Mixed Messages \" is pretty catchy despite the lyrical shortcomings . But the rest of the songs are n't that great . A lot of these songs really could have been written better . At times the lyrics go from lazy ( \" Ride the Ride \" , \" Ask Me No Questions \" ) to crazy ( Elvis Costello 's \" Tear Off Your Own Head \" ) . \" Grateful \" is tolerable , but it 's the kind of song you 'd expect to hear from them when they were still in their teens , not in their forties . And sorry , but the ballad \" I Will Take Care of You \" sounds like a watered - down version of \" Eternal Flame \" . People say a lot of the songs on here sound better live than they do on the album , and if that 's the case , then you should just see them in concert . Or else if you 're still feeling nostalgic about the Bangles , then just pull out their ` 80s albums or their Greatest Hits package .

What the Bangles have produced on Doll Revolution is a classic of the jangle - y genre . When a band takes a break of over a decade and then re - forms for a new project , there is always justifiable worry that the old magic ca n't be captured again . The Bangles proved an exception to the rule by producing the strongest work of their career on this long - awaited new album . Granted , not every tune on Doll Revolution is a solid gold gem , but there are at least ten well - turned songs on this record , which is about the most anyone can reasonably ask . If you liked the old Bangles , there is no reason you should n't be happy with the new Bangles . They can still rock , and sing beautifully produced and sincere love songs . If anything , their harmonies are sweeter and more perfect than ever . The recording does not have state - of - the - art clarity , which is a bit of a disappointment , but the fidelity is at least equivalent to their previous records from the eighties . There is one sour note , not in the music , but in the fact that if you want the lyrics , you wo n't get them in the booklet . They are found only on the limited edition DVD version -- on the DVD . So you are supposed to run to your DVD player every time you want to check out the song lyrics ? Not cool . The Bangles have shown that you * can * go home again . They recorded this album on their own terms , took their time , and carefully crafted something they could be proud of . And they should be proud . This is good stuff . It is n't revolutionary , despite the title . They sing of love , loss , confusion , frustration , and loneliness . They make it rhyme , and they make us tap our feet and smile .

I did not , however , expect it to exceed classics such as All Over The Place and Different Light , and it does n't , but the songs are as fresh as if hearing them for the first time ever . Wow !   Getting this prevented me from tearing off my own head , to paraphrase the leading song . Key=[lead vocalist ] \n After the phrase , \" One must tear off one 's own head , \" comes a quick burst of snarling punkish guitar and Susanna 's familiar sugary voice . I have n't heard the original Elvis Costello version , but they really jam on \" Tear Off Your Own Head ( Doll Revolution ) \" This opening number makes this yet another classic in the Bangles pantheon of hits . \" Stealing Rosemary \" is a simple song of a woman doing the title action for her man . Kidding . [ Debbi ] \n \" Something That You Said \" is another classic , with the solid Beatles \/ Byrds influence heard with the guitar and the harmony vocals . The drum machine in the background paints a modern addition . And Susanna 's voice never sounded so good ! \" Ask Me No Questions \" has rhythmic overtones of the Beatles \" Rain \" without the feedback guitar . The main chorus goes \" Oh , I 'm in love with you \/ But I turn away when you look in my eyes \/ Ask me no questions I 'll tell you no lies . \" [ Debbi ] \n \" Rain Song \" sung by Vicki is an upbeat guitar - oriented number where when it rains , she remembers her ex . And there 's a bitter taste with this line : \" I 'm doing fine as long as you stay locked up \/ Inside a cloud of grey \"   Whoa ! [ Vicki ] \n That 's quite a fancy dresser in \" Nickel Romeo \" , someone who 's described as \" a Cheshire cat in yellow Beatle boots \" . \" Strange desperation - you got ta cop that fix \/ Making every little girl is keeping you alive . \" That bad , huh ? [ Michael ] \n \" Ride The Ride \" has a similar beat but less ferocious than \" Doll Revolution \" . With signature guitar hooks , call it a close cousin to \" In Your Room \" [ all ] \n Just what I needed , another tender ballad to melt my heart , and my favourite song here . \" I Will Take Care Of You \" is an affirmative song of support from a loved one who will stand tall alongside through times of fear and sadness :   \" Smile , if you can now \/ Smile through your tears \/ Here where your fears are known\/ \n Know you 're safe at home . \" Magic ! [ Susanna , of course ! ] \n Guitar and soundwise , the upbeat \" Here Right Now \" sounds like Green - era R.E.M. and calls for one to slow down . \" Stand back and take a look around you \/ Running from the pressures of a restless world \/ Hush for a moment , baby , just be still \/ Here now.\/Spend a minute next to me . \" The woman in bittersweet \" Single By Choice \" is affirmative of the title , adding \" Never marry , never ever divorce \/ Listen to the solitary voice . \" Even though she gives bad experiences she had , sad , is n't it ? [ Vicki ] \n \" Lost At Sea \" details a couple who 's lost so far in arguments that it 's as if they are lost at sea . The solution :   \" Take my hand , come to me \/ Save a life , rescue you , rescue me . \"   Another Byrdsy song replete with harmonies . [ Vicki ] \n \" Song For A Good Son \" details a woman explaining to her son why she seems emotionally cold . She is scarred by the loss of her mother , taken by the ocean current . There are suicidal overtones : \" Waterside so deep and wide \/ If I follow , maybe I will find her . \" [ Michael ] \n \" Grateful \" is a lullaby to one 's young son , enhanced by chorus harmonies of \" All we are and all we need is \" while Susanna 's whispery sweet voice does lead . The bonus DVD contains \" A Day In The Life Of The Bangles \" mini - documentary , which basically explains how they felt about getting back together , story behind \" TOYOH \" , and their amazement at the large fan base they had , the \" Something That You Said \" video , audio and lyrics pages . All the familiar elements are there , Susanna 's sweet voice , the tight harmonies , the 60 's rock influenced sound , the brand of garage pop \/ rock hybrid . It 's as if they never broke up .

They are truly back in form , with the slickness factor turned way down from Everything ( though this is by no means All Over The Place , Volume 2 ) . I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters ' work on this album . I like Michael 's \" Nickel Romeo , \" but her other songs here do n't make much of an impression on me . Susanna sounds great as ever , but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads ( \" Something That You Said \" , \" I Will Take Care of You \" , \" Grateful \" ) . Not that these are n't great tracks , but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days . But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances , period , on \" Ask Me No Questions \" and \" Here Right Now , \" and Vicki sounds great on \" Single by Choice , \" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel 's \" I Am A Rock . \" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \" Mixed Messages \" ? As for \" The Rain Song , \" great stuff -- but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters ' arrangement better . If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan ! The ensemble vocals on \" Ride the Ride \" and \" Stealing Rosemary \" sound superb as well , and the instrumental playing is top - notch throughout . Vicki 's mandolin is a nice touch . My only criticism of this album is that it 's a bit long . Not all of these songs are essential -- I might have shortened Doll Revolution by dropping \" Lost at Sea , \" \" Song for a Good Son , \" and \" Between the Two . \" \n I understand some of these songs have been floating around for years -- indeed , some have been recorded and released before -- so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album , if there is one , can measure up to Doll Revolution .

Ettinger","reviewText":"I think it 's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd . Their last full one was 1989 's ' Everything ' . In my opinion it is hard for them to ever top their debut album ( not their EP ) . You had to figure U.S. record companies must have had similar thoughts since this disk has been released everywhere else since early 2003 . They still have decent songwriting abilities and continue to have great blended harmonies ( \" Stealing Rosemary \" ) . Both of these things are their saving grace . Each member has one very good song . Debbie Peterson has \" Here Right Now \" , which should have been the initial single . Susanna Hoffs has \" Something That You Said \" , which is the first single and would have been a great follow - up single selection . There are others that are certainly ok , just nothing outstanding . Even \" Ride the Ride \" is n't as good as the version I downloaded off the internet ( oops ) almost 2 years ago . Overall , Debbie Peterson and Michael Steele are the most consistent on this disk . Steele has always been under - utilized as a lead vocalist and songwriter . Nothing changes here . I 'm really liking her   \" Song For a Good Son \" . She 's at least got the most original material of the four - and always has . I always liked Vicki Peterson 's stuff , but it 's all just very bland on this disk ( \" Ask Me No Questions \" ) . Susanna Hoffs is astonishingly the weakest during this set ( except for the aforementioned ' Something That You Said \" ) . \" I Will Take Care of You \" is just downright lame . In my opinion , the album closer , ' Grateful ' , is possibly the worst song the Bangles have ever done . The chorus is one step away from a bad children 's chorale . And they did nothing special to cover the Elvis Costello title tune . Supposedly they are working towards a new release , since this has really been completed for a year . Let 's hope they get it together and deliver a stellar disk .","summary":"I SO Want to Like it Better","unixReviewTime":1064448000,"image":null}

I like Michael 's \" Nickel Romeo , \" but her other songs here do n't make much of an impression on me . Susannah sounds great as ever , but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads ( \" Something That You Said \" , \" I Will Take Care of You \" , \" Grateful \" ) . Not that these are n't great tracks , but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days -- for example , the two bonus tracks on this album , both sides of the Bangles ' first single . But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances , period , on \" Ask Me No Questions \" and \" Here Right Now , \" and Vicki sounds great on \" Single by Choice , \" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel 's \" I Am A Rock . \" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \" Mixed Messages \" ?

I have been waiting for this cd for two years , let alone the past decade for new music from them in general . Now that I have the cd in my hands , it was so well worth the money and wait for the cd to arrive in my mailbox . \" Doll Revolution \" did not fail to disappoint me . There really is n't an artist or band that harmonizes as well as The Bangles do . \" Doll Revolution \" is a great reminder how well Susanna , Vicky , Debbi , and Michael 's vocals sounds together . \" Mixed Messages \" is a great example the band 's abilities to harmonize . On the VH1 's \" Behind the Music \" episode on The Bangles , at the end the viewer was introduced to a sampling of \" Ride the Ride \" and \" Lost At Sea \" which are found on the cd , much to my delight . Overall , \" Doll Revolution \" is a mixture of \" All Over the Place \" and \" Everything \" , the raw production of \" All Over the Place \" with the sweet melodies of \" Everything \" . The best of both worlds if anything . Susanna , Vicky , Debbi , and Michael all sound as if the band never broke up in the late ' 80s . I loved every single song on the album . Not a single dud on the album . I sure hope it sees the light of day over on my side of the Atlantic . This is one cd I do n't want to see swept under the rug .","summary":"Well worth the wait and money","unixReviewTime":1050019200,"image":null}

The chord structures and heart - felt vocals arising up from the core of the lead singer 's being break through the barriers of that which we do not wish to acknowledge and allow us to recognize that pain , bringing it forth and at last allowing us to step forward in our inherent integrity and move on .

With that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this , or . I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool , but make little sense when it comes to music . Music is a personal thing . It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself . Granted it is only a 30 second sample , but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music , or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version . If you want to listen to a sample , simply hover over the track you are interested in , and press the play button . LYRICS : \n Some say love , it is a river \n That drowns the tender reed . Some say love , it is a razor \n That leaves your soul to bleed . Some say love , it is a hunger , \n An endless aching need . I say love , it is a flower , And you its only seed . It 's the heart afraid of breaking \n That never learns to dance . It 's the dream afraid of waking \n That never takes the chance . It 's the one who wo n't be taken , \n Who can not seem to give , \n And the soul afraid of dyin ' \n That never learns to live . When the night has been too lonely \n And the road has been too long , \n And you think that love is only \n For the lucky and the strong , \n Just remember in the winter \n Far beneath the bitter snows \n Lies the seed that with the sun 's love \n In the spring becomes the rose .","summary":"It is Bette Midler...what more do you need to know!?","unixReviewTime":1459555200,"image":null}

Hedges","reviewText":"\" Smoke on the Water , \" originally from the great Deep Purple album \" Machine Head , \" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat . Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple 's catalogue , the song chronicles an actual event . In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux , Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones . During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4 , a fan set off a flare gun , setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground . The flames and smoke drifted over the lake , while the members of Deep Purple watched . The band then had to scramble for a venue to record \" Machine Head \" in , and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel . The song is quite an accurate piece of history , and definitely one of the heaviest , most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded . The song has appeared in various versions ( the most amusing is from Pat Boone 's \" In a Metal Mood , \" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar ) on many albums . I recommend \" Machine Head , \" but the \" Best Hits \" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price . One thing 's certain , though : no musical library should be without this staple .","summary":"The Song Explaining Why Switzerland Is Now Less Tolerant Of Flare Guns","unixReviewTime":1271203200,"image":null}

How these three artisans could be together and managing to put so much praiseworthy music for even one single is difficult for me to fathom , I know this groups history , now , which really causes me to be amazed that they could sing together at all , but I am convinced that my road trip would not have seemed too short if not for this song and this 8 track tape . As bad as those players were I am still surprised at how this song \/ album \/ group continues to astonish me with their skill .

What he was referring to of course was the way Aretha Franklin had turned his song \" Respect \" into one of the biggest hits of the year . His version topped out at # 35 on the pop charts a couple of years earlier . Otis Redding was just beginning to hit his stride as summer turned to autumn in 1967 . This veteran performer had been around for a while . The fact is that up until this point he had made the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 19 times although his records usually ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the chart . His tunes fared much better on the Soul \/ R&B charts where 8 of them had made it into the Top Ten . It is really difficult to understand why the man had not had greater commercial success up until this point . After taking a few months off Otis Redding returned to the studio in early December 1967 . There he recorded a song he had co - written with Steve Cropper . Everyone thought it was a mistake . His wife hated it . Three days later Otis Redding was dead at 26 , a victim of a tragic plane crash in Wisconsin . And although I had been collecting records for about three years I had never heard of him . Despite his enormous talent Otis Redding had just not quite connected with general audiences . Less than two months later in January of 1968 , Volt records released that tune his wife and friends hated so much . \" ( Sitting On ) The Dock of the Bay \" went all the way to # 1 on the Pop charts and remained there for a month . Everyone now finally realized just how talented this man had been . An American classic .","summary":"Only then did people realize what a talented artist he was.","unixReviewTime":1465516800,"image":null}

Yet , he just has never been able to top one of his biggest songs from 2003 , You Raise Me Up . The song is definitely very uplifting , and shows a strength in the simplest voice that many artists just have n't been able to show in their brightest lights .

And while Groban does have a good voice ( it 's more of a very mature acquired taste ) , his songs are boring , and inspirational . This song also sounds like the producer was heavily involved making this , rather than the artist . And due to the undue success of this song from saps who need a little lifting up , the inspirational genre is now a big sappy industry . And what 's bad is , it has zero substance . Sure the lyrics , good gosh the lyrics , I mean , anybody can write these songs , but all the great ones do n't because it 's unoriginal . I mean if this song helps you , great . But for the rest of us that only care about great music , the song is only ok .

The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision . It opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3\/4 string \/ guitar progression accompanied by a 4\/4 drum pattern . It 's what makes the song so interesting , this confluence of different time streams . Keeps things slightly tipsy . Personally , I can not hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot , the song that precedes it on the album . It is a fleeting moment , but it 's there in my brain . My favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18 - 3:14 ; there is so much breathing room in it , Bonham 's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides . Very seductive . Kashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision , sections linking up with each other like clockwork . Nice flanging and phasing here and there , mostly on the drum flurries ; e.g. , 7:50 . Most fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV , but he ' messes up ' by playing Physical Graffiti instead . We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice . Well , maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door . So much has been written about this song , you can find many online treatises that analyze its brilliance . I prefer to let it all wash over me like an oasis in the desert .","summary":"DEC 4","unixReviewTime":1498262400,"image":null}

However , for reasons still escaping me , he went solo , and this song defines his solo work thus far . Now from what I 've said so far , you might say , this must be an awesome song , right ? Wrong . The problem with the majority of Thomas ' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar , the potential , the need and the want to soar , but like a Penguin , it stays on the ground . How this could be , I do n't know . Without the song taking off , it ends up a boring lazy mess , that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better . Overall , not a great song to say the least . It 's radio - friendly ( which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on ) , it 's poorly done , and most of all , it 's just flat - out boring .

And when I stopped and listened to the lyrics I was shocked at just how sad this song was ... and yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life but finding herself reliving it anyhow . It 's not a happy song ... yet Tracy Chapman sings it so beautifully . Her wistful voice is never overwrought or melodramatic , conveying just the right amount of emotion to fit the theme of the song . And the simple instrumentation keeps the song appropriately low - key . Sometimes a beautiful song is spoiled by being overproduced or oversung , and it was nice to see the singer and producers resist that temptation here . While a melancholy song , \" Fast Car \" is still lovely to listen to , and certainly more thoughtful than the endless parade of love songs that make up popular music nowadays .

My opinion \n\n I do n't really understand how one can objectively review a song . It 's entirely a matter of opinion , and a review of a song is basically pointless . I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs , especially when the review comes out before the album . But youtube exists now . It 's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think . You listen to the song , and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player ( or in better quality than youtube ) ... ( or if you want to support the artist ) , you buy the mp3 . I guess I 'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review ...

With a set of deviating deaths in R&B legends we 've lost this year with Natalie Cole , Maurice White of Earth , Wind & Fire , but honestly no death is more shocking and sad than the passing of Prince . The guy not only was brilliant , but his sound and song with R&B , funk , jazz and Rock is and will always transcend beyond boundaries in the way that David Bowie kept rolling with the tides years earlier . The guy really had so many memorable , that he had kept changing with time and everyone followed so deeply with the punches , and not bashing him at heart . When Doves Cry is one of his deepest songs from Purple Rain . The song still ignites aflame that can definitely showcase his sensuality in song , with a deep soul from his heart that really showed his sensitivity in song . There will never be a songwriter who was just as gifted , who died young .

With his marriage to Heidi Klum ending , and his albums not as strong as they used to be , he seems to be at a personal crossroads in his life . Nothing he has done in music has ever had the impact he made with Kiss From A Rose , from the Batman Forever soundtrack and off his second self - titled album . The song is still his biggest opus that is just as good today , as it was when it came out in 1994 . It definitely is a great download if you are new to Seal 's music , or if you want to hear what a real voice is like , and not something that is weighed down .

Well when \" Batman Forever \" was released , my three sons raved about this song . With the franchise changing Batmans like the four seasons , my sons like most kids were into it ( so was their mother ) . Seal 's range of vocal talent is very versatile on this one . He sings sweetly & calm , then gradually crescendos to his full range of expression . I love the Circus sound @the intro , to a guitar solo with violins soaring & swelling to the choral part . I believe there is a sound of a harpsicord , electronic or not , lovely . His lyric of \" compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey \" brings it home for me . The bridge of the song is testament to that . A beautiful tribute to any woman who listens to it , with a British seaside imagined by only the way Seal can give it to us .","summary":"A fog has lifted","unixReviewTime":1425513600,"image":null}

And it 's not just his covers which are good , his originals are great too ; \" Home \" was an awesome love song . However , this song seems to fall for the most part , flat . While Bubl&eacute ; 's vocals are still as charming and brilliant as ever , the song itself could have been better . It 's a simple song saying , you guessed it , you 're my everything . Pretty darn simple to say the least . And while you could complain all day about how light and poppy the music sounds , I wo n't go into too much more depth than that . So overall , not Bubl&eacute ; 's best , and probably not even close . It 's a light poppy tune , that keeps it very simple .

The video must also be spoken of because although it 's not super - glamorous or anything , it makes listening to the song even better . It features Hayley and the band just jammin ' out , her at the mic and them on the drums and guitars just having fun in what looks like a desert . The song itself is about a boy that Hayley is \" crushcrushcrushing \" on , and he 's not there for her . Not until the bridge does he come into the picture as more than just one - way thoughts . But the song itself , I think talks about being alone and thinking of that someone that lights your fire , even if they are n't with you .

Notably , this song is the full length version , not one of those chopped or butchered follow up versions , usually used by radio stations . There is not much I can add to who and what Prince Rodgers Nelson was . Any additional remarks on my part would be quite redundant . I bought the vinyl album back then and played it frequently using high end turntables connected to an audiophile grade system . Years later , I switched to high end CD players and improved analog system technology . I briefly owned the virtual Red Book CD . It sounded just as good as the vinyl , actually cleaner and with improved dynamic range . The MP3 sound quality of this version is amazingly good for this type of format .

First off , the lyrics are incredible just like they are with any MB20 song , with lyrics like , \" I 'm waking up at the start of the end of the world\/ but it feels just like every other morning before . \" The song is catchy and well - written , and overall just well done . And even though this is a rather successful single , it does n't really sound it . In fact , most of the best songs on their albums were singles anyhow . The bridge is also great musically , and the only thing that could get me down on this song is the chorus . While it is a great chorus for concerts , and to get you pumping , it just seems like more could have been done to it . But overall , a great song , a great single , a great group .

It really shows that Rob Thomas and the group have n't lost that luster after all those years away from the music scene , and with Rob Thomas on his own with Something To Be .

Soon after that column , the song rocketed up the charts , and while I do n't think it # 1 , it came pretty darn close , and still remains a download favorite a couple years later . The song itself is good , not great . The vocals match and work with the song , the lyrics are good , and the piano works very well with the song . However , it kind of gets sappy after awhile . And again , after the radio long where s out it 's welcome , you 're cursing the radio to stop playing that darn song .

Now , with the deep and tragic loss of Prince , the world is feeling the same bits of sadness from beginning to end all over again . He not only transformed music with each and every album he had made , every song he recorded , but Prince honestly was one of those artists that never got older with his music , he got better with each and every song . 1999 is one of those songs that still clicks every time when you think of party anthems and celebrations in music . It is still one of those songs that really connects with celebration . Prince was definitely a gem that really transcended music at the soul , where a lot of other artists have stopped .

Although it has become popular as an anthem in her concerts and covered by several artists , it is thin from start to finish . Trying to address real problems ( poverty apparently , but not clearly , due to oppression ) , Chapman 's lyrics have nothing original about them . She released this as the second single of her career . Considered political aware , it offers nothing but a complaint about the obvious . For example : \n\n \" Wasting time in the unemployment lines \n Sitting around waiting for a promotion . \" \n\n She whispers \" It sounds like a whisper . And she fills in space by repeating \" Run Run Run Run ... \" \n\n The music is sharply produced , but is stuck in a generic 1980s folk rock beat . Tracy Chapman tried too hard on this one and delivered a weak song . She has a better catalog than this .","summary":"Not Up to Tracy Chapman Standards","unixReviewTime":1351296000,"image":null}

I 've heard that they 're an obnoxious , repetitive band , that they 've supposedly \" sold out \" artistically , and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger apparently gets flak for dating \/ marrying Avril Lavigne ( what , celebrities are n't allowed to marry each other ? ) . I could n't judge myself , as I had n't listened to their music , so when I discovered that one of my favorite songs ( on a mix CD given to me by a friend ) happened to be a Nickelback song , I was a little surprised . This song was by the much - hated band ? If this was an example of their usual work , why all the hatred ? \n\n I do n't know if \" Hero \" is typical of all Nickelback 's work or not , but it 's a powerful song that gets me in the gut whenever I hear it . \" Hero \" is a rock number that first appeared on the \" Spiderman \" soundtrack , which is befitting . It 's a strong song about the difficulties of being a hero , and being strong in the face of adversity . It 's accompanied by a powerful guitar section , with my only nitpick being that the drum section can sometimes overpower the other instruments . And it does have a soft , melancholy acoustic interlude that gives the listener a slight break from the heavier guitars . If this is an example of all Nickelback 's work , then I 'm going to give the rest of the band 's discography a shot . If it 's not their typical work ... well , then at least there 's one Nickelback song I really like .","summary":"Powerful song by a much-maligned band","unixReviewTime":1399248000,"image":null}

Grindle","reviewText":"One of the key factors that made the late Ray Charles Robinson the musical icon he become in the two or three decades before his passing was the fact that , if blues came from the crossroads than Brother Ray was crossing the musical interaction . During his salad years of the late 50's \/ early 60 's there was hard bop jazz , urban electric blues and country \/ western music all somehow playing on jukeboxes in black communities all over America . Of course the foundation in all of this , if not overtly was the blues form . And considering , even on his later Atlantic days , Ray was beginning to deal with concept albums as a strong musical possibility . It would simply be the right musical choice to reflect his roots in the blues . \" Early In The Mornin ' \" and \" I 'm Movin ' On \" are the two major uptempo numbers here . The melodic form is right there , smack in the center of the 12 - bar blues . Yet the rhythm is right out of that Afro - Latin vibe - with Ray 's electric piano all making this an extension of the uptempo , funky soul sound he 'd pioneered a couple of years earlier with \" What 'd I Say \" . \" The Right Time\",while nostalgically conjuring up that image of Rudy Huxtable in&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/The - Cosby - Show \/ dp \/ B00GOC74Z2 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">The Cosby Show<\/a>&nbsp;is an elegant , chunky number full of Fathead Newman 's growling sax and the Raelette 's singing at their prime . Not to even mention Ray going from his strong vocal lead to impassioned cries at a moments notice . \" I Believe In My Soul \" starts out with a rather Oriental sounding melody on the piano while Charles own compositions \" Hard Times ( No One Knows Better Than I)\",\"The Midnight Hour\",\"Feelin ' Sad\",'Ray 's Blues\",\"Nobody Cares\",\"Mr . Charles Blues\",\"Some Day Baby \" and \" I Wonder Who \" are all mid to low tempo straight up piano based jazzy blues numbers . With the recent passing of Crusaders pianist \/ co - founder Joe Sample ? I 've come to think about how grateful music fans of my age group should really be that currently deceased   musical icons such as James Brown , Ray Charles and even someone as late in the game as Michael Jackson were still around during part of our lifetime . Many were musicians who played , some were masterful performs and some were both . But to people such as myself ? They will not merely be a page in a history book . Even though this album was recorded almost twenty years before I was born ? The strands of the new music I 'd have absorbed as a child are ever present here . The really exciting part is Ray was an originator too - the key architect of the soul genre . And here he is in 1961 - paying a vital musical tribute to a genre that he absorbed growing up . And so the cycle continues , and meets full circle . Pretty likely this is going to be one of the finest and most important albums you 'll ever hear in your life !","summary":"Ray Puts 12 Big Scoops Into His Ingenious Recipe Of Soul","unixReviewTime":1411344000,"image":null}

The production is tastefully spare , avoiding overly lush arrangements and remaining raw but still darn smooth . Mr. Charles has a wonderful ability to draw out and convey seemingly contradictory feelings in the same song ; a sad song will be so beautiful   that it brings joy ; a song of content carries undertones of trouble and impermanence that creates an insidious edge . I was turned onto this album when I read that Leonard Cohen played this frequently while writing on the Greek island of Hydra . If it 's good enough for Cohen ... \n I sympathize with those who are familiar with versions of this album with better mastering ( original vinyl etc . ) , but this is the only one I 'm familiar with and ignorance is sometimes bliss .

The debut was fun and catchy even if silly , \" Broken Frame \" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights , and \" Construction Time \" 's singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable . 23 years later , people can probably still identify with \" Some Great Reward . \" Not only is this a classic example of a well - done industrial - pop Mode album , the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to . In fact , the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in \" It Does n't Matter , \" \" Stories of Old , \" and \" Somebody . \" \" IDM \" is an awesome dreamy song , in a way unlike anything I 've even heard from this band since . It 's about appreciating the time they have , even if they know it may not last forever . And there 's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on \" Stories of Old , \" possibly my favorite from the record . \" Somebody \" is one of the more famous tracks from the album , and is well - executed , along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix . It is a beautiful soul - searching track . That does n't mean the other 6 songs are n't any good ; they are . And perhaps more than that . The weakest cut , by default , is \" Lie to Me , \" and I enjoy that one , as that even has lyrics someone can relate to . Experiences have a lasting impression , and I 'm sure we 've been around those . The album has an awesome opener with \" Something to Do , \" one of the most stadium - ready songs of DM 's early career . The record also has the band 's breakthrough hit \" People Are People . \" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite , but what 's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song . The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener 's attention . Then there 's the awesome Wilder composition \" If You Want . \" The track is electronic and somewhat space - y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album , in between the somewhat shocking ( at the time , at least ) \" Master and Servant \" and \" Blasphemous Rumors . \" \" Master \" starts with a trade - off a cappella with Martin and Dave saying \" it 's a lot , \" ending it with \" like life . \" It 's a dark song for sure , the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs , and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme . Then there 's teenage angst and irony in \" Blasphemous Rumors , \" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics . I do n't really think it 's intended as an anti - religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy , like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong . Still , an enjoyable track . There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway . This began DM 's cult success of the mid-'80 's , and rightfully so . Totatlly worth the cheap price , or if you want the re - mastered sound , you could go for the CD \/ DVD version .","summary":"Mode's first masterpiece.. it's a lot like life","unixReviewTime":1172966400,"image":null}

This album also has strong non single tracks like lie to me and something to do . They are much more experimental then their critics ever give them credit for and the sounds used on Some Great Reward and Construction Times Again are not even remotely the same .

Some of the songs did stir up some controversy back when this album was released and this album was a major turning point for this amazing band . Something to Do is a hard edged number that kicks this CD off . Lie To Me is an amazing song that I listen to many times without tiring . The dark melody , the sad sound to it is a treat for my ears . People Are People is a fabolous song with phat beats , killer bass lines and a sort of industrial feel . This song is about all people of all religions , races , etc . to get along regardless of their differences . This song has a great message . The ambience at the ending forever leaves this album in my memory . It does n't matter does n't have any major beats but has dingling synths and a both happy and sad sound to it . This song is great . Stories Of Old is another cool song but nto as great as the next one . This song is rather poppy . Somebody is a very sad piano ballad with simply pianos and Martin Gore on vocals . This song is truly a gem on this CD . Master And Servant stirred some controversy back during it 's heyday . It 's a hard - edged song with a strong industrial feel . This is my second favorite . If You Want is my favorite off SGR . It starts off as a creepy electronic song with creepy keyboards and with no drums for the first minute . At 1:30 the drums starts and the song becomes an industrial new wave dance number . Blasphemous Rumours is the one that caused controversy back in 1984 . It 's a very depressing song about religous doubt and suicide . It 's a very sad closer to this amazing album . This CD marks the turning point for Depeche Mode and all of their latter music . While not as strong as their next 5 albums this is a very good album and should be in every DM fans collection .","summary":"This is truly a great reward for me.","unixReviewTime":1009411200,"image":null}

Having lost his father at two years old , he spent most of his childhood doing the street thug thing , getting into all sorts of petty trouble while being raised in a single - parent household . But when his mother passed away when he was 17 , the pain of his loss inspired him to aggressively pursue a recording career , and 4 years later his debut , \" Ghetto Love , \" was released . To be certain , that record was n't perfect , and it had its share of filler . But what made it worth the trip was Jaheim 's voice , which had me do double - takes to make sure I was n't listening to a Teddy Pendegrass record . On his superior , impressive second album , \" Still Ghetto , \" the flava is r&b with a dash of hip hop , but the influences are clearly rooted in the old school . Throughout its trip of nearly an hour , \" Still Ghetto \" is honest , rugged , and soulful . Thematically , it 's not a huge departure from his debut , as the majority of the songs pertain to relationships and the drama that sometimes comes with them . Mary J. Blige openly gave Jaheim props in a Rolling Stone article , and she appears in the impressive duet , \" Beauty and Thug , \" in which the Queen of Hip Hop Soul 's bruised voice goes hand - in - hand with his husky voice . He glides effortlessly through the ultrasmooth slow jam \" Long As I Live , \" and I do n't even need to explain what the song \" Tight Jeans \" is about . \" Still Ghetto \" is essentially the record Tank 's \" One Man \" should have been . The latter record suffered from tired beats and half - inspired singing , but on \" Still Ghetto , \" Jaheim pulls it off with flying colors . He may be a little rough on the edges , and some may even question his choice of words ( um , \" Me and My B---- , \" anyone ? ) , but there 's no denying his honesty . Some records keep it real , and others keep it right .","summary":"The Return of Jaheim.","unixReviewTime":1036540800,"image":null}

I miss Teddy Pendergrass ... the Teddy who sang with the Blue Notes and who later had some fantastic solo albums BEFORE the accident .

Jaheim has the same voice ... the same approach . What played well in the 70's ... continues to play .

The album 's tracklisting is all around great , from the order of the songs to the lyrics and instruments . \" Still Ghetto \" is about love and relationships for the most part . Jaheim seduces and croons his female listeners practically the entire album . \" Put that Woman First \" is the mid - tempo track that was released and went on to be a hit for 2003 . Jaheim explains that if a man does not make a woman feel that she is at the top of his list , she may leave him for another man who will . A lot of women and even men like this song . Jaheim showcases his seduction skills on the song \" Special Day \" . In this song Jaheim tells his woman it is her day and asks her what she would like to do . It is a slow song with a beautiful message and melody . \" Everywhere I Am is Jaheim 's dedication to his late mother , Julie . In the song he lets his mom know that whatever he does , he feels her presence , even in the biggest events of his life . This song is truly heartfelt to anyone has either lost their mother or has a close bond with her . Another favorite on \" Still Ghetto \" is Jaheim 's duet with Mary J.

Jaheim is blessed with a wonderful , soulful voice which shines through on this release . Jaheim has shown alot love for Hip Hop so it makes sense that he have Kay Gee ( formerly of Naughty by Nature ) looking after alot of the production on this . The lead single is the inspirational \" Fabulous \" which is about staying positive and making it through the hardest of times . I like this track , The Rayne 's guest appearance is good and having the children sing the chorus adds a different feel to the track . Next two tracks are standout , \" Diamond In Da Ruff \" and \" Put that Woman First \" are about appreciating ones lady . Other early songs like \" Me and My B * * * * \" and \" Let 's Talk About It \" follow through well . \" Long as I Live \" is about real love , marriage and commitment . Jaheim goes real deep on \" Everywhere I Am \" a beautiful tribute to his mom , a song where you can really feel his genuine love . Mary J and Jaheim drop a memorable collabration on \" Beauty and a Thug \" . Slow love song \" Special Lady \" is another track I like .

Within his music he celebrates the idea of ghetto , even going insofar as to title his sophomore album \" Still Ghetto \" . While I respect Jaheim 's allegiance to his roots , sometimes the sheer overload of the \" ghetto \" concept overpowers his musical prowess . Hailing from New Jersey , Jaheim is no doubt a talented singer capable of impressing even the most fickle with his ability . In fact his talent is so strong that it could almost make you angry that he does n't have material - but images are made for reason and Jaheim has done well with his . The first cut released from \" Still Ghetto \" was the hood anthem \" Fabulous \" whose catchy refrain sung by kids : \" do n't hate on us , we 're fabulous \" , creeps into you head and seeks to take up permanent residence . From the celebratory \" Fabulous \" , the album reflects on love with \" Diamond In Da Ruff \" . It is on tracks like this as well as the soul - filled and passionate \" Put That Woman First \" that Jaheim shows you the depths and peaks of his voice . Since his debut , he 's been compared to the legendary Teddy Pendergrass , a serious compliment that echoes in every part of Jaheim 's vocals . The album takes a slight turn with the less impressive \" Me & My B!tch \" and \" Tight Jeans \" . While they all in their own way have some sort of appeal - it 's here where you pity the subject matter . Jaheim has the voice of someone who should perhaps being singing ballads exclusively , but it often feels like his talent is wasted on sub par material not worthy of his voice . Sure , it 's okay to appreciate the female form , but someone with this voice - you just know that he 's capable of more . \" Backtight \" might have a dumb title - but it 's subtlety is definitely a plus . The songwriting leaves you wanting a little more , but sound - wise it 's very nice . \" Long As I Live \" is a tad overproduced , but because the vocals are so lush - it 's hard to even care . On \" Everywhere I Am \" , the crooner calls up the spirit of the older , fatter Luther Vandross ( most of you know Luther was a much better singer when he ate Big Macs instead of lettuce ) . On the track , Jaheim sings out for his late mother and his talent is to be respected on the well - produced and well - sung track . \" Beauty And A Thug \" , a duet with Mary J. Blige , tries to be jazzy but ends up just being not so great . Things get a little more \" ghetto \" with \" Every Which Way \" which should be discarded in the do not put me on an album pile . \" Special Day \" is another of the moments that make you want to root for Jaheim . His voice has so many beautiful elements to it , that you want people to like him - you want him to succeed and more importantly , you want his record label to hire him better writers and producers . \n - Final Thoughts - \n Jahiem might not be a household name yet , but he has undeniable talent that will keep him floating for time to come . He 'll definitely have to refine his talents if he wants to reach a broader audience , but for now he 's happy being \" Still Ghetto \"","summary":"Still Ghetto","unixReviewTime":1049068800,"image":null}

Highsmith","reviewText":"Watching BET 's Midnight Love one night , I was introduced to a r&b singer named Jaheim . As I was watching his video , I was n't too impressed with \" Could It Be \" at first . I saw the song as just another new cat jumping into the r&b game . However , as I heard the song more often , I began to like the song more and Jaheim 's voice was n't that bad , as it reminded me of the infamous Teddy P singing \" Love TKO \" , \" Turn Off The Lights \" , or \" Come Go With Me \" . I was still hesitant in buying \" Ghetto Love \" but everyone that had purchased the CD gave me rave reviews so I decided to purchase my own copy . \" Ghetto Love \" turned out to be one of my favorite r&b CDs of 2001 . I liked how Jaheim used his sharp \" street \" edge to his songs . My favorites included \" Looking For Love \" , \" Ghetto Love \" , \" Remarkable \" w \/ Terry Dexter , \" Ready , Willing & Able \" , as well as the rest of his singles :   \" Just In Case \" and \" Anything \" w \/ Next .   With a title of \" Still Ghetto \" you would expect the same thing from his sophomore CD and ladies and gentlemen that is what you will get . \" Still Ghetto \" starts off with Jaheim and Duganz doing what they did on a few tracks on \" Ghetto Love \" by rappin ' and singin ' straight from the streets . From there , Jaheim does what he does best by lacing his fans with the street anthems and romantic melodies that he is known for now . His 1st single , \" Fabolous \" is dedicated to the children coming up in the world today . As Jaheim can tell you , he knows how rough it was growing up and being a hardhead so he is trying to motivate children of today to not walk in the same path that he did . While the song may not hit you like \" Could It Be \" , \" Fabolous \" gets a strong point across and was definintely the right pick for the 1st single . The majority of the rest of the songs deal with relationships and trying to find the right woman . The ladies will definitely be impressed with this CD . \" Diamond In Da Ruff \" deals with a woman that Jaheim wish he would have treated better and now he realizes how much they could have had if he would have swallowed his pride and been a man about their relationship . \" Let 's Talk About It \" follows the same line as Jaheim wants to talk to someone that he dealt with in the past and try to realize where they went wrong . He was in trouble so much that he could n't be focused in the relationship . \" Put That Woman First \" covers territory that has been covered by R Kelly , \" When A Woman 's Fed Up \" and Joe , \" Treat Her Like A Lady \" . However , with the old school feel to the song , this will still be one of your favorites . \" Beauty & Thug \" features the queen of r&b \/ hip hop , Mary J Blige and brings pleasant results . Both singers sound very well together and Malik Pendleton , who produced Mary J. Blige 's \" Seven Days \" from her \" Share My World \" CD does the production . The fellas will be able to relate to \" Tight Jeans \" , as Jaheim tells a tale about one of his good female friends always coming around him wearing tight jeans . While he may have intentions of being a platonic friend , she is tempting him to think of her in other ways . Jaheim also displays the same sentimental side that he showed on \" Ghetto Love \" with songs like \" Backtight \" , \" Special Day \" , \" Long As I Live \" and \" Everywhere I Am \" . The latter , is a powerful dedication to his mom who passed away when he was a teenager . On another song , \" Me And My B * * * * \" , Jaheim professes his loyalty for his lady , but at the same time he is saying if you try to \" get at her \" , that might be the last move you make . This may be too much for some r&b fans , but if you understand the concept , you will understand that he is n't trying to offend women , this is just his way of expressing his thoughts on this particular song . If Jaheim would have ended \" Still Ghetto \" at track 13 , I believe that he would have a 5 star CD on his hands . However , tracks 14 - 16 , turn out to be nothing but filler . Especially , \" Whut You Want \" , which puts a damper on 13 straight tight songs . The majority of the production is handled by Kay Gee , formerly of Naughty By Nature and Eddie F and Darren Lighty , which provides primarily the same sound as his debut CD displayed . Overall , Jaheim has a nice sophomore CD on his hands . If you liked \" Ghetto Love \" , you will enjoy \" Still Ghetto \" but you may enjoy the 1st CD better .

The drums and bass synthesizers begin again with a return to the opening sequence which is a reprise of the first half .

The Four Seasons emerged that year 1960 with not one or two but several 45 hits . They dominated the top of the charts and took America by storm . First with \" Sherry \" quickly followed by \" Walk like a man \" and then \" Big Girls Do n't Cry \" the Four Seasons brightened up sleep overs and slumber parties everywhere . Girls could n't get enough . The 60 's arrived big time in most part to the new sound coming from New Jersey and that sound would shape the decade to come . Solo acts would fall to the side . Groups would dominate . Later , when Frankie Vali stepped out in front of the group to bask in his own glory , the shine fell off the rose and the rising star of the Four Seasons began to fall .

The hit single : \" Love Wo n't Let Me Wait \"   is a cool - vibin , jazzy , classy number , with some orgasmic girl moans at the end of the slow drag . \" Sideshow \" is a mellow cover of a Blue Magic classic jam , and Major Harris handles it well . Other slower jams include \" Just a Thing I Do \" and \" My Way . \" The other songs are more up - tempo and also are spirit and soul up - lifters . \" Sweet Tomorrow \" is gorgeous , poetic , and romantic .

Having read a little about them I 'm not surprised to find out that they are an alternative band formed in the late 90 's . \" C'm on , C'm on \" has all the features that attract me to alternative music ( I do not claim to be an music expert and many times I do not follow bands , I simply go by what I like and my own interpretations of the music -- if you listen long enough you 're able to identify the rock , punk , and even some 70 's sounds in   many songs that are considered or identified as alternative ) . For me at least , the influence of good old fashioned well known punk bands , like the Clash and American punk like the Ramones is clear even in \" C'm on , C'mon\"--probably one of the reasons why I liked it and bought it . I did not know that \" C'm on C'm on \" was used as the opening music for the TV show \" Rescue Me \" but this is besides the point . I have no idea what the lyrics mean and are beyond the scope of my review . However , they 're simple enough , I 've caught myself singing to this song and I usually do n't sing . I love that anthem sound that is so particular of alternative music ( also punk , yes ? ) . In some crazy way , it reminds me of the Clash 's \" Police on my back . \" Crazy , but that 's what it reminds me of . I 've given \" C'm on C'm on \" five stars because I 'm very happy with my purchase . The worst I can say about this song is that when typing it out , it 's an awkward contraction and spell check does n't recognize it .","summary":"Music gem from unknown artist (unknown to me at least)","unixReviewTime":1344384000,"image":null}

After hearing seeing them live , I immediately went out and bought their self - titled debut and every SECOND of the album was up to pitch , fantastic rock music . So when I heard they were coming out with another album , I was ecstatic . Though this album is a little more ' hard ' then their first CD , it 's still amazing and those acoustics made famous by Todd are still there . Their first single ' Hey Now ' is actually more like their old stuff . My favourite song on the CD would have to be ' Hero ' , a brilliant done song . ' The Chain ' is a Fleetwood Mac remake , the beginning does n't really sound like Tantric but once it gets to the chorus , you can hear their signature sound . From start to finish this album delivers and I can not WAIT to hear more . If you liked the first album from Days of the New , Tantric 's first CD or just love rock music you wo n't be disappointed with this . That was my review after the first week of having the CD , now I have a little more to say . Tantric 's ' After We Go ' is a timeless album , it has n't left my CD player since it 's release . It 's one of those albums that you can put on replay for the rest of your LIFE and still want to hear more . Each track is amazingly good , it 's like a big juicy apple pie , rich and delicious . The opener , ' Chasing After ' is a fast paced starter , Hugo 's vocals are extremely well done here , lyrically good as well . ' After We Go ' is one of my favourites ( tied with about 5 others ) , the background vocals surpass Hugo's ... strange , no . The talent of this band is overflowing . ' Falling Away ' is musically , one of the best songs I 've heard . The guitar work is actually intelligent . The first single ' Hey Now ' is a single I actually love to listen to . ' Hero ' which was my favourite song when I first got the CD has now dropped a fair bit , it 's still brilliant - a somewhat sweet anthem , if that is an apology , I accept . ' The Chain ' is a Fleetwood Mac cover , very well done of the classic , the chorus is hard edged , I love Hugo 's vocals on the ' and if you do n't love me now , you will never love me again ' , chills . ' Change The World ' is a great song to start off if you 're a new Tantric fan , it 's not as experimental , still extremely well done . ' Just Once ' is my favourite song , I think when I listen to it , I go into a different world , the guitars and vocals put me into this dream and I never want to wake up . These last few songs are what I call the creme de la creme , the best damn music I 've ever heard in a long time ! All of these are tied with ' After We Go ' for my favourite after ' Just Once ' - that did n't really make sense . In any case , ' Relentless ' is lyrically amazing , Hugo 's vocals are sexy as hell . ' Alright ' - what can I say , the chorus ... if you 're a woman , you will get caught up in the vocals , I am telling you , there is nothing sexier than Hugo 's vocals . Todd - you are a god . Always will be . ' Before ' really , there is n't much more I can say ... if I had a thesaurus close by I would look up some more incredible words to describe it 's brilliance . Lastly , ' Awake ' , a great closing song but every time I get there I wish there was more . I hit repeat for the time being and I am counting down the days for the next album ! !","summary":"one of the best follow up albums","unixReviewTime":1079740800,"image":null}

Now with producer \/ writer team Thom Bell \/ Linda Creed , and a deal on Atlantic , they Spinners ' hard work finally paid off after years . This joint is surely a winner , with some heavy hitting mid - tempo soul jams . This one contains some legendary jams like the rolling funk of \" I 'll Be Around \" and \" Could It Be I 'm Falling in Love \" heavily laden with strings , a staple of Philly Soul . \" I 'll Be Around \" is one of my favorite soul jams of all time , and even though I am 10 years younger than the song is , I remember listening to it and loving it in junior high school ( in the mid 90 's ) when L.A. hip - hop station Power 106 FM had time set aside time for old school jams . Rapper Rappin ' 4 - Tay also made his own version of it in 1994 , a wonderful hip - hop jam which took the funky rolling music and some of the hook vocals for the rap song . Another one of my favorites here is \" Just Me and You Baby , \" a slower , ballad type jam with heavenly harmony . \" Ghetto Child \" is heavy mid - tempo jam exploring the bad side of growing up in the ` hood , very sad and timeless . \" How Could I Let You Get Away \" is a sadder lyrically rich song laden with sitars later in the song . Phillipe Wynne , Bobbie Smith ( great singers ) , and company surely deliver a rich album full of lush Thom Bell production and sweet harmony and melody ; the transition from Detroit to Philly surely was a lucrative one . 1974 's Mighty Love is another wonderful soulful album as is 1975 's Pick of the Litter . The Spinners are definitely essential listening in order to truly experience what Philly Soul has to offer .","summary":"The Breakthrough: A Second Beginning","unixReviewTime":1232323200,"image":null}

This all - time classic album includes the masterpieces \" I 'll Be Around \" , \" Could It Be I 'm Falling In Love \" , \" I Could Never ( Repay Your Love ) \" and \" Ghetto Child \" and is rightly regarded as a milestone of 1970s R&B. The Spinners ' association with the great Thom Bell would result in some of the best Soul Music ever recorded but this was their first -- and best -- collaboration .","summary":"The Spinners' Atlantic debut remains fresh, vital and timeless to this day.","unixReviewTime":1172620800,"image":null}

Oh God , we all went Spinners crazy . Anyone who grew up on Black Soul music knows that one of the hardest thing to do , is to answer the question \" WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME ? \" Could It Be I 'm Falling In Love is one of my unforgettable favorites .

The song , like almost any song by the Band Led Zepplin , is well constructed and nicely produced . The meaning is enigmatic but it allows many differing interpretations and I do not think that is bad . With many lasting works of art , it will elicit different emotions and address many topics depending on the audience . It starts with a simple , almost latin melody , and Robert comes in quietly and without hurry . His narrative is leading and his melody makes you feel as if there is actual movement . His matter of fact delivery is in line with his more mature sensibilities and the desperate angst of his youth is replaced with tension but not desperation . At the end the melody continues even after the singer has completed his part . Is it symbolic ?","summary":"A mature Robert Plant","unixReviewTime":1356134400,"image":null}

The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there , and Coldplay 's Chris Martin is a big fan as well ( Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour ) . \" Room Noises \" ( 12 tracks , 41 min . ) is full of dreamy , yet very catchy songs , not unlike , say , Sixpense None the Richer . The best songs are in the first half of the album , including the opener \" Memories \" , \" I Was n't Prepared \" , \" Memories \" ( the standout track of the album ) , and \" Brightly Wounded \" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers . Other great tracks are \" Plenty of Paper \" , a great up - tempo song , and the closer \" Trolley Wood \" . What keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs ( in newly recorded versions ) , and that 's disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning . We want more new songs ! Finally , the Amazon listing shows a bonus track ( a remixed version of \" Lost at Sea \" ) but the CD I bought does n't have it , hmmmm ... Regardless , Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today 's music scene . Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I ca n't wait to see them live ! \" Room Noises \" is highly recommended !","summary":"Eisley is one of the best new bands out there","unixReviewTime":1108252800,"image":null}

But even with that there 's no denying he had some real HITS . Songs such as ' I Want Her ' , Twisted , Merry Go Round , Make It Last Forever , Do n't Stop Your Love , Get Up On It and Nobody perfectly display the classicness he delivered . His voice is velvet , easily distinguished when you hear it .

I 've seen reviews where people give a collection one star just because THAT song was n't on there . But this 17 - song collection is a pretty accurate representation of Keith Sweat 's career . I noticed that a lot of the songs are from his first album Make It Last Forever . Sure , that was his best album , but maybe he should 've included a good number of songs from ALL of the albums . Oh well , there are other hits you remember , like \" Nobody \" , \" Twisted \" , \" I 'll Give All My Love To You \" , and even LSG 's \" My Body \" . And most hits collections contain a hard - to - find song , and here there 's \" ( There You Go ) Tellin ' Me No Again \" ( from the New Jack City soundtrack ) . I 'm not exactly sure why the Snoop Dogg - assisted \" Come And Get With Me \" is on here , but regardless , this is still a good album to buy if all your Keith Sweat cassettes are worn out or lost .","summary":"Pretty good collection","unixReviewTime":1074988800,"image":null}

Once again and as always , the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook . This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music . With the superb instrumental skills of pianist Don Grolnick , drummer John Guerin , bassist Bob Magnusson , guitarist Bob Mann ( who also played fabulously on Rod Stewart and Steve Tyrell 's recordings ) and the creative flair of concertmaster David Frisina , this CD offers some of the glowing moments of Ms. Ronstadt 's musical career . \" Lush Life , \" \" What 's New ? \" and \" For Sentimental Reasons \" are three of the greatest and most beautiful albums of standards ever recorded . Nobody sounded more expressive than Ms. Ronstadt singing \" When I Fall In Love , \" a song lamenting that love has ended even before it has begun . You can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist , Bob Mann , complementing Ms. Ronstadt 's exquisite voice . Likewise , nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of \" When Your Lover Has Gone . \" \n\n \" What lonely hours The evening shadows bring \n What lonely hours \n With memories lingering \n Like faded flowers \n Life ca n't mean anything . . . \" \n\n In \" Skylark , \" the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition as she brings new life to this Johnny Mercer \/ Hoagy Carmichael classic . She also left a lasting impression to one of Sinatra 's signature songs \" I 'm A Fool To Want You , \" just like Ol' Blue Eyes did with his meaningful interpretation . They both did the best versions for male and female vocals , respectively . She swings lightly on Rodgers & Hart 's gem \" You Took Advantage Of Me , \" then she takes it slower in Mills \/ Parish \/ Ellington 's \" Sophisticated Lady . \" And picks up the light swing tempo again on \" Ca n't We Be Friends ? \" \n\n \" Sophisticated lady I know You miss the love you had long ago And when nobody is nigh \n You cry . you cry . \" \n\n If you 're a lover of standards like me and an admirer of beauty in all its forms , you should have this CD in your collection and take pleasure in listening to its endless beauty . Here 's to the magic of beautiful music !","summary":"Another Beauty From Ronstadt & Riddle","unixReviewTime":1161993600,"image":null}

Riddle , the former Frank Sinatra arranger , employs such luminaries as Louie Bellson , Peter Asher and Don Grolnick to aid Ronstadt along the journey . Ronstadt 's interpretations range from the delightful and playful to sassy and romantic . At times the orchestration can get a little too sweet , but Ronstadt sings such faves as \" When I Fall In Love , \" \" Skylark , \" \" Sophisticated Lady , \" \" Falling In Love Again , \" \" Lush Life \" and \" You Took Advantage Of Me \" with enough charm and grace to overshadow some of Riddle 's overly ambitious arrangements .","summary":"Lush Life - Excellent","unixReviewTime":997488000,"image":null}

His first album , Live At Wetlands , showed that Mr. Randolph plays one mean steel guitar . The question would be if that same sweat and fire could be recreated in the studio . The answer is a resounding yes . Mr. Randolph cut his teeth playing in a Pentecostal church in his hometown of Orange , New Jersey and the album has clear gospel roots . But the band is really more of a funk and roll band in the Parliament - Funkadelic mold . Mr. Randolph 's steel guitar is often counterbalanced by popping bass lines and wailing organs . \" So Refreshing \" has a funky bass and buzz saw steel riff and \" Squeeze \" has fiery organs that perfectly contrast the wicked steel guitar . \" I Need More Love \" has a call and response chorus that sits atop a hard funk groove that is very Stevie Wonder like . \" Smile \" slows things down and features tender harmonies . \" Calypso \" has a Latin - jazz - rock Santana vibe and \" Run For Your Life \" closes out the disk on a full - out Jersey bar sound .

After hearing him play the pedal steel guitar on that collaboration project , I must say I was absolutely floored ! EVERYTHING about his playing will bring to mind all the things that made guys like Jimi Hendrix , Jeff Beck , Duane Allman , Carlos Santana , and Stevie Ray Vaughan as revered as they are . Simply put , the brother got \" MAD SKILLZ \" ! ! ! The same can also be said of his stellar backing unit known simply as the Family Band , whose sound I found it best to describe as being a unique hybrid of the Allman Brothers ' roots - based   rock and Graham Central Station 's sanctified funk . On this , their first studio - conceived album , nearly all the tracks shine from the infectiously \" gospel - delic \" groove laid down by the band as well as the industrial strength of Randolph 's pedal steel work ( which is a joy to behold in itself ) . I would 've given this a 5 - star rating if some of the jams were extended for greater effect , but that 's just a minor complaint linked mainly to personal preference . On the other hand , I do know a good band when I hear one and something tells me that Robert Randolph & Co. are n't that far off from becoming one of the most exciting and influential bands of their generation ( MY generation to be specific ) .

It 's also the most interesting single recording he has ever released as a solo artist . A two - part acoustic \/ electric guitar showpiece , the song is a reflection on perceiving reality and the certainty of having to pay a price for treachery and evil . The futuristic synthesizer intro is augmented \/ contrasted by Joe 's bluesy electric and haunting acoustic slide guitars . You can actually hear Joe 's bottleneck scraping the brass - wound guitar strings as it eerily slides over them . Slow blues from the dark realm of another universe . Minor and major seventh chords complement Joe singing the murky philosophical lyrics of the first , and slower , half of the song . The second half of the song features a ferocious electric guitar solo and one of Joe 's most compelling vocal performances . The Confessor : \n\n If you look at your reflection in the bottom of a well \n What you see is only on the surface \n When you try to see the meaning hidden underneath \n The measure of the depth can be deceiving The bottom has a rocky reputation \n\n You can feel it in the distance the deeper that you stare \n From up above it 's hard to see but you know when you 're there \n On the bottom words are shallow \n On the surface talk is cheap \n You can only judge the distance by the company you keep \n In the eyes of The Confessor \n\n In the eyes of The Confessor \n There 's nowhere you can hide \n You ca n't hide from the eyes ( of The Confessor ) Do n't you even try \n\n In the eyes of The Confessor \n You ca n't tell a lie \n You can not tell a lie ( to The Confessor ) Strip you down to size \n\n Naked as the day that you were born \n Naked as the day that you were born \n\n Take all the trauma , drama , comments \n The guilt and doubt and shame The what if 's and if only 's \n The shackles and the chains \n The violence and aggression \n The pettiness and scorn \n The jealousy and hatred \n The tempest and discord ... \n\n AND GIVE IT UP !","summary":"IN THE EYES OF THE CONFESSOR !","unixReviewTime":1225065600,"image":null}

Even though all the songs are great , DMSR is the epitome of the Prince sound at the time an gave us a glimpse to where the sound was going , it greatly benefits from the assists from the Revolution , due to him splitting the hook an lets the girls singing the backgrounds the funk becomes soo inclusive an he was aware of that , \" all the negros sang ... all the white people on the floor sang \" just totally brilliant . Production wise Prince took drum programming to whole nother level while the old cats where struggling to make a drum machine sound an feel like a live drummer , Prince seen the future of funk , that kick snare pattern just loops for 8 minutes , with various breakdowns from the electric toms lol , but all the other instruments get to play freely an make it feel like what it is a funk jam where all the little nuances go a long way the Sly scream that during 80 's was part of his trademark hits , the rappin \" I do n't wanna be a poet ... \" The wicked bass line the master overdubbing makes you feel like it was recorded live at first avenue in Minneapolis , you can taste the sweat off the party goers just funky . Very few artist could replicate this level of funk in a studio . I mean sure George an Parliament had 8 , 9 minutes jams but they also had an army of nearly 12 to 20 people to do it .

The song was played on local radio and I remember the song being performed at a carnival that was being held near the city that I lived in at the time ( I just wish that I could remember if it was Alannah Myles and her group or if the performance was by a tribute band ) . Anyhow , the vocals and the lyrics of the   song musically paint a story that would make for good tv episode viewing or a movie about a heartbreaker who is easy on the eyes or maybe not conventionally attractive but a charmer . Either way a person has to be open - minded to listen to this gem of a song due to the fact that the song appears to be about a womanizer who is easy on the eyes , maybe even pleasant to be around ( I.e. a charmer ) yet hard on a persons heart romantically speaking .

CocKayne","reviewText":"The 1990s was a turbulent time for music . I just found it difficult to adjust to the change from the awesome music from the 80 's to the music of the 90 's . The introduction of grunge , rap , and other music was hard to get use to . In 1992 along come a great song from Alannah Myles , BLACK VELVET . I thought the music of the 1990 's is not lost we have a winner . The reason why I love this song is the lyrics beat , and it has something for everybody . It is a song that is a blend of Pop \/ Country , the beat is a blend and the lyrics to me is more pop . So if U hate Pop music you will still love this song and vice - versa with those who dis - like Country music like me .

Joining Plant and Page in this ensemble is Nile Rodgers , who himself had chart success with his R&B band Chic . Rodgers had quite a workload with this album and Madonna 's LIKE A VIRGIN . It 's understandable that Plant and Page declined to carry on with Led Zeppelin after the 1980 death of drummer John Bonham . SOL was made famous originally by Phil Phillips in 1959 . The differences between Phillips ' recording and the cover are no \" buh - buh - buh - bum \" in the cover , a key change in the cover and Plant 's accenting of some of the lyrics differently than how Phillips did it . AT MIDNIGHT really swings . It got the lively 1940 's sound that the fighting men of World War II were dancing to at clubs . After this album , Plant , whose solo career began in or around 1982,continued going solo . Page formed his third band THE FIRM and released an album in 1985 . Recently , the surviving Led Zeppelin members re - formed with a new drummer and are currently on tour .","summary":"Robert and Jimmy mellow out!","unixReviewTime":1201564800,"image":null}

Sherwin","reviewText":"The Honeydrippers consisted of two members of the collapsed band called Led Zeppelin , Jimmy Page and Robert Plant . After Page and Plant added some new faces they had a new band , The Honeydrippers . Their new band does some great covers some of their songs . Unfortunately , this CD is rather short -- and that disappoints me . What we do get , though , is excellent quality ! The track set begins with \" I Get A Thrill . \" The band gives the arrangement a big band \/ swing\/50s rock and roll flavor to this number ; and the band harmonizes to perfection ! Listen for some great piano playing ; and the drums and percussion bolster \" I Get A Thrill \" very well . Love that electric guitar , too ! \" Sea Of Love \" opens with a grand musical flourish from the violins ; and when the band comes in they play and sing without a superfluous note ! \" Sea Of Love \" gives us The Honeydrippers delivering one of their strongest , most enchanting love ballads ever . They harmonize well as they sing this nostalgic song to celebrate the joys of being in love . The musical interlude uses the electric guitar very well , too . \" I Got A Woman \" is a song written by the late great Ray Charles ; The Honeydrippers pick up the tempo to perform this song at a faster than normal clip . The tempo helps to emphasize the joyfulness of this number that has a man celebrating his love for his woman . The band delivers this flawlessly ; and the horn solo during the musical interlude impresses me very much . \" Young Boy Blues \" uses some great chord changes to make this number special , too . The CD ends with the awesome track entitled \" Rockin ' At Midnight . \" If you really want to hear rock mixed with both big band and swing , listen for THIS ballad . The band celebrates being out on the town with their girlfriends ; and the musical arrangement pulls out all the stops to make this number stun you with its power ! The guitar solo bolsters the number as the horns play during the musical interlude ; and the overall effect of \" Rockin ' At Midnight \" packs a strong punch ! The liner notes include some great artwork and we get the song credits , too . The Honeydrippers never developed to the extent I hoped they would ; but this CD gives us excellent material from a band that lacked nothing . I only wish there were more than the paltry five songs on this CD ! I have to take off a star because of this disappointment . Overall , you ca n't go wrong with this playful , energetic CD put out by The Honeydrippers . Led Zeppelin fans will at the very least be intrigued by this CD ; and people who thirst for that big band sound with those crooning vocals will love this one . Pop it in your CD player and enjoy ! Great job , guys ! Thank you !","summary":"fine collection of songs by The Honeydrippers--as far as it goes, that is","unixReviewTime":1190160000,"image":null}

It 's an average Alice album at best , and if you skip this one you 're not missing that much . The best cuts are the galloping opener \" Zorro 's Ascent \" ; The fiery , clever \" Tag , You 're It \" has Alice assuming the role of horror - movie director and the entire song is made up of his direction to the terrified leading lady hiding from a psycho - killer . It alone makes this album worth getting . Though the militant \" I Better Be Good \" sounds like a leftover from \" Special Forces \" , it 's still one of the best tracks here lyrically and musically . Patty Donahue of The Waitresses appears to take Alice to task on \" I Like Girls \" and her asides are typically amusing and make the song ( \" What happened ? Among the rest : \" Make That Money ( Scrooge 's Song ) \" is nothing special except the instrumental finale sounds like something straight out of the \" Killer \" era , which should please fans of the original ACG . In the slower \" I Am the Future \" , Alice forgoes the sap of earlier shamaltz for a ballad with bite -- exactly like a slow Coop song should be . Some of the lyrics get a little silly , as on \" No Baloney Homosapiens \" but it 's a decent sing - a - long cut nontheless , the showy chorus reminiscent of \" Hello Hurray \" . The rocking \" I 'm Alive ( That Was the Day My Dead Pet Returned ) \" also sounds like something from B$B updated for 1982 . \" Adaptable ( Anything For You ) \" , \" Remarkably Insincere \" are actually both UNremarkable . Although \" Zipper Catches Skin \" is not a bad album -- and would be decent for any other artist , Alice is capable of much more than what 's here . Three Stars -- an average Coop effort .","summary":"Only a Couple Keepers on This One","unixReviewTime":1327708800,"image":null}

Cooper continued to assume new identities , such as the famed swordsman of \" Zorro 's Ascent \" and the put - upon son of \" Make That Money ( Scrooge 's Song ) . \" Some of the performances seem labored , and Wagner 's distinctive guitar riffs feel as if they were grafted onto the songs to add flash . The stagey ballad \" I Am the Future \" might have worked well as a production number , but with Cooper descending back into alcohol addiction there was no tour . What works well is Cooper 's humor on \" No Baloney Homosapiens , \" \" I Like Girls \" and \" Remarkably Insincere . \" And on \" Tag , You 're It \" he indulges his longtime love of cheesy cinema with a song full of slasher - film clichs . If there was no 1970s legacy with which to compare this , one might stumble upon this and think it 's a long - lost power - pop album from a surprisingly talented lyricist . It 's all quite listenable , and even fun as it passes by , but it 's not nearly as memorable as his earlier ( and some of his later ) works .

None of it is really horrible ( at least not completely ) but none of it is really great . They both seem to have like the whole new wave thing and wanted to join in on it . It did n't work out well for either of them . But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n ' roll and yet they wanted to do something ... bad .. ? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music . ' Zorro 's Ascent ' ' No Baloney Homosapiens ' ' I Like Girls ' and ' Tag , Your It ' are all decent rock tracks . They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics . Especially ' No Baloney ... ' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name . Though ' Remarkably Insencire ' is a real gem . The rest of the album feels trite and boring , not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music . The production for one thing is horrendous . While not too bad and not a total waste of your money , Zipper Catches Skin is not an album worth hunting down . yeah it makes a cool snag , but ditch the high hopes for this one .","summary":"Zipper Catches Skin","unixReviewTime":1224028800,"image":null}

It 's material ranges all over the place seemingly in search of a direction , but not really finding one . Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair , long sleeved dress shirt and a tie . A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on \" Special Forces \" . This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long . Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting . I did hear \" I Like Girls \" on my local AOR station a few times , but that was about it . Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads , I like a lot of this disc . You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff , as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous . How he thought up this one I 'll never know , but it is funny and cleaver . Three songs in the middle all run together \" Adaptable \" , \" I Like Girls \" , and \" Remarkably Insincere \" . They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics . \" Tag You 're It \" sees Alice as a horror movie director ....... or is he really a killer ? This is a great song and harkens back to his \" Welcome To My Nightmare \" days . \" It Better Be Good \" is another short fun rocker . On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well . \" I Am The Future \" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated . \" No Baloney Homosapiens \" is , well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess . \" I 'm Alive \" is another clunker that closes out the album . Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly . Still , I like most of it and it is defiantly one of Cooper 's most \" fun \" albums .","summary":"Alice's Most Fun Album","unixReviewTime":1165968000,"image":null}

It has some fantastic songs like \" Tag , You 're It \" , a tribute to 80 's slasher films in which Alice sings as if directing a B - Movie . \" Adaptable \" is a really fun song that will stay in your head after just one listen to the album . And you have \" I Like Girls \" and \" Remarkably Insincere \" which are fun songs about a womanizing loser . \" I Am the Future \" is actually a pretty dark song lyrically and I think is the standout song on the album . But , on the flip side you have what may be Cooper 's worst song ever with \" No Baloney Homosapiens \" . I am sure at the time , Cooper thought this was pretty clever , but musically it just does not flow , the lyrics are choppy , and forced into a rhyming scheme that just does n't work . \" Make That Money \" is another forgettable ditty , with lyrics again not befitting Alice Cooper . But outside of those two songs Alice I think \" Zipper Catches Skin \" is a really good album , but still the weakest of the early 80 's New Age Alice . I prefer \" Flush the Fashion \" , \" Special Forces \" and the best of this era \" DaDa \" . Still , it 's Alice Cooper and worth the price for the import , if for nothing else than to own the entire Cooper Collection .","summary":"Good...But Very Uneven","unixReviewTime":1090454400,"image":null}

And in one of the episodes where Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are happily going about making Heisenberg Blue , \" Crystal Blue Persuasion \" starts playing as the bed for this segment . Just about the entire song . And it occurred to me that besides it being the perfect song for this particular episode , Tommy James & the Shondells did a great job on this song . They were originally a 60s Top 40 band but in the late 60s put out what would be considered psychedelic rock . This song , however , captures a little bit of jazz , vocal harmonies , great keyboards , and an overall adult contemporary feel . So I decided to download it ...","summary":"Hearing this on \"Breaking Bad\" reminded me how good a song this is ...","unixReviewTime":1391472000,"image":null}

Carroll","reviewText":"This very British band is just an amazing mix of driving beats , vocals filled with whatever emotion is required of them , and lyrics that take on a number of subjects that usually require a more mature voice to be this good . I think it will take a few years before these guys hit their stride , but this debut has enough diversity and quality to leave you very satisfied . They might end up being too \" English \" for American tastes , but for me they really nailed it . Starting out with high energy numbers like \" I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor \" and \" Fake Tales of San Francisco \" set you up for a completely up tempo CD and then comes the quiet thoughtful reading of \" Riot Van , \" where the tune totally belies the lyrics . Either the humor is spot on , in titles like \" Perhaps Vampires is a bit Strong ... \" which is definitely not the sentiment in the song ; or wicked social commentary is clearly expressed on songs like \" When The Sun Goes Down . \" The band does a good job on both types . The only drawback is the music can occasionally get a bit repetitive with the same pounding guitars and drums for a few too many songs , but that 's a minor complaint compared to what this band brings to the table ; a fresh approach .","summary":"Someday everyone will catch on...","unixReviewTime":1240272000,"image":null}

Unfortunately one of those 90 's souls , Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver died early at the age of 48 . He has had so many great songs on his own , as a part of Velvet Revolver with Slash of Guns N ' Roses , but especially when he was with S.T.P. The songs he had back in the 90 's were the catalyst of his life . Sadly though , he died of those drug and alcohol problems , and his time in prison . Interstate Love Song , one his biggest songs from the S.T.P. album Purple is one of those songs that really brought out the best in his voice , and his spirit . He definitely drove from top to bottom in the song . It was really his best song , and the groups ' biggest hit . I think of when he was gifted with a brilliant and gritty voice . But to see Scott die early , just like Lane Staley of Alice IN Chains and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was no surprise .

Since their innovative neo - punk beginnings , Danny Elfman has led the Knights onto many musical victories , including his own solo projects , & finally , movie scores . Such titles as BATMAN RETURNS , BEETLEJUICE , THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE XMAS , NIGHTBREED & EDWARD SCISSORHANDS , are among his celebrated compositions . The name has been put through the guillotine , severed in half to display a highly crystallized evolution . A focus on heavier rhythm guitars have been added , giving the album a sharper edge . The cover displays an interesting little clown , deformed in his composit . The back shows some aesthetic terrorism as well . Now , this erubescent , modern - day Wolfgang brings forth a series of songs which speak from his satanic heart , of anti - assimilation in the jesting guise of conformity . Particularly noticable in the cantible \" Insatanity \" . where the voices of little ones valiantly defy xian indoctrination by recognizing its unnaturalness . Also exposed is the hypocrisy of evangelists in their two - faced , money - grubbing , sexually - twisted forms . Another favorite is \" Mary \" , which is the common story of a blossoming midwestern girl breaking the apron strings to see the great - wide - world . The rub here , is that she enjoys what she feels , & for the first time , comes unto her own realizations & conclusionsnow thyat her overbearing xian family is out of the picture . It is quite an emotionally - evoking piece , especially when the syubbornness of her unfortunately xoid kin is displayed . , in their unacceptance of her , when she finally finds something she really enjoys . Indulging in the pleasures of the flesh , & living a decadently hedonistic lifestyle which brings her satisfaction , & a sense of accomplishment . She was a bigger fish than they - she had ambition . I do n't think it was too much of a blasphemous coincidence that the name hosen was \" Mary \" , as in \" virgin \" . By the way , the violins are sublime . There 's also a remake of the Beatles ' \" I Am The Walrus \" , a fun song that has been played at many a frat party , no doubt . SPIDER is an enjoyable diddy about he who glares from the wall . WAR AGAIN is an inspirational tune about war & the adrenalyn & tragedy of battle . It inspires pride . It is powerful in its emotional evocation , as the words are definitely felt , greatly compliments the music . Overall , this release is an experience , which is rare in the pop-\"music \" industry , with their trivial , monotonous , monosyllabic , non - music blare . Like Elman 's other works , all which make an impression upon the listener , this is sure to please the discriminating , amalgamate , audial conniseur .","summary":"Sublime Insanity...","unixReviewTime":1084752000,"image":null}

When he records an LP , he obviously brings his A - game because one can hear it in his voice : He is focused when he sings and he means every word he belts out . He is one of the best male artists of today , easily . Foremost , because he has a beautiful tenor singing voice and knows just how to use it . He does not over - sing and he stays on key so well ! \" The Makings of A Man \" is one of the best albums of 2007 because it is consistent and there are some great tunes on this album . Most of the songs are mid - tempo and about women and relationships . Also , there are twelve songs so the album is not too short and not lengthy either . Jaheim will find some way to tell you that he is a reformed thug on each and every album . I know he is serious , but it 's a little funny that he feels the need to continually remind us . This time , his thug story is found on \" Life of A Thug . \" He exposes some of the malicious things he did during that juncture in his life , and if you listen closely , he was a pretty bad guy . This song is nicely produced ; I particularly like the horns . Also , the hook gives it replay value . \" She Ai n't You \" and \" Voice of R&B \" are great tracks . Vocally , he does a splendid job . The lyrics are meaningful , especially to Jaheim fanatics . He informs his listeners that he is very important to the genre of music called R&B , and he is . Keyshia Cole is my boo and she did well on \" I 've Changed \" , but that is one of the weakest songs on the album . The song is average at best . The hook is n't too good and neither are the lyrics or the production . Jaheim has included quite a few songs about his mother on his albums . Here , we have a song called \" Back Together Again . \" This heartfelt number has an emotional Jaheim singing about how his parents are united in heaven . It 's a lovely moment on the album . I hope I have convinced you to pick this album up , download it from iTunes , do SOMETHING ! I enjoyed it all the way through . Be advised , this is a laid back album . There are n't any dance tracks , just ballads and mid - tempos , but truly worth your time . Mikeisha 's Top 5 \n\n 1 . \" Just Do n't Have a Clue \" \n 2 . \" Back Together Again \" \n 3 . \" Life of a Thug \" \n 4 . \" Lonely \"","summary":"4 Stars.

Highsmith","reviewText":"It took awhile for Jaheim 's 1st video to grow on me . I would see \" Could It Be \" quite often on BET and finally after awhile the track began to grow on me . Eventually , I picked up Jaheim 's 1st CD entitled&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Ghetto - Love \/ dp \/ B00005899K \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Ghetto Love<\/a > . My favorite tracks included \" Looking For Love \" , \" Ghetto Love \" , \" Just In Case \" , \" Anything \" w \/ Next and \" Ready Willing & Able \" . His debut was definitely strong despite there being some filler amongst the 21 tracks . His 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Still - Ghetto \/ dp \/ B00006WKYJ \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Still Ghetto<\/a>&nbsp;got a tremendous push because of the 1st single \" Fabolous \" that was an anthem dedicated to the young kids that are growing up in this crazy world . My favorite tracks ended up being \" Diamond In Da Ruff \" , \" Let 's Talk About It \" , \" Beauty & Thug \" w \/ Mary J. Blige , \" Long As I Live \" and \" Me & My B _ _ _ _ \" . In 2006 Jaheim released his 3rd disc&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Ghetto - Classics \/ dp \/ B000BJ7CCY \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Ghetto Classics<\/a > . The 1st single was \" Everytime I Think About Her \" w \/ Jadakiss and my other favorites included \" The Chosen One \" , \" Like A DJ \" , \" Masterpiece \" , \" Conversation \" and \" Come Over \" . Just as review \" Musac Critic \" stated , Jaheim 's 4th release , \" The Makings Of A Man \" has Jaheim playing it safe for the most part . The 1st track \" Voice Of R&B \" is an introduction to r&b listeners who may not be too familiar with Jaheim 's work outside of the singles that everyone has heard . The track clocks in at less than 3 minutes and is a short but sweet track for Jaheim fans . \" Hush \" is produced by R Kelly and has Jaheim describing a situation where he unintentionally started messin ' around with a female that he knew was with a guy that he knew . Jaheim blames it on having a couple of drinks but now that the 1st time was so good , he is trying to figure out how they can keep things going without the guy finding out . \" Have You Ever \" is right along the lines of \" Fabolous \" as Jaheim is reminiscing to events that happened in the past when he was younger . You hear the familiar Kaygee sound that you heard on \" Ghetto Love \" as well . \" Lonely \" has Jaheim employing his own concept to the Bobby Womack classic \" If You Think You 're Lonely Now \" . The chrous stays the same but Jaheim adds his own lyrics to the verses and the other parts of the song . This is definitely one of my favorite tracks on this CD . \" Life Of A Thug \" will be one of those songs that if you heard Jaheim 's 1st 3 CDs that you have heard before . However , you will still want to listen to the track in its entirety . He talks about how his dad passed when he was 2 so all that he knew were the streets growing up despite having the guidance of his mom . My personal favorite track on \" The Makings Of A Man \" is \" Just Do n't Have A Clue \" . Babyface shows up to produce a nice midtempo jam using acoustic guitars and various other elements . Jaheim is trying to tell the lady that he is with that she has no idea about the plans that he has for her in the future as long as she realzies that he should be the one and only one for her . He states that he is better than the guys that she is use to so she should n't be afraid to give her all in the relationship . \" She Ai n't You \" has Jaheim talking about a woman that is n't girlfriend that treats him better than his actual girlfriend does . He even says that the particular girl 's love is like a Bentley Coup and his girlfriend 's love is like a Mercedes Benz that 's been used . OUCH! .. lol   \" She Ai n't You \" is another nice midtempo jam . \" Never \" is the lead single and serves that purpose well . Jaheim talks about resisting the temptation of love before because he did n't want to turn in his player card . However , after meeting this particular woman , that he is ready to burn the infamous black book . Keyshia Cole , who is 3 singles into her sophomore disc&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Just - Like - You \/ dp \/ B000VDDCHO \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Just Like You<\/a > , joins Jaheim on \" I 've Changed \" . Kaygee employs a nice sample in Atlantic Starr 's \" Let 's Get Closer \" and creates a nice uptempo jam for the prince and princess of \" ghetto love r&b . \" If you are a fan of either artist then this just might be your favorite track on this CD . \" What You Think Of That \" is another one of my favorites as Jaheim talks about how his \" Diamond In Da Ruff \" is making him feel . He 's not really caring about what the world thinks about the relationship and he is happy to have her in his life . \" Make A Wish \" is a midtempo jam that has Jaheim wanting to treat his woman to a nice time since it 's her birthday and \" Back Together Again \" is a nice song that talks about how his dad and mom are together again in heaven since they both left the Earth to soon . If your purchased \" The Makings Of A Man \" at Circuit City then you were blessed with 2 bonus tracks in \" Roster \" and \" Keep It 100 \" . \" Roster \" is the better track as the Kaygee produced track will remind you of \" Just In Case \" from \" Ghetto Love \" and \" Like A DJ \" from \" Ghetto Classics \" . \" Keep It 100 \" is n't a bad track , but you will clearly be able to tell why it was a bonus track . Overall , if this is your 1st introduction to a Jaheim CD , I would n't expect you to be a big fan of this CD . However , if you have followed Jaheim since \" Ghetto Love \" then you will enjoy Volume 4 of Jaheim 's ghetto classic series . He has a nice voice and you already know the type of songs that you are going to get from Jaheim so you should n't be surprised by the material . If you liked \" Ghetto Love \" , \" Still Ghetto \" and \" Ghetto Classics \" , then you should also own \" The Makings Of A Man \" . James ' Top 5 \n\n 1 ) Just Do n't Have A Clue \n 2 ) What You Think Of That \n 3 ) Lonely \n 4 ) I 've Changed w \/ Keyshia Cole \n 5 ) She Ai n't You \n\n Honorable Mention : \n\n Hush \n Never \n Life Of A Thug \n Roster ( Bonus Track ) \n Make A Wish","summary":"Jaheim returns with Volume 4 of his \"Ghetto Classics\" with \"The Makings Of A Man\".","unixReviewTime":1199923200,"image":null}

Unfortunately for Ja , he has n't found commercial success easily . Sure , GHETTO LOVE and STILL GHETTO went platinum , but it took time and airplay . Last year 's GHETTO CLASSICS landed Jaheim in the top spot of the Billboard Chart yet it only went gold ( and its chart stay was brief as well)and none of his excellent singles made a splash at radio . Sad considering \" Everytime I Think About Her \" and \" The Chosen One \" were both fine songs , among Jaheim 's most soulful . This time around , Jaheim lands at Atlantic and the difference is noticeable . Sure , Jaheim sounds as refined yet soulful at the same time , but the production does n't feel as bombastic or bright as it did on last year 's GHETTO CLASSICS . It 's not a bad thing , but despite this album being as consistent as any Jaheim album , it at times feels too safe and reserved . Vocally Jaheim is refined and never overdoes melisma , but you sometimes wish Jaheim would give just a bit more . The material is overall fine , but a bit safe . The opening \" Voice of R&B \" has a nice vintage soul feel to it with the horns and 1970s feeling production . Jaheim still possesses his street - savvy persona here despite the soulful underlying production . On \" Hush \" , Jaheim gets his R. Kelly on ( literally ) , though it is n't a complete successin my eyes . Sure , Ja pulls it off pretty good , but I think Jaheim is better suited with soul - samples and vintage production work - nothing against Kells . It 's not bad though , just different . \" Have You Ever \" and \" Lonely \" start to really heat things up while \" Life of a Thug \" truly brings the heat with its wah - wah clavinets , strings , and synthesized horn production . \" You Just Do n't Get It \" is n't bad , though the highlights that follow are incredible . \" She Ai n't You \" is absolutely beautiful and is my personal favorite . \" Never \" is a bit subtle , but maybe it is the subtlety that makes it so great . Jaheim vocal control is phenomenal here . \" I 've Changed \" features an as of late ubiquitous Keyshia Cole and proves to be solid as does \" What You Think of That \" . \" Make A Wish \" and \" Back Together Again \" are solid as well , if not as exceptional as the aforementioned best ( \" Have You Ever \" , \" Life of a Thug \" , \" She Ai n't You \" , \" Never \" , and \" You 've Changed \" . Overall , THE MAKINGS OF A MAN is Ja 's fourth consistent effort . Again , the material is good but safe in a couple of cases . This is n't a bland effort , but it is even less ornate than GHETTO CLASSICS and there is no \" Could It Be \" this time around . With that said , there are enough solid numbers to make this album overall enjoyable .","summary":"Another Solid Album for Ja","unixReviewTime":1198108800,"image":null}

I like the R.Kelly Produced \" Hush \" and a Jaheim vocally brings it , but the material he gets is hurting him and he seems to be headed toward the same path as Dave Holister another strong Voice Soul Brother who never got the right songs to compliment his overall range .","summary":"it's ok","unixReviewTime":1197936000,"image":null}

Every album he has put out has been at least good , and excellent at his best . I think Ja made a good choice in switching record labels and going to Atlantic , because at Warner he was n't getting any promotion . This was the first time i had to go to 2 different stores to find the damn album , because they were sold out at the first store . Jaheim is a breath of fresh air in the state of R&B right now . Because most of the R&B being put out right now revolves around Sex , partying , and drugs . And some of that is ok in small doses but to make a whole album around that gets old real fast . But Ja knows how to balance his albums between Love & Sex . He does nt over do it on this album , along with any of his other albums . But the biggest thing that i think helped him in the move to Atlantic , was that it introduced him to some new and better producers . This is the first time a Ja album has actually had a more contempary feel to it . Like the stellar Babyface written \" Just Do n't Get It \" , this is totally different than the Ja we are used to . This song totally sounds like it could be on the radio . Excellent track . Like on the R. Kelly produced \" Hush \" where Ja reminices about how he had an affair with his best friends girl . This album is alot different sounding than his previous albums , but its a good thing . While \" Never \" could possibly be played at weddings , he can still do songs that the thugs can feel to like \" Life of a Thug \" . And the other thing that i really like about this album ( This might sound weird ) , is that he released it in December . Which in my opinion is the perfect time for him to release an album because in winter , i always find myself listening to his albums . I do n't know what it is but during the winter his music just does it for me when i am driving around . Not that during the summer or whatever i do n't like him , but during the winter i always make sure to have at least one of his albums in the car with me at all times . I think it could be his just smooth but jagged vocals that just warms the air during the winter that makes his music so attractive during the winter season . And we all know Ja can blow , unless you are new to Ja , now is the perfect time to introduce yourself . And this album will be in heavy rotation for quite some time because it is just as good as his previous albums , if not better . Another hit for Jaheim ... as usual !","summary":"Jaheim- Makings Of A Man","unixReviewTime":1197936000,"image":null}

You 've heard about Christmas trees , Christmas presents , Christmas breakups , Christmas chaos , and in fact , you 've heard just about everything , until now . A charity single , and Rob Thomas ' first solo work ( a whole lot better than most of his later stuff ) , this song sings a hymn for peace and goodwill toward men , that 's not up in your face , unlike Mr. Lennon , and also unlike Lennon , there 's no anti - war message ! Nope , this song is a sincere piece of work , and one of Thomas ' best . And unlike his later work , it builds toward something grand , and when it comes to the chorus , it soars in a magical fashion that can only happen at Christmas . Overall , one of the best modern Christmas songs I 've ever heard . It 's a earnest piece of work , and at least when it first came out , the proceeds went toward charity . A underrated song that does n't deserve it , this holiday season , buy this , and hear a master at his craft .","summary":"One of the Best Modern Christmas Songs Ever","unixReviewTime":1204588800,"image":null}

I fooled you , did n't I ? This album really gets 2.5 stars . I just thought it would be funny if I ever gave anything by Mr. Browne the highest possible score . Anyway , this is slightly better than the debut , containing a whopping five good songs rather than four . I do n't think you need me here to tell you that \" Take It Easy \" is better heard here than by the Eagles ( Jackson wrote the damn thing ) ; \" Redneck Friend \" is easily the best of his few rockers , and its sense of humor is a nice change of pace from his usual overtly - serious style ; \" For Everyman \" is a bit overlong but has the best guitar solo Browne ever recorded ; \" These Days \" ( later covered by Gregg Allman ) goes from country - rock to relatively full - on rock ; and the slow - building \" I Thought I Was a Child \" is interesting too . But some of it 's more of the same , just one turgid country - rocker after another - \" Our Lady of the Well \" , \" Ready or Not \" , etc . Better than the debut , at least .

Cross","reviewText":"\" Saturate Before Using \" , \" Late For The Sky \" and this album ( and I suppose \" Runnin ' On Empty \" too although I 've yet to hear it - I ca n't imagine it would be bad , though ) are ESSENTIAL albums to ANY music fan . EVERYTHING about these albums is perfect - the production , lyrics , musicianship , singing ... etc . This makes perfect sense as Jackson was notoriously worried about getting everything perfect in the studio ( and his producers rightfully got annoyed at him for that ) . This paid off in spades , however , as everything is crystal clear and perfect even though this was recorded in the late 60 's ! A cool little addition is that the first and second as well as the 9th and 10th songs flow into one another ( very cool ) . The lyrics , as always , are extremely quotable , deep and meaningful - pretty much second only to Bob Dylan . Unlike Dylan , though , the lyrics are , like title of the album , \" For Everyman \" . As opposed to \" Saturate Before Using \" and \" Late For The Sky \" , \" For Everyman \" is the more consistent album - there are n't any \" bad \" songs ( not that the other two had bad songs , a bunch just were n't as good as the highlights ) . Another cool addition is the first track , \" Take It Easy \" , which is the original song which The Eagles then made into a monster hit with their cover version . If you were unsure whether you liked Jackson before , buy this album and you 'll become a fan ! For $ 9.00 this is a STEAL ! Absolutely recommended !

It is also a lovely , stirring , and   evocative song cycle that illuminates Jackson Browne 's unique vocal and   instrumental arrangements , and sends one running for the door to buy more   of the albums of the early \" JB \" variety . My personal favorites on this   wonderful album are \" Our Lady of the Well \" , a interesting and fetching   suggestion of Browne 's social and political concerns blended with a   celebration of the common rural peasantry of Latin America , \" Take It Easy \"   written with Glenn Frye of the Eagles and recorded by both Browne and the   Eagles , \" These Times You 've Come \" about an old pair of lovers who still see   each other romantically after parting , and of course , the combination song   cycle of \" Sing My Songs \" and \" For Everyman \" , which like \" The Deluge \" on   another album , sets out Browne 's fear of a pending eco - disaster and   apocalypse . Browne is still around , still creative , and still as socially   and politically outspoken , but this is one of his best early albums , when   he was one of the most talented and creative young folk - rock luminaries on   the popular scene , a superstar a long time in the making . This is a   ` must - have ' album for any real fan of Browne 's music and for anyone just   interested in top - shelf folk - rock music by one of the seventies and   eighties greatest popular artists .","summary":"A Terrific, Definitive Early Dose of Jackson Browne's Music!","unixReviewTime":963273600,"image":null}

Why does it have to be TSO under the spot lights and Savatage left in the dark ? Is it fair ? \n\n Do n't get me wrong but hey what s fair is fair , i mean i know Savatage members are still in TSO . Al petrilli left Savatage in the middle of Poets and Madmen album to join Megadeth then Dave Mustaine kicked him out , why take him back Paul O'neil ? Zak stevens ( Sang only in Beethoven 's last night ) left Savatage to be with the family and surprisingly came back and made CIIC band and being rude enough to come ask Jon Oliva for his help !

But the photos that adorn the CD 's layout -- She is more gorgeous and youthful in them than girls 10 years her minor . She has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world in fact . She is the living definition of \" young and smart and sexy , \" to use the catchphrase she coined for this album . OK , so I 've just now been open about my admiration for Jewel 's looks , but the question is , does she have the music to back it up ? The answer is an unequivocal \" yes . \" \n\n Some reviewers considered \" 0304 \" to be something of a misstep for the Alaskan born singer \/ songwriter , but I believe this to be one of her best albums . The opener \" Stand \" is a classic . It always brings me back to the first times that I heard this CD . One of her best ever . It and the other songs here demonstrate Jewel 's knack for making odd references in her lyrics ( see also the one to Charlie Sheen in \" Intuition \" ) that put a smile on the listener 's face and make for memorable songs . Beyond that , I love \" Leave the Lights On , \" a slower and more laid back track . One thing that was new to Jewel 's sound on this release was the use of electronica to create numbers tailor - made for any dance hall , something some fans of her past , more folkish tunes did n't take well to . I for one love it . Some of my favorite tracks here are the lesser known ones stacked at the end that are great for dancing or exercising to . I mean , you just ca n't get more catchy than songs like \" Yes U Can , \" \" U & Me = Love , \" and the rousing track where Jewel demonstrates her love for her home country , \" America . \" Excellent stuff . There is actually not one weak track or moment of filler here though and Jewel sustains the listener 's interest for the 53 minute duration of the CD , as only Jewel can , all the while proudly wearing her femininity and sex appeal on her sleeve . The only reason I 'm rating this album just shy of five stars is I liked the 2006 follow - up \" Goodbye Alice in Wonderland \" even slightly better . Still , if you want to feel young and smart and sexy no matter what age you are , Jewel will show you how on \" 0304 . \" Highly recommended .","summary":"Way underrated -- a Jewel classic -- 4 1\/2 stars","unixReviewTime":1252195200,"image":null}

This album is not unlistenable like others have stated , it is just very different than her previous records . But change is good and well Jewel sure had the guts to try something fun and new . Standout tracks include : the gorgeous , Sweet Temptation , the rock - out anthem , America , the sensitive , 2 Find U , and the first single , Intuition . Some of the tracks obviously do not measure up like U plus me equals love , very silly and repetitive , Stand is awkward but has cool lyrics , and the closing song Becoming is just plain boring . But i still give this album a high rating because i love Jewel , her writing , and her raspy and lovely voice . The best song of the whole bunch is track number nine , Haunted . This song is classic Jewel . \" The fury of my conviction will cause your heart to quicken .. \" Just a haunting song about a man stalking a woman .

To me jewel has done just that with this sassy peice of kwirky sophisticated pop . Each song on the album is a highlight with many different sounds . Intuition was the lead single with its accordian mixed with gentle pop \/ r&b beats , there are signs of soft rock material with \" 2 become 1 \" and \" America \" . Each song has its own identity , a very meaningful , simple song called \" fragile heart \" has the butterflies going with its gentle vocals and basic drum beat . This album is most definately in my top 5 albums of all time .

No one knows quite why Jewel decided to switch styles though many assume it was to crossover to the mainstream and sell more . Jewel 's fourth album \" 0304 \" takes a more electronica \/ dance approach than its guitar - driven predecessors though the lyrical quality is still there . The even weirder thing was that at the time of this album 's release , June 2003 , the big dance - pop bang from the late 90 's and even 2000\/2001 was over which suggests that this was n't exactly an attempt to ride the latest trends . Jewel was never known for doing what was trendy and this is no exception . The album starts off with the social commentary song entitled \" Stand \" . The song comments on numerous topics including policemen stealing and the mayor having no money because he spent it on \" hookers and hash \" . The lyrics seem to be trying to say that we can make a stand against all these problems . Next up is the first evidence of Jewel 's new style , \" Run 2 U \" . Everything from the internet - style writing in the title ( numbers instead of words ) to the dance beat in the background takes listeners away from what they thought a Jewel song should be but to me , it still works . The song is catchy enough that it will stick in your head but still maintains Jewel 's usual meaningful lyrics ( \" I need you for dark reasons , for greed and lust ... \" ) . Thirdly . We have the first single \" Intuition \" which seems to almost be a parody of the pop music scene . The lyrics are not quite as deep as people are used to from Jewel however it is one of those meaningful yet catchy songs that gives its message as it gets stuck in your head . While it is good to dance to , it still maintains the positive message of following your heart . Next is \" Leave The Lights On \" which is the first lyrically poor song on the album . I love the way Jewel 's voice sounds in the verses of the songs but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired especially since we know Jewel can do much better . ( \" If you want my love , you can try my love , you ca n't buy my love \" ) . It 's catchy and Jewel sounds good in it , but she can do better . The song after , \" 2 Find U \" reminds me of \" Standing Still \" ( especially in the chorus ) but that is not really a bad thing . The chorus is vocally good but lyrically weak . The verses are lyrically much better . Next is \" Fragile Heart \" , another love - themed song . It is probably closest to Jewel 's former style , but while it is a nice song on its own , it seems very out of place on this album . Maybe it would have sounded better on an album with more songs of a similar style . After that is \" Doin' Fine \" which is also quite poor lyrically as well as a somewhat clichd theme ( that her and her man are doing fine ) . This song is average at best and fails to really stand out . Then comes \" 2 Become 1 \" , and it is quite obvious what this song is about . Lyrically , it is mediocre and could have been much better . Jewel sounds very sweet in this song and this is probably my favourite song vocally , however in the grand scheme of things it is mostly average . Next up is \" Haunted \" which is told from the point of view of a stalker ( similar to Sarah Mclachlan 's \" Possesion \" ) . This song returns to the lyrical quality that listeners expect from Jewel though vocally it reminds me of Tori Amos . It is an essentially eerie - sounding song that is bound to creep out some listeners . Afterwards is \" Sweet Temptation \" which seems like a better version of \" 2 Become 1 \" . They both talk about the same subject however \" Sweet Temptation \" is much better both vocally and lyrically . This song is also much more catchy and memorable than \" 2 Become 1 \" . The next song , \" Yes U Can \" is probably one of the weakest on the album and is merely a typical dance track that nearly any singer could have done . Lyrically , it is not even up to Jewel 's usual standards ( \" Would you like to come along ? Then shut up and sing this song \" ) . While it is a catchy , danceable song , it does not seem like a song that Jewel would or should be doing . \" U & Me = Love \" is no better , either vocally or lyrically . I understand that Jewel is trying to branch out to a different style however she would be better off with quality songs like \" Intuition \" and \" Stand \" than this song or the one before it . After that is \" America \" , which is obviously another social commentary . Unfortunately , while I appreciate what Jewel was trying to do with this song , it did not work out too well . The lyrics are quite weak ( \" The Osbournes and Anna Nicole are too freaky to tell \" ) and the vocals are fairly standard . Lastly is \" Becoming \" which has better lyrics but really does not stand out too much . It is not in any way bad except maybe it was poorly placed . Overall Mark : 3\/5 \n\n While most fans were outraged when Jewel released this album , she actually has some decent dance songs that prove she 's capable of other styles . This album could have been really great if Jewel had stuck with infusing meaningful lyrics to dance beats ( as with \" Stand \" and \" Intuition \" ) . Unfortunately , towards the second half of the album , Jewel ends up using mediocre lyrics that any dance artist could have done . Up until \" Fragile Heart \" , the album was exceptionally well done for what it was supposed to be ( meaningful dance music ) though it faltered in a lot of places after that . Generally though , it is a pretty good dance album and much catchier than anything Jewel 's done before .","summary":"Different Does Not Mean Bad","unixReviewTime":1092268800,"image":null}

For one , the Amazon.com review said , \" Why pick on a girl for taking a chance ? \" This is a great album that takes her Jewelness to a new level . Her lyrics , while mostly pertaining to love , are still hers in the sense that she puts poetic thought into them . She also has some great message - bearing songs , and then just some fun ones with no need for substance ! \" Stand \" is the first song and is a great way to kick off the album . It talks about the sadness of the world we live in , how some poor people spend money on drugs and alcohol , there 's a lot of violence , and other horrible things . She also mentions how we can come together and make a change ! I really liked \" 2 Find U \" because it talked about the problems of relationships . Though there are mistakes that we make with our boyfriend or girlfriend , we have two choices when fights or things like that happen : 1 ) we can let the pain win and walk away forever , or 2 ) we can give eachother a clean slate & start over . Jewel asks for a clean slate in this song , it 's very bittersweet . Her voice is so cutesy in \" Fragile Heart , \" it 's funny ! She uses simple sentences and the childlike sound of her voice makes it amusing to me : \" If you want my heart , you have to promise not to tear it apart , 'cause my heart has been hurt a lot . \" It 's a cautionary song letting someone know she 's had lots of pain in the past and does n't want that now . I must say that \" Haunted \" gave me goosebumps when I first heard it , and still does ! ! ! Though Jewel 's liner notes say it 's about a stalker ( which makes sense if you look at the lyrics ) , I like to think it 's a very dark song about someone who Jewel wants revenge against . She describes how she will \" come to you in the still of the night \" and \" crush you with the burden of sight . \" The music is very creepy and slick , adding to the frightful feel of the song . There 's also a little clock ticking in the background , making it all the more paranoid and intense ! Remind me not to make her mad ! :-) \" Yes U Can \" is a song that really does n't have much meat to it lyrically , but is very fun to listen to ! It describes a club scene with cowboys and ' naughty girls . ' It 's tongue - in - cheek I think , kind of playing on words and stuff . Very good song ! I think \" America \" might be my favorite song on this album . It talks about the imperfections of our country , from the fact that our president wants us to ' shed blood in the name of liberty ' to the deteriorating quality of TV shows . She does n't just blast America , though , she admits that although she wants to change it she would n't leave it if she could . Yes , Jewel 's sound is altered here on this electronic album . But do n't think it 's crap because of that ; like I said , in my opinion it enhances her greatness . Though there are some very computerized songs , there are also ones that are closer to her acoustic style on \" This Way . \" I would strongly encourage every Jewel fan to give this album an honest listen ! I think it 'll be worth it !","summary":"Different yet the same!","unixReviewTime":1087948800,"image":null}

Now she 's reinvented herself as the American Kylie Minogue with \" 0304 , \" a catchy but overpolished collection of dance - pop songs . The more philosophical side of Jewel seems to linger in the slow - paced \" Stand \" ( \" It 's a shame there 's no one to blame \/ for all the pain that life brings ... \" ) . But that vanishes with the wispy \" Run 2 U \" and pale \" 2 Find U , \" both colorless dance tunes . Some of the necessary verve and power reappears with the catchy \" Intuition , \" bouncy USA - themed song \" America , \" and shimmying \" Yes U Can . \" A more gothic sensibility surfaces in the distorted , ominous \" Haunted . \" \n Nobody expects dance - pop to be deep -- all it has to be is catchy . And \" 0304 \" is n't deep . It 's just a collection of mid - level dance music , with mediocre lyrics , acceptable vocals and packaged electronic pop music . We 've seen it all before , but Jewel 's offering is n't bad . Instead , it just fails to be really good . When you hear Jewel 's voice , you can tell that all the flaws have been scrupulously polished out . In past albums , her voice had minor imperfections . No more . It 's not an exceptional voice , but neither is it bad ; it 's suited for the dance music she produces here , which isn ' too taxing . Musically , it ca n't be denied that \" 0304 \" is very catchy . Jewel flavors the dance - pop with hints of jazz ( the accordion in \" Intuition \" ) and replaces her acoustic guitars with electric and bass . Okay , the acoustic guitars are still there , but good luck finding them . Unfortunately the songs are essentially empty . Jewel has a good ear for rhythm and rhyme , but there 's nothing really interesting about these songs . They 're just ordinary dance - pop . ( \" If u want my love \/ u can try my love \/ u ca n't buy my love \/ just take my hand \" ) The only exceptions to this are \" Stand \" and the sinister , stalker theme song \" Haunted . \" Ironically , these two are the best of this album . \" 0304 \" may prove to be a mixed blessing for Jewel .

Though I am not terribly in love with the whole album ( it 's sure more pop than most of her past efforts , and it has no shortage of ' catchy ' tunes ) , the nonconventional lyrics are still there , at times , hiding disguised behind songs with teenage - like names , such as \" 2 Find U \" . The truth is that after the fact , the whole album makes you think twice as to her original purpose with \" Intuition \" , the song \/ video that has stigmatized her so much . But yes ! As a whole , it 's not tough to see that most of the songs are geared toward a more teenage audience , rather than the one that grew through College listening to her earlier work , but there 's a few songs for those of us that are in the latter category , such as the very Alanis - like \" Haunted \" ( in fact , it 's such an appropriate song to play out loud on a Halloween night like tonight ) and the clever \" America \" . Falling somewhere in between the preferences of the two groups lies the closing track , \" Becoming \" which I particularly loved . All in all , this is an album mostly geared to a teenage audience with a little \" classic \" Jewel to offer for her longtime followers .","summary":"Not her best, but not as bad as you'd think initially","unixReviewTime":1067558400,"image":null}

It 's not really all that different from the direction she had seemed to be taking with \" This Way . \" Remember \" Serve the Ego ? \" Remember \" Standing Still ? \" The tracks from \" 0304 \" are n't all that different . The production is just taken up a notch . Obviously Jewel has done something right because of the first single \" Intuition \" has become her biggest radio hit since \" Hands \" back in ' 98 . \" Inuition \" is definitely one of the star tracks of the album . Jewel has taken her lyrics and put them to a great pop beat and sound . \" Run 2 U \" is a stand - out also and is very catchy . My personal favorite * at least as of now * is \" Fragile Heart . \" It 's a light - hearted ballad and would make a great single .

This would be a great club single . \" 2 Become 1 \" is a love song similar to the title track from \" This Way . \" It 's a beautiful song as are all of Jewel 's love songs . \" Yes U Can \" is another fun dance track . \" America \" is a more serious track with some ear - catching lyrics .

Dispensing with the folk \/ pop \/ country undertones that often distinguish her music , but still lyrically on the same page , 0304 finds the singer beckoning us to the dancefloor . Granted , this is n't the out - and - out club record that some seem to be mistaking it for -- it 's not even nearly as cutting edge as the forward - thinking remixes of ' Serve The Ego ' that she so effortlessly breezed through . But , it is different enough from her previous work to seemingly brandish her a \" sell - out\"(other \n new members of this club include indie - goddess turned power popster Liz Phair , but that 's for another review ) . Which is too bad , because this is indeed Jewel 's best album -- in fact , it 's probably the best album Madonna DIDN'T make(and boy , she REALLY did n't make it with that folk - styled drink coaster otherwise known as AMERICAN LIFE ) . First single ' Intuition ' hints at things to come throughout the set , with a helping hand from Shakira producer Lester Mendez . ' Stand ' , ' Fragile Heart ' and the future club smash ' Run 2 U ' all bounce along with enough addictive melodies to forgive the singer for her still overwrought lyrical approach . And even if she falters somewhat by placing identical - sounding songs in slots ten through thirteen , it overall remains a more than solid musical treat .","summary":"Better With Age","unixReviewTime":1057622400,"image":null}

I honestly say that I love every song on this album and I never thought I would say that about Jewel . Also her sound is very \" Shakira \"   this time around which   is interesting in a way . She is going more rock \/ dance and every artist changes their style with every album but her words and meaning in songs stay the say . I congratualte Jewel on an album VERY well done .","summary":"SHOCKED!!!!!!!! For the good.......","unixReviewTime":1057017600,"image":null}

I actually liked her first three albums , but I wish I could say the same for her latest album , 0304 . I have no idea what 's going on with this album . It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying , because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club . Such tracks include \" Run 2 U \" and especially the leadoff single , the R&B - ish \" Intuition \" . The music on these songs is n't bad , but it just does n't sound like Jewel . If she 's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once , it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example . And when I listened to the rest of tracks on here , I noticed they do n't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other , thus making you almost wonder if you 're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album . \" Becoming \" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first : you or Jewel , and I do n't know what possessed her to come up with \" Haunted \" . \" 2 Find U \" is okay , but I liked it better the first time I heard it , when it was called \" Standing Still \" ( or the second time , when it was called \" This Way \" ) . Another problem here is the lyrics . Songs like \" Fragile Heart \" and especially \" U & Me = Love \" could have been rewritten a few times . I do n't know how a party joint got on this album , but \" Yes U Can \" deserves some serious fast - forward button pushing . I do n't know what Jewel was trying to do here , because the album is 54 minutes of confusion . Even the album title is confusing , considering it came out on 0603 . Maybe that 's not what it means , but regardless , Jewel dropped a major brick with this album . Hopefully she 'll realize this was a mistake and come back to Earth for her next album .","summary":"2-1\/2 stars -- Huh?","unixReviewTime":1055808000,"image":null}

I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago . Slowly but surely \" Intuition \" grew on me , it 's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism . I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to encorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music , showing that it is possible . It 's not a sell out either , since this music is n't popular like it was a few years ago . Not to say it 's bad by any means . The best track for me is \" 2 Find U \" , a nice love song . \" Run 2 U \" is another favorite . \" Leave The Lights On \" has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado . \" Haunted \" is another great track here . \" 2 Become 1 \" is a great love song . The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow 's second album , picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics , and including odd pop - culture references and name - dropping along the songs . This is still the same Jewel , just with dance beats . And it is her most enjoyable album yet .

She is not a sell - out ! I still would like her even if she was , but she is not , and I 'm happy I can tell everybody that . STAND is the ultimate Jewel song , very reminiscent of WHO WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL ? from those early days . RUN 2 U is a really cool upbeat dance track . INTUITION is that cool top 30 hit you 've heard lately . It 's classic Jewel . ( I love Ms. J 's big butt is boss - who do you think this is about :) LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON is a cool jazz - infused song . Ooh so good and Jewel - like ! 2 FIND U is a beautiful poetic ballad . A great new kind of song for Jewel , she sings a beautiful ballad like Celine would only she writes her own . FRAGILE HEART is another beautiful poetic ballad more Jewel - like in the vocal area . DOIN ' FINE is a cool upbeat dance record that uses the guitar in a really odd that 's different and very interesting . 2 BECOME 1 is an excellent song very beautiful even better done live acoustic but excellent on the album ; almost a sequel to 2 FIND U. HAUNTED is easily the coolest song she 's ever written . It 's truly haunting . I feel like I 'm stalking Jewel as I hear it and I feel bad for her , but I ca n't help myself . SWEET TEMPTATION is a really excellent track , more a rock ' n roll record than a dance record . YES U CAN is a cool upbeat rock record she originally wrote for Santana but he decided not to keep . I 'm glad he did n't , her performance is great . Such a cool song ! YOU & ME = LOVE is another cool upbeat song . AMERICA is a thought - provoking dance record about what we do in America , whether it be good things or bad things . She mentions plenty of both , and quite skillfully . BECOMING is a great ballad about Jewel becoming , as she constantly becoming other things . She is young , and she is still a work in progress , and she intends to keep acknowledging that truth . This is definitely her second best album to PIECES OF YOU . It is better than THIS WAY and SPIRIT only by a little but nevertheless if you get an album better than those two albums that 's really saying something . Folks , Jewel is hear to stay , and so is the ever - present guitar on this album . She is blossoming and you can see it in this CD , and she still has her guitar at her side as she 's blossoming . It 's beautiful to see her blossoming ! Get your copy of 0304 and experience the beauty of this CD and a glimpse at a special artist ever - evolving !","summary":"SAME OLD JEWEL WITH A REFRESHING TWIST!

The voices are very \" soft \" and perform in a gentle harmony . Contrast that with other versions that may have richer or bolder harmony ; this , however , stands well on its own merits . There are some jazzy riffs here and there , some soft , jazzy hi hat \/ drum rhythm in the background . I do n't think any one voice stands out on this piece , but together they work very well . Not quite the Lennon Sisters ( if you know who they are ) , but along the same vein . Personally , I enjoyed this piece and am pleased to add it to my Christmas music collection . If Lawrence Welk was alive today and continuing his show , I think you would hear this group performing this piece on his show .

Right before this album came out , 9\/11 happened . Cher dedicates the tribute song \" A Song For the Lonely \" to the \" Courageous People of New York \" who endured through the horrible event . When I last saw her in concert ( Farewell Tour , 2005 , Glendale AZ ) and this video was shown in the ampitheater , I was struck by the WTC symbolism and how moving the song was . This CD has a link to the video and it is definitely worth watching . I think \" Believe \" was a much - more commercially viable disc than \" Living Proof , \" though I think that \" Living Proof \" is a more powerful recording . It also took me a few listenings for me to really start to like it . It 's packed with great songs . I always thought that Diane Warren 's \" Body to Body , Heart to Heart \" should have been released as a single . The record company antics of releasing different versions of the disc in the U.S. and Europe are a bit tiresome : the European versions contained additional songs and short - changed U.S. fans . The same company did the same thing with the \" It 's A Man 's World \" disc in the mid-90s . It 's all about the bucks , I know , but enough is enough .","summary":"Cher IS living proof that nothing can keep this woman down!","unixReviewTime":1184976000,"image":null}

No , this one is not a compilation ; it is a studio recorded album . No , you did not read this statement wrong . This album is , indeed , another studio recorded album for Cher . The album is entitled , LIVING PROOF , and is her best album since that of   1998 's BELIEVE . The album is jam packed with great songs , including four hit singles that were released . Read on to find out more . SONG FOR THE LONELY The first single from the album . When I first heard this song , I was really amazed . I could not believe how incredible this song was . The lyrics are so strong and motivating , as Cher 's voice is strong and powerful . I strongly recommend that you all listen to this song first because 1 ) It is the first song on the album , and 2 ) Cher has dedicated this song to , and I quote from her album thanks , \" ... The courageous people of New York , Mayor Gulianni , Governor Pataki , and my friend Liz ... \" \n\n A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG \n\n   The third single from the album . This is a song that would be most popular on the dance floors at clubs and other get - together parties . This is definitely a kick - a * * tune . ALIVE AGAIN \n\n   The fourth & final single from the album . Awesome tune . NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU The second single from the album . \" A Different Kind Of Love Song \" is not the only song that should be played in clubs ; this song would also fit into that of clubs , where people can immediately get their groove on . This song has an edgier groove for anyone who wants to shake their a * * on the dance floor . RAIN , RAIN \n\n   Not bad . REAL LOVE \n\n   Not bad . LOVE SO HIGH \n\n   Incredible \n\n BODY TO BODY , HEART TO HEART \n\n   Diane Warren has written so many songs for so many solo artists since I can remember . She has written such songs as , \" Who Will You Run To \" for Heart , \" Love Can Move Mountains \" for Celine Dion , & \" If I Could Turn Back Time \" for Cher . This was another one of Diane Warren 's songs and Cher was happy enough to grace Diane 's lyrics with her music and voice . LOVE IS A LONELY PLACE WITHOUT YOU \n\n   Great . LOVE ONE ANOTHER \n\n   Back in 2000 , when Amber released her self - titled album , she had originally recorded this song . Cher took the courage to cover the song . The song is amazing in every way and I think Amber would be most proud of this version , even though her version kicked a * * as well . If you listen to both versions , you 'll notice that Cher had re - written the second verse for her version , as well as re - writing the last two lines of the song 's bridge . WHEN YOU WALK AWAY \n\n   Not bad . WHEN THE MONEY 'S GONE \n\n   Not bad . This is an album that I have enjoyed from start to finish and I do encourage each and everyone of you , who have not yet heard this album , to buy it and listen to it . I guarantee you all that you will enjoy every song on this album from start to finish . If you do not like it , than I 've done my part , while receiving the wrong response .","summary":"Cher: Living Proof (2001)","unixReviewTime":1115856000,"image":null}

The success of \" Believe \" directed this album to this music style . To start things up the leading US single \" Song For The Lonely \" is an anthem dedicated to the people of NYC or anyone who ever felt lonely , the lyrcis on this song are really strong , but , the strong resemblence to \" Believe \" make this song sound a little bit dated . The second single in the US \" A Different Kind Of LOve Song \" is another strong lyric song , with great definition , and more innovative beats than the first , one of the best tracks of the album . \" Alive Again \" tranceable , cheesy lyrics , but understandable , the second single overseas , not a great result . \" The Music 's Not Good Without You \" this is the first single overseas , has an old feeling to it , dedicated secretly to Sonny , great deep lyrics , sad sounding , melancolic , great results , \" Rain Rain \" , the more midtempo of the album , great feelin ' put in this , \" Real Love \" the distortion of Cher 's voice is overused here , not bad , but not great . \" When The Money 's Gone \" well , last single release , great dance tune , but the message is a little anoying .

The main difference is the US version has a track called \" When You Walk Away \" , and the UK \/ Canadian printings have a great song called \" You Take It All \" instead of \" When You Walk Away \" , and vice versa for the US . LIVING PROOF is a great album that builds on the strength of BELIEVE , however this album never really lived to its potential , it did n't catch on as much as BELIEVE did to listeners . \" Song For The Lonely \" was a song that really resonated with a lot of people , with it 's universal theme . In fact , a lot of the songs were like the ones on BELIEVE , with a message of strength and survival through life 's difficult stages . As a whole , this album is better than BELIEVE . The only tracks I could have done without is the R&B tinged \" Rain Rain \" and the Diane Warren latin infused \" Body To Body , Heart To Heart \" . The rest of the album is just great . I actually like Cher 's version of Amber 's \" Love One Another \" , more than Amber 's version . \" Love Is A Lonely Place Without You \" is like an epic ballad dance song , should have been a single . \" Real Love \" is a really funky Daft Punk sounding song , very european . \" Alive Again \" and \" A Different Kind Of Love Song \" are other highlights , with great positive messages .

The UK version features \" You Take It All \" , which in my opinion , is the best track of the album . Instead the US version has \" When You Walk Away \" , which is not available on this UK version . Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength , like \" Alive Again \" , \" Song For The Lonely \" , \" Love One Another \" , which all have messages of love and acceptance and moving on . Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding \" Love Is A Lonely Place Without You \" . The only songs I could n't get into are the latin influenced \" Body To Body , Heart To Heart \" , and \" Rain , Rain \" . The rest of the tracks are winners , however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than \" When The Money 's Gone \" .

' While this import may be a little expensive , ' The Look ' is totally worth the extra cash . Unlike many of the other songs on this disc , ' The Look ' does not contain a lot of computer enhanced effects , like the 100 % techno number ' The Music 's No Good Without You . ' ' The Look ' is set to a funky Flamenco beat that would have really gone over well as a single in the US . The lyrics may be light weight , but it 's just so much fun to listen to ! I do n't pernsonally own the Japanese version of ' Living Proof , ' but I have heard ' The Look ' a number of times . If you love Cher and Spanish - influenced music , buy a copy of this import .

It also contains Cher 's curious choice of song lyrics ( she only wrote one of the songs ) and her somewhat annoying singing voice ( only topped ( again ! haha ! ! ) by her annoying speaking voice and the insipid things she says ) . The problem with that particular album is she sings in a language Hoppy can understand ( English ! ) . This Japanese version is much much better .

Cher 's singing is confident and powerful ; and the songs are consistently excellent . This CD follows Cher 's 2000 internet - only CD of self - penned tunes , \" not.commercial , \" that Cher released on her own Isis label . For that CD , she lived in a castle in France and wrote some good songs like \" The Fall \" dedicated to Kurt Cobain and \" Sisters of Mercy \" that expressed her opinions on Catholic school . While we do n't see any saucy lyrics as Cher 's classic , \" You 're about as useless as Bob Dole 's ... arm , \" we do get the best commercial polish on \" Living Proof . \" \n \" Song for the Lonely \" is a hot rocker , timely in the wake of the World Trade Towers & Pentagon terrorist acts , \" When heroes fall in love or war , they live forever . \" The drums fall hard on this comforting opener ; and when Cher sings \" It 'll be all right , \" her vocals fly angelically . \" A Different Kind of Love Song \" is a cosmic rocker with a driving techno beat , \" We have living proof there 's some kind of light that flows through everything . \" \" Alive Again \" is a pulsating midtempo song of renewal , \" I only want to learn to freeze the flame . \" Throbbing echo chamber vocals resound through the excellent \" The Music 's No Good Without You . \" One of my favorite tracks , # 1 on my own personal top ten , is \" Rain Rain , \" an addictive soulful track . Keyboards and hot rhythm guitar lace \" Real Love , \" \" Time after time , you 're bringing me up when I 'm down . \" \" Love So High \" has more soaring vocals on this throbbing rocker . \" Body to Body Heart to Heart \" is an amorous full - throated rocker where Cher uses a taste of Spanish guitar that she employed so prominently on one of my favorite songs from the \" not.commercial \" CD , the gorgeous ballad \" Still . \" \" I 'll never love this way again , \" Cher sings passionately as the pace slows a tad on the beautiful \" Love Is A Lonely Place Without You . \" \" Love One Another \" is great cosmic pop with pulsing rhythms , \" Try to understand , open up your heart , a fist is just a hand , it can come apart . \" Keyboards wash defiantly on \" When You Walk Away . \" The CD closes with Bruce Roberts ' and Donna Weiss ' \" When the Money 's Gone , \" a funky rocker that is so endearing . Cher 's voice floats as she sings , \" What a fine life I give to you . \" \n \" Living Proof \" is musically excellent . Cher has fully moved into the genre .

So Cher shows in \" Living Proof \" that you do n't mess with success and use the same formula as \" Believe \" . Though \" Believe \" was a good dance album , it also got tiring very quicky as does \" Living Proof \" . The songs are good dance songs my favorite is \" A Different Kind of Love Song \" which is definitely the strongest song on the album and should of been released as the first single in stead of the dismal been believed and done that before \" Song for the Lonely \" . However all the songs sound like the same vain of \" Believe \" , and just get tired with the same dancebeats over and over . I do n't want to sound contradicting here , Cher is good , \" Living Proof \" is a well produced dance piece , however it would do better as a 12 inch vinyl single than 12 different songs . The other strong cuts include \" Rain , Rain \" and \" Love One Another \" which sounds a lot like \" A Different Kind of Love Song \" which is a faster version of \" Song for the Lonely \" which is a slower version of \" Believe\" .... Get the picture ? There is no new trails taken here , no new ideas , or sounds . Chers voice always the classic sound that Cher has is always in good form , and Cher is one of the best entertainers of all time , however \" Living Proof \" is just the same old \" Beliefs \" .

One Word that means so much . This latest cd is her best yet . \" Living Proof \" is the most appropriate title fore Cher shows in this dance - ethrusted cd that she can take on anything in her career and that she is here to stay . \" Living Proof \" is defintely the best produced dance cd EVER , with the following tracks ... \n \" The Music 's No Good Without You \" ~ The First European single , and the most unlike Cher song on the cd . I you did n't know it was Cher you would nt know who it was . \" Alive Again \" ~ Cher goes from super vocoded in track 1 to a super powerful voice in track 2 . So powerful that a radio station in Germany has chosen it for their Olympic theme song . \" Song for the Lonely \" ~ The first Amerian single and the most meaningful song is also very powerful and unlike Believe has no vocodor ( cherbot ) recrdings o her voice . \" Different Kind of Love Song \" ~ Cher said it herself ... its \" Vocoded to DEATH ! \" haha ... its awesome super dancy .. will be big in clubs \n \" Rain Rain \" ~ Smooth Ballad ... cuts the dance theme a little , but still miraculousely is dancy ? ! ? ! ? ! Only cher ! \n \" Love so High \" ~ Excellent song ... has to be heard \n \" Body to Body , Heart to Heart \" ~ Kinda like Dov'e La'`more . Very latin and very upbeat \n \" Love is a Lonely Place Without You \" ~ Great Vocals , Cher ! ! Super good song . \" Real Love \" ~ Kinda like Believe ... very vocoded ... excellent \n \" Love One Another ~ Remake of Amber 's dance song ... very good . Cher 's is far better \n \" You Take it All \" ~ Very slow yet very well produced \n \" When the Moneys Gone \" ~ Great way to end the cd .. one of the best songs on Living Proof .

Actually , I did n't know what to expect after \" Believe \" . I was on of those that had a \" wee \" problem with Cher going ' dance ' . Believe showed Cher in great vocal form from previous recordings . The songs suited her to a tee ( with the exception of \" We All Sleep Alone \" , a real nightmare ! ) and the production was quite good . My big surprise was the amount of careful work that went into this followup . The only reason this cd does n't rate a \" 5 \" in my opinion is that she could have done it entirely without vocoder effects and it would have still been great . After all , I buy her music to hear HER . \" Song For The Lonely \" will be as big , if not bigger , than Believe . And there are several potentials for Top 10 to follow . Check out the infectious \" Different Kind Of Love Song \" , the haunting \" Rain Rain \" , anthemic \" Alive Again \" , the 70 's   disco \" Love Is A Lonely Place Without You \" , and a great cover of \" Love One Another \" . This cd tops Believe without taking away from it . If you have n't got it yet , wait for the february release of the US version which will contain an additional track ( 13 ) .

Her music is a bit campy at times but nothing wrong with a bit of camp value . I was not willing to wait until spring of 2002 for the US release of \" Living Proof \" . I was happy to shell out the big bucks for her new album . Needless to say , the results were positive . \" Living Proof \" is ten times better than \" Believe \" . The material she chose to record is far better than most of the songs off its predecessor . Although I do think Cher overdoes it on the vocoder sounds on this cd , I was able to forgive her for that since every song on this cd is a winner in my book . I immediately fell in love with \" Alive Again \" which is one of my favorite tracks off this cd . I was completely surprised when I heard Cher cover one of my favorite songs from another dance diva Amber . Cher does a swell job at \" Love One Another \" . Unlike \" Believe \" , \" Living Proof \" is a stronger dance album . The songs are tight and the material was just right for Cher .

ON Believe Cher seemed to be more passive to the producers . Her involvement on this cd is very evident . She is there for multiple background choruses , and works all the vocals superbly . It 's great to hear a girl singer with a lower register , and a way with a lyric . The work is there and the power of the singer is up front . I personally find a few of the tracks her highest achieving artistially ever ! \" When the Money 's Gone \" is a wonderful rocking dance rock track that finds Cher earnestly questioning the fidelity of her partner when the riches fall ! It is a terrific track . \" This is a song(for the lonely \" is an anthem dedicated to the Sept . 11th victims and families , and she shouts it in plaintive cry , in the feel of a real rocker . It is full of emotion and conviction . \"Rain Rain \" , has a hook that stays after one listen , and the depth that makes you glad you remembered it ! Cher 's cover of Amber 's hit , \" Love One Another \" does not become a brides - maid to Amber . She brings a low decible sincerity that only a mature woman can pull off . \" A different Kind of Love \" Song , is just that ! AND .... Cher universally dedicates it to everyone , acknowledging love in a universal way ! Cher is no stranger to fame , and this cd will only add to her roster ! ! ! I love it , and so will you . Cher sounds strangely youthful in 2001 - 2 , and guess what .. It 's inspiring .","summary":"Cher is still the one! And More so than ever!","unixReviewTime":1007942400,"image":null}

Grindle","reviewText":"History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60 's . Much of it heavily based in fact . Most of this is of the psychedelic rock scene of that city . But there were some important hybrids too . A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that , especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk . Based heavily in what James Brown was doing at the time , they had an approch that could n't be more different if it tried . Right off the bat the album kicks off with \" Knock Yourself Out \" . This along with the witty \" Social Lubrication \" and \" The Price\",\"Back On The Streets Again \" and \" The Skunk , The Goose And The Fly\",with almost goofy lyrical exchanges are TOP before they were even closed to slick . The rhythm section is right out in your face , the horns are blaring right out and the vocals are as raw and unrefined as you 'd hear on any Kool & The Gang and James Brown album you 'd find during the period . Somehow or other though , there 's a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing . Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs . The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer \" Sparkling In The Sand \" . This is a very slow 9 + minute ballad that has much more of a jazz flavor with more prominant reed solos than anything else . It 's surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970 - with Sly Stone , Santana , War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions , that the music did n't overburden itself before it really got going . It 's a testement to the enduring power and stylistic elasticity of funk that that never happened . This and all of those bands prospered greatly during the era . And laid the groundwork for what is sometimes called \" united funk \" .","summary":"TOP Knocking Themselves Out Right Off The Bat","unixReviewTime":1343606400,"image":null}

There are a few songs here that I personally would not have included , ( \" their rendition of \" El Paso \" , for instance ) , while there are plenty of songs from each studio album whose inclusion would have been easily justified ( \" Wreck Your Life \" 's \" W - I - F - E \" and \" The Other Shoe , \" and \" Too Far to Care \" 's \" Streets Where I 'm From \" , for instance ) . Nevertheless , \" Hit By a Train \" is an entertaining listen from start to finish . In that sense , this is more of a sampler than a collection of their best hits . Miller has a tendency toward song - title puns that do n't do justice to the songs themselves ( \" Cryin ' Drunk , \" \" Crash on the Barrelhead \" - not included here ) , but this only points out his self - consciously clever way with a phrase . The band has obviously mastered the two - step ` train beat ' ( 3 tracks here ) and the hard - bouncing \" Texas shuffle \" ( which accounts for eight of the CD 's eighteen tracks ) , but it 's Miller 's lyrics that keep you coming back for more , even after repeated listens . Miller 's albums as a solo artist certainly hold up well , but it 's his work with Old 97 's that is most effective , which is why this collection works as well as it does . How can you not love an album containing \" Barrier Reef , \" \" Lonely Holiday , \" \" Jagged \" and \" Victoria , \" all on the same disk ? \" Hit By a Train \" encapsulates some of the band 's best moments , and hardcore fans of the band will want this if only for the non - album tracks ( the above - mentioned \" El Paso \" and \" Cryin ' Drunk \" ) , but casual fans would do well to continue exploring their catalog further .","summary":"More of a 'Great Sampler' than a 'Greatest Hits' Collection","unixReviewTime":1153094400,"image":null}

Fresh from a dramatic weight loss and looking like a million bucks , Peggy Lee was ready to go when she signed Atlantic Records to record a soulful set of great contemporary songs . Peggy Lee went deep inside , laid down a stunning vocal on the great \" Let 's Love \" which should have been a huge hit but shamefully received no airplay upon its release . Next is a spirited soulful version of Melissa Manchester 's \" He Is The One \" with a thrilling background gospel chorus with Peggy leading the way with a superb vocal . Sensuous and funky on a playful \" Easy Evil \" , torchy and illuminating \" Do n't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight \" , clearly Miss Lee is in peak form and very inspired ! A fresh funky arrangement make evergreen \" Always \" a delight while \" You Make Me Feel Brand New \" becomes a tour - de - force , making this the definitive version of this timeless soulful classic . Hot rhythm track sets gospel spiritual \" Sweet Lov'liness \" on fire while a haunting Peggy Lee original \" The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter \" is simply gorgeous . Soulful seduction make \" Sweet Talk \" a quiet storm classic which should have been a huge hit and mesmerizing achingly gorgeous Henry Mancini \" Sometimes \" is a sentimental classic having a special feel all its own . Bonus tracks are wonderful discoveries with \" I Am His Lady \" the best ever version of this soft - jazz treat . A ragtime arrangement make the Peggy Lee original \" I Wanna Be Seduced \" great fun and another Peggy original \" The Nickel Ride \" is a stunning classic that is naked and haunting . This unique original has Peggy brilliantly accompanied by piano only and the result is another great song that echos   Grammy Winner \" Is That All There Is ? \" . Peggy must have wondered \" Is That All There Is ? \" when this great release was received with such shocking indifference , robbing public exposure to a great work and Peggy acclaim she clearly deserved . Closing is a great circus like arrangement for a stirring \" Let 's Keep Dancing \" which was to be Peggy 's last major studio production and a winner it is ! This great song featured in \" Sharky 's Machine \" soundtrack should have been a big hit and would have been in better musical times than the musically directionless early eighties ! . Now if only Capitol Records would release the great 70 's \" Where Did They Go \" and the classic \" Norma Delores Egstrom \" , both featuring the iconic Peggy Lee in peak form , fans will be happy this legendary singer is finally given some justice for her great but sadly overlooked 70 's work . For those who enjoy great singers in a sublime setting in peak form , do not miss this classic collection , this level of greatness will never happen again ... special Limited Numbered Edition & value will soar when no longer available ... Thank You Peggy Lee for years of great entertainment and sublime vocals & classy lady RIP","summary":"Mesmerizing & magnificent...Bravo Peggy Lee!","unixReviewTime":1093824000,"image":null}

Nirvana , Pearl Jam , Alice In Chains , and Soundgarden were just so much better and created a legacy in the trail they left behind . Candlebox just sort of had a moment where people enjoyed the sound of Grunge so much they were desperate for more and they heard \" Far Behind \" and instantly called it worthy .

While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD , including an energetic \" 90 Degrees and Freezing \" , a Motown - inspired , horn driven \" Come to Me Do \" and a catchy and powerful pop gem \" Feel \" ( all penned by all - time great songwriter Robert Lamm ) , the record suffers from an over - abundance of ballads and sorry , over - blown production . I 'm not a producer , but I know what sounds good to my ears . I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album , but the ones on this Chicago album , the first recording of all - original material in 15 years , are simply not good , whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint . I wo n't go down the list , but will cite \" King of Might Have Been \" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff 's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range . I do n't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD , but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band , Rascal Flatts . No more to say as this speaks for itself . As confirmed by the band , DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording , and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on \" XXX \" . Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop \/ rock \/ R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings , a CD of Chicago - only songs would , undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on \" XXX \" . Finally , DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members , thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance . \" Chicago XXX \" \" could have been a contender \" with a different approach to the CD 's production . We 'll just have to wait for \" Chicago XXXI \" .","summary":"Just OK","unixReviewTime":1196467200,"image":null}

Stillwater","reviewText":"I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue , but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right . Now this is not a comparison about old 70 's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste , but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly . If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago , you might want to check this out , but I was dissapointed . There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album , but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs . There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd . I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on , but not that much . I did not like the producer on this album . Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards , drums , guitar , vocals etc that I felt cheated . I did not know who played on what track . My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced . It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious . I do n't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm , but it was way over the top ! The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance . The back vocals on the song \" Caroline \" sounded like a straight keyboard sample . Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop - machine ? They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it 's painfully obvious . I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person 's voice . Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with . These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets . I do not mind the loops , midi , sequencing , samples etc , cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster , and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine , but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed .","summary":"XXX (Rated For Certain Audience)","unixReviewTime":1177372800,"image":null}

While most artists get some criticism from me if they have too many ballads , this is one band that has been above that because they do the ballad so well . I love all of their \" second career \" stuff from the 1980s . I also have gone back to visit their earliest stuff -- including listening to and enjoying their debut \" Chicago Transit Authority \" album . Suffice it to say , I am a fan of all eras of this band . After listening to it numerous times , my conclusion is that it nearly stands up to previous material . I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that a couple of the ballads are a bit sappy even for them , and for sure the song order is strange with having all ballads followed by all uptempo numbers . I also see no point to having two versions of \" Feel \" on the album -- just stick with the trademark horns version . Still , I am overall very pleased with the release of this album . \" Feel \" is an enjoyable track ( whichever version you listen too)--very familiar but with a sound of modern production . Good single , although I do n't think it did too well chart - wise . Ballads like \" King of Might Have Been \" and \" Caroline \" would fit right on such Chicago albums as 17 - 21 with their beautiful vocals and overall melodic sound . Even the guest vocals on \" Why Ca n't We \" and \" Love Will Come Back \" are somewhat enjoyable and an interesting direction to take . \" Long Lost Friend \" is a bit sappy but for sure very pretty . I agree with those who say the second half of the album comes as a nice surprise in returning to the \" roots \" of the band a bit . \" 90 Degrees and Freezing \" is a catchy , fun uptempo number , and \" Come To Me , Do \" is a vintage - sounding Robert Lamm - sung track . \" Already Gone \" has some cool harmonies that are not so typically straight - ahead as so many Chicago melodies are . \" Where Were You \" , \" Lovin' Chains \" , and \" Better \" are also refreshingly uptempo and a lot of fun to listen to . Some have called this a \" safe \" Chicago album , and to a degree I agree with that . Many of the ballads in the beginning certainly fall into a familiar territory we have heard before . While I have never heard a note of it , I am further intrigued by people 's descriptions of the unreleased \" Stone of Sisyphus \" album and would love to have it see the light of day . I also think of such albums as the amazing one that Toto put out this year and wonder what a Chicago album made in the same vein ( i.e. , totally doing what they want to do instead of perhaps pining too hard for a return to radio single \" glory days \" ) might sound like . All that being said , for me this is overall a very satisfying release . I have enough criticism here with the song order and \" safeness \" of the album that I ca n't quite give it a 5 - star rating , but it is close . Call my rating 4 1\/2 stars for an album that should be very satisfying to ' 80s Chicago fans and also to plenty of career - spanning fans of this legendary band .","summary":"4 1\/2 stars---very welcome comeback but just a hair off from their best","unixReviewTime":1153612800,"image":null}

To me , their last album was \" Twenty One \" back in 1991 . \" XXX \" could easily be the follow up judging by the musical direction the band takes here . I 'd say this album is most identical to Chicago 16 through 21 . It has the streamlined , by the book , paint by numbers , manufactured syrupy saccharine assembly line power ballads and lite funk \/ jazz pieces you 'd expect from 1980 's era Chicago . It 's as if the boys missed grunge \/ rap \/ hip - hop \/ hip - pop and have released an extremely American Idol friendly album . That being said , the 12 songs are fairly homogenous and melodic . I do n't hear any hits here because all the songs sound like they could be made by any MOR \/ AOR band right now . The guest musicians do n't really add anything original to the Chicago sound . The horns seem more present with less keyboards . There is n't a truly awful song on \" XXX \" , but it 's just bland and banal pop , and nothing that could match Chicago 16 - 19 . I do n't believe \" XXX \" has anything that really resembles their 1970 's output , which is a shame , because there are still fans waiting for Chicago to really kick out the jams like they used to and sideline this David Foster - cursed pop they 've been producing for the past 24 years . I also felt it a waste of space to have two versions of their first single \" Feel \" . I listened to both and there was n't any major difference between the two , so I 'd go with the \" Hot Single Mix \" version .

Some die - hard Chi fans are berating this effort because it does n't duplicate the sounds of CTA - II - V - VII - VII ( Guercio ) or the 17 - 21 ( Foster ) sounds . I knew that Scheff and Champlin had the makings of giving this band new life , given the right production and management . This band has finally , ( under Jay DeMarcus production ) with XXX , come into their own . Of note , checking the Rascall Flatts website , DeMarcus profile shows that Chicago and David Foster were two of his major influences . The STRONG voices of Lamm , Champlin and Scheff , with the addition of TOTO members Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams , and the Rascal Flatts singers makes for as strong a vocal production they have done since Cetera 's departure , breaking new ground for the band . Instrumentally , the bands already strong skills are supplanted by   some of Nashville 's best hired guns on guitar and drums . Stylistically , they cover Trip - Hop - Pop , Power Ballads , Power Pop , New Country , Jazz Fusion , and Blues Rock . This kind of diversity is unheard of in todays ' music scene . \" Love Will Come Back \" with Rascal Flatts on vocals has the makings of a new country hit . Expect it to be the most added song to New Country playlists \n\n \" Caroline \" as the makings of a Power Pop anthem . Renegade rock stations stand the best chance of adding this to playlists . \" Feel \" , the first single , has the best chance on the Adult Contemporary scene , with its updated beat and production values . \" 90 Degrees and Freezing \" is a Lamm Jazz - Fusion piece which reminds you of the roots of the band back inthe 60 's and early 70 's . Maybe Jazz and Public stations will play this , too complex and tight for AAA , too hip and edgy for AC . Other material is very good , not just \" filler \" but it 's doubtful any of it will ever get airplay . All in all , a very pleasant surprise to critical listeners . No corners were cut on this production , and Warner \/ Rhino seems to be doing a good job at promoting it .

When I played trumpet back then , I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like \" Questions 67 and 68 . \" I even enjoyed their more \" lite rock \" phase of the ' 80s . But all of that was then and this is now . Their new \" XXX \" is not so hot . The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD , \" King of Might Have Been . \" It 's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of \" You 're The Inspiration . \" The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now . \" Inspiration \" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera ( no longer in the band ) ; \" King \" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing . The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus ( who ? ) ; \" Inspiration \" was filled with shimmering , subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster . \" King \" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune ; \" Inspiration \" is a classic that was co - written by Cetera and Foster . And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole . It 's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago 's glory days , but the fact remains that it 's a pale imitation . First , the album count has gotten shakier over the years . I do n't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection ( ex . , \" Chicago Love Songs \" ) should count toward the total . So really they are nowhere near 30 albums . Second , the movie rating implications of \" XXX \" seem to have completely escaped them , as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art .","summary":"Thoroughly mediocre; a shadow of their former glory","unixReviewTime":1142899200,"image":null}

The 2 - minute \" Political Science \" is certainly one of his greatest achievements , and the song is just as timely now as it was in 1973 . What makes the lyric so great is that it distills exactly what so many Americans think about the world . It could be your friendly next - door neighbor , who seems like a perfectly nice person until you stumble into a   political discussion , and then you realize that he is an immoral monster . It seems to me that \" Political Science \" should be the national anthem -- it 's what large numbers of Americans   really think , and if they disagree then they should be forced to change the attitude as well as the policies before they change the song . I would like to include the entire lyric , but here is a sample : \n\n  \" We give them money , but are they grateful , no they 're spiteful and they 're hateful . They do n't respect us , so let 's surprise 'em , let 's drop The Big One and pulverize 'em . \" \n\n  \" Boom goes London , and boom Pay - ree , more room for you and more room for me . Every city the whole world round will just be another American town , oh how peaceful it will be , we 'll set everybody free ... They all hate us anyhow , so let 's drop The Big One now . \" \n\n  Is Randy Newman being too sarcastic , too harsh ? Just look at the anti - French movement among the republicanus neanderthalis recently -- \" nuke France and gimme some Freedom Fries with my burger \" -- and it seems clear that if anything he is too kind . Thank goodness for Randy Newman in times like these . Along with Mose Allison , Stan Ridgway ( see my 7\/29\/04 review of his brilliant latest , SNAKEBITE ) , and a few other mavericks , he understands America 's dark side well enough to deflate its pretensions and hypocrisy   with humor , from the inside .","summary":"\"Political Science\" should be the national anthem","unixReviewTime":1102550400,"image":null}

He experimented so much , in fact , that \" Randy Newman Live \" was released as a stopgap in 1971;it also previewed 2 songs from this album in stripped - down piano - only versions . The \" alternate \" take of the title track on this reissue shows just how much Newman experimented . Pounding anthemic rhythyms gave way to more lush but not overstated arrangements . The final release was very much worth the wait . Newman brings orchestra back into the fray after completely abandoning it on \" 12 Songs \" ( most likely the abandonment came as a result of the use - and sometimes abuse - of orchestra on his debut album ) . Newman 's piano and the orchestra meld wonderfully in the mix . Some of the arrangements are downright amazing ( especially on the title track and \" He Gives Us All His Love \" ) . Thematically the album could not be more diverse : God , death , politics , satire at a Swiftian level , sex , and success . Newman 's ability to communicate cynical satire in a way that takes itself seriously without seeming self - righteous is displayed all over this album . When he 's funny he 's also profound . \" God 's Song \" is hilarious while at the same time chilling . The same could be said for the sadly still all too relevant \" Political Science \" . In the midst of these songs , the serious numbers are almost shocking . There probably has n't been a more candid song about death and belief than \" Old Man \" . Newman claims that audiences have walked out on this one , so he 's stopped playing it . It 's a great song , but yes , an absolute downer . \" Dayton , Ohio - 1903 \" evokes the era the song is set in complete with breeze and front porch swing . \" Memo to My Son \" is an absolutely hilarious song about parenting ; the character in the song promises to show his son how smart he is , and then rattles off clich after clich . \" You Can Leave Your Hat On \" has become a very recognizable song , maybe one of Newman 's best known songs ( even for people who have no idea who Randy Newman is ) . The bonus tracks on the reissue are interesting : \" Let It Shine \" is an upbeat and happy song more akin to Newman 's movie soundtracks of late . It was written for a sitcom that apparently never aired , which explains the mood . \" Maybe I 'm Doing it Wrong \" was included on \" Randy Newman Live \" ; this is the studio version complete with orchestration . The rest are demos of songs on \" Sail Away \" . All are good tracks that complement the album well . It 's no surprise that this album is considered a classic by many critics . It 's one of Newman 's best , and one of his best - sellers . A good album to introduce someone to Newman 's music . It was the first Newman album I heard , and I 've been a voracious fan ever since .","summary":"Have no fear, Randy is finally here...","unixReviewTime":1072569600,"image":null}

I have since realized that Newman stands among the great social satirists - and that 's everybody , not just the singer - songwriters .

Sherwin","reviewText":"This is easily one of the best CDs I have in my collection and that 's saying a lot -- I have a fair amount of CDs ! Randy Newman really blew me away with these songs and ballads that hit the nail on the head with so much social and political commentary -- not to mention satire -- while managing to keep the tunes catchy and easy on the ear . Randy 's use of major and minor keys enhances the songs all the more , especially in stellar numbers like \" Lonely at the Top \" which discusses quite frankly the price of celebrity ; \" Sail Away \" about slavery in America from the point of view of a slave trader in Africa during the time of slavery ; deep thoughts about God heard in both \" He Gives Us All His Love \" and \" God 's Song ( That 's Why I Love Mankind ) ; \" the evils of potential nuclear warfare in \" Political Science \" while pointing out that the people dropping the bombs would be too ignorant to realize that they 're ruining the world instead of making it a better place ; sex in \" You Can Leave Your Hat On ; \" \" Memo to My Son \" which shows how an older man really does n't know all that much about life ; the memorable \" Dayton , Ohio - 1903 \" and more . Several of the songs are also quite amusing such as \" Memo to My Son \" and \" Political Science . \" \n\n Another thing I like about this edition of \" Sail Away \" is that we get some fine bonus tracks not found on the original CD release ( and they certainly were n't on the original record album release , either ) . Listen for bonus tracks that are truly special like \" Let It Shine ; \" a studio version of \" Maybe I 'm Doing It Wrong ; \" earlier renditions of \" Dayton , Ohio-1903 \" and \" Sail Away \" as well as a demo of \" You can Leave Your Hat On . \" \n\n This is a must - have album for any Randy Newman fan and people just discovering Randy would also do well to get this so they can enjoy it as much as I do every time I listen to it !

Written by Stevie Nicks , it became the only U.S. number one hit for the group , and even today , so many years later , it remains one of their best known songs . That first LP went it 's own way years later , but was replaced with a CD copy . That one still surfaces in my untidy collection now and then , but when I saw the MP3 version here , it was an instant no brainer to grab it . That classic classic disc was the number - one album on the charts for over 30 weeks , and Rolling Stone named \" Rumours \" as the 25th greatest album of all time . Today it ranks as the 10th best - selling album ever , with more than 40 million copies sold to date , and it features four top 10 singles . \" Rumors \" won the 1977 best album Grammy , and even 35 years later , it today remains remains the band 's most successful effort , and ready to be shared with yet another generation . These are the album tracks on the MP3 version here : \n\n 1 . Second Hand News ( LP Version ) ; 2:53 \n 2 . Dreams ( LP Version ) ; 4:13 \n 3 . Never Going Back Again ( LP Version ) ; 2:15 \n 4 . Do n't Stop ( LP Version ) ; 3:13 \n 5 . Go Your Own Way ( LP Version ) ; 3:35 \n 6 . You Make Loving Fun ( LP Version ) ; 3:29 \n 9 . I Do n't Want To Know ( LP Version ) ; 3:15 \n 10 . it was on the 2004 remastered reissue of the album , but luckily for us , it 's still available here as a single . The quality of the recordings in this MP3 version are excellent , and the carryover from the LP versions are excellent . This was their eleventh studio album , and the recording sessions were marked by quite a bit of interpersonal strife between members of the group ; and these experiences showed up in some of the album 's lyrics . There are plenty of postings out there on the ' Net about the background behind this album , so I wo n't add to them here . Needless to say , \" Rumors \"   remains the group 's most successful effort , and for many it 's the best album they made . As a side note , the front cover of album featured a stylized shot of drummer Mick Fleetwood and vocalist Stevie Nicks dressed in her \" Rhiannon \" stage persona . The photograph was taken by Herbert Worthington , a friend of Stevie Nicks for over 30 years , and he and Stevie have collaborated on thousands of her best photographs over the years .

What 's It Gon na Be Santa \" is a re - issue of \" Chicago XXV \" , a superb contemporary collection of Christmas classics with a Chicago original mixed in . This new release however , adds six newly recorded tracks to the 14 on Chicago XXV , making an already good thing even better . The original selection of Christmas tunes is simply terrific . Chicago , following in the approach of \" Night and Day Big Band \" wherein the American supergroup re - arranged big band classics with an inventive and fresh variety of styles , tempos and grooves , takes a similar artistic path with their Christmas release . Such holiday standards as \" White Christmas \" and \" The Christmas Song \" are done in an uptempo pop - funk style while \" Let It Snow ! \" shows off Chicago 's ability to really rock in a blues shuffle groove . Bill Champlin 's soulful \" Have Yourself a Merry Little \" Christmas \" gives this moody classic a wonderfully original blues treatment . And , throughout the disc , the legendary Chicago horns play through trombonist Jimmy Pankow 's melodic arrangements in their unique , warm and fat style . The six new tracks really compliment the original CD , adding even more new styles and sounds . The disc 's opener , Bobby Lamm 's \" Winter Wonderland \" lays down an infectious rock groove with excellent vocal arrangements making great use of Chicago 's arsenal of superb vocalists . Lead guitarist Keith Howland who covers some tunes in concert , shows off his first studio lead vocal with a quick tempo pop rock version of \" Jolly Old Saint Nicholas \" . Bassist Jason Scheff 's tenor has never sounded better than on \" This Christmas \" , which has a wonderful 70 's soul retro sound with the Chicago horns propelling the arrangement . Bill Champlin again shows why he is probably the greatest blue - eyed soul singer around with a gutsy , funky \" Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer \" . It sounds like an odd combination , but this track really works . Following up to his terrific arrangement of \" Let It Snow ! \" , trumpeter Lee Loughnane pens a superb shuffle version of \" Sleigh Ride \" . Again , he steps behind the microphone to tackle lead vocal duties and his deep voice , reminiscent of the late Terry Kath 's depth and timbre lends itself perfectly to this classic . \" Chicago : What 's It Gon na Be Santa \" is just terrific and certainly one of the most inventive and eclectic holiday CD 's by any artist . There 's something for everyone here to enjoy . Essential holiday listening as well as essential Chicago .","summary":"Great Re-issue of a Christmas Classic","unixReviewTime":1103932800,"image":null}

Buck was an outstanding singer and his two part harmonies were his trademark . All these songs were No . 1s on the country charts and date from Act Naturally in 1963 to 1988 's Streets of Bakersfield with Dwight Yoakum featuring Flaco Jiminez on accordian . WOW !

But overall , the modern standard on tackling tough issues through music . The lyrics speak volumes , and succeed where so many other songs like this fail .

This twenty track collection hits most of the highlights of Yoakam 's nearly two decades as a performer .

If you 're looking for a cheaper alternative to Rhino 's 2002 box set REPRISE PLEASE BABY , this is a winner from beginning to end . The only disappointment is that with a running time of just under 70 minutes , they could have added the only two top 10 singles missing from this set : \" Always Late With Your Kisses ( from 1987 's HILLBILLY DELUXE ) and \" I Got You \" ( from 1988 's BUENAS NOCHES FROM A LONELY ROOM ) .

I guess a few purists will ignore him , but not many - there are n't many country singers now whose music owes so much to tradition while still selling in large quantities . This compilation covers the whole of career to date , including eight tracks from his compilation of eighties hits ( Just looking for a hit ) , eight tracks from his compilation of nineties hits ( Last chance for 1,000 years ) , Things change ( from A long way home ) , I want you to want me ( from Tomorrow 's sounds today ) and two tracks from Population me ( Late great golden state , Back of your hand ) . Thus , there is no new material here , but this compilation is the strongest single CD of Dwight 's music so far released . Inevitably , some classic songs have been omitted , one example being The heart that I own . Most of the songs here are originals but Dwight has recorded many fine covers , represented here by Little sister and Suspicious minds ( both Elvis Presley ) and Crazy little thing called love ( Queen ) .

Grindle","reviewText":"So much controversy has been generated regarding the creative merrit of this album that I truly believe it 's many enjoyable qualities have been forgotton . Not only that but their are many excellent creative elements to this music as well that are even still ignored to this day for the same reason . So instead of concentrating on this album for what it is n't I 'll focus this review on what it is . Throughout his career it 's important to understand that George Benson was always on the cutting edge of vocal soul - pop \/ jazz . Even his earliest albums such as&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/The - George - Benson - Cookbook \/ dp \/ B0012GMW5W \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">The George Benson Cookbook<\/a>&nbsp;featured Benson singing pop songs of the day so I am not going to criticize him on this album for doing what he 'd always done . The main thing that makes the difference here is that George Benson is modernizing his poppy funk - jazz here for the mid 70 's and in terms of music , song selections and just his renowned playing and singing this album certainly takes the cake there . It 's not very long in it 's entirety but the fairly long cuts that are here are all excellent each in different ways and aside from two one vocal number the instrumentals that dominate this recording give enough time for everyone , especially Benson to strech out instrumentally . No matter how many times I 've heard the title song of this album , as far as I know one of only a select few instrumentals associated with Bobby Womack and aside from the rather pretty melody these days I actually really enjoy the bluesy sort of licks gets on the final verses of the song . After having heard the original of \" This Masquerade \" on Leon Russell's&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Carney \/ dp \/ B000002U04 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Carney<\/a>&nbsp;it gives new meaning to this one . Leon 's had a deep bayou flavor to it wheras George Bensosn presents the song as something of an American pop standard with the darkness of the melody baught up to the surface even more along with George 's guitar - scating signiture almost making the song into a Benson original as opposed to an interpretation . In fact the only Benson original here is the instrumetal \" So This Is Love ? \" which , much like \" Lady \" and the Jose Feliciano cover \" Affirmation \" all get a great balance between soul - jazz , funk and R&B with a tempo and rhythm that variates enough to keep it really interesting and involving . \" Six To Four \" is a great pop \/ funk that 's a bit more uptempo and upbeat than the rest of the album and provides a nice change of pace . This album , all and all is not altogether as pop oriented as you might expect despite Claus Ogerman 's flowery string arrangements and the upfront melodies and it actually serves it 's purpose very well in that regard . There are plenty of very musical licks from George , Phil Upchurch and everyone else involved in the making of this album so it 's not just a commercial triumph for Benson but he did n't totally compromise himself artistically either .","summary":"Benson In A Masquerade","unixReviewTime":1273708800,"image":null}

He also won a ' Best Pop Instrumental Performance ' Grammy that same year for \" Breezin ' \" and this was the song I remember being all over the radio back then . But the guitar work on that particular song is nothing compared to what he throws down on the excellent ( and proper jazz ) songs , \" Affirmation \" and \" So This Is Love ? \" But those two are just my favourites . All six tunes are great and this is another of those CDs I put on repeat anytime I play it . One listen is very rarely ever enough . Great production by the celebrated Tommy LiPuma with the orchestra arranged and conducted by the equally legendary Claus Ogerman . It rarely gets any better .

It introduced a style of jazz that was inflected with r&b stylings that made it appealing to a mass audience who necessarily did n't like the genre . The album hit number one on the Top 200 & r&b charts and stayed at number one on the jazz charts for over a year . The album was spurred on by Mr. Benson 's smooth and elegant cover of \" This Masquerade \" which peaked at number 10 and went on to win the 1976 Grammy for Record of the Year . But in addition to that great track , the album had five other gems including the appropriately titled title track which has a light , airy Latin vibe , the straight jazz of \" Six To Four \" and the sophistication of \" Lady \" .

So when this album came out , in all it 's velvet splendor - it sported a velvet cover , but no single to back it up . After 45 years , I finally downloaded and listened to it , and there were some songs that could have been singles , although they departed from the ' formula ' because they went in a slightly ' country ' direction , an idea from one of the non brother members of the band . The 5 piece band was disintegrating with Robin leaving the group after this release\/   They would come back stronger in the 70 's , but they kept on recording up until the death of the twins . The only song that may be familiar is First of May , but the music and lyrics are top notch . The boys were finding their own voices and style . But when you consider all the good music coming out in ' 69 - Abbey Road , The who , the San Francisco sound was coining to flourish on the charts , this one , probably also because of it 's cost ' was ignored . Maybe that 's why it 's so endearing now , considering that the guys were Justine Beiber and Miley Cyrus 's age when they produced this .

It was by far their most ambitious release and was had a red - flocked cover and included a poster and sticker . At a certain point the title \" Masterpeace \" was considered . The band was still a 5 - piece band at the beginning of the recordings , but before the release of the album in 1969 , guitarist Vince Melouney had left the group . Though not a direct concept album there are themes about the ship Odessa that runs though the songs . Apart from some long , mostly instrumental orchestral pieces , the music is not really that different from the group 's previous releases . To be regarded as a real classic I find the album too uneven , with too many average songs . There are of course a lot songs , too , that ranks with the very best of their early works . I have always liked their music best without the big arrangements that often burdened good songs too much . Simple songs with great melodies like , \" Sudddenly \" , \" You 'll Never See My Face Again \" and \" I Laugh in Your Face \" are still my favourites . I also used to like \" Marley Purt Drive \" , but it seems the songs has n't aged that well . Among the classic ballads \" Lamplight \" is outstanding , and \" Melody Fair \" and \" First of May \" are both great songs . This 3 CD version contains both mono and stereo versions of the original album , and the third CD contains some very interesting alternate versions along with some previously unreleased songs . Many of these are almost as good as the well - known versions , and a few maybe even better ; I especially like the alternate mix of \" You 'll Never See My Face Again \" . The song \" Barbara Came to Stay \" , is the same tune as \" Edison \" , with different lyrics , and also one of the great additions . For fans of the group , this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums , of course is must .

Released at the height of their first popularity and the start of their ultimate eighteen - month breakup , these three musicians , barely out of their teens , produced their only double studio album . Originally coated in a red velvet cover , this is one of the most extravagant re - releases to date . Originally seventeen songs , varying from the near operatic , \" Odessa ( City On The Black Sea ) \" to country flavored tunes like , \" Marley Purt Drive \" and \" Give Your Best \" , the Gibbs cover nearly every style of pop music available , including rock , orchestral , country and R&B. \n\n Originally slated to be titled , \" An American Opera \" or \" Masterpeace \" , this double album epitomizes the height of talent of the Bee Gees boundless creativity . In addition to two new studio songs , \" Pity \" and \" Nobody 's Someone \" , there are alternate and demo mixes that will surprise in their originality , beat and alternate verses . \" Edison \" , \" Lamplight \" , First Of May \" and \" Whisper , Whisper \" all are given special treatment , sometimes twice . \" Whisper , Whisper \" is actually Part Two , a welcome addition to a song that originally ended too quickly on a fast , rock driven pace . Of the three discs ( 57 songs ) , the stereo had been remixed \/ remastered to absolute , crystal clear perfection , bringing out all the muffled sounds that the original LP contained . The Mono mixes present the songs with emphasis on different vocals and instruments , while the third disc contains all the previously unreleased material . Fan Joe Brennan of website \" Gibb Songs \" has this great explanation of Stereo vs. Mono recordings :   \" Odessa was recorded on 1 - inch 8 - track tape reels . Each of the 8 tracks can be played separately , and each might have the input from one or more microphones . Each of the 8 could be recorded at different times and places ( like New York and London ) , or erased and re - recorded . To make stereo , you have to mix down to 2 tracks , and for mono , mix down to 1 track . While doing this you get to decide how relatively loud each track should be . The source is the same 8 track master . Mono was for old record players , and for AM radio , which was where you heard the latest tunes on your transistor radio or car radio \" . With three discs , a poster , extensive liner notes , photographs of the group , handwritten lyrics , single covers and reel - to - reel listings , a T - Shirt and a sticker all enclosed in a nifty red velvet covered box , this limited edition is a fan and collector 's dream .","summary":"Masterpiece!

Now available on a single CD , it marks the end of the sixties period for the Bee Gees . This was an important time for the Gibbs ' who were maturing ( at ages 19 and 21 ) and already millionaires . The music was conceptual and starting with the title track , it delivers with powerful orchestration and emotional , lyrical simplicity . It is a skewed look at a fabled seafarer lost at sea and emotionally destitute . At least , that 's what the project started out to be . Somewhere during the recordings , egos flared and tempers snapped , so what you ended up with is a collection of half Bee Gees conceptual songs and half individual Gibb contributions . It is still a remarkable recording ! \n Stand - out cuts are \" Marley Purt Drive \" that could have been recorded by \" The Band \" and \" Melody Fair \" , a single in some countries and a well covered track . Most of the other tracks deal with period issues like , drugs , sex , rock ' n roll , psychodelia and why not ? Producer Stigwood unwittingly fueled the tensions by choosing \" First Of May \" as the A - Side single instead of B - Side \" Lamplight \" , which was just as strong . Regardless , the final outcome is a conceptual album filled with an orchestrally sweeping moodiness aligned with perfect harmonies and lyrics envied by everyone . This is one of the few albums of the period with orchestral solos with the Gibbs providing the chorus . It is monumental .","summary":"Beatles Were White - Bee Gees Were Red","unixReviewTime":991872000,"image":null}

There is a very large number of awesome songs as a part of this hit compilation , but the ones I enjoyed the most were \" Wake Up , Little Susie \" , \" All I have to do is Dream \" , \" Love of my life \" and \" Take a Message to Mary \" .","summary":"Big influence for things to come","unixReviewTime":1061337600,"image":null}

Sherwin","reviewText":"England Dan & John Ford Coley \" were an American pop rock duo composed of Danny Wayland ` England Dan ' Seals and John Edward ` John Ford ' Coley . Native Texans , the duo released eleven albums and nine singles in their career and are best known for their 1976 single , ` I 'd Really Love to See You Tonight , ' a number 2 pop hit and number 1 Adult Contemporary hit . After they disbanded , Seals began performing as Dan Seals and launched a country music career through the 1980s which produced 11 No . 1 hits . \" Another reviewer writes that England Dan & John Ford Coley 's music was along the lines of \" light pop \" with \" a touch of folk ; \" and I agree ! These five tracks are some of their very best music ; I love the way they performed so well ! England Dan & John Ford Coley could harmonize flawlessly and their melodies were easy on the ear and memorable as well . \" I 'd Really Love to See You Tonight \" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and it still sounds great in our time ! \" Nights Are Forever Without You \" is a little masterpiece that is timeless ; it has great electric guitar work and the arrangement overall is very strong . They cover Todd Rundgren 's \" Love Is the Answer \" so well that Todd would surely approve and \" It 's Sad to Belong \" is very poignant . The track set ends with England Dan & John Ford Coley performing their awesome \" We 'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again ; \" this is yet another evergreen classic that I could never tire of hearing ! Big fans of England Dan & John Ford Coley will probably have most if not all of these songs already , so I think this music is best geared toward more casual fans and people just discovering their artistry . True , it 's very sad that Dan Seals passed away all too young ; but he does live on through his music . I highly recommend the beautiful songs of England Dan & John Ford Coley .","summary":"England Dan & John Ford Coley: their music still amazes me","unixReviewTime":1354320000,"image":null}

The other four songs are beautifully harmonized top tens from the late 70 's , and to this day \" Nights Are Forever \" and \" I 'd Really Love To See You Tonight \" hold a certain simple innocence . These songs and his eventual starring turn as a country artist show how much talent the man had and how underrated his work has been .","summary":"Never Have to say Goodbye","unixReviewTime":1238025600,"image":null}

Hedges","reviewText":"\" Smoke on the Water , \" originally from the great Deep Purple album \" Machine Head , \" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat . This somewhat extended version , recorded live in Japan , has , if anything , even more energy than the original . Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple 's catalogue , the song chronicles an actual event . In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux , Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones . During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4 , a fan set off a flare gun , setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground . The flames and smoke drifted over the lake , while the members of Deep Purple watched . The band then had to scramble for a venue to record \" Machine Head \" in , and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel . The song is quite an accurate piece of history , and definitely one of the heaviest , most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded . The song has appeared in various versions ( the most amusing is from Pat Boone 's \" In a Metal Mood , \" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar ) on many albums . I love live music , and highly endorse this version , and I also recommend \" Machine Head \" ( the \" Best Hits \" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price . ) One thing 's certain , though : no musical library should be without this staple .","summary":"Flames From Switzerland To Japan","unixReviewTime":1271203200,"image":null}

Their music is awesome ! \" Summer Breeze \" has a terrific soft rock flavor to it ; this mellow tune could n't have been done any better and it remains a classic song . Like \" Summer Breeze , \" \" Get Closer \" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and just one listen will tell you why -- this sweet tune is catchy and very well performed by Seals & Crofts . \" Hummingbird \" is easy on the ear and \" Diamond Girl , \" as mentioned above , was one of their biggest hits ever . The five tracks end with Seals & Crofts performing the poignant \" We May Never Pass This Way ( Again ) ; \" it 's very impressive ! This is not only an excellent introduction to Seals & Crofts ; it 's also great for the rather casual fan who may not have all of these tracks already -- this music is here for download !

Also , two weeks before those concerts , a member of the Monkees touring crew recorded one of their concerts , probably for his own use . As far as I know , these four concerts are the only recordings of Monkees concerts from the 1960s that exist . Unfortunately , the exact same songs were played in the exact same order at all four shows . Which is not to say that the concerts are exactly the same . The Monkees make different mistakes at each of the concerts . Sometimes they sing the wrong lyrics , sometimes they play the wrong notes . And there are often technical problems with the microphones and instruments . Probably the major difference other than the mistakes is in the ad libs that the Monkees say during the concerts . They even occasionally ad lib a few lines from songs like \" Singin ' in the Rain \" , \" There 's No Business Like Show Business \" and \" Act Naturally \" . So , is it worth owning copies of all four concerts ? Not really , unless you 're an absolute Monkees fanatic .

The \" founding members included guitarist \/ vocalist David Pack , bassist \/ vocalist Joe Puerta , keyboardist Christopher North , and drummer Burleigh Drummond , fused symphonic art rock with a slickly produced pop sound . The group was discovered in 1971 by Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor Zubin Mehta , who featured Ambrosia as part of a so - called All - American Dream Concert . However , it took them four more years to get a record contract ; Ambrosia was released in 1975 and spawned the chart singles ` Holdin ' on to Yesterday ' and ` Nice , Nice , Very Nice . ' \" \n\n These five tracks by Ambrosia give us just some of their best ; this is great for casual fans and people just discovering their beautiful music . \" Biggest Part of Me \" was a big hit and it still gets airplay in our times ; Ambrosia performs this with a lot of genuine passion and the music fits in perfectly with their vocals -- great ! \" How Much I Feel \" was another hit for the group and just one listen tells you why ; this is a charming tune . \" Holdin ' on to Yesterday \" is yet another awesome song by this band and it all holds its own very well . \" Nice , Nice , Very Nice \" is easy on the ear and the track set ends with Ambrosia performing their fine \" You 're The Only Woman ( You & I ) . \" Now THIS is great music !

However , next to \" Roundablut , \" \" Light My Fire \" sounds positively earthbound ( not that that 's a bad thing ) . Maybe the Doors and Yes should have swapped lead singers , just as an experiment . I can imagine Jon Anderson singing \" The End , \" but I ca n't imagine Jim Morrison singing \" Roundabout . \" There , have I typed enough words for this to qualify as a review ?","summary":"Son of \"Light My Fire\"","unixReviewTime":1427328000,"image":null}

For some reason , I have heard billie jean by Michael Jackson on the radio enough times for the song to grow on me . I m taking it that billie jean by Michael Jackson symbolizes the journey of a man coming to terms with being the father of a woman who became pregnant at an extremely young age ( I m guessing a teenager ) due to the lyrics she is just a girl . He does not want to believe that he is the father , but he sees that he probably is due to singing about looking at the babys eyes that remind him of his own eyes . From my humble opinion , Billie jean by Michael Jackson still does touch on a relevant issue today because the common societal message that is still being sent is that every woman who is someone becomes a mother , and I do believe that many teenage females subconsciously take in this message and internalize it . I just happen to have made my own decision on what I was going to do after my teenage years when I was tasked with helping my adoptive mother look after the younger children in her care . I have an open mind when it comes to teenage mothers because I myself was born to a woman who had just turned 16 8 days before my entrance into this world . However , that is all that I m going to say for now for a compelling song that touches on a topic that is not going to go away anytime soon .","summary":"classic Michael Jackson pop song","unixReviewTime":1420675200,"image":null}

I listen to radio mostly and frequently I get tired of the same stuff and definitely tired of the over - played stuff ( even if it 's a great beat like Lady Gaga 's \" Poker Face \" ) . I 've never heard of Franz Ferdinand and I first heard \" Take me out \" on Amazon . The more I review songs the more I 'm aware of my alternative music tastes ( especially alternative music reminiscent of 1990 's alternative ) . For me , good alt - music has a rock beat with a twist -- something different , unexpected , experimental even . I think this can be subtle or obvious and very subjective definitely ( in the eye of the beholder or the ear in this case ) . Sometimes a repetitive beat is annoying ( one reason modern country music does n't do it for me ) ; but sometimes it 's classic ( like Elvis Costello 's \" Pump it up , \" Chuck Berry 's \" Johnny B. Goode , \" or Elvis Presley \" That 's Alright Mama \" and even some old - skanky - country like Hank Williams ' \" I 'm so lonesome I could cry\"--old - skanky - country is a term of endearment made up entirely by me ) . By no means am I comparing \" Take me out \" to the classics , I 'm trying to explain how I base my reviews . What caught my ear on \" Take me out \" was the initial repetitive rock beat ( it 's fast with a hint of punk ) guitar and drums dominate ; it 's a great mix with the singer 's voice ( is he singing or screaming -- it 's hard to tell , there 's an angry sound to his voice which is fitting with the punk aspect of the music ) . A minute into it , the beat transitions to a slower , deeper , harder rock sound ( hm , interesting choice of words yes ? If good music does n't make you think sex , maybe it 's not good music . Anyway , a very sexy transition IMO ) . There is n't much variety in the lyrics or rhythm for that matter ; but sometimes that just does n't matter . The beat keeps the song moving along . The lyrics do borderline on the monotonous but it 's an easy song to sing to -- maybe Franz does n't have much to say . It 's the only song I 've listened to from Franz Ferdinand . I like it , a lot . With Amazon 's 20 million songs , there is so much to listen to ! I rated this song 5 stars because I am very happy with my purchase . I love songs that are a change from the mainstream .","summary":"Music gem from unknown artist (unknown to me at least)","unixReviewTime":1344384000,"image":null}

For Billy Joel , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still sound just as vibrant and distinctive as they did when they first came out back in the 70 's , the 80 's , and even the 90 's . Sometimes the distinctive and classic style of a great songwriter still can deliver better than the joke artists of today . That has shown with Piano Man , New York State Of Mind and the classic We Did n't Start The Fire . The song still lights up the flame 25 years later after it originally came out and it still sounds just as driven as it did years ago . I still never get tired of the rhythm and rhyme into a great history lesson through time , as Joel pointed out into the song , and it still is better than the wasted acts of today .

Adler","reviewText":"March 4 , 2009 \n\n As a young man finding my way in New York City there were what the residents called public baths . This was a very long time ago but as a music fan even then , I remember a young , explosive female entertainer named Bette Midler who would entertain at these baths accompanied by her pianist , Barry Manilow . Of course they would later break away from each other to become each outrageously loved and successful show business personalities . There were definitive differences with Barry Manilow becoming a much more   conservative recording artist whereas Bette is the nouveau Lucille Ball with a comedic lasciviousness that generations have enjoyed immensely . My wife and I waited in an endless , serpentine line to see Barry Manilow do a show at the Garden back in 1981 . Once inside , we immediately noticed his engaging smile and friendly persona which is nothing short of contagious . His material , as evidenced by the classic Weekend in New England ranks amongst the finest songwriting in American music . In Barry 's case , whether another classic of his I Write the Songs classifies him as a 100 % singer songwriter is irrelevant . We appreciate him as a captivating singer who is an authentic charmer . That is exactly how Barry Manilow can credit his gargantuan success since the days of playing the piano and appearing with Bette Midler in New York 's public baths . I would have to say that his vocals and keyboard playing are indeed highly professional . His strength is to light up any room he walks into and then you have have to add one of the most highly regarded song catalogs music fans have ever appreciated .

He was best known for his 1967 hit single and generational anthem , ` San Francisco ( Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)' ... John Phillips wrote and co - produced \" San Francisco ( Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair ) \" for McKenzie . Phillips played guitar on the recording and session musician Gary L Coleman played orchestra bells and chimes . Hal Blaine played drums . \" \n\n \" ' San Francisco ( Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair ) ' was released on 13 May 1967 in the United States and was an instant hit , reaching # 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 . It was also a # 1 in the UK and several other countries , selling over seven million copies globally . And what a great song this is ! True , the others did a great job helping Scott with this number ; but I 'm particularly impressed with Scott McKenzie 's unforgettable treatment of this song .

I would say the Trammps with Zing Went the Strings of My Heart had all the disco elements down including the strings , and that was in late 1972 , over a year earlier . But the Trammps song was minor and The Love I Lost was a huge mega - hit , so it 's known to far more people . Disco evolved out of the Philly sound of Gamble and Huff , and taht 's who Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes recorded for . \n\n But forget labels like disco anyway ( some people do n't like the term ) , and what you 've got is a smooth orchestra , a driving rhythm and Teddy Pendergrass singing his heart out . It 's a great R&B classic and is as fresh today as it was when it was released . There was a long version on the album , but that just had an extended interlude for dancing because dance music was expected to be more than a three minute AM tune . But for just listening I think the single is better as the dance interlude gets a bit repetitious on the long version if you 're just listening .","summary":"First Disco Song?","unixReviewTime":1383091200,"image":null}

This instrumental song is performed so well by Mr. Cramer , who had such a heart and soul for playing the piano !

While watching these past Oscars they played the nominees for best movie song of the year , and I thought to myself , it all seems so fake . The song from \" August Rush \" completely missed the mark it was trying to achieve , and \" Enchanted \" with the exception of \" So Close , \" sounded like typical Disney type fair . However , then came , \" Falling Slowly , \" a song from a widely unknown film , I was like , \" Wow , this is really different , this is beautiful ! \" And it was all that and more , and the studio version only improved on these precious elements . It 's a moving , gentle song that really touches your heart . And like I said , I liked the song so much , I now want to see the actual movie , \" Once . \" \n\n Overall , the surprise song of the year , and a feel - good story that these unknown musicians are finally getting the credit and recognition they deserve . Buy this song , and you wo n't be disappointed .

Just like the ride , marriage ought to be easy , ought to be simple enough , a man meets a woman and they fall in love . But it 's not that easy , there are bumps in the ride and sometimes it gets rough . Mr. Springsteen 's first marriage was failing at the time and the line it is easy for two people to lose each other is quite prophetic as the marriage ended up in divorce . The music perfectly captures the carnival mood of the piece and Nils Lofgren 's guitar solo cuts through the joyful sound like a razor blade acting as the tension that cuts through the rocky relationship .

No matter , though , because being a universal language , music belongs to the world . There is so much going on in this arrangement , and it all fits together so perfectly , that you have to listen to it over and over to begin to pick up everything that 's going , from the harmonies and little vocal touches and phrasings , to that incredible female background soprano , which I sounds almost like a Theramin , one of the first electronic instruments .

While he has n't recorded an album since 1993 's River Of Dreams , his music still stands the test of time because it is worth while from beginning to end . But for those who seem more interested in acts like Britney Spears and anyone who has been on American Idol , and does n't own a Billy Hoel record , than this is a start to download for your MP3 player . The Essential Billy Joel is a collection of over 30 tracks from Billy 's long and successful career from the 70 's , 80 's and 90 's . The songs here have all been remastered well , and chronicle a innocent man who has made the music of our times . The collection includes a lot of great standards he has made his own for over 35 years like Piano Man , River Of Dreams , We Did n't Start The Fire , the delight diddy Uptown Girl , and The Longest Time , all the way to # 1 hits like My Life , It 's Still Rock N ' Roll To Me and Allentown . There is so much that is great in music , but there are a few of his great songs that were sadly overlooked like You 're Only Human ( Second Wind ) , Modern Woman and a few other good songs . But , those are small complaints , because those songs were only minor hits . Instead , the collectin includes some of his songs from his 2001 classical pop album instead . All in all , The Essential Billy Joel is a very strong and standard greatest hits album from beginning to end that is fun and a joy to listen to , whether you 're a hard core fan , or anyone who is new to Billy Joel 's songs . This album is definitely a great purchase to download off the internet , or buy from your local record store . Even though Billy Joel has n't made anything new in awhile , his music is still making us go to extremes .","summary":"Billy For Beginners","unixReviewTime":1201996800,"image":null}

I purchased an old The Source magazine from December 1994 and saw that was a track for one of their Sure Hot Singles back in the day . Thing was I never paid too much attention to UGK , except for a few songs here and there . Then ended up being the laughing stock at my job , because I told them that I 'm from the A , their recent album&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Underground - Kingz \/ dp \/ B000K7UFL2 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Underground Kingz<\/a>&nbsp;was the only album I owned . So I ended up buying this the very next day . Super Tight is a very southern style album . Both Bun B and Pimp C sound way different back in ' 94 , than they do today . A lot of tracks would bump today as they did back then . Bun B drops a solo track \" Feds In Town \" which sounds real good . \" Pocket Full Of Stones 2 \" and \" Protect & Serve \" are other good songs . \" Stoned Junkee \" is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and features 3 - 2 . The final track \" Three Sixteens \" featuring DJ DMD is a very good way to close out the album . Super Tight is an excellent album . Some of the production sounds dated ( although I have to give mad props to Pimp C for his production ) , but it still bumps here today . It 's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar , especially when other albums from the south such as&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik \/ dp \/ B0000013GB \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/The - Diary \/ dp \/ B000000W6Z \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">The Diary<\/a>&nbsp;dropped the same year . But if you 're a fan of 90 's southern rap ( mainly groups like E.S.G. , UGK , or anyone from Rap - A - Lot ) , do n't hesitate to get this album . I used to live in San Antonio during my high school days ( ' 00-'04 ) , and this album reminds me so much of how it was down there in Texas .

I definitely do not think Michael Jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a pedophile and wacko jacko . Still he still had some great songs towards the end of his career and his life . You Rock My World , one of his last hit songs originally from the lackluster Invincible album is still one of those few standouts from that album that is playing well . It showed a more R&B rhythm to the appeal that Michael Jackson wanted to get into a generation that was getting into Destiny 's Child , TLC and when a lot of R&B really was going more into a dance and hip hop rhythm . It really was a good song , but one of Michael Jackson 's last to really hit the nail on the head . If you would prefer Michael 's music from the afterlife , as it was released from the Xscape record , you should absolutely go back to what made Michael Jackson a legend in the first place , and get Invincible with You Rock My World .","summary":"He Rocked The World","unixReviewTime":1403654400,"image":null}

It may be funny initially , but it 's replay value is nowhere near that of the song it introduces . Listeners of at - least the official album versions of these tracks may , in other words , find themselves skipping past , or at - least zoning - out on , the first several seconds . That means the tracks , essentially the songs , would be better without their preludes . In the case of You Rock My World , the title of which does n't come across nearly as corny as it should , the song would also make more sense without it . The dialogue implies that the girl is a total stranger to both Chris and Mike , but the song lyrics have Jackson already romantically entwined with her . \" It feels like I 've finally found a perfect love this time , \" he insists before going into one of his best choruses yet . \" You rocked my world , you know you did , \" it goes , utilizing a harmonic vocal stack similar to the haunting Ghosts , \" Who 'd think I 'd find someone like you to call mine ? \" The words are trite ; on paper the song would read like a high school crush poem ; but the vocal melodies , even on the verses and bridge , are quite awesome . The music , highlighted by dramatic keyboard strings where applicable , is a slinky soul groove that goes back to the relative timelessness of the Thriller album . Despite an unnecessary scratch break near the end ; the ad - lib peak section should take the song out ; it 's producer Rodney Jerkins at his best . It 's not Michael Jackson at his best , but it 's damn close . If the quality of this love theme is any indication , I 'd guess he got the girl . \n\n marcellee.com","summary":"5 of 5","unixReviewTime":1381449600,"image":null}
