2153,-1,3.0,"I would have to say that this is probably a good niche product and nice gift for someone who already owns a compatible toothbrush.  It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).

That said, for $50 plus S&H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.
The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

This is a simple to use product that probably does what it says.
But I think I'll give mine to family member who also uses Sonicare brushes and may appreciate more the gadget geekiness of the UV Sanitizer.",0.275,1.275,1

The best I can say, is that it has a pleasant scent. (But those with fragrance sensitivities/allergies may find themselves bothered by it).

And, I must agree with several reviewers who sagely noted that the components of the product are less-than-healthy. The first two times I tried the whip, I quickly washed my hands afterward. Of course, logically, it was still in my hair ... and near/on my scalp. Ultimately, this made me way too nervous to continue to use it, so I tossed it.
