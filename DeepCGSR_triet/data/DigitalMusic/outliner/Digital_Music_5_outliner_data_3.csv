AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000VZQHNS,-1,1,5,"Nelly Furtado completely remade herself in 2006.  Her earlier work, including hits ""I'm Like a Bird"" and ""Powerless"" were fun and entertaining songs (and Nelly is a very attractive, appealing artist), but they didn't excite the mass audiences.  They had more appeal to the Adult Contemporary chart.

  2006 saw the debut of her song ""Promiscuous"", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take ""Promiscuous"" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This set the tone for the remainder of her album ""Loose"", which showed her new image to be genuine instead of posed.","Nelly Furtado completely remade herself in 2006 .

'My Favorite Mistake' in particular, the first track talks about a relationship that is almost just for show and not working out well. Even Sheryl admits it's a ""mistake"".

A24P8BEJ26FU01,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3,"RnB/Soul singer, India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002. Most sophomore albums by other neo-soul artists, such as D'Angelo and Macy Gray (note that I haven't heard either of these albums) were deemed by fans to have fallen to the dreaded sophomore slump so India Arie had a lot to prove. India Arie proved she had undeniable talent with her debut album, both lyrically and vocally and most fans tend to compare the two albums. On both, India Arie wrote or co-wrote all the songs and she writes about meaningful topics such as self-respect and communication in relationships. On her sophomore album, ""Voyage To India"", India Arie provides her wonderful lyrics and vocals in songs that seem to tell what many women are thinking of, rather than being self-reflective as she was on her debut.
India Arie starts her sophomore album off with a short intro, just over a minute in length, called ""Growth"" which states that the only thing that is constant in the world is change. It's a somewhat pointless intro, but the statement she makes is definitely True. The second track is an mid-tempo song called ""Little Things"". As expected by the title, this song talks about appreciating the little things in life such as a ""call in the morning from my little sister singing me happy birthday"". As with most of India Arie's songs, the lyrics are not complex but are beautiful in their simplicity. Next comes ""Talk To Her"", a somewhat preachy song about how to talk to a woman. India Arie instructs the listener to treat the woman with respect and ""talk to her the way you want someone to talk to your mama"". In other words, talk to her respectfully no matter what she's wearing (""It doesn't matter if she's wearing a miniskirt or a business suit""), a message that desperately needs to be heard in today's society. The song also talks about the importance of respect and communication in relationships.
Afterwards comes the mid-tempo ""Slow Down"", a debatable album highlight. The song speaks about taking life day by day and not rushing through everything. The lyrics are once again simple yet beautiful. It's about remembering that speed isn't always the best way to achieve your goals. Next comes the romantic ""The Truth"", with its lyrics seemingly half-spoken, half-sung (more like spoken to a tune). Nonetheless, a sweet, romantic song about what India Arie loves about her man. The next song, ""Beautiful Surprise"", has a similar theme about finding love when you least expect it. It was written by India Arie alone and really shows off her talent for songwriting. After comes a short interlude, ""Healing"" which talks briefly about releasing all sadness from you. Like most interludes however, it is not too memorable.
Subsequently come two songs about moving away from the pains of the past, ""Get It Together"" and ""Headed in The Right Direction"". ""Get It Together"" is another somewhat preachy song that talks about having to get it together to heal your body and heart. It is a beautiful song when you listen to it but in the grand scheme of things, it does not stand out. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" fares much better, probably because it is more upbeat however it is fairly short compared to the other songs on the album. After that comes ""Can I Walk With You"" is an album highlight that seems to talk about taking friendship to another level and it is probably my favourite song on the album. Then comes ""The One"", a very overused song title but this is probably one of the better songs of that title. Lyrically and vocally it is a unique (in a good way) song but it is also quite short.
Next comes ""Complicated Melody"" another romantic, metaphoric song that compares India's man to colours, numbers and songs. It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice. Otherwise, it adds little to the quality of the album. The song, while it sounds nice, is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons. Following this comes another interlude, ""Gratitude"" which is not much different from the other two. Then comes another highlight, ""Good Man"", another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album. India's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well. The second last track, ""God Is Real"" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album. Finally, there is the bonus track ""Interested"" which doesn't stand out at all compared to the other tracks. The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great.
Overall Mark: 3/5
Although this is still a great album, ""Voyage To India"" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie's debut so good. The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other. As a whole the album sounds great, but when you break it down, many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and, of course, different lyrics. India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists, like Jewel (similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop), so memorable. The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable.","RnB / Soul singer , India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002 .

ABE14SVILZLNY,B000W11N6W,-1,1,5,"With the surprise double-platinum success of 2001's Acoustic Soul, India. Arie became that rare bird -- particularly in contemporary R&B -- who straddles the line between artistic innovation and schmaltz. Certainly a talented guitar-playing songstress, she also takes her lyrical cues from Hallmark cards, a mix at once comfortable and off-putting -- and difficult to put one's finger on.
This follow-up, seemingly rushed into stores, doesn't clear up the confusion; as with Alicia Keys, it's almost impossible to criticize a contemporary urban artist who writes life-affirming, organic songs, yet this journey ends as unconvincingly as Soul or Songs in A Minor. What's more, it lacks any sort of knockout number -- Soul had two, ""Video"" and ""Brown Skin"" -- leaving us to wonder just where Arie intended on taking us.
Which is not to say that the potential isn't there, only that balance is not. Is she the younger visage of Tracy Chapman (""The One,"" ""Power of Words"")? Channeling Chaka Khan on two gleefully old school steppin' tracks, ""Interested"" and ""Slow Down""? When she takes her own advice to ""live for the moment,"" she gets better results: ""Get it Together"" is a swirling slam-dunk of a love song, and ""Good Man,"" an overlooked track off the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, makes a nice fit here. When she comes off preachy, it's with treacly results: ""God is Real"" and ""Little Things"" are cloying bits of armchair philosophy.
Voyage is at its most interesting, and often its best, when Arie tries to come from out of the shadows of her influences and chart her own path. Though she stumbles on ""The Truth"" trying to incorporate slicker R&B-style beats into the mix, the titular Spanish folk tinges of ""Headed in the Right Direction"" says it all, as does ""India's Song,"" which could have been the album's most overwrought track but instead perfectly mixes Chapman's subdued introspection with Woody Guthrie's wide-eyed folk. These are the tracks suggest the voyage isn't over; it may have only just begun.","With the surprise double - platinum success of 2001 's Acoustic Soul , India .

Arie's debut album of folk-laced soul didn't break any new ground, but it was an overall appealing mix of catchy tunes and positive messages that were a welcome alternative to the talk-show/men-bashing lyrics of her ghettoized peers.

Expectations are naturally high, and I hoped that her followup ""Voyage to India,"" would be a musical and lyrical step forward from her debut.  While the album is thoroughly listenable from start to finish, ""Voyage to India"" just doesn't serve a platter filling enough to stick to your ribs.  Arie has her heart in the right place, and her intentions are noble, but the truth remains that she's a passable lyricist, often resorting to ""love yourself"" cliches that become one-dimensional.

Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto.","This CD is more than Rodrigo 's Concerto .

The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.
After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.
Dear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.

A25KDGSE2EVYXY,B000W21ER4,-1,1,4,"This is Weezer's first ever album, and I think it's pretty good. I think Raditude might be my first favorite. I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin' tune to listen to, but it's not quite hard-rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.

""My Name is Jonas"" might be a song about the singer's brother, since the actual singer's name is Rivers. A punk rock song with a light guitar intro. The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first.

The Amazon sample for ""No One Else"" says ""My girl's got eyeballs,"" but the whole line is ""My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head."" The music is fun, catchy, and a little simple.

""The World Has Turned And Left Me Here"" is so Weezer-y, you can almost immediately tell who sang it if you hear it for the first time on the radio. I would've given it a 5/5, but it kind of got old after a while.

""Buddy Holly"" is Awesome! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly? Kinda, kinda not.

Next comes ""Undone"", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.

""Surf Wax America"" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.

Next comes ""Say It Ain't So"". This one has everything that a Weezer fan would like; Pretty good lyrics, rockin' chorus, guitar solo, and it's really catchy. Say it IS so!

Somebody said that ""In The Garage"" this one is an anthem for nerds/ rock 'n' roll lovers, and I might have to agree. It's my favorite song on the album. I like the intro because it sounds so different from the rest of the song. [Is that a bagpipe?]

""Holiday"" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure. Yes, it has a middle section, but much louder and better than the one SWA had.

""Only in Dreams"" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5/10]

Now for the bonus tracks:

For ""Mykel and Carley"", I'm not so sure who Mykel and Carley are, but the song was great! It had a guitar intro that reminded me of the intro for My Name is Jonas. Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band's newest album, Death to False Metal.

""Jamie"" is Just boring. Enough said.

However, ""Susanne"" is Another great hit from Weezer!]

Finally, we have ""PaperFace"". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it.","This is Weezer 's first ever album , and I think it 's pretty good . I think Raditude might be my first favorite . I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin ' tune to listen to , but it 's not quite hard - rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins . The music is also very creative and original , much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994 . Best of all , it 's timeless ! Each song has at least something to say about it . "" My Name is Jonas "" might be a song about the singer 's brother , since the actual singer 's name is Rivers . A punk rock song with a light guitar intro . The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first . The Amazon sample for "" No One Else "" says "" My girl 's got eyeballs , "" but the whole line is "" My girl 's got eyeballs in the back of her head . "" The music is fun , catchy , and a little simple .

A19I5KZQM3CA6W,B000W21ER4,1,-1,1,"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?

To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.

After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.

On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.

A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):

I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.

If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as ""You're just jealous!"" or ""I'd like to see you do better!"" or ""How is it in your parents' basement?"" or ""You must jerk off to your computer!"" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:

""Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!""

FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.

To those of you who would call me ""pretentious"" or ""music snob"" or ""self-righteous"" or ""self-absorbed,"" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is ""simple,"" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:

""Devil's Night Out"" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" by The Sex Pistols
""The Essential Heart"" by Heart
""Highway To Hell"" by AC/DC
""Meat Is Murder"" by The Smiths
""The Strange Case Of..."" by Halestorm
""Greatest Hits"" by Tom Petty
""Complete Greatest Hits"" by The Cars
""Ugly"" by Life of Agony
""Remain In Light"" by Talking Heads

As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!

I also wish to point out that arguments such as ""Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!"" or ""You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!"" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)","I can remember owning this album when I was in high school , so even though I now can not stand Weezer in the least bit ( now being 26 ) , it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time .

I'd suggest picking up the 2-disc ""KING OF THE BLUES"".

I 've read the quibbles in the All Music Guide and thru out the Freddie King reviwes listed below , but I still really like this music . Yes Leon 's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix , and the strings and backing female voices occationaly over power King 's playing and mar and date the arrangements , but it 's soooo good , even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie .

She was Mrs. Miller, who sang with a quasi-operatic soprano.  She mostly recorded cover versions of recent pop hits.  She often went off-pitch, and sometimes she fell behind (or got ahead of) the beat.  She sang with more vibrato than Tiny Tim, and occasionally she would perform bird whistles.  Of course, the whole thing was a joke by the record company.  It's pretty funny, although it wears a bit thin after a while.  I don't think too many people can take 21 songs by Mrs. Miller!  But if you can't get enough of Mrs. Miller, this is a pretty comprehensive collection.","Back in the the mid-1960s , Capitol Records signed an almost-60 - years - old housewife to a recording contract , for some reason .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000WCZW7M,1,-1,3,"The past few years have really brought out anew for pop star Amy Grant. She had moved back into her Christian roots well with her core audience, but unfortunate, she hasn't been able to click with newer music buyers. Since her A&M catalog was recently moved over to EMI, on her label Sparrow. While so many acts have done well with a new label in catalog sales, Amy still has a long way to return to the success she had a long time ago. A few years ago, it was well said with her previous hits package Greatest Hits 1986-2004 which did very well with the actual appeal. Now that she has another hits package, does Amy Grant really have the appeal she once conquered with record buyers?

Amy Grant's 2007 Greatest Hits mixes in a bit of the old and the new that Amy had delivered well from her 90's pop mix, to her contemporary mixes of soul and Christian music. The songs have been remastered nicely, and tries to deliver nicely as a re-introduction to Amy to a whole new audience. The collection includes some of her great gems like Every Heartbeat and Baby Baby, to her contemporary Christian classics like Lead Me On and Father's Eyes. While the collection works fairly well for new fans, it misses a few great songs from her pop era that worked better from her previous hits package. The collection overlooks a few great tracks like The Next Time I Fall, her often overlooked duet with former Chicago singer Peter Cetera, as well as The Things We Do For Love, which she did for the Ellen Degeneres film Mr. Wrong, and her delightful cover of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi from House Of Love, which had a very colorful video, and a better beat than when Joni recorded it years ago.

All in all, Amy Grant's Greatest Hits isn't a bad collection though, but it just doesn't deliver like the A&M days really did, or her previous Greatest Hits 1986-2004 album, which unfortunately is no longer in print. Hopefully, there could be a better hits collection that could attract Amy's great pop days like that one did, but this one could've had more to be desired, and that makes it a missed heartbeat.

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000WCZW7M,-1,1,5,"With three decades of music under her belt, Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections.  And while they are both great, there was no place to find a sample of her entire career.  Until now.

This disc is an attempt to collect the hits from Amy's entire career, and it does a remarkable good job.  With just nineteen songs, it hits all the highlights.  It includes ""Simple Things,"" the title track from her last major studio release and ""Old Man's Rubble"" from her self title debut.  In fact, it includes at least one song from each of her major studio releases (not counting the hymns projects or the Christmas releases) except for her third, ""Never Alone.""  Heck, it even includes ""Stay for Awhile.""  That song originated on Collection and went on to become a hit in its own right.

And there are plenty of classics here, from ""Baby Baby"" and ""Saved by Love"" to ""Thy Word,"" ""El Shaddai,"" and ""Father's Eyes.""

Having said that, there are some drawbacks.  Fans who already own all her releases will find absolutely nothing new here.  All nineteen tracks have been previous released.  While they have been digitally remastered to sound better, I must admit I don't notice the difference.  Of course, when you are getting almost an hour and twenty minutes of music, this is being picky.

An equally picky point is the over representation of ""Heart in Motion.""  I know it was her biggest release by far.  But it gets five tracks, which is about a quarter of the disc space.  And, to be honest, it's not my favorite of her releases.  Seems like one or two could have been cut to include a song from somewhere else.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"" didn't make the cut.  That would have been a good switch.

Finally, there's the timing.  Amy's last two releases have been a greatest hits and a live disc.  I know she just changed record labels, but I would have preferred to see this after another studio release.

In reality, these are all minor quibbles.  Any fan of Amy's music will find lots of memories in these nineteen songs and be glad to have them all in one place.","With three decades of music under her belt , Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections .

A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B000X964EY,-1,1,5,"Monolithic Baby! is the sixth full-length Monster Magnet studio album, it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time.

The album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.

The aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.

The fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.

Regardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'

Most Monster Magnet fans are fond of Dave's Vocals and lyrics, which are up to their usual high standard on this record, and most fans will be more than happy with this album, the songwriting is of a very high caliber and there are so many rocking songs that this is one of the most direct, focused and in your face records the band have made.

Of course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments. If that describes your feelings in similar situations then maybe give Monolithic Baby! a miss, elsewise do not hesitate to pick up a copy, it really is a very enjoyable record.","Monolithic Baby ! is the sixth full - length Monster Magnet studio album , it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time .

""Call to Arms"" is no doubt the band's anthem for this album. A major difference you notice right away is that this album is a lot brighter and hopeful as compared to their 2006 album We Don't Need to Whisper. ""Everything's Magic"" adds a hint of keyboards and lots of progressive effects that complement Tom Delonge's (ex-Blink 182) melodic, high-pitched vocals. ""Breathe"" is not your typical radio ballad, but more like a sci-fi movie love song. Driving guitars mixed with melodic vocal breaks make up the track ""Secret Crowds."" Drummer Atom Willard (Offspring) experiments with some unique drum beats on this one. ""True Love"" employs electronic drum beats, unique guitar licks, and uplifting vocals.

The Bad
Despite the different effects and drum beats used, the album tends to sound like one long, drawn-out song.

The Verdict
The brighter more optimistic Angles and Airwaves are far more enjoyable than their darker and hopeless debut. However, lack of diversity keeps this album from returning to my CD player.","The Good

A5TJL46NVFH47,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,4,"Musically, ""Dead Again"" features some of the most ambitious, memorable songs in Type O's career.  The formula hasn't exactly changed, but these songs for the most part match up to past classics.  However, lyrically, this is easily Peter Steele's worst work ever, and oftentimes the inane lyrics detract from the emotional power the arrangements inherently have.

There are several reasons this might be the case.  For instance, it's quite possible that all Peter knew how to write about were the typical Type O topics: death, romance, wolves, fire, etc... The lyrics on this release instead attempt to make real inspirational/thoughtful and moral statements.  That in itself is not the problem, nor is the fact that apparently now Catholic Steele preaches his newfound faith through several of these songs.  The problem is that the lyrics are usually either simple and literal (""I'm a drug addict, always will be"", ""there's no excuse for drug abuse"", ""A child is torn from the womb unbaptized, there's no question it's infanticide"") or pun-filled attempts at humor (""Turn your cheek, gets ripped off, that's why we're given four"").  The song ""Ode to Locksmiths"" actually has the line ""Now I know why girls hate boys,'cuz Eve was in fact raped"".  It seems painfully obvious that Steele's faith is hardly sincere (more out of fear of death than anything) and that he's only preaching because he feels he should, not because he really believes in what he says, judging by the tired and sometimes ridiculous points he tries to make.  Steele himself even said in an interview that he had a hard time finding lyrical inspiration for this album.  A few of the tracks have decent lyrics, such as ""September Sun"" but most, being long songs, have their fair share of good and bad parts.  Only 2 become unlistenable, ""She Burned Me Down"" and ""Halloween in Heaven"".

Other than that, this is a much more energetic and punky Type O than we've had in a while.  Nearly all of the songs have some sort of throw back to their early days, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" is fast throughout.  Many of the songs are quite positive, also... this may be the least depressing album in their career.  Even the World Coming Down-esque ""These Three Things"" has a triumphant finale.  There's no question to me that the drama in their songwriting has improved... all of the epics on this album truly build energy and go somewhere.  Kenny's guitar work seems more Sabbath-inspired than ever before, and although the guitar tone has lost the signature, thick, flanged tone, the combination of Steele's vocal melodies and Silver's organ textures still creates the signature Type O sound.  The songs are full of tempo changes just like the Type O epics of old (""Black No. 1"") but there seems to be a logic and flow present in these songs that just wasn't there in those days.  The album is incredibly consistent, and has no filler and is easy to listen to all the way through despite its length.

In conclusion, ""Profits of Doom"", ""These Three Things"", ""Ode to Locksmiths"" and the haunting closer ""All Hail and Farewell to Britain"" with its excellent ambient outro all contain some of my favorite Type O moments.  I'd recommend ""Dead Again"" to any Type O fan who doesn't put too much importance in the lyrics.","Musically , "" Dead Again "" features some of the most ambitious , memorable songs in Type O 's career .

Others like ""Tripping A Blind Man,"" ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" and ""She Burned Me Down"" are the cream of the crop, with their punch-in-the-gut riffs that bring back old school Black Sabbath (something that Type O are the best at).

I have heard her sing with her father (Loudon Wainwright III) and she came across much more bluesy than she does on this effort (check out ""You Never Call"" on his live disk). Her voice on this disk hits some qualities of Marianne Faithful (great) to some more alt. generic female lead singer(not so great).

The good thing (for me) is that she kind of defies a certain style.  It's not that she's all over the place, just that the music doesn't fit nicely into one genre.

Wainwright's writing is pretty good for her initial effort. I think that's where all her family's strentgh lies anyway...which is not a knock to their performing abilities.

But like most disks there are some outstanding tracks: ""When the Day is Short"", ""Wither I Must Wander"" and the oft mentioned ode (?)to her father, ""BMFA"".

Honestly, L&L is one of my favorites by Mary. It was very downbeat for the most part and I think that's what people didn't like. Same thing happened here. More than half the album is slower and full of meaning and songs about relationship/self-esteem up's and down's. The production on a few of the tracks is a little more Pop/R&B than a lot of her earlier material too.

So even with certain differences I must admit that after listening again (just like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Life/dp/B0000AQS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Life</a>&nbsp;album) I find that this is a great (and once again) underrated effort by Mary J.

It's just more of a grower in my opinion. To me though some of these tracks are just amazing. I guess the ballads/mid-tempos actually makes this one of my favorite recent MJB efforts. I'm now not ashamed to say that. Beautiful effort.

4.4 stars.

A3FTSMLO4972GR,B00110DT4C,-1,1,4,"This is a decent album; I personally was expecting more soul into it. What I actually got was a mixture like Geffen is trying to turn Mary J. Blige into a black Carole King. This became apparent in songs ""Smoke"" and ""Fade Away"". I did listen to the record three times consecutively on my recent trip and the first half was pretty good, what I was looking for was for Mary to hit me with something heavy like she has on all of her recent efforts (i.e. PMS, I'm Not Lookin', Changes I've Been Going Through, Not Gon' Cry) and then I heard ""Roses and personally, I'm split with the song. It's Mary but it's didn't grab me like Whoa!.
I did appreciate ""Just Fine"" a little more than when I did initially. ""Grown Woman"" I love and ""Work that"" picked up where the hidden track from her last album left off. The beat is nice, the lyrics are little B-rate. After ""Just Fine"" things start to run together and sound a bit same, then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little. Her duet with Usher ""Shake down"" is cute but a bit odd vocally. Usher is nice but I would've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary's (i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight). This album is a hit and miss with me, where only a good 3 songs are my favorites and they aren't the best of Mary.","This is a decent album ; I personally was expecting more soul into it .

A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B0011B6UI8,1,-1,2,"The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought ""Cool...this just might work!"" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's True talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's ""I'm Not In Love."" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the ""Big boys don't cry"" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the ""I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back"" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with ""Under The Milky Way"", ""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Broken Wings."" Oh, sure, ""Under...."" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on ""....Town"" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for ""Town"", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for ""Wing""). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal ""Human."" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a True testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. ""Holding On To Yesterday"" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. ""Baker Street"" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. ""Let's Go Out Tonight"" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on ""For The One."" Much like ""Human"", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to ""Miss You Nights"" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! ""Blue Rose"" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. ""Cry"" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (""You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb""), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with ""Imagine"", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).","The whole point behind covering a song is to A ) better the original or B ) shake things up and make it different than the original .

A1NN9AE7H9HQYD,B0011YBRFQ,1,-1,3,"I am a bit disappointed by AZ's A.W.O.L. This album lacks of consistance. I love ""Do Or Die"", which in my humble opinion is a masterpiece (just like Nas' ""Illmatic""), but A.W.O.L. seems like a mixtape with major lack of coherence.

There are standout tracks, such as ""Never Change"", ""Can't Stop"", ""City Of Gods"", ""The Come Up"" and the Bonustrack #2 ""Magic Hour"", but the rest of the album just seems to be randomly and unkindly put together.

AZ is one of the best MCs in the business (no doubt), but he needs to come up with a neatly organized album. I am thinking about DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Buckwild to produce it with guest appearances by Nas, CL Smooth, Common and Cormega.

None the less, pick up this CD to support AZ. He is one of the last True rappers in the business! Check out AZ's Greatest Hits CD ""Decade 94-04"", which is hard to find in the US.

So anyways, the song has a nice buildup. It is a little slow, and the payoff may be less than satisfying, but Linkin Park is clearly going for a soft rock sound, to go in some background somewhere. Some people may like the sound, like soft rock fans, but fans of Linkin park will be like, WTH? ""In The End"" this is not. The vocals suit the song, the lyrics are good. Are they trying to go for a love song or something?

Overall, try first, maybe buy if you like. For me, it's just another song on radio I could really care less about. And definitely not one you want to hear all the time. Maybe every once in a while, but that's it.","First off , while this song may have a close structure to a certain U2 song , it would n't be the first time a good song sounded like a good song , Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Wonderwall ?

(It starts with one)
 One thing I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To explain in due time
 (All I know)
 Time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down to the end of the day
 The clock ticks life away
 (Its so unreal)
 Didnt look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on but didn't even know
 I wasted it all just to watch you go

 I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time when...

 I tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end
 It doesn't even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end
 It doesn't even matter

 One thing, I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To remind myself how
 I tried so hard
 In spite of the way you were mocking me
 Acting like I was part of your property
 Remembering all the times you fought with me
 Im surprised it got so (far)
 Things aren't the way they were before
 You wouldnt even recognize me anymore
 Not that you knew me back then
 But it all comes back to me

I used a magnifying glass to study the picture art on the cover of the CD jewel case and found the caption: twisted dog sister. The blimp in the upper left corner of the picture on the CD cover has the message: BAD YEAR. The CD is round and does not have the entire message, but the art on the CD itself clearly has bombs that are called DOOKIE. This CD was released in 1994 during the transition from January to February, so MTV had many opportunities to play the song Basket Case during the year 1994, and I think a special thrill was beheld internally at the idea of giving myself the creeps and my mind plays tricks on me. Basket Case was the Martin Luther Stonehood of 1994 expressing itself in punk rock, and people who have forgotten are like Americans who lack Hegel circling the present with the depth of its past.","Twenty years ago , at the end of 1994 , MTV counted down 100 music videos of 1994 and gave the number one video position to the song Basket Case by Green Day from the CD Dookie .

A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.

1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  ""Reach"" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.
2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.
3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.
4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.
5) 2 Find U: Weak.
6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.
7) Doin' Fine: ""We are what everyone wants to be.""  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.
8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is ""spells"" the song title...).
9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.
10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.
11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.
12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.
13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).
14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own ""becoming"" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.

As you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to ""This Way"") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.","I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel ... and how would that work out ?

A2WZYL0HNUR5XH,B001237HCI,-1,1,5,"For former Jewel fans who don't like this CD, tough!  I've never heard anything like this, and my friends agree it's great.

""Stand"" (take a stand) is like some time tunnel idea from when music counted for something, set to a sleazy bar beat that holds the counterbalancing darkness.  We haven't had an artist who could popularize stuff like this in a while.

And there hasn't been so much hidden in lyrics since people tried playing Beatles records backwards.  Consider that ""Intuition,"" seems to be ""follow your heart"" inspiration, all mushy stuff you'd be proud to sing in church, when suddenly a stacatto vocal riff breaks in with ""just cash in, sell yourself.""

There are two striking examples of subliminal change of the apparent message by the silencing of a ""t"" at the end of a word.  In ""Leave The Lights On"" the rhythm makes it impossible to pronounce the ""t"" in ""can't"" so what we actually hear is ""you can try my love, you can buy my love"" instead of ""you can't buy my love.""

The second one is in ""Yes U Can.""  The first time the ""t"" in ""boots"" does come through, but after that it sounds like ""b"".  This one will get my review censored if I spell it out here, and maybe that's why she wrote the lyrics that way, to get past the WalMart censors?  The albumn does NOT have an explicit lyrics rating.

A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"Firstly, I am a huge Jewel fan.  She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever.  At first, I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering.  The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general.  But let's not give up on Jewel so quickly.  I admit, I don't like the first single from 0304 ""Intuition"" because it is rather forgetful pop (and won't go down as a classic), but you cannot deny that it appealed to many younger people.  The second single ""Stand"" really appeals to me, on the other hand.  It is a very catchy song, and while it is not traditional Jewel, it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there. And at the end of the day, isn't that what is important about a singer?  To be able to re-invent themself from time to time?  Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it.  I consider ""0304"" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different.  She never said she wouldn't go back to her traditional style in the future.  Unfortunately at the moment, folk type music isn't that popular ... so that's another reason why Jewel is trying something different.  In 1978, the Rolling Stones released a disco single (Miss You) because that's what the public were really into then - even though rock was their normal style. Going with the flow, in other words. Times will change yet again, and folk music will be what the public want.  Cycles ...

A1ALPL858XSDE,B00123G6YI,-1,1,4,"From his debut hit ""Life's A Dance"" in late 1992 through the rest of the '90s, John Michael Montgomery (with his easy going baritone) was one of country music's most reliable hitmakers.  Over the past four years, however, he's had but one top ten hit, the chart topping heart tugger ""The Little Girl.""  With his recent singles struggling, a hits collection was the logical choice for Montgomery's next release.  A sequel to 1997's GREATEST HITS made the most sense, as Montgomery has ten top 20 hits not included on that first set.  Instead, Warner Brothers went with this career encompassing VERY BEST OF that contains 11 of the 14 recordings already found on the strong selling GREATEST HITS.
Among the hits not included on either collection are the engaging ""Ain't Got Nothin' On Us,"" ""Love Working On You,"" and ""Hello L.O.V.E.""  All are uptempo romps that would have contributed nicely to the ballad-heavy VERY BEST OF.  The sequencing on VERY BEST OF distorts the musical nonbalance even more, with three fast tunes leading off, followed by a slew of slow stuff.  The collection concludes with two new ballads: the paternal reflection ""Cool"" and the pledge of devotion ""One Day Less.""  While pleasant, neither track seems likely to reverse Montgomery's recent chart struggles.  Ultimately, while it contains more tracks and covers a longer period of Montgomery's recording career, this VERY BEST OF is not as enjoyable to listen to as his earlier GREATEST HITS.","From his debut hit "" Life 's A Dance "" in late 1992 through the rest of the ' 90s , John Michael Montgomery ( with his easy going baritone ) was one of country music 's most reliable hitmakers .

A sequel to 1997 's GREATEST HITS made the most sense , as Montgomery has ten top 20 hits not included on that first set . Instead , Warner Brothers went with this career encompassing VERY BEST OF that contains 11 of the 14 recordings already found on the strong selling GREATEST HITS . Among the hits not included on either collection are the engaging "" Ai n't Got Nothin' On Us , "" "" Love Working On You , "" and "" Hello L.O.V.E. "" All are uptempo romps that would have contributed nicely to the ballad - heavy VERY BEST OF . The sequencing on VERY BEST OF distorts the musical nonbalance even more , with three fast tunes leading off , followed by a slew of slow stuff . The collection concludes with two new ballads : the paternal reflection "" Cool "" and the pledge of devotion "" One Day Less . "" While pleasant , neither track seems likely to reverse Montgomery 's recent chart struggles . Ultimately , while it contains more tracks and covers a longer period of Montgomery 's recording career , this VERY BEST OF is not as enjoyable to listen to as his earlier GREATEST HITS ."

Granted, there's nothing here that matches the instant pleasure of 'Believe' or 'All or Nothing', but there's also nothing here that matches the abundance of filler found on BELIEVE either. Lyrically, the tracks follow similarly in the vein of her eighties' corporate-rock albums than her more recent output. The set's first international single, 'The Music's No Good Without You',seems an odd choice, if only because it isn't one of the albums more ingratiating tunes.  Far better is 'Alive Again', as well as 'A Different Kind Of Love Song' and 'Real Love'. Also interesting is 'You Take It All', an electronica-driven track that sounds like Cher trying to channel Olive or Dido.  Among the very few missteps are the sole ballad 'Rain Rain', which is just plain dull, as well as a pedestrian remake of 'When The Money's Gone'. The only other minor quibble is the use of the dreaded vocoder on nearly all the tracks--it sounded cool the first thousand times we heard 'Believe', but has since been rendered just another tired, over-utilitzed gimmick--her voice is better than ever, and the heavy reliance on vocal effects just detracts from the album's overall impact after several listens. Though it doesn't match her underrated nineties opus IT'S A MAN'S WORLD as her best, it is a superior album to BELIEVE and reinforces the notion that Cher sounds best when she supresses the rock chick and unleashes her inner dance diva.","After staging arguably the biggest musical comeback this side of Tina Turner with her dance - driven project BELIEVE , Cher 's back three years on to offer up more of the same with LIVING PROOF.Utitlizing many of the same producers , she attempts to build on the momentum experienced with the previous set , and the end result is an overall more consistent album .
