A20Z0JD766DPG6,5557706259,1,1,5,Another very inspirational collection by a Very popular Christian group.  Another of my Favorites.,
AXQ89O6YRT7AX,5557706259,1,1,5,"I love the song Slow Fade by Casting Crowns, especially how they put the children version at the end... its a song that speaks to everyone of us to be careful on ""itching ears"" that may take our faith and attention away from the Lord and to be watchful all the time and put on our armour at all times in the gospel. The song slow fade speaks to those who does not just live and walk in faith but also those who are still in the process of finding themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the Lord, the lyrics simply say ""people never crumble in a day... its a slow fade when you give yourself away..."" this is so True, nobody changes over night and we can start by being careful on what we feed our minds, body, ears, eyes, and soul for our body is the temple of the Lord and we are to keep it holy and live a christ-like life all the time, not just at certain times but 24/7, with or without people around us... we may not get it all right at ones, but its a ""slow fade"" when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it starts by the choices we make on what to feed our body and soul.",
A1M379MK8MKGUF,5557706259,1,1,5,This is an awesome album from the amazing Christian group Casting Crowns. You can't go wrong with this album. Amazing and worth the buy! I think if you like Casting Crowns you'd probably also like my current new favorite artist I found through myspace. I think they'll be as big as Casting Crowns and already starting to see a huge interest in them. See my other reviews for The Warehouse Band,
AA762OWLWCPQ2,5557706259,1,1,5,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this album yet! Maybe I didn't buy it from amazon, lol! I love this album to pieces. All the way from What This World Needs to Every Man, Slow Fade to all because of Jesus...great just awesome! I had the privilege of seeing this band perform at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, VA back last November with my brother and I tell you what..this band cares for souls! I, only being a new christian for a couple of months prior I was on a spirtual high already and this band lifted me up higher! Casting Crowns is one of those exceptional Contemporary Christian Bands that you would feel comfortable having your 6 or 8 year old son or daughter listen to. I had Lifesong and I knew how much I enjoyed that album, still there most phenomenal work to date and then picked up the debut album self titled Casting Crowns. If you want to listen to a band that actually loves Jesus and wants everyone to know it, I can guarantee this band will fulfill your craving.",
A16QJ649N8PRV,5557706259,1,1,5,"This latest effort by Casting Crowns is an outstanding project.  As with their other albums, it is lyrically powerful and has a great sound.

There are several very good songs on this album.  The album has a theme of challenging Christians to live their faith all the time, not just on Sunday mornings.  There are a couple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers.

As with their previous albums, I think that this one will produce several hit singles.  'East To West' is already in that category.  Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'Every Man', and 'Slow Fade'.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns.  For those who are unfamiliar with their music, I would recommend starting off with their self titled debut.  In any case, this is well worth buying.",
ADVX0P3EIKWBK,5557706259,-1,-1,2,"I have gotten ripped on previously Casting Crowns reviews because I gave them 4 stars instead of 5...so there is no doubt people will go crazy with this review.  But with that being said, this CD just wasn't very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with ""If We Are The Body"" and ""Does Anybody Hear Her,"" but with ""What This World Needs,"" it's just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn't doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!

This CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.  Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album.  This one will sell a lot of units, but will not stand the test of time.  It will collect dust on my shelf.",
A25B8W9VSY0C5Y,5557706259,1,1,5,"I remember the first time I heard Casting Crowns on the radio several years ago. It wasn't Mark Hall's voice, the band's music, or even the harmonies sung that drew me in. It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that ""Voice of Truth"" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time. I decided to go ahead and buy that album and found every song spoke volumes to me. Now here we are 3 albums later and once again, Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again. They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart.

I really like the way that Casting Crowns' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the 'gray area' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...'no way!'. We give God a list that says I'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don't step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.

The first song on the album: ""What This World Needs"" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along. I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say.

Song #2: Every Man- This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we've done there is Hope for us. Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through.

#3: Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day. No, instead it is a slow fade. Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray.

#4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn't giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I'm the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )

#5: The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates, this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail.

#6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. ""The Altar and the Door"" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.

#7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my ""anthem"". I admire Mark's clever word play- ""Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is..."" What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.

#8: I Know You're There: This song is great! One of the ladies from Casting Crowns sings this. She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem. This song is about knowing that God is always there for us.

#9: Prayer for a Friend: This song, which sounds close to a ballad, is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord.

#10: All Because of Jesus: This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world.

#11: White Dove: This song is completely different from anything Casting Crowns has ever done. I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different.

I highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music. I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world. Casting Crowns does a great job of helping its listener connect (or re-connect) with God.

One more note: This album is GREAT to work out with!!! I do my strength training and cardio workouts with this album. I also like jogging to this album.",
A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,5557706259,1,1,5,"Christian soft rock group Casting Crowns has taken the Christian music world by storm thanks to two strong previous releases.  And their third project should continue the trend.

The group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music.  There's nothing earth shattering with either, but both work together to create some great music.

The disc starts off with the rock anthem ""What This World Needs.""  Think ""If We are the Body"" but faster.  The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100% perfect outward appearances.  After all, the heart is what counts.

The title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I'll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, ""Somewhere in the Middle.""  In fact, the phrase ""between the altar and the door"" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.

As with other Casting Crown's CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don't grab me.  There's nothing wrong with ""I Know You're There"" and ""All Because of Jesus,"" but they aren't as special as some of their other tracks.

My two favorite songs are back to back.  ""Slow Fade"" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith.  It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day.  It's a slower song with a haunting sound.  And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall's daughter singing ""Because Little Eyes.""  It's enough to give me chills.

Appropriately enough, the next song is ""East to West.""  As you might guess, this song talks about forgiveness.  It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God's forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under.  As with so many of their songs, the lyrics are powerful.

Musically, there are few surprises here for the long time fan.  But that's just fine because their music is wonderful.

I'm surprised I haven't worn out Casting Crown's first two releases I've listened to them so often.  This one will certainly suffer the same fate.",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,7799420340,1,1,4,"It is hard to imagine enigma's from so many artists. Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.

The Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.

All in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon. What ever reflection, The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005.

A1KCA1O8SPOE8P,7799420340,1,1,4,"This is almost a definitive look at Jackson's career both with the J5 and solo.  There's still a 5 star 1 disc compilation in Jackson's future.  But as of 2005 there are none on the market.  But the 2 disc's here (compiled chronologically) move along nicely. You get the Jacksons' biggest hits and Michael's early Motown solo hits.  So, why isn't this a 5 star package?  For one there's no ""Dancing Machine"", which is a cruel trick played by Epic/Legacy to make you buy one of the numerous J5 compilations with that song on it (or just download it).  The liner notes consist of a few paragraphs that aren't worth anyone's time.  And they included ""Dangerous"" a decent album cut that's not essential.  Better choice would be ""Working Day And Night"". All told not a bad CD to have by Jackson if it's only a Greatest Hits CD you need.",

Unlike the original release, this one comes in a digipak fold out case, which hold the 3 CDs in slits and can be a problem if you handle them often, so plan on uploading the music to iTunes (etc) to avoid scratching your discs. The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael, and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos, plus complete details (chart info, etc) for each song. As for the music, this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael (and his Brothers on Disc 1). The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs, many of which are featured as 'single edits', which is fine as I already have the full versions. The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat, but could've been perfect if 'I'll Be There', 'Dancing Machine', and 'Scream' (Duet with Janet) were included. It does however feature Michael's #1 duet with Paul McCartney ('Say, Say, Say'), which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now. At any rate, I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than 'Number Ones' or aren't ready to purchase the 'Ultimate Collection' (which also failed to include a number of classics!).",

A1GIIPXONCEEHP,7799420340,1,1,5,"There's no denying the impact Michael Jackson has had on popular music over the course of forty years. From the Jackson 5's first No. 1 (""I want you back"" when Michael was eleven) through his untimely death at the age of fifty.

I was still in high school when Michael and his brothers released four consecutive No. 1s (something not even the Beatles did). Despite Michael's popularity, I remained essentially a casual fan. I didn't buy a Michael Jackson album until THRILLER--an album that spawned seven hit singles and has sold over 100 million copies to date.

I eventually bought 1995's HIStory and later 2001's GREATEST HITS. But if you're looking for one collection to hit all the highlights of a brilliant career (I bought mine as a Black Friday deal), this is everything the casual fan needs:  solo hits starting with 1971's ""Got To Be There"" through 1999's ""You Rock My World"" along with a sprinkling of Jackson 5/Jacksons hits. [The only glaring omissions are the duets with his sister Janet (""Scream"") and Paul McCartney (""Say Say Say"")]

Overall, this is two and a half hours of music that changed the landscape of popular music forever. This music belongs in any serious collector's library. ESSENTIAL  [Running time - Disc 1, 78:56; Disc 2, 78:50]",

A2U80IPZXN5V1U,7799420340,1,1,5,"It's no secret that Michael Jackson was incredibly talented and gifted musician, the fact that he also had a passion for his art must have helped. This two discs collection covering the man's entire career from the time he was a little kid up to his later years as one of the most famous person on this planet. It serves as an example of how great his music was and how it's still amazing today. Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry, Michael revolutionized it, and in the 1980's Michael was fashion. MJ's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need, we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time, or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time, or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael's numerous accomplishments in the music industry, it's how good his music was.

The first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael's time in the Jackson 5/ Jacksons. Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall (1979), 7 songs from Thriller (1982), 8 from Bad (1987), 7 from Dangerous (1992) and 1 from both History (1995) and Invincible (2001). All the hits you would expect are here: Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad and much more. There isn't much to say about the songs included, they're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this ""essential"" collection. Besides the ""Ultimate Collection"" boxed set, this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael's career. It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc, Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career.

I can't hide the fact that I'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible. Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael (although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could/should have been included. ""They Don't Care About Us"" and ""Earth Song"" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career-spawning collection. From Invincible I think ""Whatever Happens"" should have been here and perhaps ""Butterflies"". It's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included, they do not really match the pop ""hits"" in terms of lyrics or musicality, they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance. That aside, The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want, the hits and more well-known songs. I must add it does a good job at doing so!

The Essential Michael Jackson does an excellent job of going further than your average compilation and offers Michael's hits and some of his best songs. The fact that it covers his entire career is great; you get a proper overview of Jackson's music. For someone who is relatively new to Michael Jackson's music this is really The Essential Michael Jackson.  4  /5.",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,7799420340,1,1,4,"While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the ""King of Pop"". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.

The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.

Overall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record, and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry. If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record, this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure. R.I.P. Michael, you've rocked the world, and so many hearts along the way.

This Michael Jackson collection is also great. All the hits are here from the Jackson 5 years,and Michaels hits,including his last,""You Rock my World.""",
A2R6RA8FRBS608,7799420340,1,1,5,"Michael Jackson gave us so much wonderful music during his lifetime; and this two CD set showcases his fine talent. Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks; there's not a dud in the bunch. The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well.

""I Want You Back"" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! ""ABC"" is very catchy. ""Got To Be There"" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings ""Got To Be There"" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! ""Rockin' Robin"" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?

""Ben"" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes ""Ben"" even more beautiful. ""Enjoy Yourself"" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. ""Blame It on the Boogie"" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in ""Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground)."" Listen also for Michael to deliver ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings ""Rock with You;"" ""Off The Wall"" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled ""The Girl Is Mine."" ""Billie Jean"" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever. It's got some beat! ""Beat It"" is yet another jewel on the first CD. ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" is another catchy, infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it; and I especially like ""Thriller;"" ""Thriller"" is timeless and just one listen proves it!

""Bad"" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ--he stands right there, front and center where he belongs! ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett; and ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is pop music at its very best. ""Man in the Mirror"" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it; and Michael does a superb job on ""Another Part of Me."" I love it! ""Black or White"" is very well done; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot. ""Heal The World"" is very sweet and easy on the ear--this music lacks nothing, it's all THAT good.

""Remember The Time"" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good; it's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it. ""Will You Be There"" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect; and ""Dangerous"" has some beat! ""You Are Not Alone"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson's songs! The second CD ends well with MJ performing ""You Rock My World."" Awesome!

Michael Jackson fans should consider this a ""must-have"" for their collections; and it has so many songs that it makes the perfect introduction to MJ and his music for newcomers just discovering his magic. I highly recommend this two CD set.",
A26Q3LIFIMUYMX,7799420340,1,1,5,"This CD is awesome and I have enjoyed it so much his music is so inspiring to me. He has talent no one else will ever possess and the music on the CD shows it. I am truly devastated over the loss of MJ I am still crying about it.  He will live in my heart forever.  I only wish the negative people would have known the real MJ. Listen to his words, look at his various videos on the web in regards to children, read the court transcripts and read the book on his conspiracy.  You will know why he was acquitted because he was totally innocent from day one and every juror knew it.  God Bless his beautiful children.  I am looking forward to the day his children are older and they give an interview on what a wonderful ""DADDY"" he was.",
A1F9Z42CFF9IAY,7799420340,1,1,5,"This is the only Michael Jackson album you need to buy. It has all the essential hits/tracks spanning his entire career!

While he had tons of hits, all of his individual albums had songs that were not hits and not good songs. So, there is no need to buy the individual albums unless there is a particular song that is not on this 'essential' album that you are looking for.",
ANOOQD9XOQWSM,7799420340,1,1,4,"Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in ""Billie Jean."" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into ""Bad,"" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire ""Dangerous,"" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.",
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,7799420340,1,1,5,"Even though Michael Jackson's personal life was rocked with scandal and I didn't always approve of his antics but I cannot ignore the cultural impact this gifted performer had on me as a child. I was in born in 1982, I remember hearing him on the radio and thought wow what a voice! The song was Dirty Diana from his Bad album. It wasn't until 1991 when his Dangerous album was released that I became a fan of Jackson, Black or White was a stellar video and the cd was just pure pop candy, I ate it up! After the scandal broke in 1993, I lost interest in Jackson but now that he is no longer with us - I hope will be remembered for his music and dancing ability - he was one-of-a-kind. This collection of greatest hits is spectacular! There are couple of Jackson 5 classics and of course the best tracks of his career like Thriller, Billie Jean, Human Nature, The Man in the Mirror, In the Closet, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), She's Out of My Life, Will You Be There?, and Don't Stop Til You Get Enough. He changed the sound and look of pop music forever, RIP Michael!",
A2OAKHL0E0A4YQ,7799420340,1,1,5,"Thjere are many Michael Jackson CD's on the market. This is the one to own however since it captures all of his big hits and well represents my two favorite albums ""Off The Wall"" and ""Thriller"". His best songs are all here"" Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Beat It, Billie Jean,The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, etc. as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"". THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard. There are 37 cuts. Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon. If you can only own one CD, this is the most logical choice. My only quibble is the omission of ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" which was my favorite Jackson Five song. At one time, he was selling over one million albums-CD's a day (1983-84). He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics. Highly recommended!",
A9Q28YTLYREO7,7799420340,1,1,5,"Michael Jackson is a timeless Musical Genius. He Owned the Last Century. Dick clark got it right  when he gave MJ the Award as Artist of the Last century. nobody before or since captured the whole World's Musical  Complete Attention as the soul Brother from  the Dirty of Gary Indiana. these songs showcases His Greatness for  Decades upon Decades. His Vocal Range&ability to adapt to Musical changes highlights a Genius without Limits.  Michael Jackson is the ""DON OF MUSIC"" period. Michael back in the day was a Event all unto Himself.  there aren't too many artists who cover as much Ground as MJ past or Present.  He changed the game of Popular Music.  these songs made me go and get Penny Loafers and get my dance on.  these Songs reprensent a wonderful time in Music.  without Michael Jackson I wouldn't even really care about Music. he was that Cat that Made a Brother truly appreciate the Art form to the Highest form.",
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,7799420340,1,1,5,"Isn't this unbelievable? Another Michael Jackson compilation! Many of Jackson's fans own HISTORY-PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK I,NUMBER ONES and the ultimate 4 disc(3 CD and 1 DVD) compilation. This collection,like the latter aforementioned one,features many of Jackson's all-time hits(his solo recordings,Jackson 5 recordings and Jacksons recordings). So put these CD's in your player,turn up the volume and get down and funky! You'll be glad you did!",
A2LNEZD3YBO12O,7799420340,1,1,5,"This is just as strong and vibrant as the box set that came 8 months before it! I sent a copy of it to my uncle in Georgia a few days after it came out on July 12! Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent.  This one, like the box set, combines his Jackson 5 hits, his Jacksons hits and his solo hits going up to 2001.  Past albums stopped at Thriller, but this goes even further to Invincible.  But my favorites are on here, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little loud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener.  The packaging said 37 songs, but there are 38 songs here, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, ""But why isn't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here?""  It must have been tough deciding what to put on here, because Michael has always made quality music.  To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100-170 miles or so on a road trip?  This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than 2003's Number Ones. Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends!",
A1QEWOSV05RYEO,7799420340,1,1,4,"Despite all the controversy that has occured with Michael Jackson, he is truly the king of pop and he truly has one of the best recording voices ever.  You can't deny that Michael Jackson is one of the most influential artists not only in pop, but also in the Twentieth Century of music itself.  THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.

This collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including ""I'll Be There"", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.

It is wonderful reliving hits such as ""I Want You Back"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Thriller"", ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"", ""Don't Stop Til You Get Enough"", and etc... 4 stars.",
A1534MBU6VJXYN,7799420340,1,1,4,"When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their ""The Essential..."" series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his ""not guilty"" verdict.

If this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and ""Thriller"" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.

If you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though ""I'll Be There"" and ""Dancing Machine"" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: ""Off The Wall"", ""Thriller"", ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit ""You Are Not Alone"" and the 2001 Top Ten single ""You Rock My World"".

As with most if not all entries in the ""Essential"" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that ""Thriller"" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as ""I'll Be There"", ""I Wanna Be Where You Are"", ""Dancing Machine"", ""Ease On Down The Road"", the Paul McCartney ""Say, Say, Say"" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), ""State Of Shock"" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.",
A344FQSEVEAG75,7799420340,1,1,4,"...But not so because of it's lack of completion. As in the past Greatest Hits compilations by Michael and The Jacksons, there has always been filler...but no thriller, hits with pits! So this compilation IS the best so far!! Pictures included are his best photos showing off a talented singer/songwriter and not the everchanging cosmetic mess. The quality of the mastering is far superior than previous compilations including that of the earlier hits from Motown...like I Want You Back, ABC and Got To Be There. The track information is informative and I don't recall another compilation that has such details.

  But the reason for the 1 less star is that it did not complete the Essential and added 2 songs that were not Essential for this type of CD. Granted he has had more #1 hits and more top 40 hits than most!! Over 4 decades here, from 1970 - 2000!

But where is the # 1 Essential I'll Be There or Dancing Machine?

They could have left out Dangerous which never charted and Leave Me Alone which is an essential, but not a hit as well. The video was a bigger hit!

  OK now what's next?  Maybe Volume 2 Essential ...and!",
A14GK0E64J0WAS,7799420340,1,1,5,"Whoa!!!!! Where did this come from? Without any hype or media attention, Sony has just released ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" (37 tracks, 157 min.), perhaps the ultimate Michael Jackson compilation.

CD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the ""Thriller"" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as ""ABC"" and ""I Want You Back"", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include ""State of Shock"" or ""Lovely One"" instead of ""Enjoy Yourself"". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 ""Thriller"" album tracks (the other 2 being ""Baby Be Mine"" and ""The Lady in My Life""; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when ""radio tracks"" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.

CD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from ""Bad"" and 7 from ""Dangerous"", and finishes off with ""You Are Not Alone"" from HIStory and ""You Rock My World"" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is ""Scream"", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.

In the end, this ""essential"" compilation is better than any other compilation available (HIStory Vol. 1; Number Ones, etc.) as it covers both the Jackson 5/Jacksons era and his solo output. It's very strange to me that this was released without any hype or advertizing campaign, but the main thing is that it's out and available. Hihgly recommended!",

I purchased this at B&N with a coupon in-store today, but will share with my Amazon brethren as I get 95% of my new vinyl here and love to add to the reviews that I myself greatly depend on.

I have decent mid-fi equipment, not really a reference system but certainly good enough to expose the quality of an inferior recording. 1978 Japanese Technics SL-220 with AT95e > TC750 > Yamaha RX-V377 > HD598 and the CD on the same RX and phones via Yamaha CDP-S300

I prefer the vinyl by a good margin, though the only fault I can find is the vocals are a little low in this mix. Record was dead flat (as in free of warps) drilled dead center, poly lined paper sleeve, lyrics sheet, download card. Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. #6 via KABUSA EV-1. Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks, generous lead-in area and dead wax, I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00.

It may be the most quiet metal record I own as far as background, and darn sure is the best for $18.99 or less. The record volume overall is a tad low but nothing that's not easily overcome by the volume control. I was impressed to the point that I will now seek out the new releases of Kill em All and Puppets, despite Puppets having some issues according to reviews.

So yeah, mix sounds nice and balanced, good bass, vocals recessed a tad, but not a big deal IMO. Very happy with the price/quality. Would recommend. Kill EM All is my favorite Thrash era Metallica and this album bridges the gab between that album and puppets.",

A2L167UOLOYOO0,9714721180,1,1,5,Since Amazon has lumped the Elektra CD release of this album i must specify which release i am reviewing. I am reviewing the 2000 24 karat Gold CD edition of Ride the Lightening remastered by Steve Hoffman. This is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab release just so people know. I own a few of their Miles Davis LP's remasters which sound amazing. Now back on track i have owned and played the hell out of Ride the Lightening (1995) CD put out by Elektra. While that version sounds good the 2000 Hoffman remaster blows any other CD edition out of the water. The album just has more life organic sound and does not sound harsh or filtered. The source material Mr. Hoffman worked on this release with was the original master tapes of the album. While the 1995 CD edition of RTL does not sound much different from the original vinyl version it did go through digital filtering possibly noise reduction and a few other things.  My reason for buying this version was i had heard Metallica had remastered Ride the Lightening again and were releasing a box set for the album. After hearing the sound on the album in that box had fallen victim to the loudness war i searched for an alternative. Snagging a decently priced copy of this long out of print remaster was luck on my part. All i have to say is if you care about sound stay far away from the RTL (2016 box set) it has nice extras which are tempting but yeah this 2000 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster is the way to go. Best sounding version of RTL in my humble opinion.,

A19I5KZQM3CA6W,9714721180,1,1,5,"Like with a handful of the albums I own in my now far larger CD collection, this album has been in my possession since I was about 14, so needless to say, I should have done this review a very long time ago. Straight to the point: I really have to say that this is my absolute favorite Metallica album of all time. As a perfect follow-up to ""Kill 'Em All"" the sophomore album ""Ride the Lighting"" marks a point in their career when they were in the prime of their quality brand of thrash metal, making a name for themselves as a band, and further rising to prominence in the '80s metal scene.

With a dark and eerie atmosphere, coupled with massive, thundering guitars, skull-crushing drums and raspy vocals, no metalhead in existence will be dissatisfied upon even the first listen, and will never want to skip over any songs. Every one of the songs on this album is a perfect illustration of what defined the True sound of Metallica and what made them such a great band. From the high-speed, neck-breaking insanity from songs such as ""Fight Fire With Fire,"" ""Trapped Under Ice"" & ""Creeping Death"" to the more steady, yet eerily menacing ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade To Black,"" this is the type of metal album that will never fail to disappoint any True Metallica fan.

Honestly, there is so much more I could say about this album that other have said before, I could go on all day about it! This, my friends, is the TRUE Metallica in their prime, and the defining sound of revolutionary metal greatness as we know it. Sadly, this period of their career in which they valued their art and staying True to themselves as musicians would not last beyond the '80s. We all know how they started to care more about money and sold out to the mainstream by going in a more alternative direction, ultimately destroying their own legitimacy as a metal band (See my review of their self-titled ""Black Album""), but at least we still have this album, along with ""Kill 'Em All,"" ""Master Of Puppets,"" and ""...And Justice For All"" to remind us of how awesome of a band they used to be.

All in all, this is definitely one album that makes no sense not to own, if you consider yourself a True Metallica fan, or a True metalhead in general. Just buy this album already! You know you want to. HORNS UP!!! \M/\M/",

I watched some documentaries about them and had no idea that they were an underground band which makes their success even cooler. Every song is great. The Call of Ktulu is insane. They are all extremely talented and this shows why people like their music so much.",
A2VSNUK7YLRKRE,9714721180,1,1,5,I love this album!  I still have the original vinyl picture disk but wanted to add the CD to my collection.  In my very humble opinion this is their best album with Garage Days a close second.,

WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!!!",

The album itself is just like And Justice and All dealing with death in certain songs like Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Creeping Death.  The album had a deep impact on me on many songs off the album because at the time I bought it I was dealing with thoughts of death and the Metallica music infulence my release threw my poems I wrote and really help me get threw a dark period in my life.  But the actual music has some amazing metal music within it and deep powerful lyrics in it.  So if your looking for some good thrash metal type music pick this album up and see how many songs off it you enjoy and maybe the album will help you threw a dark period your going threw just like it help me threw mine as I wrote my poems and other items I write.",

Metallica has been rocking the free world for big time and I am one of their most passionate fans. I love the way the guitars sound like a garbage truck going over the side of a cliff!

Sometimes, I'll be driving and I'll pull up to some ying-yang playing hip hop way too loud out of their Ford Focus and then I flip the switch on my stereo to ""Ride the Lightning"" and it blows their high school BS off the road!

If my parents let me I'm going to get a ""Freedom"" tattoo on my neck and one of Lars Ulrich's face on my right hand. That way, if my parents go out for the night it'll be me and Lars alone and there's not a court in the land that can stop us from doing ANYTHING we want.",

My favorite song on here is,Fade To Black,which is my favorite Metallica song of all time. But every song on this album rocks. Just a shame there is only eight tracks on here though.

A33M07VZBYRMPY,9714721180,1,1,5,"Ride the Lightning is one of my favorite Metallica album. It presents a fast and harsh music and lyrics, respectively, similar to that style of Slayer. I often state that Ride the Lightning and Kill'em All are two progenitors of thrash and death metal albums.",
A1432KCCCZL550,9714721180,1,1,5,"If you're new to Metallica, this and the follow up, Master Of Puppets, are the albums to get, if you're a metal fan anyways. these 2 are hands down their best.

For an, at the time, little known metal band, the production is really good. Everyone is in top form. James's vocals are a little higher than they'd be after this album, which adds to the charm of this album. The band was driven. they had some good material, partly thanks to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. And they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan's attention.

Fight Fire With Fire 10/10 - starts off with an acoustic intro that fades out as the electric guitars fade in. All this to lead into possibly the fastest Metallica song ever. This is a perfect opener with great guitar work, and vocals. this is definitely in a long list of favorite songs by Metallica, which every song with lyrics on this album actually are on.

Ride The Lightning 9/10 is an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verses. Plus a catchy chorus. Overall a very good song.

For Whom The Bell Tolls 10/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever. Granted it has stiff competition, but it might be. This one has a nice groove to it. This one's still fairly heavy, but not as heavy as the past 2 songs. There are some good melodies, and the guitar playing is really good. I hate to give credit to Lars, but his drums really add power to this song.

Fade To Black 9/10 is the first Metallica ballad. It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads. It doesn't really have a chorus, just a riff, instrumental based chorus, similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot. And it works fine. The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style, then the song speeds up for the bridge and solo. Overall a very good song.

Trapped Under Ice 9/10 after a ballad, what do any good metal bands do? They come back with a fast paced thrasher, which is what they did here. This is the second fastest song on the album. The song has a nice pace to it, and is an overall fun listen.

Escape 9/10 is kind of the pop song of the album. Odd it gets no recognition. This is probably the catchiest song on the album. This one's similar pacing to Ride The Lightning. It has a really good chorus, and is yet another in a long list of great songs on here.

Creeping Death 10/10 is another contender for favorite Metallica song. It's a fairly fast paced thrasher with a great horus. It has some slower parts as well and is a great way to close out the album.

Then there's an instrumental which I won't rate because I'm not really into instrumentals. It's played just fine, so I'm sure for fans of them it'll do.

Overall if you're a metal fan new to Metallica, which would be surprising, this is a good place to start. You won't be disappointed.",
A38T0YN4VC4ZIE,9714721180,1,1,5,"Ride the Lightning is a lot better in my opinion but both are still great albums. RTL has the best of early thrash/speed metal but it also has some progressive influences that would show more on their next 2 releases. Ride the Lightning has the perfect mix and it's a classic. The band matured also from their previous both musically and lyrically, it's a but darker than their first album. It's also their first album to feature Cliff Burton on bass in every track, replaced Ron McGovney which he was the original bassist. Dave Mustaine was fired in 1983 and formed Megadeth, former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet replaced him and RTL is their first to feature him on guitar. The band gets their line up together here. All of the songs are great but Creeping Death is my personal favorite.",
AWSYTZ2I2MW0V,9714721180,1,1,5,"This is a piece of metal magic. All the songs are glorious one, all the songs are classics. Metallica really creates metal magic on Ride the Lightning.

A2U80IPZXN5V1U,9714721180,1,1,5,"Metallica are truly one of the forces to be reckoned with in their genre of music whether you call it Metal, Heavy-Metal or Thrash is of little importance, they're one of the greats. While everyone has their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely cannot take away their achievements and the great music they have put out. Metallica already proved themselves to be a great band with their debut album Kill `Em All which has that early real raw and unpolished sound that makes it a fan favorite. 1984's Ride The Lightning expands on the formula of Kill `Em All and shows a bit more maturity, I mean the debut is great and it shows a lot talent it also shows a lot of anger from some seriously p***** off teenagers. You can see a certain progression, a development from the first album and they were becoming more and more the band that would release Master of Puppets. Ride is a dynamic and solid album all the way through, it also features tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that's still very much present more than 25 years later.

The opening song ""Fight Fire With Fire"" with its gentle guitar opening gives the impression that it's going to be a slower and softer song than usual for Metallica. WRONG! It soon changes and suddenly becomes very fast, perhaps one of the fastest Metallica songs. Excellent track to begin an excellent album. The title track, Ride, remains to this day one of my favorite Metallica songs with its incredibly fast solos and powerful lyrics. ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" has one of the most iconic intros in Metal, once again amazing lyrics by James (""take a look to the sky just before you die, it's the last time you will"", sounds nice doesn't it?). ""Fade to Black"" can almost be considered a ballad for the band, the lyrics are so personal and depressing yet the song is uplifting. It's a slower song for Metallica but it progressively gets heavier, the song has such a strong feel it's hard to overlook how great it is. In fact it's one of my favorite Metallica track to this day.""Trapped Under Ice"", ""Escape"" and ""Creeping Death"" are also very good songs that should not be ignored, those songs are excellent but have not often been played live.""The Call of Ktulu"" is an amazing 8+ minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that.

Ride The Lightning while not a concept album is mostly about the different types of death and ways of dying and it shows in the song titles (Ice, electrocution and others) making of Ride a dark record. Ride is also the last album on which Dave Mustaine receives credit; here he is credited on two tracks, the title track and the instrumental ""The Call of Ktulu"". James came up with some particularly great lyrics on Ride The Lightning as he usually does, but here it's really special. Ride has terrific guitar work courtesy of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet, excellent bass from Cliff Burton and solid drumming from Lars Ulrich. It would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that had a huge role and impact on the Thrash movement. These songs are classic Metal tracks and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt knows all about them already.

Some prefer the early raw Metallica sound of Kill `Em All and some prefer the acclaimed Master of Puppets album. With respect to those two amazing alums, out of the three first Metallica albums I'll have to say that Ride The Lightning is my personal favorite out of the three and is probably the one I like best of all the albums the band has done. I love Master just as much as the next guy but it's been overplayed, some of the stuff here has been overplayed as well but to a lesser degree. As much as I love the rawness of Kill `Em All I think the band is better on Ride. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that Ride The Lightning is an amazing Metallica album, it features deep lyrics, skillful guitar playing and is everything there is to like about the band to begin with. A total Metal album, I very much enjoy this ""Ride"" years later. 5/5 for this one, a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general.",
A1NF9WS7RR82MX,9714721180,1,1,5,"When fans talk about Metallica, many of them refer to the first four albums as thrash classics, grouping them together as if they all feature the same style and fit into the same genre.  What I see many people fail to point out is that Ride the Lightning was just as huge a shift in sound and style from Kill `Em All as The Black Album was from And Justice For All.

When Metallica wrote Kill `Em All, thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal didn't exist yet.  They were influenced by speed metal bands like Venom and Motorhead, and produced a debut album where the musical traits of those bands were stamped clearly on just about every song.  Starting with Ride the Lightning, Metallica made a full shift to thrash, essentially defining the genre by making far more use of shredding riffs, melodic solos, and high-speed double bass drumming.  While James still utilized his scream on tracks like Trapped Under Ice, he employed a deeper overall tone and used a more gruff delivery.  You really don't hear many similarities to Kill `Em All musically; I mean, what songs from Ride the Lightning would sound right on that album?  In my opinion, none.  They  showed incredible progression and maturity from the wild, intense nature of Kill `Em All to the controlled powerhouse approach of Ride the Lightning.

The album itself is an easy five stars (bold statement, right?).  What metal fan doesn't know For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade to Black by heart?  Crushing thrash songs like Fight Fire With Fire, the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping Death are relentlessly aggressive.  Escape highlights the melodic NWOBHM influence that was virtually non-existent on Kill `Em All.  The perennial favorite Metallica instrumental, The Call of Ktulu, rounds out one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  It has a sound completely distinct from their others, has some of the best songs in Metallica's catalog, and without question belongs in any collection of heavy music.",
A3GP5YP52BD4EX,9714721180,1,1,5,first of all if you don't know about Metallica you probably be very young. Just buy it for the beginning . All the songs are master-super-heavy metal songs.

Fade to blcak - For whom the bell tolls - Creeping Death - The call of Ktullu - and the other songs are just amazing . there is a strong feeling by hearing this songs .,
A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,9714721180,1,1,5,"It seems like Metallica is turning into a band that you either love or hate as years go by. That's pretty sad, because the band is essentially one of the all-time great metal bands of all time. Some people will say that they're overrated. Well, I say that I still enjoy their music a whole lot. A majority of their albums are living proof that they can create powerful and haunting music. Ride The Lightning, the second album and the first without former member Dave Mustaine, is an all-around masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's pure brilliance. Songs like ""Fade to Black"" and ""Creeping Death"" are sure to please every Metallica fan out there. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is not only my personal favorite on the album, but also my personal favorite from the band themselves. It's five minutes of pure awesomeness. ""The Call of Ktulu"" is a 9-minute instrumental that may be boring to some, but I find the melodies and sounds to be completely engaging. In short, I won't describe what the songs mean or sound like, since I'm sure almost every reviewer on this page are Metallica fans. I'll just conclude by saying that Ride The Lightning is a great metal album.

Grade: 9.8/10",

ASP7N59L4E90M,9714721180,1,1,5,This is one of the best thrash metal albums ever and it's just raw and powerful totally recomend this to any old school metallica fan or any metal fan in general. But I can't put this ahead of Master Of Puppets.,
A3KZ7OH4VRL048,9714721180,1,1,5,"Talk of Metallica albums usually passes over ""Ride the Lightning""; you hear how great ""Master of Puppets"" is, the transition that was ""the black album"" and general disgust at ""St. Anger."" The truth is, without ""Ride the Lightning,"" we never would have seen any of the others.

""Ride the Lightning"" was Metallica's sophomore album, and it represents a quantum leap forward over ""Kill 'Em All,"" setting the sound that has come to be known as ""Metallica"" to us. The songs are more refined, yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor. While it would later be refined into ""Master of Puppets,"" arguably the greatest metal album ever, this album is still a masterpience, containing ""Fade to Black"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" as well as the very-well-done instrumental track ""The Call of Ktulu.""

Definitely an essential pickup for a Metallica fan, and one of the first few albums you should buy if you're just getting into the band.",
A34HYQ9BQZPE78,9714721180,1,1,5,"Metallica's sophomore album, ""Ride The Lightning"" certainly showcases some interesting and classic thrashers. It's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album. It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica's early catalogue, considering ""Kill 'Em All"" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal, ""Master of Puppets"" is regarded as Metallica's magnum opus, and ""...And Justice For All"" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for ""One"".
Regardless of whether or not ""Ride The Lightning"" is overlooked or not, it's still a classic that should be in every metalhead's collection. One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica's debut, it seems to have a thicker, more polished, and at times, more epic sound. Don't get me wrong, though, I still think ""The Four Horsemen"" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics, but to get a full review of ""Ride The Lightning"", simply read on.
""Fight Fire With Fire"" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute. Suddenly, a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour. The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare. The singing is also very raw, with James singing a very staccato pattern, ""Do!...Un!...-to others!...As!...They've!...Done to you!"". Great way to start off the album.
""Ride The Lightning"", the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high-pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy, Devil's Tritone riff. Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here, along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment.
""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" is a progressive, five-minute classic with plenty of great guitar riffs that occupy the first two minutes of the song. The nastiest riff of them all is featured in the chorus, and some wild guitar playing closes this war song out.
""Fade To Black"" is a personal favorite of mine, one of the best songs on the album, and one of the very best songs Metallica's ever written. Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo. Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses, then comes a powerful chorus riff. More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out.
""Trapped Under Ice"" is another heavy song about struggle, featuring some dirty riffage and wild soloing that definitely makes itself worthy to be on the album.
""Escape"" is a more melodic, radio-friendly sounding song, but nonetheless a great track, as well. A bit shorter and a pretty cool song.
""Creeping Death"" is a song that defines thrash metal. This is an overall great song that you gotta hear. Its lyrics refer to the Seven Plagues in the story of Moses in the Bible, and the thrashing riffs pummel their way into your brain. And, as always, Kirk Hammett shows us why he's an amazing guitarist when he screeches out those awesome guitar solos.
""The Call of Ktulu"" is a nine-minute, progressive instrumental. A cool way to end the album, it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums, alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone. I personally prefer ""Orion"" off ""Master of Puppets"", but this song is definitely a great one, too.
So as you can see, ""Ride The Lightning"" is undoubtedly a classic metal album. I've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time, and when you give this a listen, you'll see why. All of the tracks are very strong, the songwriting's great, as are the singing, guitar-, bass-, and drum-playing. Get this, along with the other three Metallica releases in the '80s, and even ""The Black Album"" if you're interested. Overall, this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrash metal, and heavy metal in general. Good job to the 'tallica guys! Thanks for the time, and peace.",

Ride The Lightning - Electrocution
For Whom The Bell Tolls - On the battlefield
Fade To Black - Suicide
Trapped Under Ice - Drowning
Escape - Difficult to explain, listen and make your mind up about it
Creeping Death - Murder
All these songs are classics with great big crunchy guitar riffs, thick, heavy drumming, powerful bass, and to top it off great lyrics.",
A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,9714721180,1,1,4,"After the blistering debut Metallica delve further into their psyche, further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated NWOBHM muse. And it's a more difficult metal experience in general, the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument. Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener.

After that however the differences start seeping in. Ride The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I'm not sure it needs it. For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it's excellent musical and lyrical assault. The production values on this album seem a little dull, the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door.

But the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release. The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu. And the literary references are a nice touch. Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends (hey, we've all been there), it's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it.

All up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice. There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there. But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff. In fact I'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it's debut Kill `Em All through to the black album. If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum.",
A2582KMXLK2P06,9714721180,1,1,5,"Ride the Lightning is the one Metallica album that seriously has a lot of aggressive power and remains a classic to this day.  While I'm not particularly thrilled with a few moments here and there, overall it's much better than what many of the metal bands in the mid 80's were doing (with all their big hair, constant partying and chicks).  Metallica's music remains fresh and exciting all these years later.  This album was REALLY underrated back in the mid 80's.  People back then didn't know how to approach something with this much speed and punch.

Fight Fire With Fire- a plodding guitar riff, and the idea for an acoustic intro is ripped off from a couple old Black Sabbath tunes.  The verse melody is horrible but the chorus is decent.

Ride the Lightning- the best part of the song is the 15-second guitar intro.  I love that.  Great chorus as well that remains memorable no matter how many times it's played.  Great guitar solo as well.  Some parts of the solo remind me of the mid 70's Rainbow song called ""Light in the Black"".

For Whom the Bell Tolls- let's just call it the way it is- this is a classic metal track in the same way ""Iron Man"" is Black Sabbath's classic.

Fade to Black- a softer number that gradually builds into a much heavier and typical Metallica track.  It's not really a ballad.  It's a shame the verse melody has been copied time and time again by Metallica themselves as early as their Black Album in the early 90's.  The original idea was right here on this album.  The lyrics don't sound very emotionally honest though.  I like the second half of the song more even though parts of the guitar solo sound ripped off from Black Sabbath's ""Snowblind"".

Trapped Under Ice- flashy guitar playing that sounds like a leftover from the Kill 'em All album.  Not that that's a bad thing, mind you.

Escape- really good song, though the chorus sounds stuck in the 80's with that dated sound.  I like the way the verse melody chugs along.  Great lyrics by their standards too.

Creeping Death- another memorable heavy/speed metal track.  These guys were clearly more talented than most.  The guitar solo sure sounds like it was copied from a popular Scorpions song at the time.

Call of Ktulu- a very slow, rocking build up.  It's really good but 9 minutes might tire out some people.

You need to have at least one Metallica album in your collection, and none of them are better than this one.  Get it.",
A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,9714721180,1,1,5,"RIDE THE LIGHTENING, Metallica's second album, is notable for its musical direction, combining thrash metal with more symphonic, and much more complex, songwriting than previously seen in metal music.

When Metallica recorded their debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Em-All/dp/B000002H5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill 'Em All</a>, the record was brutal, fast, and noholds barred.  The music barrels ahead, and there isn't nearly as many different instrumental subtetlies and flourishes that Metallica would later use to adorn their music with.  Instead, the focus was to play the music as loud, and as fast, as humanly possible.  They sounded rather like their contemporaries in drawing from the same overall musical milieu.  A lot of bands from NWOBHM (""New Wave of British Heavy Metal"") were covering a lot of the same territory, such as Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Motorhead, early Def Leppard (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Through-the-Night/dp/B000001F7R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Through the Night</a>, their 1980 album, not their hair metal stuff), Saxon and other bands considered part of that movement..

Beginning with this record, and culminating in ... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, Metallica changed their approach.  Still retaining the aggression and attitude of punk, mixed with the loud, bone-crunching amalgamation heavy metal sound popularized the major bands of NWOBHM then put in progressive songwriting that owes as much to classical music as pop or rock or traditional heavy metal, and you have a good idea of what RIDE THE LIGTHENING,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Master-of-Puppets/dp/B000002H33/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Master of Puppets</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/And-Justice-For-All/dp/B000002H6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">...And Justice For All</a>&nbsp;sounds like.  Those three records are what I call their progressive metal trilogy; with each album their song writing got more complex and more symphonic.

As much as I like KILL `EM ALL, this is the album in which Metallica really comes into their own.  While KILL `EM ALL has some very strong songwriting, they don't display the same complexity and melodic integrity as they do on this record. All over we see Metallica opening their sound up.

""Fire with Fire"": The soft intro to ""Battery"" from MASTER feels like a nod to the great acoustic intro to the opening track, ""Fire for Fire"".  After the mellow intro, the band kicks the song into high gear.  This shift is clear evidence the band is mastering different dynamics and integrating shifting tempos into a coherent song structure, and they're not just brutally fast like KILL `EM ALL.

""Ride the Lightening"" is one of Metallica's more epic compositions.  Lyrically the song sets up themes of being powerless in a hostile situation, a theme Hetfield would often return too.

""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" deals with the futility of war, another theme the and would revisit on both MASTER and JUSTICE, and is titled after the Earnest Hemingway novel.  One of the band's more famous early songs.  The intro is pretty long, at over two minutes before Hetfield starts singing.

""Fade to Black"" is notable as it is the first ballad ever commercially released by the band.  [Just because they were labeled sell outs during the load era doesn't mean it diddn't happen fore then.]  Those people who hate LOAD and RELOAD should take note that accusations that Metallica sold out first surfaced with this very song, due to how much of a departure this was for the band's clearly established sound.  Now, however, most fans and critics, as well as the band itself, considered this one of Metallica's great songs.  The song is very much a study in dynamics, and while it is primarily a slower ballad, Metallica works in some heavy passages in the song as well.  The song deals mainly with death, and is considered a ""suicide classic"".  This is one of Metallica's most important songs, as it showed the band's fan base there was a lot more to the band than just mind numbingly fast thrash.

""Trapped Under Ice"" has some killer chorus work and interesting lyrics.  Musically it's very solid as well.  The song has some absolutely intense guitar work.  Probably the second weakest song though, next to ""Escape.""  Metallica has only performed the song four times live.

""Escape"" is one of the few songs the band has never played live.  Written as filler because they didn't have enough songs for the album, the band has pretty much disavowed the song.  While I don't know why the band hates it that much, it is True that this is easily the weakest song on the entire album, though not necessarily bad par se.  It's just the other songs are that good.

""Creeping Death"", written from the point of view of the angel of death coming to kill all the first born in Egypt, remains one of the band's principal early epics, and is still one of their most frequently played songs.  Drawing their inspiration from the movie THE TEND COMMANDMENTS, Cliff Burton made the observation that the plague of the first born was like creeping death, and the band wanted to use it for a title they liked it so much.  One of the band's most famous of their early songs, this one's an undeniable thrash classic.

And last, but definitely not least, is ""The Call of Ktula"".  The second instrumental released by the band (after Anethestia, Pulling Teeth from KILL `EM ALL), this is the last song primarily written by David Mustaine of Megadeath fame that Metallica would record. Originally entitled ""When Hell Freezes Over"", Cliff Burton had the song renamed, because he was a H. P. Lovecraft fan and was referencing THE CALL OF CTHULHU.  Megadeath actually uses the chords for their song ""Hanger 18"". Discounting the two covers ""Tuesday's Gone"" and ""Mercyful Fate"" it's the band's fourth longest recording, and the longest song on RIDE THE LIGHTENING.  For my money, this is one of my favorite Metallica songs, and when I really started listening to this album in the late 1990s, this was the song I would play over and over.  It's much better than MASTER's instrumental ""Orion"".  Absolutely brilliant, even if Mustaine did write it.

Overall, this is the album that would set Metallica on the artistic path they would follow for the rest of the 1980s.  This is the album they became truly progressive.  If it weren't for ""Escape"", this could arguably be one of their top albums; as it stands, this is still one of Metallica's best records, just only slightly flawed for the inclusion of ""Escape"".  And it's important that while hair metal and spandex were giving metal a bad name, bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden were still keeping the hardcore music close to its roots.  Hair metal and glam/pop is rather dated.  It's too Metallica's credit that their albums stand up as well as they do and aren't dated at all, given they were, recorded in that same era of Def Leppard, Poison (damn Brett Michaels), Ratt, Slaughter, Warrant, Stryper, Europe, Journey, and other rather ridiculous bands were doing commercial hair metal and power ballads.",
A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,9714721180,1,1,5,"This is only Metallica's 2nd album, but already they were turning into a great, ""thinking man's"" heavy metal.  Sometimes I like to think this is Metallica's debut, because this is really the first album where they became Metallica.  Many early fans bemoan Metallica's later albums, wanting them to return to the days of thrash metal with Kill 'Em All (their weakest album in my opinion).  They say they sold out by using slower tempos and multi instrumentation (like pedal steel guitars and hurdy-gurdy).  The reality is that Metallica has always been ambitious, and here on their 2nd album, they prove in conclusively.  This is a fantastic album, one that has really stood the test of time (it was made over 20 years ago, and still sounds fresh today).  It is loaded with classic Metallica tracks.  The thrash opener Fight Fire with Fire, the fantastic title track, the brilliant For Whom the Bell Tolls, the magisterial, signature track Fade to Black, another majestic, signature track in Creeping Death (one of my all time favorites), and the brilliant, prog influenced instrumental that closes the album, The Call of Ktulu.  It is also interesting to note that Kirk Hammett has a much larger role on this album.  He co-wrote many of the songs, and his lead guitar doesn't seem thrown in like it did on Kill 'Em All.  This is one of my favorite Metallica albums.  It's the 2nd step in a discography that just keeps getting better.",
A1OML05BTJBEKS,9714721180,1,1,5,"Metallica's second album, and their first for a major record label Elektra, entitled Ride the Lightning is also arguably their best album ever.
First released in August of 1984, Ride the Lightning was considered a metal masterpiece in the underground at the time of its release.
After the promising debut album Kill 'em All in 1983, Metallica (which was comprised of singer/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich and the late great bass player Cliff Burton), the band's cult following got them a major record deal with Elektra Records and the band went to Denmark with the band themselves producing and using one-time Rainbow engineer Flemming Rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which I found to be the case when I first got this album in May of 1989 on cassette.
The album starts off with ""Fight Fire With Fire"" which at first sounded like it was going to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars playing a relaxing melody but then Hammett and Hetfield's guitars come screaming in as was Ulrich's drumming which sounded like Bruce Lee on speed and Burton's bass playing which was superb. James' vocals on the track sounded sinister. We continue the rocking on the album's classic title cut which is a classic thrashy cut with tempo changes that would make the prog rockers happy. Next is another classic metal track ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" which is a superb rocker with a beat that sounds like marching off to war. The first half ends with ""Fade to Black"" which for the most part was a ballad before speeding up and was IMHO the Stairway to Heaven of the 80s as, like that song, starts soft then picks up then softens then gets harder and harder before the big finale.
The album's second half kicks off with a classic thrash number called ""Trapped Under Ice"" which is just superb. Next is another great metal number ""Escape"". However, it's a shame that these two great songs are overlooked by many. We then come to one of Metallica's best pre-1991 masterworks ""Creeping Death"" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing. We end the album with the epic instrumental called ""The Call of Ktulu"" which sounds like the band had been listening to ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes as the piece is filled with tempo changes, key changes and is just stellar, especially Hammett and Burton's solos on guitar and wah-wah bass respectively.
While Ride the Lightning scraped the Top 100 upon its release without either radio or MTV or even mainstream media support, the album today is now their third largest selling album with some five million copies sold in the US alone today.
Most Metallica fans from 1991 onward probably don't like this album but us purists who liked their speed metal sound in their early days then this album is for you.
Highly recommended!",
A1JIW8GOSSGUQR,9714721180,1,1,5,"There are many agruements of what the best Metallica album was. I have to say that Ride the Lightning was easily their best effort, and might be one of the top 10 metal records ever made. Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10, and every single tune is heavy as hell (except for Call of the Katula, but it does some crunching at the end) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again. True the Master of Puppets is great to, but I don't think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning. Master has really been worn out since I listened to it soooo much, that it really doesnt do it for me anymore. I still love Ride the Lightning as they day I bought it in 1986. ENJOY!",
A2H22I2RWE0HOV,9714721180,1,1,5,"The division between Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning is huge.  The albums sound like two different bands.  Amazing.  Where KEA was juvenile and garage-bandish, Ride The Lightning was the polished effort.  Don't get me wrong, a lot of great songs came from KEA, but Ride The Lightning is better.  Fight Fire With Fire opens up the album (back when it was an actual album) and never looks back!  Absolute pure shred!  Ride The Lightning, Creeping Death, Fade To Black, & For Whom The Bell Tolls!  All Classics!  Their first really professional effort for Electra, with the final batch of Dave Mustaine co-written tunes. Clearly one of the greatest metal albums of all time.

Dig it!",
A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,9714721180,1,1,5,"Metallica.  Once brought up into a conversation, two things pop into a mans mind.  One of a historically important Thrash band, that made an impact upon almost anybody who cared to listen, and a historically important band that practically changed their name to Nutallica and also practically sold their souls for money.  Both of these are True, but the first is so fresh and original and important that to this very day, we still love these songs.  The True Metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best.  Although there are only 8 songs here, they are all of a decently long length and are all so beautiful that you never want them to end.  This was Metallica, not the Metallica of today with 6 minute songs containing stupid lyrics, a trash can and no solos.  After the Black album pay no attention to them,  you'll only be disappointed, but back to this album.  Kill `em All was the beginning of Metallica, and here on their second album, they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of Hit the lights or Whiplash (great songs but not important lyrically speaking).  Almost all of these songs are about Death.  Not death in the sense of Cannibal Corpse's Hammer Smashed Face, but more so in that that each is about a different issue, and makes a point and has something important to say.  With a short break down I'll show what I mean.

1. Fight Fire with Fire 10/10: one of the best and fastest metallica songs in my opinion.  This one is about Nuclear Warfare

2. Ride the Lightning 10/10: Beautiful solos, a song that you'll be happy to have stuck in your head.  This one is about the Electric Chair.

3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 10/10: slower, but one of the most important tracks here.  It's about the Spanish Civil war and also has something to do with H.P. Lovecraft, an author whom Kirk has a fascination with.

4. Fade to Black 9/10: a friend of mine finds this to be relatively boring.  In my opinion you need to be in the right mood for this song.  But when you are in the mood, this song rocks.  It is about Suicide, and from what I understand this song was also controversial because a man killed himself while listening to it back in the 80's.

5. Trapped Under Ice 8/10: Great song, the solos are great, the atmosphere is great.  It's about, well, being trapped under ice.

6. Escape 8/10: the only song not about death, more so about escaping from a town that wants you to be a certain way, and therefore rebelling.  Remember, 8/10 still means good, it's just that track 1-4 are classics.

7. Creeping Death 9/10: It's told through the eyes of the Grim Reaper.  An all around great song.  I love the middle part.

8. The Call of Ktulu 10/10: A beautiful instrumental, once again about an H.P. lovecraft story. I actually read this one and it's a good read, very strange.  In my opinion, this is far better than Orion from Master of Puppets, but that's just my opinion.

There is something about Ride the Lightning that I can not explain with any other record.  It has this strange dusty feeling to it.  When glancing at a copy of it, it appears to be rather old and unused (even a brand new copy).  Popping it into a CD player, the production has this weird dusty feeling to it that has the same feeling.  But when listening to it, it seems like a gem or relic that one has discovered in the attic of an old house.  It has this mystic atmosphere to it that can not be replicated or understood really.  James's voice also has a rough edge to it as well that isn't on other Metallica records.  This is my favorite Metallica record, as I can listen to it from start to finish and NEVER become bored at all.  Anyone who likes metal should have some Metallica in their collection.  I don't consider them to be the best metal band in history, (as a matter of fact I don't give that title to any band) but this is a valuable history lesson from the world of thrash.  Metallica were once great, people listened to metallica for those beautiful solos, for the touching and fun lyrics and song meanings.  But if you want a great drummer than look elsewhere because Lars is easily disposable, and I could name [insert any number here] of drummers that are better than him.  Lars just does enough to get by but he'll still have his moments of talent, though in this present day, I don't think there is a single person who doesn't want to just punch him in the face.  Well enough about this album, just find it, get it in your collection and enjoy.  Hoped this helped.",
ASVNSWIXBV72Q,9714721180,1,1,5,"Metallica's second album, 1984's ""Ride the Lightning,"" was the first real metal album I ever bought. When I bought it, I was looking for a really heavy album, so when the first track began with an acoustic intro, I was sorely disappointed. Luckily, however, I skipped to the next song, the title track, and its booming intro brought a big smile to my face. Ah, nostalgia.

With 1983's ""Kill `Em All,"" Metallica helped create thrash metal; but they followed up their debut with their sophomore album, which was released only a year later. Most metalheads have given it the credit it deserves, but I feel ""Ride the Lightning"" is still somewhat underrated, since the album that followed this one was ""Master of Puppets.""

""Ride the Lightning"" is still fast. Most of it shoots by like...well, lightning; but it's slower, darker, heavier and more mature than ""Kill `Em All."" James' voice is somewhat lower than it was, and his lyrics are improved. As the above Amazon editorial review mentions, James discusses several different ways to die: Armageddon, capitol punishment, suicide, being trapped under ice, etc.

""Fight Fire with Fire"" has the aforementioned acoustic intro, but it's just a tease-it doesn't last. The power chords fade in and the song becomes a breakneck speed, with rip-roaring, almost Slayer-esque guitar work. Lyrically, this songs seems to be about the Apocalypse.

""Ride the Lightning"" is the album's most popular single. It's another thrashy number, with booming rhythms, fiery chug and churn riffs (which go from fast to faster to slow to fast), and an awesome, lengthy Hammett solo. ""Ride the Lightning"" has good lyrics about being executed by the electric chair, and it also has a surprise ending, but most of this song is an instrumental.

""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is slower paced, but still loud and heavy. The first two minutes of this song is an instrumental, beginning with a bell ringing, then the heavy, repetitive, churning guitars kick in. This song has another good, winding solo near the end.

""Fade to Black"" is really morbid because it has depressing, introspective lyrics about suicide. It begins with a distant guitar solo, but the acoustic strums actually make the first part of this song rather pretty. (Pretty in a dark and depressing way, but pretty nonetheless.) The choruses still have heavy riffs, and the end is an ascending and cascading solo.

""Trapped Under Ice"" is very fast paced with another short but sweet guitar solo near the middle.

""Escape"" has vocals which make it radio ready (it has good vocal hooks). Most of the song has propulsive riffs with thunderous drumming, but the choruses are slower.

""Creeping Death"" begins with machine gun guitars and drumming, before changing to another fast beat with guitars that burn straight ahead. And, of course, there's another stellar solo near the end.

""The Call of KTULU"" is the album's instrumental. In my opinion, this song IS as great as ""Orion"" (from Metallica's next album, ""Master of Puppets,"") and it's a very good way to end the album. It starts out slowly and ominously with wind wooshes, but then it suddenly becomes a lot faster. This song builds well and has superb guitar and drum work.

So, this disc is another wonderful landmark album and it's still one of the best C.D.'s of the past two decades. All of the qualities of a classic metal or thrash metal album are here: long songs (about 6 minutes per song), rapid fire riffs, ripping solos, an instrumental track, and even some acoustic guitar licks. In conclusion, if you want a complete metal collection, or if you just like heavy metal, you need this album more than you need your next breath.",
AE42JLYPXUI45,9714721180,1,1,5,"In 1984, Metallica had released their sophmore album entitled, RIDE THE LIGHTNING. This album turned out to be even better than KILL 'EM ALL. This album was definite in proving Metallica to be the best Heavy Metal act out there. This album has all the sound you could ever want from a Heavy Metal band.

FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE

This song is just astonishing. Any self-respecting Metallica fan would love this song. I sure as hell love this song.

RIDE THE LIGHTNING

Ah. The album's incredible title track. Can't get enough of this song and it sure can't get any better than this.

FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS

When I said it couldn't get any better than ""Ride The Lightning"", I was wrong. This album just keeps getting better, especially on this tune. Damn, this frigging guys can rock.

FADE TO BLACK

This song is my favorite off of the album. All I do is listen to this song a first time, then I start again for an encore presentation. If you listen carefully, you'll notice the song is talking about suicide. Gotta love this song.

TRAPPED UNDER ICE

Incredible.

ESCAPE

A great song with great lyrics and a rockin' sound.

CREEPING DEATH

As much as I love hearing this one, it creeps me out because of the title. But I can't help it when I just sing along with James on this one.

THE CALL OF KTULU

Instrumental song.

What an album! These guys know what fans want in a Heavy Metal album. This band is definitely going to be here for a long a** time. So get up off your a** and buy this album if you don't have it already.",

Picking up where their debut album Kill'Em ALL left off, Ride The Lightning has better production. The opening track Fight Fire With Fire starts off with a little accoustic intro, and suddenly warps into thrashing speed and will have you headbanging throughout. The title cut is another menacing headbanging track as well. For Whom The Bell Tolls and the awesome thrash ballad Fade To Black are two of the band's most popular songs. Creeping Death is another great song, and of course the closing track The Call Of Ktulu is an epic instrumental. James Hetfield's vocals are good, and his rhythm guitarwork is good as well. Kirk Hammet's lead guitarwork is splendid. Cliff Burton's bass lines are very menacing, and Lars Ulrich's drumming is good as well. Anyways, this is a great album and should be a part of your collection. Buy it now! R.I.P Cliff Burton

But I digress. ""Ride The Lightning"" is easily one of the most awesome, headbanging, and skilled metal albums ever recorded. It rightfully earns its place in every metalhead's favorite album list. Insane drumming, loud riffs, blistering solos, and actual melody worked into the mix... once again, THIS is Metallica! From the intense, apocolyptic opener ""Fight Fire With Fire"", to the epic ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", the beautifully written semi-ballad ""Fade To Black"", and, of course, the metal classic ""Creeping Death"", this album grabs a hold of the listener, and never lets go throughout the whole album!

AX94XE2KY5WK4,9714721180,1,1,5,"If Metallica's 1983 ""Kill 'Em All"" wrote the book on thrash metal, then their sophomore release ""Ride The Lightning"" re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of. It was simply revolutionary at the time. Since ""Kill 'Em All"", the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents, technique and their approach with this groundbreaker. Every track offers something new, and experimental. The instruments aren't the only improvement. Hetfield's lyrics are much more personal, and conscious. The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from ""Kill 'Em All"" out of the water. Tracks such as ""Fade To Black"" and ""The Call of Ktulu"" were absolutely phenomenal works, untouched by the standards of 1984. And although it's up for debate, Hammett's guitar solos are my favorite on this album. Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on ""Ride The Lightning"", that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen, and still does to this day. Other highlights include ""Fight Fire with Fire,"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". This album rocks in epic proportions.

A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,9714721180,1,1,5,"Ride The Lightning is one of the best albums of the thrash/speed metal genre and along with their next album Master of Puppets is Metallica's best work. While their first album Kill 'Em All relied more on speed metal, Ride The Lightning showed the band expanding their musical horizons and their songwriting abilities, which would lead to their breakthrough in America.
Every track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics. The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs, death, and the struggle within. There is much diversity to be found here whether it's the excellent speed metal of ""Fight Fire With Fire"" and ""Trapped Under Ice"" or the longer epics ""The Call Of Ktulu"", the title track, and the awesome ""Creeping Death."" The menacing ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Escape"" are also very strong tracks. Then there's ""Fade To Black"", the best track the band has ever recorded, and is to heavy metal what ""Stairway To Heaven"" is to classic rock. This is simply an incredible song, between its several different movements and its lyrics which tell of a man contemplating suicide. The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song's outro is one of the best ever of the genre. Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal. Highly recommended.",

'Fight Fire With Fire' starts off with a soft intro and it turns into a thrash metalhead's heaven and it's a killer song and I love the explosion at the end of the song. 10/10
'Ride the Lightning' is the title track and it's another Metallica classic although it isn't nearly as fast as the previous song but it's worthy enough to enter inside a thrash metalhead's mind. 8/10
'For Whom the Bell Tolls' starts off with the tolling bell and although I didn't think much for this song at first but the chorus lines helped me like this song and the tolling bells is awesome. 10/10
'Fade to Black' is a bit slower and softer than the previous songs they've done but Metallica can do a slower song very well (that is up until they're Load stuff) and the loud guitar's somewhat reminds me of Black Sabbath's Iron Man which is also a classic, and there are more songs to come that have the same vein as 'Fade to Black'. 10/10
'Trapped Under Ice' is probably my least favorite song off of this album but it's still a good song especially compared to their post-Black Album era. 7/10
'Escape' is probably the most underrated song off of this album and I actually like this song alot, and I wish that the same thing can be said with the other Metallica fans. 9/10
'Creeping Death' is another standout for this album and it's one of their heaviest songs off of this album. 10/10
'The Call of Ktulu' is the closing track and believe it or not, I actually didn't think much for this song but I gave it a few listens and now this is my favorite song off of this album and I could listen to this song like 5 times in a row and never get tired of it, Ride the Lightning is worth it for the price of this song alone and this song is easily one of heavy metal's best instrumentals of all time. 10/10
If you never heard of anything that Metallica has done before the Black Album? Then you're going to be in for a total surprise and this is the way how Metallica first started, if you liked the later Metallica stuff then you should get into their early stuff when they were total thrash but the best of both worlds, Metallica is now the MTV Icons.",

hiphopforlife(ME): Welcome to my review of Metallica's second album, Ride The Lightning. before I start, let me give you some background on the band......
Average Joe:Whoa, hold on. If your name is hiphopforlife, what are you doing reviewing a Metallica album?
hiphopforlife: Be patient, homeboy. Yes I am black and the biggest lover of hip hop alive, but I am no joke as far as hard rock and metal go, since my taste ranges from Tool(LOVE EM!), Dream Theater(very underrated),Creed(very overrated),Limp Bizkit, Testament,Nirvana,Pantera,Slayer, Korn and Metallica;my first album was And Justice For All ten years ago
(anotheralbum you should pick up). I am more than qualified to
review this album. Now on to buisness. Ride The Lightning is the second album from the artists formerly known as Metallica. While their first album, Kill 'Em All, was raw and off the wall as you can get, the guys calmed down(somewhat calmed down) and created one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever; and the scary part is that the album after this one, Master Of Puppets(a legend in it's own time) is BETTER! It starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, arguably Metallica's fastest song. Ride The Lightning is up next, which brilliantly looks into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair. For Whom The Bell Tools relaxes on the speed, but cranks up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player Cliff Burton. Fade to Black is next, which is Metallica's attempt and sucess at a ""power ballad""...
Average Joe:Hold on ,hiphop;this has a ballad? Don't tell me that Metallica's gone Barbra Striesand or worse,Bon Jovi on us?
hiphopforlife:To quote one of my rap idols, Ice Cube, KILL THAT NOISE! They have not wimped out by any means(the wimping out will be in 7 years).This is the second best metal ballad of all time(Sanitarium on Master Of Puppets is of course, number one. It is excellently written and sung by James Hetfield(the greatest metal vocalist of all time; sorry Ozzy).Trapped Under Ice and Escape are next; and to be honest, these two songs are just okay, in my opinion,which is why most people rank Master Of Puppets higher than Ride The Lightning; they aren't horrible, just okay. But the pace definitely picks up with the next two songs; DO NOT SKIP THEM! Creeping Death expounds on James' Christian scientist upbringing with a story on how Moses frees the Isrealites; it has a great middle part which makes the whole song worthwhile. Now it all comes down to the final song; the Call OF Ktulu, a superbly constructed instrumental which showcases all four members of the band's talents, especially the aforementioned Cliff Burton, who wraps up his title of the greatest bass player of all time.  That's Ride The Lightning, one of the most influential records from metal's most influential band. I would advise you to pick this up YESTERDAY, if not sooner.
Average Joe: Thanks hiphop; you sold me. You are the greatest reviewer ever.
And you, dear reader, will be sold as well on the past greatness of the band once known as Metallica. Get Ride The Lightning, as well as their whole 80's catalog(and the Black album ,if you must).",
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,9714721180,1,1,5,"Contrary to just about everyone else saying ""Master of Puppets"" is Metallica's best album, I have always felt ""Ride the Lightning"" was Metallica's finest, and my all time favorite album.  The album starts off with ""Fight Fire With Fire"", a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield, and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  The title track deals with whats on the cover, awaiting execution in the electric chair.  The track also showcases Lars Ulrich's double bass drums.  ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", one of Metallica's most recognized songs, showcases every band member's talents, especially Cliff Burton's sonic bass assault.  Up next is ""Fade to Black"", a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide, and this as well has become one of Metallica's most popular songs.  The song has a special meaning to me personally, it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard, and it helped me through some bad times.  ""Trapped Under Ice"" is about, of all things, being frozen suffocating under ice.  The lyrics give a chilling (no pun intended) feel to it, and the song has a great chorus.  ""Escape"" is hte only song that could be classified as ""filler material"", but it is a solid track in itself.  Next up is ""Creeping Death"", which is a concert staple to this day, and contains biblical references as lyrics.  This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents.  The final track, the instrumental ""Call of Ktulu"" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar.  The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more, but that's not really much of a complaint.  All in all, ""Ride the Lightning"" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and the second of the first five Metallica albums that are essential to every metal fan's collection.",
A3CBNR1SZJJJDE,9714721180,1,1,5,"I bought Ride the Lightening upon its release in 1984 when I was in 8th grade. My friends practically laughed me out of school for liking such ""[junk]"". Motley Crue and Ratt were the real metal bands back then. Well, I never have been one to be affected by peer pressure so I stuck to my guns. By the time we graduated in 1988 everyone of those guys who made fun of me in junior high were Metallica fans and they were the biggest metal band of the 80s. Here it is almost 20 years after its release and I still believe it is the best metal album ever made, even though I fell out of the Metallica camp by the early 90s and a lot of great metal albums have been released since.",
AAOMG1YP0VNP9,9714721180,1,1,4,"This is one of the best metal albums ever! I think most would agree that Master Of Puppets is better and I think I go against most people when I say that I prefer Kill Em All, but still this is fantastic.
After releasing the killer (and at the time - original) debut, Metallica they release an even better album! Fight Fire With Fire sounds a bit cliched today with the quiet intro but it is one excellent song. Ride The Lightning is another great song and For Whom The Bell Tolls is quite sludgy and very good. They don't make riffs like that anymore! Then comes one of the best Metallica songs ever: Fade To Black. This is a quieter song which builds up progressively and is excellent. Trapped Under Ice and Escape are not so good but are listenable and they don't have me reaching for the skip button. Creeping Death is another excellent Metallica song and along with Fade To Black is one of the albums highlights. Then comes The Call Of The Ktulu. This is probably THE best metal instrumental I've ever heard! And to think that Lars was the only member of the band who was over 20 at the time - you won't find musical maturity like that in most bands - never mind that young - and certainly no nu-metal band will have it today.
This belongs in any True Metalheads collection - there aren't many albums that are better than this.",
ARHOZP9Y49IH4,9714721180,1,1,5,"I have the very original release of the LP on the metal indie Megaforce, released just before Elektra here signed them and reissued the LP only a few months later, making the Megaforce original a collector's item.  Just total kick@$s metal all the way! The bonus CD could be ""Jump in the Fire"", but I aine sure.  On Vertigo or Sony (Japan).",
ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,9714721180,1,1,4,"It's like this baby: Metallica helped define thrash metal in the 80s. With Kill 'Em All, they proved that they could play hard, fast, and with reams of energy. However, the subsequent release of Ride The Lightning proved to be a more thought-out collection of songs. Hetfield's peerless riffing is more refined, and his growling vocals are coming along (he still wasn't too great, though). Hammett's solos are mostly exciting, and he became one of the most copied lead guitarists around (in metal). Even Ulrich, whose drumming was always relatively simple, fits well with the music is gives it a crushing edge. Metallica has never been too focused on bass, so I feel sorry for Cliff Burton he doesn't really get too much attention. He still plays an important role in adding extra punch to the riffs, but one thing that's nice about Metallica's newer work is that the production is more accommodating to the different instruments. (Just a small gripe.)
Anyway, this album tells you what Metallica was all about. The highlight of Ride the Lighting one of my favorite Metallica songs, ""Fade to Black."" It's a great anti-suicide song, that starts with slow, lugubrious guitar that builds up into heavy, powerful riffs. It concludes with exhilarating, punchy riffs and a glistening solo. Fans have written to Metallica saying that this song deterred them from taking the course of suicide...that's how good it is!
""Call of Ktulu"", the big instrumental, is almost symphonic in its interplay (which is why it works so well with the orchestra on S&M). ""Creeping Death"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" are heavy, clomping thrash songs with interesting progressions and killer riffs. ""Fire Fire with Fire"" is mindless thrash with lots of kick. ""Trapped under Ice"" is tight speed metal.
Ride the Lightning isn't as ambitious or complex as Metallica's follow-ups, Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. However, most of the songs are great one way or another. Here, Metallica driven by pure intensity and delivers a great, great metal album.",
A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ,9714721180,1,1,4,"THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, rhythm guitars), Kirk Hammett (lead guitars), Cliff Burton (bass guitars), Lars Ulrich (drums & percussion).

THE DISC: (1984) 8 songs clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet with black & white band pictures, song credits/lyrics and thank you's. All music written by Metallica. Recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Label - Elecktra.

COMMENTS: I grew up with this album. Played the vinyl record in college so many times I wore it out (thank God for compact discs). This is still a classic Metallica album. However, decades later, I go back and forth with ""Ride The Lightning"". Thinking it totally shreds one week, and then the next week thinking it's so hard to get into. This album takes an acquired taste, and perhaps 'mood' is the better word. ""Lightning"" is Metallica finding their roots. Sure 6 of the 8 tracks are fragments of brilliance; atom splitting; rapid-fire assaults on the senses. The lightning quick songs are important in the band's library of songs. They had to go through these early stages to get to where they are today - so many years later. The title track is perhaps my favorite fast track on the album. The two slower songs - ""For Whom The Bells Toll"" and ""Fade To Black"" - are perhaps two of the best songs in the entire Metallica catalog. I can still listen to these songs anywhere, any time, any day. Both feature some amazing guitar work (both electric and acoustic). ""Call Of Ktulu"" is a 9 minute instrumental slugfest that I fell in love again with after their 'live' version on ""S&M"" simply blew me away. Decades after this release, it's still a classic in my book, but I have to be in the mood for it. Just a notch below ""Master Of Puppets"". Still a great disc.",
A3M97WKI0FP3JF,9714721180,1,1,4,"Right up until last year, I was never really much of a Metallica fan.  Then for some reason, I decided to get Garage Inc..  That in turn was followed by Justice, Black, Load, Reload, S&M, Puppets, and now, Ride.  Before buying S&M, I deciding to get the Cunning Stunts DVD.  And  believe me, I really enjoyed the spectacular concert the guys performed,  particularly, ""Creeping Death"" (probably the best song on the  DVD), ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", and especially ""Kill/Ride  Medley"".  Those performances (along with the tracks on S&M) were  what prompted me to buy this CD. I was especially interested in hearing the  original versions of ""Fight Fire With Fire"" and ""Ride The  Lightning"" from the Medley.  And let me tell you, they are definitely  killer!  The machine-gun guitar and drum riffs were probably what made this  CD popular in the first place.  IMHO, Metallica help create speed/thrash  metal in the early/mid-80's.  Not only do you get the killer riffs, but you  also get the popular ""Fade To Black"" which is similar to  ""One"" in that it starts out really slow, then gradually picks up  speed before peaking at a fast guitar solo.  And then you have ""The  Call Of Ktulu"" which is an excellent instrumental by itself (however,  I prefer the S&M version; it sounds SO much better with the  orchestra!).
Being a new Metallica fan, so to speak, I can start to see  why many of the longtime fans out there don't prefer the newer stuff  they've put out (I personally like both of the Loads).  Ride (along with  Puppets and Justice) was unique in the sense that Jaymz and company had the  guts to put out something that would stand the test of time to this day.  Even though I've heard it only a few times, I'm starting to appreciate it  already!",
A1EKTLUL24HDG8,9714721180,1,1,5,"This is one of the best Metallica albums, behind only Master of Puppets and the self-titled ""Black"" album. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade to Black"" are two of their best songs, and there isn't a bad one. The songwriting is a HUGE leap over their debut, with some of their best lyrics, not to mention countless classic riffs and solos. This is a must-have.",
AAOMG1YP0VNP9,B000002TTH,-1,-1,3,"...and the quality of Queensryche's music has done just that.
Promised Land is a strange album for Queensryche to release, mostly because they had just enjoyed mainstream success with the likes of Empire. In contrast, Promised Land is much darker, more brooding and certainly less mainstream (arguably the least mainstream album the band have ever released). And that's a good thing right? Well, not necessarily.
The fact that this is boring. Just because it is dark does not make it really intelligent. I respect the fact that they did what they wanted rather than lap up the commercial success like Metallica did at the same time. But that doesn't mean that everything they do is automatically brilliant because of it.
The fact is that this has hardly any decent songs to mention. It lacks the energy of Warning and Queensryche EP, the accessiblity of Empire and the brilliance of Operation Mindcrime. It does have the wierdness of Rage For Order but in a bad way since it is resorts to uninspired sluggishness rather than the sinister almost industrial feel of Rage For Order.
For an album that took 2 years to write and record, Queensryche don't have a lot to show for it. It seems like they were going out of their way to be different rather than just letting the music flow.",
A331OF34UX4Y1K,B000002TTH,-1,-1,2,"After amazing albuns ""OPERATION MINDCRIME"" and ""EMPIRE"", this was a disapointment for me. Boring at the extreme, overproduced, it clearly show that the band was already losing their creativity vein.",
ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B000002TTH,1,1,4,"Queensryche has evolved considerably over the past 20 years of their prolific careers. They've gone from fiery heavy metal in the days of their EP to the lush rock-opera of Operation: Mindcrime, to the sublime perfection of the commercially successful Empire, to their current status as a generic rock band. In the middle of these last two phases comes Promised Land. Compared to the remarkable accessibility of Empire, Promised Land is a little more difficult to appreciate. Living up to the amazing success and quality of Empire is nearly impossible, and I do not envy Promised Land for what it tried to do.
The problem lies in the fact that Promised Land's excellent songs are not as densely packed as those on Empire. Most of the songs are good, but not all the songs are excellent. There are moments of mediocrity that drag the album down from levels of excellence. The superlative production alleviates some of the boredom associated with the passable tracks, as do the thick wall-of-sound arrangements. However, interspersed amonst the middling pieces are some of the best tracks they've ever recorded, including some of the finest lyrics. The acoustic balladry of ""Bridge"" made for a lucrative single that deserved all its enjoined success. The sad, thoughtful ""Out of Mind,"" the ominous ""Lady Jane,"" and the hard rock trappings of ""Disconnected"" are all great. The True standouts are the stormy title track, with those monstrous arrangements and the harrowing tone, and the moving closer, ""Someone Else?"" The latter is the most un-Ryche song they've ever done, consisting only of piano and Geoff Tate's emotive vocals. The memorable piano riffs, thoughtful lyrics and Tate's passion are what makes this one special. Tate even strains on a note...guess he's human after all! Without the songcraft to elevate it to greatness, the production helps.
A good Queensryche, almost a great one. Still, it can't touch the monolithic status of Mindcrime and Empire. In terms of songcraft, those albums are the band's best.",
A1EKTLUL24HDG8,B000002TTH,1,1,5,"Though not a True concept album like Operation: Mindcrime, Promised Land is an engaging conceptual-esque song cycle unified by simarily themed songs and myriad sound effects. From the opening collage of 9:28 AM we get right into the ""story"" with I Am I, which, along with The Bridge, was a minor album rock radio hit. Other standout tracks include Out of Mind, the epic title track, One More Time, and the personal, moving closing track Someone Else? which is made all the more poignant as it's arrangement consists solely of piano and Geoff Tate's world-class vocals. This is possibly the band's best set of lyrics ever, they are, for the most part, intensely personal, moving, and, at times, uplifting. Out of Mind, with it's conveyings of guilt and the sense of perspective it gives you, and the all too typical father/son story in The Bridge are the standouts in the lyrical department. The music and overall arrangements are also the best and most dense that Queensryche has ever put together. Though not their top album (that honor still belings to Mindcrime) this is one of their most interesting, and certainly one of their best.",

ADKHI1TUGAX4,B000006045,1,1,5,"There aren't many trip hop albums I have bought over the years that has managed to sound fresh every time I throw in the cd into my stereo or listen to it on my iPod. Massive Attack's 1998 classic ""Mezzanine"" is one of those few trip hop albums that still sounds as fresh today as I first heard it almost ten years ago. The music is a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beats, seductive male and female vocals, and a diverse mix of samples from bands like The Cure.

What I love about ""Mezzanine"" so much is that the music is dark and sinister. All the death/black metal bands in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as ""Mezzanine"" is. There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller. The first two songs ""Angel"" and ""Risingon"" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares. I can never get tired of listening to ""Teardrop"" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals. The production is neither too slick or too gritty. ""Mezzanine"" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless. Every song is a Massive Attack classic.",
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0,B000006045,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorite trip hop albums. The first four tracks are just amazing, and have me repeating them over and over. The songs respectively are  ""Angel,"" ""Risingson,"" ""Teardrop,"" and ""Inertia Creeps"". ""Angel"" has a stark production featuring pointed beats and a distorted bassline that frames the vocal and a two-minute flame-out with raging guitars. ""Risingson"" is a dense, dark sounding song with a ton of dub throughout. ""Teardrop"" is an awesome song where they collabored with Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins. ""Inertia Creeps"" is a highlight with an atmospheric sound, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen. These songs are definately the highlight, and the other songs are still good, just not as good as these four in my opinion. Overall an awesome album that should have a place in every music collection.",
A3G10NPD661EQD,B000006045,1,1,5,"""Mezzanine"" is another classic album by the legendary group Massive Attack, and I would even argue that it's better (there aren't any bad songs and the best songs here are simply extraordinary)! The best tracks are the first four songs which deliver a 1-2-3-4 of such creative genius that it'll instantly make you a fan. Sometimes relaxing, sometimes haunting, and always groovy, ""Mezzanine"" delivers a worthwhile follow-up to ""Blue Lines"" that ""Protection"" failed to be. Like ""Blue Lines"", ""Mezzanine"" features several singers who are ALL very likable and charismatic (""Blue Lines"" suffered from the track ""One Love"" where the singer arguably kind of ruined the song). The lyrics aren't as memorable as on ""Blue Lines"", though, but you won't mind. Overall it's a much darker album than ""Blue Lines"" as it occasionally blends metal and industrial music with their trip-hop sound. Hip-hop and probably casual music fans will love this album. A word for the wise: the rest of the album might take a bit before you  realize how good it is. Anyways - very highly recommended along with their first album ""Blue Lines"" and Portishead's ""Portishead"" (though this one isn't as good).

Highlights include:
the entire album!",
AAV3HU72C3R3G,B000006045,1,1,5,"You've heard their music in commercials and movies and may not have realized it. I didn't until I picked this album up within the past six months. Of it, Blue Lines, and 100th Window (only ones I have), it's the best, and that is clearly in consensus with other MA fans. This is a very good album...just really interesting and exceptional musically.

If you're at all interested in this kind of music, you cannot go wrong with Mezzanine.

EDIT: I've actually been listening to this album more over the last 24 hours and am now of the opinion that it's more masterful than I originally thought. It's easily listenable from start to finish. There are no weak songs. If you think you've found a weak song, you've just not listened to it enough yet. This album will be especially enjoyable for somebody with a good sound setup (be it high quality earphones or, preferably, a nice car stereo) because some of its bass lines are truly praiseworthy.

As others have alluded to, or stated, this is the kind of CD that holds a constant spot near the top of one's music collection. I knew it was good, but only now do I fully understand that fact. Isn't it a breath of fresh air when a single album is full of such greatness and not just one or two songs, as with 99% of the music out there?",
A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B000006045,1,1,5,"It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is True, the fact that several years after its release, the opening ""Angel"" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!",
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I,B000006045,1,1,4,"I don't know too much about their other albums, but I can't imagine any other being better than ""Mezzanine"". You can call this trip-hop or electronica if you want, but this is just cool mood music that is beyond beautiful. Perfect for putting on after the bars at home, with that last drink or smoke of the night. With guest vocals from ""The Cocteau Twins"" singer, and a cool sample of ""The Cure"" on track seven, you know this is gonna be good. ""Teardrop"" was the big song from this, and the rest is just as moving. It will go great with your ""Portishead"" and ""Sneaker Pimps"" cd's.",
AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B000006045,1,1,5,"I haven't been into Massive Attack for too long, probably a couple of years now. ""Mezzanine"" was my very first MA album. I bought it because I heard nothing but good things about this group as well as this album. The rest is all history. I have their other three albums [""Blue Lines"", ""Protection"", and ""100th Window""]. I think of all the MA albums I own, ""Mezzanine"" resonates with me the most. The music is dark and foreboding, lyrically and musically. The cd starts off with the dark sounds of ""Angel"". I particularly love that songs for the dark, slow, hip hop beats mixed with the haunting vocals. The choices in samples is astounding, if not refreshing. Normally I loathe the use of samples but Massive Attack is able to use samples and manipulate them into a totally different sound than what the original artist intended. My personal favorite songs off ""Mezzanine"" has to be ""Man Next Door"" and ""Teardrop"". Those songs are simply amazing. I recently put in ""Mezzanine"" into my cd player for the first time in months, and amazingly enough it still holds up very well in today's current music scene. I really think that ""Mezzanine"" set a standard for the whole genre of trip hop music. It is one of the best albums in that genre as well as one of the best albums in general to come out in the past decade or two.",

Teardrop is now a classic and many other songs are also brilliant. I recomend everyone who claims to be a music fan to buy Mezzanine. It is indded one of the best albums of the late 90's and probably of all time.",
A3M97WKI0FP3JF,B000006045,1,1,4,"...seductive, spellbinding.  There are probably many other words out there that can describe this record, but the five I've mentioned are probably the closest that will match the feeling I get from listening to it.  Imagine a dark, tranquil atmosphere with shimmering electronic music and bassline grooves and narrative, soulful vocals in the background.  ""Mezzanine"" perfectly fits this description!  Some of the highlights include ""Angel"" where the music starts soft and then builds up into a screaming frenzy.  Or how about ""Teardrop"" (w/former Cocteau Twins vocalist Elizabeth Fraser) which features an angelic voice, an acoustic guitar, and the same shimmering electronics.  I could go on and on.  But I think it's best that you go out and buy this fine record and experience it for yourself.  If I'm not mistaken, it was one of SPIN magazine's top 20 records of 1998.  Heck, I bought it just before Christmas last year and wondered what took me so long in doing so.  In any case, I'll definitely look into buying their other stuff including the DVD!  And I look forward to their new record which should be coming out sometime this fall!",
A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000006045,1,1,5,"What struck me first after hearing Mezzanine was its sheer weight. The sound, with its low beats and (in a first for Massive Attack) thrashing guitars, succeeds in actually oppressing the listener....and that's very  much a good thing, because the music in this album is just so very novel  and smooth you want to feel every part of it.
As usual with Massive  releases, ""Mezzanine"" features the vocals of two female vocalists  on several songs, Liz Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins) and newcomer Sara  Jay. Liz's contributions are some of the higher points of the album, and  ""Teardrop"" is just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998.  Sara Jay's one song is the insidious and sneaky ""Dissolved Girl,""  which has Massive Attack doing some new tricks with electronica.
Horace  Andy, the reggae singer who is a mainstay of Massive Attack's albums, has  three songs here, the industrial ""Angel,"" and the almost-retro  Massive Attack ""Man Next Door"" and ""(Exchange)"".
The  songs featuring the vocals of Massive's members 3D and Daddy G are also  well-done, and 3D's threatening whispers on ""Risingson"" do a lot  to make it one of my favourite songs.
Although certainly some of the  songs are better than others, this is one of the few CD's I've ever  listened to where there is not a single bad song. The album as a whole is  perfect, and I would recommend this to any person who is breathing and has  a pulse.",
A3M88RCAR2T804,B00000747R,1,1,5,I remember when this came out on lp in the early 70's.  Thank God it has been re-issued on cd.  This is what Philly sould is all about!,
A3GTI1Z7YE49ZS,B00000747R,1,1,4,"The Stylistics make moody soul music, atmospheric. There's also a hint of Warrick - Bacharach  in their music, well, after all they did cover ""You'll never get to if you break my heart"", and the joyous ""Make it last"" carries on in that vein.

Other than that song, in my opinion this album doesn't really get going until the second half - the jazzy slow burn of ""Love comes easy"", the off-hand rock 'n' roll title track, the soul classic ""You make me feel brand new"" and the exuberant ""I won't give you up"".

But, the highlight for me is undoubtedly ""There's no reason"" with it's off-kilter melody, interesting arrangement and rolling chorus with the perfect vocal harmonies. Along with most of the other songs, the gentle, understated sound adds to the whole atmosphere.

Songs like ""Only for the children"" and ""Could this be the end"" - I don't know. I've always thought Russell Thompkins Jr is at his best singing love songs, because it suits his vocal style than angrier songs. Overall I would give this album a 7, or three and a half.",
A14W1VNMMYLWND,B00000747R,1,1,5,"1973, the Philly wonder group Stylistics release their third album after the first 2 albums, 2 straight classics.  Thom Bell and Linda Creed make a great production team, and Russel Thompkins Jr. keeps hitting the high notes as the lead tenor.  The music is lush again like the second album Round 2, and there are some surefire winners here.  ""Make It Last"" has the same lushness of songs like ""You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart)"" from Round 2.  ""Payback Is A Dog"" is about how a woman who does wrong will finally know how it feels when she is on the receiving side of the heartbreak, and has impeccable harmony.  ""Love Comes Easy"" has that smooth lush feel again and deals with finding one great thing in life in an uneasy world: love.  ""Rockin' Roll Baby"" has a vintage 70's rock feel with the great Falsetto lead (giving it a soul inflection), and a light touch of funk.  Not my fav, but it shows that the Stylistics can expand into different territory effectively.  A persistent sentiment of love even if unrequited is expressed in the nice mid-tempo ""I Won't Give You Up.""  Then we have a great jam with the slower ""Let Them Work It Out,"" which is more laidback and deals with a certain friend who gossips about other friends' love lives (and troubles in said romances), and that it is getting annoying.  The song is about letting couples work through their difficulties.  A somber joint is ""Could This Be The End.""  It is another slower joint with perfect harmony.  Rockin' Roll Baby is another classic in the Stylistics catalogue.  Thom Bell is a genius musician, especially considering his classic works with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, The Spinners, among others.  The Stylistics are right next to the Delfonics as 2 of my favorite soul groups ever.",
A22N03OBDDVSEB,B000007UVW,1,1,4,"I'm a life long Blue Oyster Cult fan from way back, in 1988 they released ""Imaginos"" #122, at the time I thought this was a tremendous record, but after 22 years of reflection, it's a 4 star release at best.  This is a upgrade after ""Club Ninja"", but that wasn't very hard to do.  The thing about ""Imaginos"", it has too many special guests and the recording was 5 or 6 years in the making. (I didn't know that at the time I bought it in '88).  I still like these songs after 22 years, ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", ""Les Invisibles"", ""Magna Of Illusion"", with some fine piano by Allen Lanier, the remake of their own ""Astronomy"" #9 mainstream rock and my favorite tune is the classic ""Blue Oyster Cult"", just a great track, Buck and Eric at there best.",
A1IH46GF4BNPIQ,B000007UVW,1,1,5,"Back in the day BOC was Huge. I loved their music and got everything they ever put out EXCEPT ONE, Imaginos. I was overseas in the Navy when it came and the 2 albums prior to this were a bit of a disappointment, SO when it came out I was busy and just didn't get around to getting it. when I did go to get it it was gone. Pulled from the shelves everywhere for what I don't know but nowhere to be found. No big deal right? I mean tha last 2 releases were rather dull so I figured BOC were tapped out,  becoming Nostalgic and Nundane. Many years before I even expressed interest in it again after I heard from others that it was actually very good. Some of the best BOC has ever done many say. Hmmmm. better get it. NOT, everybody wanted like mega bucks for a copy. Anyway when I saw it here re-released I jumped all over it. Damn glad I did. When I first listened to this and keep in mind, for 30 years I have never heard even one track from this CD, it was like hearing the latest release form one of my favorite bands and it rocks. As a whole I give it an 8 on a 10 scale but there are about 5 songs on this that are the best BOC has ever done. Those songs get a solid 10. Buck is blazingly fast and imaginitive. ie the title Imaginos. These are Blockbuster, Genious Level Guitar Riffs that prove once again that Buck Dharma is one of the greatest guitarists alive and way too many people have never heard of him. A shame really. BOC has a Dark Inteligent perspective that always kept them to, well, cult following status. I am a member of that BOC Cult. I like just hearing this now because it truly feels new and fresh to me. I know it came out in 1978 or 79, and it is now 2008. But you can'yt tell that from hearing this for the first time. It sounds like so much of BOC's greates work. Classic and Timeless. If like me you are a BOC fan and you don't have this. You already know from the years that you gotta have it. If you are a new BOC fan or wondering if this is Vinatge BOC or just mediocrity from BOC, let me assure you this will top your collection as some of BOC's finest and without a doubt Buck Dharma soundly places himself in the Guitar God Status like he wasn't there already.

AKGF27HN0OF19,B000007UVW,1,1,4,"An album that has always seemed to divide BOC fans.  ""Imaginos"" is a concept album concocted by Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman whose origins go almost back to the beginning of the band.  Two of the tracks on this album appear on ""Secret Treaties"" which serves as somewhat of a companion piece to ""Imaginos"".  The original BOC lineup re-united for this one along with a host of guests.  The concept is the story of Imaginos a time traveler of sorts who appears at different times in the world's history to influence historical events.  The problem is that the story is not told in a linear fashion and it ends up being completely confusing.  I have read essays on the story behind the story and still haven't really figured it all out.  This is a weird album for me, I think most of the songs on this disc are outstanding to the point of being some of the best stuff BOC has ever done, but looking at the album as a whole it is not quite as good as I think it should have been.  Being a big progressive rock fan maybe I set my expectations too high when I found out BOC was doing a True concept piece, but on this one the sum is not greater than it's parts.  That being said there is some really great material here.  The remakes of ""Astronomy"" and ""Blue Oyster Cult"" (formerly ""The Subhuman"") are better than the originals.  ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", ""Les Invisibles"", ""In The Presence Of Another World"", ""Del Rios Song"", ""The Siege....."", ""Magna Of Illusion"" are all awesome.  The title track is a bit of a letdown, but still ok.  Still......even with all this great stuff, I think the album could have been put together better and re-worked to an extent.  Anyway this is a minor quibble as this album really is a must for any fans of BOC.  I believe it is currently out of print and hard to find.",
A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000007UVW,-1,-1,3,"This is an album the Blue Oyster Cult fans will really get into, a concept album that showcases the bands unique song stylings. For the casual listener, or sometime BOC fan, stick with ""Agents of Fortune"" or ""Fire of Unknown Origin"". ""Imaginos"" is a heavy album and features a great remake of ""Astronomy"", the best song on the CD. But unless you are prepared to invest some time, deciphering the story, and songs you won't get much out of the album. I picked up ""Imaginos"" on CD after hearing ""Astronomy"" late at night (the best time to play the CD), and there was a narrative about the ""Imaginos"" myth read by Stephen King as the song opened. I heard this only two times on the radio, and picked up the CD because I was a huge Stephen King fan, and enjoyed some of BOC's earlier albums. Needless to say, the Stephen King narrative is not on the album. I was disappointed, but played the disk a few times. I enjoyed ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", a pretty straight ahead rocker, and ""In The Presence of Another World"" which is a more down-tempo song. Actually most of the songs are good, and you will find yourself humming the chorus for hours after listening. The only track that I found lacking, was the title track ""Imaginos"". For some reason, most likely the background singers: ""Oooohhhh Imaginos, Ooooohhh Imaginos, Oooooohhhh, ooooohhh, ooohhhh Imaginos"" the song sounds like fanfare for a two bit magician about to perform in Vegas or something. Once I got that image stuck in my head, I just kept picturing Imaginos The Great performing card tricks and turning newspaper into doves. If you see a copy of this disk used for under $10 pick it up, but I don't think it's worth the $20 used price I see here.",

A10DNCYK7YISHU,B00000I7LP,1,1,5,"Before the Slim Shady LP, a no-name emcee named Eminem was probably ripping the mic at the Lyricist Lounge or other underground hiphop spots...back when he was an ill lyricist hungry for attention by scaring you sh**less with raw punchlines and excellent verbal battling ability.  Back when he was able to step into a rhyme cypher with Canibus, Mos Def, Last Emperor, and Chino XL and dominate...  To a hiphop standpoint, by focusing on his lyrics and comparing with his earlier efforts, this CD is the beginning of his downfall...  But with the variety of ideas it saves the CD.  And by being so creative brings it up to 5 stars...
Unfortunately, because he's not on a dependable label he's forced to rap to garbage beats (which is Dre's specialty, but this release are some of his better ones), he's forced to do exactly what the higher level employees he works with say.  He's not able to make his own decisions and the contoversy that has become of him has forced him to listen to Dre and others and rap about that instead of making his own ideas... ARTIST - one that can use their imaginative ability to create something...
But, none the less, an excellent debut CD by a good artist who's stuck with a bad label...  Hopefully one day Slim will wake up and leave DRE in his footprints and join a True HIPHOP label 'RAWKUS' ...
plus he's not the only white rapper out there today: Evidence (Dilated Peoples), The High and Mighty, Smut Peddlers, Everlast/Whitey Ford, El-P (Company Flow), and RA Rugged Man...

The songs were well written and I can about imagine what her performance was like. She seems to really be into her music.  There is nothing scripted about it.  You can feel the passion coming from her voice as well as the creativity that was put into the music, which is somewhat of an lost art in today's world of music.  I highly recommend this cd to any fan of real soul music.",
A2RXC61UJQQSWZ,B00004TTUZ,1,1,4,"Now I have just finished my reviewing Ms Ledisi's major debut:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-and-Found/dp/B000RO8UAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost and Found</a>, which, whilst being a nice safe release, is nothing like this.

It's sad that with an independence like this, the freedom that an artist has is lost when dealing with the majors.

A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B00004TTUZ,1,1,4,"Ledisi - Soulsinger (2000)
Word has it that this album is to be rereleased this year on Tommy Boy Records. If this is True, then I'm glad that she's getting a second chance. Soulsinger is filled with Ledisi's ability to mix little spoken word with jazz, R&B, and soul. She puts her all in every performance, as evidenced in ""Take Time"" and ""Coffee"". She has the voice of a throaty Southern gospel choir singer and she truly delivers. It's too bad that some of these songs have uninspired lyricism like in ""Groove On"", a song about her wanting a one-night stand. Also, she tends to sing so hard that she gets off-key, which is a problem throughout the album. But it's hard to find powerful singers like her these days and by listening to ""Free Again"" and the very revealing ""Poppa Loved to Love Me"", Ledisi should start getting props soon. -EJR",

A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0000564WK,1,1,5,"The Left Banke is one of those bands from the 60s that kinda fell through the cracks as the years went on.  Pretty much looked at as a ""two hit wonder"", they were much more than that(as One and Two Hit Wonders tend to be sometimes).
They're classified as ""Baroque Rock"".  What the hell is that, you ask?  Oddly, it sounds exactly like it's description.  The band members of The Left Banke weren't the most technically savvy of musicians, so the sound of the band revolved around youngest member, Michael Brown.  Brown was trained in classical music and played piano and harpsichord, both of which are very prominent in The Left Banke's sound.  Add to that, the smooth Beach Boys-esque vocal harmonies, and you have.....Baroque Rock!!  One song, Evening Gown, almost sounds like a harpsichord driven punk song!
I'm surprised I like this album as much as I do.  Though I'm big on vintage rock music, this seemed a little too different than what I normally listen to, which is rockabilly and surf. I initially bought it because I've always had a soft spot for Pretty Ballerina, but much to my surprise I found this whole album to be great!
I am very glad I picked this one up!  If you like the late 60s stuff, The Left Banke deserves a resurrection.  If you like Justin Bieber, you're a schmuck!",
A1PLX7O7HW809U,B0002HA8IA,1,1,5,"This is a very special cd. It is a tribute to Debby's mother-in-law Rosemary Clooney so that makes it special in itself. But whats really special is this womans' voice - so perfectly suited for this material. As a fan from the start of her career I know how versatile she is. Here she sings with authority and with the technique of a jazz legend. For us fans who have been waiting for new material from Debby for years this is just what the doctor ordered. This cd is perfect for a night of romance with fine wine and Boones' beautiful vocals washing over you. The production has class written all over it from the players to Debby Boone. Looking forward to the live show - it will rock! Congratulations Debby and thanks for keeping your music and your life real. God Knows :).....postscript - i was lucky enough to catch Debbys' live show at Scullers in Boston 6/22/05 and she truly charmed and dazzled her audience. Debby - thanks for being such an inspiration and a True lady...as I said ""keep the good music coming!"". :)",
A1PLX7O7HW809U,B0002HA8IA,1,1,5,"This is a very moving collection of Debbys' Christian music as is the recent ""You Light Up My Life - Greatest Inspirational Songs"" - if you like this you'll like that too. Boone has a dramatic soaring voice that comforts the soul. Can't wait to get her latest on Concord Records ""Reflections of Rosemary"" a tribute to mother in law Rosemary Clooney. She may finally get the props she deserves.",
A35MQ03ZBF585E,B0002HA8IA,1,1,4,"I would have liked a dance band with at least 15 pieces or more to accompany Debby. She has the ""chops"" & I believe that this would enhance her sound. The band was still good but it could be a fuller sound.",
A1D44YT0P8Q8XL,B0002HA8IA,1,1,5,"The songs in this album ""Reflections of Rosemary"" from ""Blue Skies"" and  ""Mood Indigo"" to ""In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning"" and ""Time After Time"" are some of the nicest popular standards identified with Rosemary Clooney, one of the best female vocalists of all-time. And Debby Boone is singing the same songs as her special tribute to her mother-in-law. This album promises the listeners an unforgettably, wholesomely beautiful listening experience. There is something to captivate the ears of every listener as she is backed by some of the best musicians we have in the music world today: Rosemary Clooney's arranger/pianist for twenty years, John Oddo, arranger Earl Brown, guitarists John Pizzarelli and Jim Fox, bassist Chuck Berghofer, drummer Gregg Field, percussionist Daniel Greco, saxophonists Gary Foster, Dan Higgins and Scott Hamilton, trumpeter Warren Luening and cellist Armen Ksajikian.

I have enjoyed the music of Debby Boone since she recorded an album of great inspirational songs in the seventies and eighties most notably ""Sweet Adoration,"" ""Can You Reach My Friend?"" ""Sincerely Yours"" and ""You Light Up My Life."" Her father's music, Pat Boone, has been part of my very musical family when I was growing up. He was one of my late parents' favorite singers and mine, too and I was especially fond of his hit song, ""Love Letters In The Sand.""

On this elegantly charming tribute album recorded with love and dedication,  Debby Boone sings sixteen classic standards starting off with an uplifting  Irving Berlin classic, ""Blue Skies,"" which Rosemary Clooney used to sing to her first grandson Jordan, whenever he was ""sad, when he took a fall and was crying, or anytime he needed his spirits lifted."" It's a surprised added track - Ms. Clooney's A Capella version. Ms. Boone stated that, like her son Jordan, she would always find comfort in this beautiful song, which highlights Scott Hamilton on tenor sax solo.

While all the tracks are so enjoyable, I really love the way she sang ""Mood Indigo,"" which features a vocal quartet - herself and her sisters Cheryl, Lindy and Laury with vocal chart arrangement written by Earl Brown. With its vintage-sounding arrangement and its nostalgic rendition, this classic from Duke Ellington/Barney Bigard/Irving Mills evokes a sentimental feeling that will flood your eyes with an ocean of tears as the sisters sing...

Little sister, you ain't been blue
No, no, no
You ain't been blue
Not till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to your shoes
Then you cry, you just sit there and cry
Go long, so long blues...

Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evenin' when lights are low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The wonderful tone of John Pizzarrelli's guitar as well as his soft and mellow scat can be heard in ""I've Grown Accustomed To His Face"" while Dan Higgin's flute plays beautifully in ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" complementing Ms. Boone's gorgeous vocals. The Van Heusen/Burke medley is also surprisingly stunning ""But Beautiful,"" ""Moonlight Becomes You"" and ""Like Someone In Love."" One of my all-time favorites ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill was rendered so beautiful and heartfelt making it one of the best interpretations ever recorded. And she dedicated it to her hubby, Gabri. The delicate medley of ""It Never Entered My Mind"" and ""In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning"" was selected as a tribute to Frank Sinatra, whom Ms. Boone had worked with on several occasions in the past. The enchanting Bossa Nova arrangement on ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" is so pleasing to the ears.

An all-time top favorite, Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne's ""Time After Time"" is also a highlight and one of the singer's favorite songs that Chet Baker recorded in an album called ""Chet Baker Sings."" According to her, ""she fell in love with that album in 1996 and developed a real school girl's crush on Chet. She spent summer tirelessly delighting in his trumpet playing and melting at the sound of his voice, not to mention his picture."" She then sent a copy of the record to Rosemary knowing that she would absolutely ""love the way this guy sang."" And to her surprise, Rosemary told her; ""Do you know I carry around a picture of Chet Baker in my wallet to this day?"" In other words, they had a crush on the same guy! Co-incidentally,  ""Chet Baker Sings"" is also my very first Chet Baker CD from my collection and I have written a review on this outstanding album about a year ago. It's a very nice album that focuses on Chet Baker not as a trumpet player but as a singer with a soft and mellow vocal style.

Listen to Debby Boone at her utmost best as she pays homage to one of the best female singers of all-time, Rosemary Clooney. You'll also be delighted with the Liner Notes, which include in great detail Ms. Boone's heartfelt sentiments for each and every song she selected for this great tribute album.

An album of sheer beauty, elegance and perfection.",

ARHOZP9Y49IH4,B000BKIWUO,-1,-1,3,"Word of mouth and buzz helped make ""Menopause"" a sleeper stage hit with middle-aged women.  This CD is mainly sold at the theatres that book the show on the nights they're on in the lobby.  This is the original cast (the usual case for this kind of release), so the end result can be different than of the actresses on the leg that perform in your area.  Don't expect a bunch of female Weird Als or ""Capitol Steps""/""SNL""/""Mad TV"" types.  The instrumentation is slightly amateurish, low budget, watered down, and weak.  For ""My Husband Sleeps Tonight"", a parody of the cringey oldie ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", no credit is given to Solomon Linda, whose family fought for his recognition and residuals.  Some parodies keep the same titles as the songs they lampoon, like Tina Turner's comeback ""What's Love Got to Do with It?"".  That almost defeats the purpose.
Most men and younger women may not relate to the lyrics that Jeanie Linders wrote from experience.  They refer to symptoms like hot flashes, ageing, night sweats, cramps, insomnia, mood swings, restlessness, binge eating, weight gain, wobbly temper, becoming like their mothers; you name it!

ARHOZP9Y49IH4,B000BKIWUO,-1,-1,3,"Word of mouth and buzz helped make ""Menopause"" a sleeper stage hit with middle-aged women.  This CD is mainly sold at the theatres that book the show on the nights they're on in the lobby.  This is the original cast (the usual case in this kind of release), so the end result can be different than of the actresses on the leg that perform in your area.  Don't expect a bunch of female Weird Als or ""Capitol Steps""/""SNL""/""Mad TV"" types.  The instrumentation is slightly amateurish, low budget, and weak.  For ""My Husband Sleeps Tonight"", a parody of the cringey oldie ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", no credit is given to Solomon Linda, whose family fought for his recognition and residuals.  Some parodies keep the same titles as the songs they lampoon, like Tina Turner's comeback ""What's Love Got to Do with It?"".  That almost defeats the purpose.
Most men and younger women may not relate to the lyrics that Jeanie Linders wrote from experience.  They refer to symptoms like hot flashes, ageing, night sweats, cramps, insomnia, mood swings, restlessness, binge eating, testy temper, becoming like their mothers; you name it!

Now forward to 2006, the golden boy of music returns with first single Sexyback off FutureSex/LoveSounds. The single is an incredible piece of sweet funk, combining the sensuality of yesteryear's Prince and the deft execution of pre-scandal Michael jackson. With a hot salacious video to boot, the song is sure pop ecstasy.

At the helm of things is once again hip master Timbaland whose collaborations always bear edible fruits. Remixes of the song range from mediocre to superb, beginning with the lackadaisical Pokerface Club Mix which sounds like a piece of early 90's recycled house mix.  The slightly more varied Linus Loves Remix ups the ante with a more danceable electro beat. The best mix has to be the cool Tom Novy Ibiza Mix that cleverly uses a verse of Timberlake's sung vocals wrapped around some hypnotic and lackbaid grooves.",

A2WLRNFTHI67WX,B000LWZD7M,1,1,5,"The self-titled release by the Atlanta based band, Theocracy first appeared in 2007 but has been out of circulation since that time.  For several months, fans have long-awaited for the release of Theocracy's original album - an album that has been remastered and remixed.  On November 19, fans around the were were thrilled to listen in to Matt Smith and the boys hammer out their unique style of Stryper meets Dream Theater heavy metal music.

Track by Track:

After a 80's-like keyboard intro the album begins with a double-base drum anthem that celebrates victory in Christ.  Here's a few lines from Ichthrus.

Forced into the catacombs
unite to praise the King of kings
they fear a revolution
and the power that He brings
heaven's sons stand as one, as believers
in the blood of Christ
even in death we have True life

CENTURIES FLY
BUT THE FLAME IS STILL ALIVE
THE MAY HIDE IT, BUT IT WILL NEVER DIE
CARVED IN OUR SOULS,
SEE THE TWO HALVES OF THE SIGN
THROUGH THE AGES HIS GLORY WILL ARISE
FOR ALL TIME

The Serpent's Kiss begins as a ballad and speaks candidly about the curse of sin that has been inflicted on the cosmos.

Born into the darkness
thrown into the viper's den
the serpent in the cradle
takes the child into its nest of sin
slowly suffocating
the souls of victims it has found
into the vicious cycle
on the path that only leads us down

Rat-race-fueled machinery
this system of corruption
have we become so cold and numb
we're blind to its destruction?
We're forging in the fires made of greed
Our idols made of gold
then bowing down before them
with corrupt, adulterous souls
opened eyes,
realize...

WHAT WE HAVE DONE
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
WHAT HAS BECOME OF OUR LIVES
CORRUPTED OUR DREAMS
WHAT WE HAVE LOST
AND WHAT REMAINS
PARALYZED BY THE VENOM THAT RUNS THROUGH OUR VEINS
THERE'S GOT TO BE MUCH MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS
THE WORLD'S CARESS IS JUST THE SERPENT'S KISS

But the venom that has plagued mankind has been defeated by the power of the cross.  So the song continues ...

I stand before you as a child
by this world I've been defiled
stained and poisoned, burned and beaten
bruised and wounded, sick and vile
with hands reaching out to you, I run
realizing what I've done
you take me in your arms, a reunited father and son...

The song is not only a powerful reminder of the gospel but also leaves listeners with a permanent and painful warning:

And all illusion ceases to exist
the world's caress is just a serpent's kiss

Mountain paints a vivid portrait of the journey that every Christ-follower faces.

Step by step the climb gets harder
my being weakens as I struggle farther and farther
flesh is weakness, darkness, sickness
my dreams are shattered, my ambitions crumbled
my will defeated, my spirit humbled once more
I am hopeless, helpless without you

The tune resembles John Bunyan's classic work, Pilgrim's Progress and leaves listeners with hope as they plod their way through the Christian life:

Take me to the places I can't go
Transcending
I'm sick of living in the status quo
New Beginning
And when it seems I've given up
On eagle' wings you life me up again
and this time I know, in the end
...You carried me

The title track, Theocracy is a metal dream that challenges every listener with the direct claims of Christ's lordship:

At the center of my heart there sits a throne
That the rightful occupant's not always
free to call His own
For how can I give the King
His place of worth above all else
When I spend my time striving
to place the crown upon myself?

The chorus hammers the lordship theme with a holy vengeance:

I TAKE MY CROWN AND CAST IT DOWN
CASTLES BURNING
CASTLES BURNING
LEARN TO GROW, GROW TO BE
A FLESH AND BLOOD THEOCRACY
TO TAKE THE LOSS AND BEAR THE CROSS
RAISE THE KINGDOM
RAISE THE KINGDOM
BURN AWAY ALL IVE BEEN
TO RESURRECT THEOCRACY WITHIN

2 Corinthians 10:5 is employed to remind Christians to submit every thought to the lordship of Christ:

and the would-be rulers of my heart
that I place upon the throne
each lead the kingdom of my life to ruin
to bring every though into submission
to tear the idols down
is to break the chains, to rearrange,
to give the king his crown

The Healing Hand is a powerful five-part masterpiece that begins with the prophecy of the Messiah - the hope of nations.  The tune leads listeners from the cradle to the Cross of Christ where the ""healing hand becomes the bleeding hand.""

His kingdom forever, the Lion of Judah in strength
everlasting redemption, atonement complete
resurrected in power, as King now he stands
FOR THE BLEEDING HAND HAS BECOME THE RULING HAND

Faith-born forever, a part of His kingdom become
Or reject him, stand back
and watch his kingdom come
Alpha and omega almighty is he
Christ reigns victorious for eternity
Eternity

Several more songs grace this stunning album.  There is simply too much to share in a short review in this format.  But suffice it to say, this piece of work by Theocracy is about as good as it gets.  The music is tight, the production is crisp, and the vocals are spot on.  Again, as I have noted elsewhere, Matt Smith is one of the premier songwriters of this day.  For whatever reason, he has gone largely unnoticed - a tragedy in its own right.  This young man should be commended for his God-given gifts.  But as every God-fearing man recognizes, all the glory goes back to the Giver of every good gift.

Thanks to Matt Smith and the band for writing such God-honoring music; heavy metal music that truly honors the Lord Jesus Christ and magnifies his gospel!",
A18V2E6MMO8KLO,B000LWZD7M,1,1,5,"For those not familiar with the self-titled debut release, band founder Matt Smith composed all of the songs and performed all of the instruments (sans acoustic drums). Despite this deficiency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print. Fast forward to 2013, Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5, released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue/rerecording of the debut became a reality. As Smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds. These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm. Bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal. And while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking, he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music. Reissues rarely add much to the original  especially when the original was near perfect  but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded, transforming a classic of epic Christ-centric power metal into a masterpiece.",
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B000MSTZV0,1,1,5,"Bonnie Pointer's First Solo Album is a classic waiting to be rediscovered. A varied album of different styles, all produced & performed so amazingly, it holds up well today. There is funk, Motown oldies, acoustic tracks, & a great orchestrated ballad. The music, the musicianship, and the vocals are all very creative and of the highest calibre.

 Side One has 2 Motown oldies WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU that are both done in the old Motown style. They even have legendary Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON playing on them. This version of HEAVEN is five minutes and features scat singing by Bonnie in the middle. This is a different version from the disco hit single that went to #11 on the charts. Bonnie redid it as a single, and I much prefer the album version , with it's homage to classic Motown. The other 2 tracks are both stellar, with inventive arrangements, singing & playing. The single FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [ HANDCUFF ME ] is amazing. Pop/funk with Bonnie singing all the background vocals herself, and in the middle there is a banjo solo! That's what I mean about the creativity and work that Bonnie, the musicians and producer Jeffrey Bowen [ who previously produced The Temptations ] put into this album. And you have not heard a funk track as hot and funky as AH SHOOT, I guarantee you since Sly & The Family Stone's THANK YOU. This song is 5 minutes of pure funk nastiness with an organ that drives it, blazingly funky horns a/la James Brown, Bonnie's muti-faceted  vocals & just sheer musical genius at it's height. Outkast must have heard this track. It's just waiting to be sampled. The musicians on this album are of top calibre with Family Stone member TRUMAN THOMAS arranging, playing & co-writing , Funkadelic guitarist EDDIE HAZEL, Rolling Stones sideman OLLIE BROWN, original Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON, NIGEL OLSSON of Elton John's band on one track, and string arrangements by noted arrangers LEE HOLDRIDGE and PAUL RISER.

 And Side Two illustrates another side to Bonnie Pointer, with 4 acoustic rhythmically driven & played songs MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], and the beautiful ballad MY EVERYTHING that closes this unique, diverse album of sheer musical pleasure. These 4 numbers all co-written by DONALD BALDWIN are amazing - filled with hooks, catchy choruses, and pure musicianship. Remember Bonnie's solo on BLACK COFFEE from The Pointer Sisters 2nd album THAT'S A PLENTY. That is just a taste of what Bonnie can do with a ballad.

 Also of note is that this self-titled album is the one with a RED COVER. For some unknown reason, Motown released Bonnie's 2nd album with the same self-titled name, and that has a purple cover. Also it's not as great as this one. Released in Dec. 1978, the same time as The Pointer Sisters equally excellent ENERGY album, this is a classic that has to be heard. It is by far the best of Bonnie's 3 solo albums. Catalog number is MOTOWN M7-911R1.

 Tracks: WHEN I'M GONE, FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [HANDCUFF ME ], HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, AH SHOOT, MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], MY EVERYTHING.

 Released on MOTOWN M7-911RI, December 1978, Red Cover.",
A2REF5NAGDO02L,B000MSTZV0,1,1,5,"I was all of 14 years old when I had this project on vinal, and I swan ... I wore the grooves off the album! It captured my musical mind back then and finding it on CD at last has been almost more than I can hadle! Every song is Motown production at it's best! While each song is perfection and I cannot pick out a 'best' I am partial to AH SHOOT; funky and bass driven ... it gets this white boy to dancin' like no white boy should!! Then there's I LOVE TO SING TO YOU ... a wonderful love song in itself, but Bonnie sings it so sweetly and simply that it amazes me. The original line up of songs ends with MY EVERYTHING ... another love song sung with total honesty ~ pure magic! The bonus tracks are the icing on an all ready perfect cake, and I am thrilled to have this back in my collection.",
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B000MSTZV0,-1,-1,2,"I waited decades for this amazing album by Bonnie Pointer to be released on CD. It is such a highly unique album. The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning albums by a female artist. Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect side of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979. The real big surprise was Side 2 with Bonnie singing 4 new original songs with acoustic guitars, layered vocals and a variety of instruments, like  California soul. Nobody else sounded like this. And all ending in the majestic "" MY EVERYTHING "" with beautiful orchestration. But I got a major shock, and am hugely disappointed. This reissue on CD does NOT have the original version of "" AH SHOOT "", but instead an alternate take! Unbelievable, but disappointingly True! Did someone not know that this was a totally different alternate version? The original is nowhere to be found. Instead we get this inferior version that was never released. If anyone knows this album, "" AH SHOOT "" is one of the funkiest songs ever recorded, with Eddie Hazel on guitar and Ollie Brown on drums, plus funky as Sly and James Brown horns and hammond organ, and Bonnie singing these stellar funk lyrics. Big Break Records could be re-named Big Blunder Records for this mistake. Where is the original version of this major funk opus??? I still have to play my original vinyl album to hear "" AH SHOOT "" the way it was released. What is the reason for this fiasco and why isn't the original on this release? Did anyone even know that this was an outtake? Big Break made a major screw-up with this mistake. I'd give the original album a 5 star rating, but because of this Big Break Blunder, their reissue screw-up deserves 1 star. Have someone who knows the original album listen to it before you make it on CD.",
A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY,B000MSTZV0,1,1,4,"It's encouraging to see that a batch of late-'70's and early-'80's albums have been newly (circa 2012) reissued on CD--by a label called BBR (Big Break Records).  ""Bonnie Pointer"" is the first one of them I've bought, because it contains one of my all-time favorite disco songs, ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"".  The original LP did not contain the disco version that eventually became a #11 pop and Top Ten Disco hit, but this reissue cures that by including both the 7"" and 12"" versions of it.  The other three bonus tracks are all versions of the record's first single, ""Free Me From My Freedom/Tie Me To a Tree (Handcuff Me)"".  The latter, which is not a medley by the way, has a very interesting lyric that seems to have caused the single to stall at mid-chart, at least on the pop side.  Some programmers & listeners felt it was either an S&M reference, or as the liner notes say, ""a step back for the feminist movement.""  It is open to either that interpretation or Bonnie's--that she meant to be tied and handcuffed with love, not literally, after finding independence to be disappointing.  ""Put love's chains back on me...""

The rest of the record covers a wide range of styles.  I think Bonnie sounds a lot like Carole King on ""More And More"" and I'm hearing some Billie Holliday in ""My Everything"".  Another Motown remake (besides ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"", originally a hit for the Elgins) begins the album:  ""When I'm Gone"" is a (literally) snappy version of the Brenda Holloway classic.

I wouldn't say the sound is ""muddy"" as another reviewer put it, but I can't say it leaps out of the speakers either.  I'd be curious to hear/read what other buyers think about this.  On the plus side, the packaging is excellent, with great photos and an extensive essay by Christian John Wikane.  The notes give a brief history of the Pointer Sisters before (thoroughly) discussing the making of this album.

More about ""Heaven"":  it opens with a machine gun drum blast, has the guitar jangling all the way through, features a 2-minute wild string-and-drum break, and ends with Ms. Pointer channeling Louis Armstrong.  One of the most amazing disco productions ever!",
A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000MSTZV0,1,1,5,"For those who grew up during the 70s like me or those who are just fans of the period The Pointer Sisters are infamous.  Bonnie Pointer was the creative force behind the original quartet and after years of huge success she broke from the group in 1976 and joined Motown.  Her first release was this gorgeous recording with the glorious red cover, her beautiful face and simply titled BONNIE POINTER.  Side one had the uptempo tracks and side two was more reflective.  There are glorious covers of WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. The Motown sound was again loud and strong.  But Bonnie also brought FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM a disco track with much funk and AH SHOOT.  The second side totally shined with emotional standouts MORE AND MORE and MY EVERYTHING.  Raw and emotional, Bonnie gave her all.

The album was a huge success and then HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was released as a disco track and it roared up all the charts and became a disco/dance/soul/r&b classic.  It also brought even more attention to the amazing album.  Here BBR has done their magic and brought this superb release to life with beautiful and glorious remastering.  The sound is amazing.  What a gift.  And then we get 5 bonus tracks and a huge booklet of pictures and extensive liner notes.  If this release brings back memories it has never sounded better.  I highly recommend it to fans of soul/disco/r&b as well as fans of the 70s.  And a huge thanks to BBR.  You are reuniting listeners to the True music classics the way they were meant to be heard.  Don't hesitate to purchase this.  The crystal clear sound of Bonnie's pure vocals will pull you in from beginning to end.",
ALLU4SGSA4SJG,B000MSTZV0,1,1,5,"I was living in a small apartment in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, the year this album hit the shelves. Heaven Must Have Sent You, both in English and Spanish, rocked every juke box on the island. Radio Mart, broadcasting from Cuba, had the Caribbean airways poppin'.",

The stereo is lush, the definition superb. ""Party Doll"" with the Crickets, an unreleased track from the 1962 album and ""Gone"" (which was apparently an atrociously sounding 45 due to a mastering problem) are wonderful.

Paul and John cut up like schoolboys here, putting on voices, making weird noises, crooning too close to the mike and generally acting the clown. An LP highlight.

SIDE TWO NOTES
1.) The 6/66 'B' Side of ""Paperback Writer,"" a stereo version was issued on Capitol's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BEATLES-AGAIN/dp/B000LYUC30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BEATLES AGAIN</a>&nbsp;in 1969. 2.)

Its title track is a cowbell classic that was later homogenized by Mama Cass and group. ""Matchbox"" a rare Ringo vocal, is a Carl Perkins cover. 5.) A Larry Williams do-over first released on the American&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BEATLES-VI/dp/B001BAN08W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BEATLES VI</a>&nbsp;album (Summer '65). 6.) Another from the ""I Call Your Name"" EP, it's John's amazing Larry Williams cover. 7.) John beats the organ mercilessly on this ""Help"" 'B' Side. 8.) Fourth cut from the aforementioned EP, it's a high voltage Little Richard remake sung with much passion by Paul.

ARHOZP9Y49IH4,B000P56BSK,-1,-1,3,"Please know that this is a pirate release.  Rarities UK or US was never on CD.  These tracks are on official CDs now, especially Past Masters (the same reason Hey Jude/The Beatles Again isn't on CD either).  MFSL sure didn't release this (theres also a fake MFSL pirate of Abbey Road mono).
When the original UK LP was released in 1978 (I have a continental copy), most of these tracks were never on an album there before.  These classics are generally well known among the fans.  This is more for completists really.
I wouldn't mind getting the edition which is combined with Let It Be.  If I do come across this one, and it's not too much, I'd probably buy it.",

A3B0CI4MUZ627,B000PHA2XS,1,1,5,Good,
A1DFAAZTL1IAV2,B000PHA2XS,1,1,4,Some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play (I haven't heard the Knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly).  And most of these won't get much play 30 years from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality songs not heard much today.,
A2AJVRTVD7D1DU,B000PHA2XS,1,1,5,Great music,
A1ZVZI3MNS3M2V,B000PHA2XS,1,1,5,Wanted music to exercise to. This is a good album for that.,

A3UCQ3MT3S5J30,B000QLYCAC,1,1,5,I like this song and love Allison's voice. It is haunting and moving and powerful. She sings the song as though she is trying to convey a serious message and I am on the verge of understanding the message. I recommend this song.,
A2OTVNYVIVMM9J,B000QLYCAC,1,1,5,"This is a great song and I have downloaded several copies.  It has been done by practically everybody from rock bands to opera singers and there is something to say for all.  The lyrics are stunning - it is a very sad love song.  The singer or chorus who does it needs quite a range.  It needs to be belted out, not whispered with the help of electronic equipment.  I liked Allison Crowe's renditon.  Bon Jovi does a good job, as does Jason Castro,the Canadian Tenors, and Brandi Carlile.",

A1X3AM904OIM4X,B000QMCWMG,1,1,5,This song is one of the greatest songs ever. They don't write music like this anymore. All they have now is rap and rock music that is dark and dreary. truly a feel good tune with simple lyrics. I am biased but I love the vibes by the man Vince Montana Jr. he is the Philly sound.  This song takes me to another place another time. truly beautiful music that will live on forever at weddings and many other places. I love the sitar sounding guitar.,

And now, today, I sing at various bars and restaurants with a predominantly country audience (simply because that's the area where I live -- out in the country!) And whenever I sing a Motown classic, like Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition,"" I see feet and hands a tappin' to the beat! But when I do ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" by the Stylistics (because, yes. I can sing both the low and the high parts myself,) people start slow dancing. And I get all kinds of compliments. If you can pull it off vocally, then you really owe it to your audience, and to yourself, to share this wonderful love ballad with the world.",

Things Can Only Get Better (1985) is one of those forgotten mid-80's gems you throw in a mix and everybody loves.

A3JRW716H3AX14,B000QO6B1C,1,1,5,In this classic rocker we are treated to a driving beat intertwined with soaring lyrics. Musically it is a fusion of early 70s rock with strong Motown flourishes such as ample use of fuzz and wa-wa on the guitars with lively choral back-up on the vocals. The lyrics are upbeat as was typical of the era. It makes you smile and wish more music of today could impart such a good feeling. There is some really great drumming throughout.,

AO2FZ2DWUOXV7,B000QO5DAC,1,1,5,"The  fact that songs such as this are still available confers a degree of merit, I suppose.  I purchased this along with about thirty others from the period because I was sitting around feeling nostalgic for my youth and the days I shared with some friends in a band in Detroit (EVERYone in Detroit in the sixties was in a band).  Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it. The only thing remarkable about this group and those like it is that the guys only had one hit in them.",

A18XXW70NTBQVZ,B000QO8WUU,1,1,4,"Do you guys remember Art Bell when he hosted the radio show ""Coast to Coast""?  He had some great bumper music and this song was one of them.  Very Haunting.",
A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B000QO8WUU,1,1,4,"What got me caught on this song was hearing a remake from the Webb Brothers. The remake took the best aspects of the song and gave it a updated polish. All that means is the original, while sounding dated, still holds both a unique and familiar feel to it. The song has two different parts to it. These parts are completely different from each other in just about all things. The feel, groove and even time signature are different. The first part is very much a forward moving and brooding feel to it reminiscent of the old western films. The other part switches to a 3/4 time signature with Nancy Sinatra singing softly about nature. Both sides seem to switch back in forth in either a dance or a duo between each other. Kind of a one side masculine and one feminine.

Much has been said about the meaning of the song and lyrics. The obvious is one part is a man who was influenced by somebody named Phaedra, and the other is Phaedra herself speaking of what she is all about. Is it all about romance? Is it about evolving to a higher sense of being? Is it just about sex? I found no definitive answers out there. I like to think it's about redemption given to somebody hardened by life by one who is at one with her surroundings.

It's such a simple song yet it is filled with complexity not just in lyrics but musically as well. It's been covered many times, but I find going back to the original keeps me in touch with just how beautiful the song is in both its darker and warmer tones. If you like 60's psychedelic music they don't get much better than this.",
A4S2GMZIQKEHY,B000QO760C,1,1,5,Like most folks I heard this song in Kill Bill and was very curious who sung it and the like. I really like the guitar on this and how it accents with the lyrics. Its a good one for 99 cents.,

The lyrics are still powerful and well-phrased, the vocals still include harmonizing Falsetto (which I cannot stand normally, but these guys did it perfectly), and the guitar work still has the slightly metallic electric guitar sound of classic rock.  Have to love it.",

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5,These Boots Are Made For Walkin by Nancy Sinatra is a bold pop song about a singer expressing in an assertive way of what she plans on doing with her boots. The music to the song is also well-timed with when she expresses with the lyrics how one of these days her boots are going to etc. etc.,
A10M52OJSDB8WK,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5,Exactly what I was looking for.  This is the version I remembered.,

A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5,"I loved the 1960's the songs were so strong and almost militant by standards of the day.  In the backdrop of the times These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was one of the rallying cries of women fed up with the traditional roles of homemaker and mommy.  These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was more than a song it was a metaphor that spoke to empowerment of the so called weaker sex.  More than just a woman's rallying cry this was a darn good song too.  This song like so many others is a joyful part of my 1960's era childhood.  In 2014 its fun to look back into the world now long gone.  Sometimes when I listen to these songs like These Boots Are Made For Walkin' I remember listening to the car radio, the memory is sometimes so vivid can almost smell the Ford Fairlane 500 that was our family car.",

A2J096HDALTSMA,B000QOEN6W,1,1,4,"Four stars because it is 60s ballad music. Though this is an iconic classic and has much more rock and roll sounds than many of her other songs, it still is a Sinatra ballad. A must have for any Sinatra collection.",

A2WE5R44SIWN8E,B000QONMQ4,1,1,5,It brings back memories of my youth.  I'm 59 years old.  Rogers had quite a range back then.  Who knew that he would become such a huge country star.,
AVR7IAWO7Z0VQ,B000QONMQ4,1,1,5,A lot of people don't realize before Kenny Rogers went country he was one of the 60's Hippy movement. This is a really great album and the song is a favorite of all those that dropped out and tuned in.,
A2SLOF85ZZQYEG,B000QONMQ4,1,1,4,to believe that this song was done by Kenny Rogers about a bad trip that he and the First Edition had. At least that is what he said in a Playboy interview shortly after they did this song but it still is a Great song from a bygone era.,

The MP3 format is not optimum for real listening enjoyment.  In order to compress the data, a lot of tones are left out.  Even a good cassette tape outperforms this storage medium.

A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B000QP7U8O,1,1,5,"People who work are expected to take part in the kind of mechanism without magic that avoids anything that is going on in this song. As personalities in a fog, we always sense an iceberg approaching at ramming speed. The key for me is she thinks crossing her legs is funny. This song works with a man and a woman singing about each other. The combination is a big door prize. There are ups and downs:

He ain't been laid in a month of Sundays.
I caught him once and he was sniffing my undies.

Intellectual involution is only aroused when magic makes whatever comes next far more interesting than what we have observed so far. The secrets that work for circus stunts, religion, philosophy, and the usual cosmic pogo stick ups keep our scrambled eggs all runny.",

A1ALYBBYCFD7OB,B000QPWQ2E,1,1,5,"This is an updated version of the song that defined Mason Proffit in the early 1970s.

AFZ8M3KQY2DYY,B000QVL4NU,1,1,5,"Christmas jeer -- I mean cheer -- is all the rage!

I figured I would do my part for the retail industry and their obsession for Christmas in July and do a review on this tune appropriately -- in July. This sketch ranks up their with ""A Christmas Story"" and Ralphie along with his Red Rider BB gun with the Compass in the Stock/Stalk (who knows???) as being American classics.

This song is an undying testimony to America's obsessive nature with parody and an unrelenting need to kick back and say ""to hell with being up-tight"" and with good reason - stress is the killer (Fantasia and a white bat or something, anyway...) and life is not all that serious as it is irony based. It doesn't come as a surprise as to why the fine line between becoming productive or postal rests somewhere in letting go for a moment. Unfortunately, I know these things.

Enjoy!",
A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000QVL4NU,1,1,5,"""Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer"" is Dr. Emo's (yes, he really is a doctor) signature hit, that has gone down in history as becoming one of the most ludicrous modern X-Mas songs in recent history. The reason why I listen to this song almost everyday during Christmastime is because it's so funny and over-the-top. It's really a very tragic song (at least the lyrics are) but it's sung to sound funny and even rather screwballish. I remember there was a music-video made for it that VH1 used to show during Christmastime. My favorite part of the song is when Dr. Elmo asks deadpan: should we open up her gifts or send them back? It can't get more theatrical than that",

It features some nice guitar playing and singing, but the lyrics are rather simple.  I admit I like the kind of lyrics that break your heart (probably why I like the blues so much) and this isn't telling that kind of a story - the lyrics are a little too simple for that, but it does have a very nice sound with nice guitar riffs.",

A1XWM9JESCL1R7,B000QVXDR0,-1,-1,3,"I don't know if this was recorded live or not but the sound came through as if there was no mic, song would have sounded better if you could understand the singer clearly.",
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000QVXDR0,1,1,5,"""Sadie"" by Son Seals -- This classic Hound Dog Taylor Chicago blues song finds pulse and life in Son Seals. The singer, it seems, has made excuses for things he cannot defend. Sadie has left, and he wants her to return, but she is not sure this is a good idea.

Great piano and B. B. King-like guitar.

""Sadie, will you come back home tonight
Oh Sadie, will you come back home tonight
I love you, and you know I'm gonna treat you right.""

I fully recommend ""Sadie"" by Son Seals.

A3JJ21YCMGSKGH,B000QZVK9Y,1,1,5,"Nancy And Lee is a fine album that pointed Nancy Sinatra firmly toward pop music in the 1960's. This album moved her beyond the rock and roll sex kitten years of Boots, and partnered her with Lee Hazelwood. Particular favorite duets are Summer Wine, Jackson, Some Velvet Morning, Sand, and Lady Bird. Nancy Sinatra fans will love this CD.",
A1HBI9BBQIG1NH,B000QZVK9Y,1,1,5,"Nancy and Lee are a perfect combination,like Sonny and Cher. Lee is the writer with the gravel voice and the troubadour personna. Nancy is  the kitten with the school girl toughness,feminine and smart. They had several hits in their  groovy day and the best are here. Jackson,Summer wine,and Sand are great examples of the duos country pop that defined their unique sound. Billy Strange production brings out the most honest pop sound that is fresh as it was then .This is one of my favorite lps! This is the best of their sixties output,and they also did a swan song album a few years back. But,the charm is in these recordings here. The cd is out of print and sells for a small bundle,but here it is on mp3!",
A3TXWIDMKRYG3J,B000QZVK9Y,1,1,4,So that's why I purchased it and I'm truly not sorry. You will be sorry if you miss this deal-a great collection of songs from an era now bygone by two artist who for a moment helped define that era! A must own for Nancy fans.,

And I worked PT at a Top 40 radio station at the time, so- you know- I didn't hear it ENOUGH. I hated this song.

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000S3BNY6,1,1,5,"From my exposure of VH1, I was in 7th grade when I first heard I Ran by A Flock of Seagulls. This catchy song has a hybrid of synth-pop and electro rock in the beat and appears to be a song about falling in love with someone who is different in some way from many people. Im glad that this song is available to hear online (Amazon prime, youtube, Pandora, iheartradio etc.) because it is rarely played on local radio where my husband and I current reside.",

A11YRHINAJNUQJ,B000S3BNY6,1,1,5,A flock of Seagulls had a hit with this song as the music had a rousing beat and the voices that went so well with the beat of the song that took you along for the ride upon the rhythm of the band as they put their heart into the tune they sang and played. Years have come and gone but the songs of The Flock Of Seagulls lives on beautifully.,

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000S5111E,1,1,5,"Back in the 80's, there were so many great songs, that some got lost in the shuffle, only for those 80's kids to bring them back in their current work. This underrated song was all but lost to the radio time vaults till Napoleon Dynamite made it its credits song, perfectly going along with the movie. The result was the rediscovering of this classic, and amazingly, it still held up. Covers quickly ensued.

Musically, the song has a lite poppy feel, that is distinctively 80's. Is it 70's? No. Is it 90's? Nope, it is unmistakably 80's. It's a nice feel to the song, and it really adds an extra flavor to it. Vocally, while the verses lag, and fail to deliver a great punch, making for the only complaint of the song, the main chorus is perfect. Well, almost, that ""I promise you,"" does drag it down.

However, the lyrics are really the crown jewel and highlight of the song. They're as great now as they were then, if not more so. They're well written, emotional in unexpected ways, and it really speaks about the aspect of love that's rarely touched upon: Us guys who can't think of the perfect words to say to our perfect and lovely ladies. The lyrics really hit home for us poor guys, and really make it an even better song than it already was.

Overall, one of the most underrated and forgotten about songs from the 80's that was lost for so many years, but is finally making a comeback. Why iTunes doesn't have it is beyond me, and is really a musical travesty. So many fans are getting jibbed of great music.

In other arenas, the song went perfect with Napoleon Dynamite, and the song seemed better because of it. It's like they completed each other to make one another more emotional in their own little way.

And because of the movie, covers ensued. Anberlin's cover of the song wasn't that great. It was a straight up cover, with some acoustic elements added to it, that really didn't add to the song. Plus, they are so alike on vocals, you still had the same problem. New Found Glory also covered the song, but they made it more upbeat than the original, giving it more of a pop/rock influence, but it still kept the emotion of the original song, and added another layer to it.",

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000S5111E,1,1,5,The Promise by When In Rome Appears to be a cheery song about the singer reassuring someone that they care about that they are always going to be there for that person.

A3Q4NULWZU3RI,B000S5111E,1,1,5,"It's sad that in 2015 music in general is broken and fake
There are those that love to point fingers and pick on the 80's and the music that came from that decade of excess!
The interesting thing that decade did have some dated corny music but, even some of the over-blown 1 hit wonders had great 1 hits

Case in point When In Rome  with there massive hit The Promise
I find it hard to believe that a band that craft such a flawless single only had one hit
But, it's a great timeless one hit!
Even though it sounds very 1980's with the key board nobody is using auto-tune to hide anything
It's not overly studio produced there is life in this song (it has a soul)
The Promise is a True 80's classic in every sense of the word anyone who'll disagree it and say it sucks, is lying to them self
It's a catchy perfect pop song  10/10",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000S52E9W,1,1,5,"There is no question that today, music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers, Joe Cocker who passed away at 70 years old. He honestly was one of the greatest singers of all time, who knew how to belt out remarkable songs on his own, and doing renditions of other artists songs. He had his ups and downs with his life, but always kept music in tune. When he did another artist in song, he took it into another place like his cover of the classic Ray Charles song Un-Chain My Heart, which came out in the 1987. The song just remains a classic, and showcases his bluesy voice and a soulful heart kept alive in song and in real heart. It is truly a blessing at soul, and what he put out with great music. Joe Cocker will definitely be missed in song, and in spirit. His heart has been un-chained.

You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile.

Smile, a very special piece composed by the great Charlie Chaplin for his 1936 film entitled ""Modern Times,"" had its lyrics and title added by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons in 1954. This song, a classic little masterpiece, gets the royal treatment from Nat ""King"" Cole, who delivers this ballad with panache. Nat's excellent diction, sophisticated phrasing and sense of timing make this version of ""Smile"" one of my very favorites. It never fails to move me; this is an incredibly poignant musical number. I highly recommend this music.",

A1NADGMAR6GQW1,B000S55EQC,1,1,5,At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.  So if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a CD of your chosing that expresses your love for her.,

I liked his voice - mostly a smooth high-end baritone - so much that I downloaded six more songs. He's great to listen to whether country-western or crossover songs. A little higher baritone than Dean Martin, and more like Gene Autry.",

A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000S56380,1,1,5,"This fun 1982 hit by ""Bad to the Bone"" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers needs volume. I work out to it, keeping it a regular running playlist song.

I'm a car singer. When it is just me, I turn it up and sing at the top of my lungs. This one brings out my inner blues man. As a running song, it carries a strong tempo, a hard beat, and twice the attitude found in anything Katy Perry sings.

""On the day I was born, the nurses all gathered 'round.
And they gazed in wide wonder, at the joy they had found.
The head nurse spoke up, and she said leave this one alone.
She could tell right away, that I was bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone.""

I fully recommend ""Bad to the Bone"" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers.

""Bad To The Bone"" is probably his most recognizable song and is a chunky piece of braggadocio that echoes the great Mr. Diddley.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000S55TTY,1,1,5,"There is honestly so much that could be said about Joe Cocker and his gifts in song. The guy was honestly one of the most amazing singers that had ever came out of the Woodstock. He honestly was amazing with each and every song he had recorded and performed live. The guy was absolutely a remarkable singer But this past year had showed a sad and tragic end to his brilliant end, losing his life to lung cancer, as a result from his twenty years plus of drug and alcohol addiction. But he left behind a cavalcade of great songs from With A Little Help From My Friends, and especially Up Where We Belong. His collaboration with Jennifer Warnes which won a academy award for Best Song and a Grammy Award in 1983. It is a lovely romantic ballad that still captures the soul of the heart. Joe & Jennifer had a connection that many of today's artists couldn't even come close to at heart. If you had never even heard of a Joe Cocker song before, than this is one I would recommend going to.

The song had a bittersweet tone to it, reflecting the theme of the show, life may be lonely, it may get you down, but there is always someplace to go where everyone knows you and actually wants you around. Great song. Gary Portnoy also wrote the theme to Punky Brewster, at the time I used to think the song, like Punky (she's grown into a lovely young woman) was cute, and at times it felt a bit cheesy but as I hear it today that song actually makes me miss those cheesy days.",

The example of Lazarus is used to show that even when we think God is too late to intervene, He does things that we think are impossible. This song has been an encouragement to me in many difficult situations.",

What a message, God has perfect timing.  Even when He's four days late He's still on time.  Amen.  You will be cheering by the end of this song.  Karen Peck and New River are an amazing group and you will be blessed by this song.  I would recommend this song to everyone.",

AYWQTPVYAF43L,B000SX87C2,1,1,5,"By the early 1990s, Duran Duran's popularity had faded. Their album Liberty had proved a commercial failure, its two singles failing to make a significant showing on British or American charts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDLiVwpv89s

It was not until Capitol leaked ""Ordinary World"" to a radio station in Florida in the autumn of 1992 that it looked like Duran Duran mania might yet hit again. The single proved so popular that Capitol had to push the US release date up, ultimately releasing it in December.

The keyboards in the song were arranged and performed by Nick Rhodes and John Jones. The drums were played by Steve Ferrone at Maison Rouge.

The guitar solo that characterizes this song was arranged and performed by Warren Cuccurullo, former player with Frank Zappa. His instrumental rock trio version became a staple of his solo shows and was included on one of his solo albums ""Roadrage"".

The music video was filmed by director Nick Egan at Huntington Gardens in San Marino, California and the song later featured in the soundtrack to the film Layer Cake in 2005.

Simon LeBon later performed the song with Pavarotti at a WarChild benefit.[2] The performance was released on home video as Pavarotti & Friends: Together for the Children of Bosnia.

The lyrics to ""Ordinary World"" were written by Simon Le Bon as the second of a trilogy of songs for his late friend David Miles; the others being ""Do You Believe in Shame?"" (1988) and ""Out of My Mind"" (1997).",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000SX87C2,1,1,4,"When it came down to what Duran Duran has had in music, they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled about them in song. Still, they had crossed over nicely in the 90's with the music from The Wedding Album, and some of the songs still ignite today like they did back in the 90's. Ordinary World is absolutely no exception. The song is definitely one of their better songs that the group had came out with. I love the rhythm of the song from start to finish. It is definitely one of their better songs they had came out with. If you are absolutely new to Duran Duran's music, this is a great song to download, and if you are a hard core fan of Duran Duran, you'll fall in love with this song and that is a ordinary world.

Song: B+",
A1CHLJQMZN8LHG,B000SX87C2,-1,-1,1,"I'm sure everyone was curious to hear this album with ""Ordinary World.""  This song debuted in the late 90's.  Beforehand, all their stuff was from the 80's.  ""...ours is just a little trouble at all..."" I'm sure is a fav lyric by most of their fans.
It's not your traditional slow song.  You will also like ""Come Undone.""  I also have the trance version of ""Ordinary  World.""",
A2GW5TTEKODNL8,B000SX87C2,1,1,5,Sometimes you just wanna take a quick trip back to yester-year. This song is as good as it was the day it released!,
A1P9PG7KCYX50S,B000SX88OY,1,1,5,"I heard the song ""Sunrise"" in a Grocery store music system. The OOoh, OOoh chorus is so unmistakable in this song that I had to ask who it was as I had only heard the song once before. A person told me ""Norah Jones"".
  I then saw Norah perform this and several other ""Hits"" on Austin City Limits.  I downloaded this and some other female pop singer mp3s  to put together a kind of Pop Diva cd of my own. Norah tops the list. She is also a very skilled piano player. A wonderful talent. Amazon MP3 downloads are a great, low cost way to listen to a favorite vocalist or band.",
A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B000SX6NYQ,1,1,4,"On of the best (and best known) songs from the Band. I actually like the live version from 'The Last Waltz' more. But since that one is only available if you download the whole album (which I don't want), guess this will do.",

A2COVEY6OYK5JF,B000SX85CE,1,1,5,"My husband and I heard this song as part of a sitcom montagoue and then had it stuck in our heads for days- and so had to buy it off amazon mp3s.
What we keep repeating when we listen to it in the car: bands and singers from the 80s just can't be beat-
this song is so powerful- and so real- and so emotional-

you can literally FEEL the song through the lyrics.

I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh I hope that it won't end though
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone

How do I get you alone",

The melody is a bit dark the contradiction of the juxtaposition of the whole story makes the love song all the more delightful and the longing is sweet and promising.  the girl can sing and delivers the lyric and the melody with all the nuance and emotion to suspend the listener within the story.  She is a quiet and compelling force , I don't of another performer who could have pulled it off so quietly but blow you away.  Maybe Bette Midler at the outside. Again it stands the test of time, she makes some intelligent choices.",

A2IHB3M0ZIKNOZ,B000SXC10Q,1,1,5,"This was one of Grand Funk's real anthems and one of their most played songs before their big hit period began with We're An American Band in the fall of '73. Grand Funk was never very popular with the critics, largely, I think, because their music was fairly simple and they were real crowd-pleasers, and showed no greater ambitions than that. But these qualities made them vastly popular with the general public who gave them six million-selling albums at a time when AM radio wouldn't play their songs. This song would be heard at rock concerts all over, especially the outdoor concerts. If it was a big concert Grand Funk themselves might be playing it as they toured a lot. But many outdoor summer concerts had good regional or local bands and all of them played this song too. It really captures the feeling of a rock concert circa 1970-71.",

A348GYLVPWT8AK,B000SXKWXY,-1,-1,3,Maybe its the reality shows with Bret Micheals but you think that after nearly dying this man would wake up and stay with his family and just plain grow up but the song is okay.

AEZNE7TR0CHFI,B000SXM3HM,1,1,5,There's a reason for Dierks Bentley being on the charts all the time. This song's dynamics are nothing short of sensational. He goes from almost no instrumentation to rockin' the song hard! What's not to like?,

A110ZEDSNASVCO,B000SXM5WK,1,1,5,"This is a classic, rock n roll tune that is surreal with the idea of Major Tom floating away to die in the void of space all alone. Very sad tune but extremely good all the same. David Bowie is certainly one of the most underrated Musicians out there in music. I'm a HUGE fan of his Diamond Dogs work and this album is another one that is phenomenal.",

ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B000QZX5B0,1,1,5,"i might look at this album differently from most Soilwork listeners. I would say _Stabbing the Drama_ is a big improvement over _Natural Born Chaos_ and _Figure Number Five_, and it's sort of a medium between the two. Just for reference, _A Predator's Portrait_ is one of my all time favorite metal discs, simply perfect. _Steelbath Suicide_ and _Chainheart Machine_ are also fantastic. all three of those are brutal and furious. That said, I even liked FNF for the most part, because of the vocals and catchy songs, but the guitars and drums and METALNESS of it seemed more half-hearted IMO, a downgrade from _Natural Born Chaos_ but that album had its own shortcomings like sounding pretty homogeneous.

_Stabbing the Drama_ has the same catchy aspect as these previous albums (NBC/FNF) but the writing on the whole seems stronger. Heck, this band's songwriting is downright outstanding in my opinion, they write GREAT catchy metal songs, their melodic acumen is outstanding and Speed is an extremely empathetic vocalist. The album shows a tremendous refinement of the band's main direction for the last while, and if you take the last three albums as a class, this is the most well-rounded and best-written accomplishment of those. but here the songs have more variety and better quality from beginning to end (i haven't heard the newest one, _Sworn to a Great Divide_)

I would honestly think of this has heavy pop music, which to me isn't a bad thing although such a description is probably a major turn-off to most people.  like pop music, the main focus is the vocals and the hooks. The general form of structure and arrangement is pretty straightforward, and by now Speed's approach to vocals is pretty predictable. Speed's voice is amazing though, whether the harsh voice or clean voice, and he's gotten much better with each album. That said, the music is much more... i dunno, fleshed out than the last few. Fat, chunky-choppy riffs and absolutely AMAZING drumming (forget Ranta, the new drummer is a fiend, did i mention that?), and very tasteful synths all drive the hooks home with amazing force behind the vocalist in the spotlight. pop music, even really good pop music, doesn't really show this kind of deadly chops.

I'd say if you really _disliked_ everything since APP, STD won't change your mind -- BUT if you liked the general approach of the previous two albums but thought they could be a little better SOMEHOW, then you should pick this up if you haven't because it rules, although i wager the fan likes or would like NBC more than this one. I think this is just as addictive as those, but more well written so it has much better lasting power. i personally have deep regrets about not getting it until very recently.",
A1JIW8GOSSGUQR,B000QZX5B0,-1,-1,1,"If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums, was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one, and make it work. When I heard the first few works by this band, I had thought they were the most unique band since ""Hypocrisy"". Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own ""Bells and Whistles"" to stand out from the rest. So on to ""Stabbing the Drama"" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of ""Stabbing the Drama"" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic. I also found myself not liking one single track. Not a ONE! Change can be good, but here, change isn't good. Sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone.",
ASVNSWIXBV72Q,B000QZX5B0,1,1,4,"There has been a lot of competition among metal bands these past few years, and so many of the bands offer nothing at all new to the metal scene. Plus, it doesn't necessarily make it easier if your band is from Sweden, because there are also several Swedish metal bands (i.e. Arch Enemy, Meshuggah, In Flames, etc.)

Before I heard their music, I had Soilwork pegged as just another metalcore band; but then, on an impulse buy, I gave ""Stabbing the Drama"" a listen. And when I did, I was very pleasantly surprised. This C.D. isn't 100% new or innovative, but it's melodic, and that's quite refreshing in this day and age.

The guitars are fiery and crunchy, but the vocals are what make these songs pleasing to the ears. Singer Bjorn Strid doesn't quite have a soulful voice, but it is tuneful and quite impressive. He switches back and forth between angry and aggressive to harmonic and clean. Sometimes, as is the case with tracks five and six, he can sing melodically even when the backing music is heavy.

The title track is a personal favorite because it has rapid stop-start riffs and drumming which is vaguely reminiscent of a jackhammer.
""One With the Flies"" is a punching rhythm with cascading riffs, and a nice, melodic guitar solo.
""Weapon of Vanity"" has scorching, blowtorch riffs, and ""Nerve"" begins with thunderous guitar noise and dreary vocals.
""Stalemate"" has a sprinting rhythm with running riffs and fast, thumping drums.
""Observation Slave"" has a lot of clean singing (some of the vocals sound distant), alongside riffs which are extra crunchy.
""Blind Eye Halo"" features grooving riffs, fast snare drumming, and back-to-back guitar solos.
Finally, ""If Possible,"" has more fast, surging, stop-start, punching riffs, but it ends with some light guitar plucking.

There's one thing that drags this C.D. down, which is that most of the songs follow the same structure: raging vocals in the verses and singing clearly for the chorus. This structure becomes quite repetitive and predictable, but all in all, I'm very glad I decided to give this C.D. a shot, because it is much more than typical metalcore. Soilwork deserve to have much success with it, because ""Stabbing the Drama"" makes the band stand out among other modern metal bands. So, if you've given up on In Flames, and you're not sure which other metal bands to listen to (since there are so many), I definitely recommend you give ""Stabbing the Drama"" a shot.",
A3TKL7X26QKKMO,B000QZX5B0,1,1,5,"I hear people complaining how bad this album is, that ""Soilwork have turned to crappy nu-metal or they're not melo-death!"" Seriously, if you think THIS album sucks, go buy Metallica's horrible excuse for a new album ""St. Anger"", or that that new album from Limp Bizkit. True ""Stabbing The Drama"" isn't Soilwork's best album, but is sure blows the previous release ""Figure Number Five"" right out of the water, and at least the drummer doesn't sound like he's banging his drum sticks on trash cans, and that guitarists Ola Frenning and Peter Wichers still know how to solo. Now that I got that out of my chest, I will now review the album. 2005's ""Stabbing The Drama"", Soilwork's sixth album is one of the best metal albums I bought this year. Like I said before, this blows FNF out of the water. Even thought the bass and keyboards are somewhat drowned out (due to the bit faulty production), this album still has great vocals from Speed Strid, catchy guitar riffs and some nice solos from Peter Wichers and Ola Frenning, and some very good drumming as well. My favorite songs on here are ""Stabbing The Drama"", ""One With The Flies"" (which is very catchy), ""Weapon Of Vanity"", ""Stalemate"", ""Nerve"", ""Distance"", and ""Blind Eye Halo"" (which is an excellent dose of traditional Soilwork brutality and aggression).

themetalbeast's track ratings:

1. Stabbing The Drama: 5/5

2. One With The Flies: 5/5 (Very catchy, nice solo)

3. Weapon Of Vanity: 5/5

4. The Crestfallen: 4/5

5. Nerve: 5/5

6. Stalemate: 5/5

7. Distance: 5/5

8. Observation Slave: 4/5

9. Fate In Motion: 4/5

10. Blind Eye Halo: 5/5 (Very aggressive song, I love it)

11. If Possible (Bonus Track): 5/5

12. Wherever Thorns May Grow (Bonus Track): 5/5

The Verdict:

Is ""Stabbing The Drama"" a horrible sell-out album, an underrated masterpiece, or just a misunderstood album. Truly a misunderstood, underrated masterpiece, and one of 2005's best. You might be disappointed if you're acustomed to Soilwork's older albums, but if you're a True Soilwork fan, or just have a great taste in music, feel free to purchase this.",
A3713PP4MADKED,B000QZX5B0,-1,-1,2,"I plan on going to Ozzfest this year, despite the unusually lackluster lineup (I'm really only going to see In Flames, Mastodon, Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Mudvayne, Maiden, and of course Sabbath), so I've been trying to get into more bands that are on this year's tour. I've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork (this was before this particular album's release), and I knew they were (supposedly) melodic death metal, and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I've give them a shot, but I waited for the release of this album, which I had seen advertised, before I actually purchased anything, as I wanted to get this first. That worked with Dark Tranquillity (""Character"" is a jaw-dropping album), but maybe I should've started with an older release with Soilwork.

After all the rave reviews I've seen of their past albums, and simply their label of melodic death, I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album. I really didn't get it. While I'm not saying that Soilwork doesn't have talent, I'm just saying that if they do have it, they're not showing it as much as they should be on this record. The songwriting is bland as can be, like a pop rock record: most, if not all, of the songs are in intro riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus formula (with a few exceptions), and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired, not at all melodic death-like. Well, at this point I realize Soilwork, at least on this record, isn't really a melodic death band anymore. While In Flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago, I still believe that they make great, though less complicated and though-provoking, music, ""Soundtrack to Your Escape"" being one of my favorite albums of 2004. But it just doesn't work with Soilwork. I honestly can't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else. Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice, but it bores me, it just seems too much like something you'd hear on a commercial radio rock album. And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal, but Speed's voice really just doesn't do anything for me. He sings on the majority of the album, but he'll also scream every now and then, but I don't see anything special in that either.

The main problem with this album is it's just too predictable, too dull, too uninspired, too generic, and way too simple. The album has some catchy tracks (the choruses to ""Weapon of Vanity"" and ""Nerve"" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them), they just don't stand out too much. If you're gonna be a metal band, you gotta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you've got, and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with, you've really gotta give it all you got. Maybe I'm just judging too hard, but I've given this album time to see if it grew on me, and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it. But since I've heard so many good things about their past releases, I'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future, because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the `Fest.",

A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000SZDX88,1,1,4,"First let it be said that I've made a switch.  Having a limited budget, I have owned an MP3 player for fifteen months now.  One of the drawbacks has been figuring out a way to load my I-Tunes to my favorite personal music device.  With C.D.'s it's a breeze, but what about those times when you don't want to commit to an entire album, but go for the single essentials?  Amazon offers a solution with downloaded music that can be formatted for I-Pods AND MP3 players.

Happily, I've been in pop music bliss as I hear some of my favorite songs come in MP3 player clarity from their downloads.  Enticed by a Metamorpho review, I decided to head down memory lane and pick up a jazzy and formidable piece of rock music.  ""The Wanderer"" gets my vote as the best Dion song, and, as I refuse to contradict the merits of Meta's illuminating review, I can still wait for tomorrow to pick up the other nuggets I've sampled of his on Amazon when I get extra greenbacks.

Not to date myself, but it is quite a blessing to discover the glory of music in different phases:  a clock radio (childhood), a radio tape-recorder (puberty) to stereo and Walkman (college), and now the splendor and clarity of MP3 player resonance and selection.

(For the uninitiated, TAKE NOTE:  Write down the directions as you initiate your downloading capabilities from Amazon.  Download the complimentary starter song they offer (You may say, ""I didn't order that!"" Notice it says ""Free Download"" to start your format.  Then, play the song from its selected option.  (See if your Windows Media Player  plays it and capture it in your library.)  When it does and you've captured it, you're in business. Then, you can download songs off Amazon.  (I would also advise you to listen to the songs before you download them.  Make sure you hear the version of the song you want. [I almost downloaded a new version of The Crystals' ""He's a Rebel,"" a no-no in my book.)

Being somewhere between a newbie and computer whiz kid, I admit it's a little hard to start on Amazon.  (I had to pay twice for Cyndi Lauper's ""All Through the Night"" before I got the hang of it.)  If you write down the directions, it is easy after your first download and capture.  So pay attention and ""Don't do as I do, do as I say!""  Having the will and way, I am happy to take the Amazon MP3 Player plunge.  Give it a try and you will, too.",

The first time I heard this song I was 16 and in my first ""serious relationship"".

My boyfriend had a '57 Buick convertible and belonged to a car club, complete with a letterman's jacket and combed his hair in the Princeton style.

We'd sit at the park with the top down and listen to the radio, KJR coming out of Seattle.  It was a sweet time with Mel Carter's voice singing the words that made many a young heart soar.

Yet another great song that no baby boomer putting together an oldies collection should be without!",

A15T3Y3BL2AJ9V,B000SZIVVM,1,1,5,"I am a US Army veteran having served 8 years in Europe during the Cold War. This song speaks out of my heart. It should serve as a reminder to all of us as to who we are and what we should represent and what we value, such as our freedom which has cost it's price on several occasions throughout our history, starting in 1776.
This is the album version from 1992. It is very good, even though a version released in 1990 has more appeal to some folks. It doesn't really matter that much. Any of Lee's versions of this wonderful song will bring the message across. That is what really matters, I think.

A2PT5T9P73GXY,B000SZFP52,1,1,5,What can I say except it's Billy Idol at his best. The beginning of the song was played & sung exactly as the original song was. Then entered the remix which I found to be very entertaining. I would recommend this remix version.,

A3JRW716H3AX14,B000SZXEMI,1,1,5,"This song starts with drumming with a crisp rim shot punctuating a slowly writhing clavinet melody. This is soon joined by some deep piano chords.
At one minute a wispy female vocal enters. The rim shot carries on throughout the tune with the occasional crackling, vinyl record sound entering from time to time. The rhythms are expertly intertwined to make a haunting and beautiful musical experience. I love this tune and consider it the best of Massive Attack (so far). What you hear on the sample is basically what you will hear on the download with the exception of the vocal. This is also used as the soundtrack for the TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D/dp/B002JVWR7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D</a>.",
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000SZXEMI,1,1,5,"Like Mazzy Star, Massive Attack is good at coming up with songs which are lengthy, melodic, mesmerizing, and very appropriate for ambient music for your home or for the backgrounds of films and TV.  In this case, this song ended up being played, without vocals, over the opening credits of the hit TV series House, MD.  It is a perfect choice for the dark-toned saga of an addicted doctor in chronic pain.
Nice vocals and a heartbeat effect round out the song.",

A2CEUUD4H3JV8D,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5,"THIS is the track that started it all for me!  The fast classical guitar piece in the beginning caught me by surprise.  Then the BASS and electric guitars, I was gone!  I had forgotten all about what I used to listen to before, and WOW, this was my ""new"" sound.  Heart was my all time favorite band after this!  SO Glad for MP3s.  YES!!!  They still are one of my top five favorite musician groups.  Heart, yeah...",

A3THSGE4JMQRJC,B000SZX270,1,1,5,I don't know if you can get a more classic Acid Jazz tune than this. Great mixing of Cataloupe Island with modern beats and rap. The intro taken from a night at birdland is a great touch.,

A1B1RE5IQTDPD7,B000SZZBBA,1,1,5,I like music and I find certain songs that are inspiring and energizing.  I have picked certain songs from different albums that I use to worship the Lord and uplift me through the day,
A1C9N96N2M5D13,B000SZZA70,1,1,5,"""Magic Man"" by Heart is a classic rock song that appears to center around woman singing about a man who has left a memorable and/or deep impact on her. I also like how the singer made the tune even more interesting by mentioning the time when her mother was trying to call her home. Nonetheless, ""Magic Man"" by Heart is good for those who like any other songs by Heart and/or classic rock music.",
AYOBDN3WZINT6,B000SZZA70,1,1,4,I purchased this to add to my IPOD collections so I can listen while napping before a long day at work.,
ANTMZ5ZC0TLNZ,B000SZZA70,1,1,5,"Heart... Magic Man has a timeless sound and quality. blues like guitar opens on one of their all-time classics. ""Magic Man"" is about a girl who's spellbound with a man of her dreams, to the chagrin of her mother.",
A3TY54T5QG26ID,B000SZZA70,1,1,5,"Everyone MUST know this song by now! A classic.  I'm a musician and a musician friend and I were going to 7-11 for something and this came on the radio and we said ""Who is that?""  We knew it wasn't Grace Slick.  We just sat mesmerized listening and then the Moog Synthesizer came in and it was WOW.  And all those guitars and guitar licks!  The announcer said it was the Wilson Sisters from Cananda.  My friend comes over a week later with the album:  Heart Dreamboat Annie.  I got my own copy.  It's considered a modern classic.  Every cut is a dandy.",

A2CEUUD4H3JV8D,B000SZZA70,1,1,5,"I could see this played out in a music video because of the way it's presented here.  The girl hypnotized by the ""Magic Man's""  charm and personality (among other things), the mother's worry that her daughter will be lost to a stranger, and her pleas to her daughter to come home.  It's up to you to decide whether she returns or not.  I like that.  Rarely do songs involve the listener to actually think about the outcome for themselves.",
A330HRJVSMZCCC,B000T00GF0,1,1,5,I make CDs of all my favorite songs and listen to them in the car and while I'm cleaning house. This song is one that has been on the CDs for some time now. It has so much meaning and says so much from my heart. I just love it.,
A2KQT4D0OZR569,B000T00CKE,1,1,5,"I love this song and recently downloaded it from Amazon.com.  I love Joshua Kadison's voice.  It's warm and he conveys emotion well with it.  The lyrics to the song, though, are what makes it a favorite of mine.  They describe a love without being sappy and are realistic enough to make me think of my own relationship with my husband.",
A2NRBOWFEO19S8,B000T027SO,1,1,4,The sick times we live in have cast a shadow over this tune.  Excellent quality.  Used as part of an audio biography of friend.  Doesn't get better than this.,

A14Y48GBNSJK1V,B000T027SO,1,1,5,Another good song overshadowed by the great American Pie song.  If it was on any other album it would have been a bigger hit.  If your a Don McLean fan you already know how good this song is.... if not take a listen and you'll find out what this download is all about.  Sound quality is good on this song.,
A2A9T2X7ZFNN20,B000T027SO,1,1,5,Love this classic song.  I can just see Vincent Van Gogh painting that beautiful scene.  Paint your pallet blue and grey...,
AWIGS50MFK5RW,B000T027SO,1,1,5,Thankful that Amazon makes it easy to find titles from long ago and the prices are so reasonable.  Love this old song.,
A1N8KLT7H2BTJ7,B000T027SO,1,1,4,"It is as advertised at a reasonable price.  The only drawback to Amazon music is the low bit and sample rates.  I wish they'd offer a high quality mp3 product, even if it's at a higher price.",

No one has ever written a better or more recognized ballad of the 60's and 70's than McLean's American Pie.  It should be made into a documentary.",

A2ZN87SZ3M5DQ3,B000T1A1YU,1,1,5,I am not a big fan of group but they had two incredible songs ... one of which was this.  There is just something that flows with this song.,
A2J096HDALTSMA,B000T1A1YU,1,1,5,It is the original from Roxette. Recommend for anyone that wants a classic 80s hit that is fun and brings a great sound to any set of speakers.,
AGBQJLG0ZU074,B000T1A1YU,1,1,5,"I really love this tune. The music is dramatic and bouncy with a great band. There again, I loved this for some time and finally heard it in the car, and the DJ finally said who sang it,,,,Yeah, you guessed it,,,,back to Amazon. Now it's mine,,,Great vibes and
you listen to it and see what YOU think? Bob",

A1LVEPRENTHRSH,B000T1FR8A,1,1,5,I heard this song played during a Bruce Hornsby interview on satellite radio while I was doing housework.  I had to stop and listen to every part of this awesome production.  Bonnie Raitt and this song are a perfect match!  I told my friend about it.  She commented that it is an old song. No problem--this heartfelt song is for all times.,

A26Y3WOLEBRDEF,B000T1FR8A,1,1,5,The sentiment stinks but the song is great!!!  Bonnie Raitt's voice never gets old.  Heard the song on the radio and had to have it on my tablet.,

A3I8GC0R44ON1L,B000T1BRPM,1,1,5,I needed this song for a project for my parents. Somehow this was missed. But I don't mind paying to hear Kenny Rogers sing this song. It is so uplifting and a blessing about what True love and commitment are.,
A35L9OHHDP854U,B000T1BRPM,1,1,5,"I bought this song to give to my wife - besides being a great song, it reminds me of our life together these many years. I love her more today than I did when we were married 27 years ago. And I love this song.",

A1FT65Q22VCA2D,B000T1FQD6,1,1,5,Nice song,
A3BIV1X1K9R796,B000T1FQD6,1,1,5,"The group Roxette always seems to come up with wonderful songs - very melodious as well as real ""toe-tapping"" stuff! Never get tired of listening to this group! This song is no exception!",
A3QS1EPDZTLPWS,B000T1HLCK,1,1,5,"Absolutely gorgeous. Though the Kings of Convenience's first album is not ""electronic"" in the strictest sense (or in any sense), there's still no denying the utter beauty of this album. The first track on the album, ""Winning a Battle, Losing the War,"" is my favorite, full of shimmering guitars and pensive lyrics; the track doesn't explodes as much as it blossoms right at the end. ""Singing Softly to Me"" throws in some trumpet to emphasize the call-and-response of the song, while ""I Don't Know What I Can Save You From"" adds a mournful cello towards the end, as if underlining the futility of the situation. The haunting melodies and the powerful lyrics get under your skin and stick in your head. An underlying melancholy lies at the heart of some of the outstanding tracks like ""The Weight of My Words,"" ""Little Kids,"" and the powerful closing tracks, ""The Passenger"" and ""Parallel Lines."" The album titles says it all: QUIET IS THE NEW LOUD.",
A3G10NPD661EQD,B000T1HLCK,1,1,4,"Though ""Quiet Is The New Loud"" lacks a hit like ""I'd Rather Dance With You"" from their newest album ""Riot On An Empty Street"", every song here is wonderfully mellow and good enough to make it a better album overall (that one had some bad tracks). Erlend Oye was clearly blessed with one of the most soothing voices in the music business. Not only are the vocals great, but the lyrics are also very interesting, even if they lack catchiness. That's not really what this album's about anyway; it's about relaxing. The instrumentation is also pretty simple - it's basically just acoustic guitars and drums, but they're wonderful here - they perfectly encapsulate the mood. ""Failure"" and ""I Don't Know What I Can Save You From"" may be the standout tracks, but, really, they're all wonderful. They may not be breaking any new ground here, but they don't really have to - you're going to love it anyway. Practically any music fan will love this, and for that it definitely earns ""5"" stars. You'll never get tired of listening to this! This is highly recommended!

Highlights include:
the entire album!",
A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B000T1HLCK,-1,-1,3,"I first had a chance to listen to Kings' ""Riot on an Empty Street"" and found it to be much more elaborate from a stand point of harmonies, composition and lyrics. Well into ""Quiet is the New Loud"", though it's not a BAD album, it doesn't quite catch you either and it even ends up being a  bit boring at times. I recommend you check out the band's 2004 album instead. Pass on this one.",

A1WZHESEKXF09I,B000T1FR4Y,1,1,5,I love Bonnie Raitt. I recommend watching the video. This is a feel good song. I would recommend it. Lyrics are so True.,
A97TYP2NJSJNC,B000T1FR4Y,1,1,5,This song puts things into perspective. It reminds me to think and judge for myself and not be too concerned with what others think.,
A2R6N8S68XV2T1,B000T1FR4Y,1,1,5,I enjoy buying single songs instead of albums. I also enjoy being able to listen to the song first before purchase.,
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5,"""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" by the Proclaimers is about as high energy as a pop song can be. Positive lyrics, intense beat, great singing and musicianship help keep this song on my running playlist workout after workout.

Scottish identical twins, Charlie and Craig Reid -- these two brothers harmonize and sing off of each other well. Though only a modest hit in America, hitting #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988, it lives on as a stadium anthem in Scotland, and in pubs everywhere.

It is a schmaltzy love song with a catchy refrain. If that's OK with you, give it a listen.

""And when I come home(When I come home), yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you.""

One day while I was driving somewhere, by accident I had my radio station from what I was listening to and it fell on one of the radio channels that play this type of Christian music. I was hooked right there. It's downloaded on the computer at work AND at home. This music soothes my soul every single day and I can't be without it.

There was nothing I didn't like about it AT ALL. I would recommend that pastors, Sunday School teachers and parents make this music a daily diet for their children. Our country is in the fells of bad, scary things ahead.",

It refreshes Scripture in my mind and reminds me to not only give praise when things are going my way but keeps me out of the ""my will be done"" mindset in times of trouble. Matt Redman has a fantastic voice and the song has a great tone and rhythm. Definitely moves me to my feet and helps me to remember that I can, through Him, take on anything that comes me way because I am His child and have within me the Spirit that cries out ""Abba, Father.""

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000T31G8S,1,1,5,"It is sincerely sad whenever someone young and talented dies before your heart. Natalie Cole knew that dear feeling, not just with the death of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole, but also in herself, with her saddened passing New Year's Eve in 2015. She had showcased a brilliant and beautiful bravado of songs that really have with stood the test of time, on her own and healing through the soul of jazz and R&B soul overall. When I have thought of Natalie Cole, I think of her deepest songs that really showed all sides from pop and R&B like Snowfall In The Sahara, Live For Your Love and the dearest ballad of them all, Unforgettable. The song which Nat King Cole recorded on his own was one thing, but when Natalie did it in 1991, it really became timeless beyond what words could ever expect. It is just one of those duets that really drives you at the heartstrings so deep, you'll forget what cheap music of today really is. This is a must download for any die hard fan of Nat's, Natalie's or for anyone that really never heard of what great songs were like.

Song: A",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000T31G8S,1,1,5,"I am truly devastated to hear the news that the great Natalie Cole passed away at 65 years old. He work as a amazing songstress has been delivered through the heartache, and from the soul of following in the footsteps of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole. I am definitely crushed as a hard core fan of Natalie's. Her voice defiinitely ranged from the sassy in soul and R&B, to the sophisticated Jazz intimacy of her beloved father's legacy. While she had her demons from drug abuse, and the heartbreaks of three failed marriages, what Ms. Cole did for a lifetime, was truly beyond breathtaking at soul. Obviously her biggest hit was really with her beloved father, Unforgettable. The song really showed a beauty and closeness to what Natalie had never experienced with Nat King Coke, and his heartbreaking death. Now with Ms. Cole passing on, the song is so surreal at the soul. I am just shedding tears of sadness for her. Natalie Cole was truly unforgettable.

Natalie Cole  1950-2015

It's a wonderful blend of Tribal and New Age Music.  The Tribal lyrics speak to the soul.  The English Lyrics speak to the heart and the mind.

Jay Black's voice is even more powerful than I recall it was, and it has seldom, if ever, been used as well as it has on this song. It cost me 99 cents, and it was a bargain at twice the price. Glad I bought it.",
A35XG6755DWOJV,B000TDG3B8,1,1,5,I honestly can't recall any song by the Stray cats except this one. Stray cat strut is a well crafted song with a wryly amusing lyric and a lovely blues feel.

A255DFIUTVMC60,B000TDG3B8,1,1,5,This song is cute and sassy. I can imagine choreography to this song. It's perfect for strutting around the house to.,
ACKDSX71VI5HY,B000TDG3B8,1,1,5,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""Stray Cat Strut"" was released in the early 1980's by a group called The Stray Cats, a trio that featured musician Brian Setzer.  At the time, I thought it was a silly, absurd yet enjoyable tune.  Roughly twenty-eight years later, it's still fairly humorous but also I hear nuances and jazz influences and terminology that enriches the song to the status of a minor classic.",
A220EANOQ8R2JU,B000TDI8V6,1,1,4,This is a great song. He really sounds like Jimi Hendrix on this song. One of the best songs of the nineteen nineties.,
A5UTBXSLXQLQ6,B000TDI8V6,1,1,5,I love this song! This is going on my heavy metal / hard rock play list on my mp3 player. A must have! His star rose and fell so fast. I was hoping for more from him!,

A35XG6755DWOJV,B000TDI8V6,1,1,4,"This is a classic song from Lenny Kravitz. I suspect many, many, many men know it only as one of the best songs from Gran Turismo 3. That's where I heard it and it brings back such happy memories of the last good Gran Turismo game. That aside this is a fast, guitar and drum heavy song with a cracking music video to go with it and one of the cooles tdrummers ever. Definitely a song to keep. So, why the four stars? Well the version I downloaded from AMazon was so quiet it could barely be heard played over my computer speakers and when played on my X7/Sennheiser portable music set up I thought I'd missed it. This is really poor audio quality. There are ways around this if you're creative so whilst I like the song the download is terrible. Avoid.",

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TDSQ9A,1,1,5,"""Rebel Yell"" is a very enjoyable and daring passionate lust song. As per the songfacts website, ""Rebel Yell"" is basically about a one night stand that is very pleasurable that the lover ends up expressing that they want more. This is also made clear with the following lyrics:
In the midnight hour she cried- ""more, more, more""
With a rebel yell she cried- ""more, more, more""
In the midniight hour babe- ""more, more, more""
With a rebel yell- ""more, more, more""
More, more, more.

 Obviously, there is more to this gem of a song. Billy Idol really puts alot of his spirit into the song in such an excellent fashion that it is almost like he is telling a very entertaining story that he is simultaneously singing. I admit that I first heard this song when I was a teenager, and I currently still love listening to this song. The guitar riffs and his fantastic singing blend well together with this song to make it a musical track that is fun to listen to multiple times in a row. ""Rebel Yell"" is also another song to put in a love/lust playlist and/or 80's classic song playlist",

So when someone mentions The Verve this song is the first thing that comes to mind. If you like any type of music you should like this song.

A2DRGGCUUU3LJT,B000TDUUZS,1,1,5,I am happy to find this song and add it to my music collection.  I was surprised to find it.,
A1VOSVK55YQMYD,B000TDUUZS,1,1,5,This song is great sounds a lot better on an ipod than any car I owned back when released. They don't make music like this anymore.,
A29YXBFTD7QUP3,B000TDUUZS,1,1,4,"What is there to say, either you love this guys music or you don't, if you are looking at it then it's obviouse you already enjoy this music and, this is a good one to have.",
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000TDUUZS,1,1,5,here's another great song that didn't get the air play from DJs that it deserved.  I'm sorry we didn't hear more from Divinyls.,
A89ZZKNDFQH23,B000TDUUZS,1,1,4,"I was told recently to learn this tune for a cover band show, its always requested when they have a chick singer.  SO I knew the song but downloaded it do a brush up, it's right on the border of being crude, but stays just on the edge passing sexy off easily.  It is a good song, it's clever and well done.",
A165P3MOJV3OVZ,B000TDSTK6,1,1,5,Enjoyed it,
A3C1L3IUFBEYBP,B000TDSTK6,1,1,5,Great for my luau party!,
AOSMJHTFNUXRB,B000TDSTK6,-1,-1,1,How can I review this when it didn't download? I was told to call here and there-now THAT'S too much trouble. I have learned to NEVER download a single song for my MP3 player again from Amazon or iTunes.,
AD3VJNKDVFDYG,B000TDSTK6,1,1,5,You'll find no surprises here: this is one of the most popular Beach Boys songs and a fun summer song.,
A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000TDSTK6,1,1,5,"I just like the harmonies of the group.  The words are empty, mostly filler, but the song flows  well.",
A1BPOYZDY1KYQA,B000TDUOCC,1,1,5,"My wife wanted this in her iPod and on a cd for her car.  Good music, the right price and just a straight download.",
A11NCMBVWN14KD,B000TDUOCC,1,1,5,great,
AOR7VND4GXUJ9,B000TDUOCC,1,1,5,This is a very feel good song. I used to love to dance to it. I remember I was real thin then. What happened!,

A3837D2JE16VV4,B000TDUOCC,1,1,5,"The power of this song is in the arrangement. Spirited bass line, with a rousing gospel piano, supporting the most exuberant song about love every written. Natalie's most fun hit.",
A1NQMFCC5FJCPX,B000TDUP8K,1,1,5,"In my opinion, both interpretations of the classic song are essential to any collection. UB40's take on ""The Way You Do the Things You Do"" combines electronic synths and bright horns that counter the subdued vocal harmonies. A reggae/pop classic.",
AGHWHC4XOQUMM,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5,"I ordered this version of the song Barbara Ann by the Beach Boys because it does not include all the extra ""sound effects"" that are in the original version. This version sounds cleaner to me, with the vocals more pronounced. I like it!",

A3J8I8XLN6T0QU,B000TDUXBY,1,1,5,"There is not one song that I don't like from Trace! He sold me from ""hello"" and still amazes me with his voice! I have all his CD's! I fell in love with this song the first time I heard it!",
AARNOU1XYBFXT,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5,"It's one of the lost love songs, slow dancing, stuff that made being in love what it was and was meant to be. --- It wasn't the ""tennis shoes in the dryer"" music that is the base of most of the music now. --- It's a phrase I made up to describe the current music to my children.....""thump thump ---- thump thump....""",
A3C1L3IUFBEYBP,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5,Great for my luau party!,
A21SVX9ETVZ3ZN,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5,one of my favorites,

A30C4HNZBZYDI2,B000TDUVES,1,1,5,This was a good song off of a really good album.  I'm glad I could get such a great price on it through Amazon and I like having it sync wirelessly to my Kindle Fire.,

A1LEYLI0BCE0YR,B000TDWS8A,1,1,5,This song is an anthem of the 60's. It has been covered by a number of groups but none come across like the Beach Boys because they lived the song. You gotta like it no matter how old you are.,
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000TDUVKM,1,1,5,"I double dog DARE you!
The wonderful Gorillaz has produced a listenable, singable, danceable single with this song, which has a very catchy beat.  It doesn't matter if you can't make out all the lyrics; you will still enjoy it.  Nicely crafted by the oddball band put together by people from various other bands.",
A3L0YM35AU0X7R,B000TDURL0,1,1,5,"Billy Idol was one of the artists that defined 80's rock. In the decade that spawned MTV, Idol created an image much like David Bowie, that took advantage of the dance club scene that began using big screens showing DJ rock videos to the dance crowds. With a hypnotic dance beat and great lyrics this song and Rebel Yell define Billy Idol.",

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000TDWOAM,-1,-1,1,"Never cared so much for the original, but, Billy Idol's late eighties remake is about as pleasant as smelling a wet fart. How did this song become so popular?? hmm...Leave it to these robotic, zombie like, program directors/puppets working for the large radio- owning conglomerates. anyway, enough of my ranting, this song is horrible and has dated horribly.",

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TDYITM,1,1,5,Roll With It by Steve Winwood is an upbeat song that to me symbolizes making the best of life regardless of how things turn out.  This Roll With It by Steve Winwood ties with Eye of The Tiger by Survivor in helping to remind me to stay resilient and self-confident about making the best out of my life whenever I hear the song.  Roll With It is a great song for those who like classic 80s songs that are emotional boosting/motivational type songs.,

A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000TDYITM,1,1,5,Steve Winwood's voice has been rocking since the days he was with the Spencer Davis group.  This was one of the best songs to come out of the 80s with a nice mix of 80s pop with some soul mixed in.,

A1Q5BEVD3IF62H,B000TDWO5C,1,1,5,"We, worshippers, care, are generous in giving, joyful in our God. We also like hearing the reasoning behind the music. The reason for this song, made me want it. Jeremy Camp, the writer, had just became a widower, his wife a victim of cancer. This is his outcry of pain. Real pain creates dramatic dependence on this God who cares more than any other. Now people understand. When trauma strikes- we still believe!",

AHB899WWYV0RK,B000TDYRQQ,1,1,5,"As I get older, pieces of favorite music from my past become new and greater from a few moments in the movies. This song was beautifully used in the final credits of ""Love Actually"" as photos taken in the reception area of Heathrow airport are shown, ordinary people greeting loved ones and long lost friends. As we watch these interactions, The Beach Boys sing, ""God only knows what I'd be without you . . .""  These people's happiness and tears, I think, become ours as we watch and remember.",
A2QLPXZ9CNMMVQ,B000TDWRHM,1,1,5,By far a classic.,

AYMHDYEA0N2CD,B000TDWQEQ,1,1,5,"What can you say, it is a wonderful song.  Keith Urban plays the guitar at the end of this song for about 3 min and it is very entertaining.  One of the best out there.",
AR65NXO4GIA9H,B000TDWQEQ,1,1,5,This is probably my favorite song Keith Urban has ever done. It's one of his slower songs but it really suits the lyrics and meaning. The song itself is gorgeous but sad and you can really hear the emotion coming through. I highly recommend this song if you like any of Keith Urban's other songs because it's well worth the price.,

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000TDUTOK,1,1,4,"I call him Mr. Singles because a few of his albums that I have are mainly good for that: the singles.

Fly Away is a good example off of the album, ""5"".

It has Lenny longing to ""fly away"" and ""get away"" from this world, off to see something different like the ""milky way"".

I appreciate Lenny mainly because of the singles that are released, being more catchy, radio-friendly type tunes and because he writes his own lyrics a lot (all?) of the time.

Fly Away is a fun experience which will send you high with the simple, yet rockin' guitar and the production. The lyrics aren't too bad either.

4.25 stars.

end note: This track came out in '98 originally but is featured on this greatest hits album produced in '00.",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000TE0O7G,1,1,4,"Honestly, it has been a very long while since Lenny Kravitz came out with a really good song. The 90's showed he had a really good tune with knowing how to craft good songs like Fly Away and Thinking Of You for his mother Roxie whom died of cancer in 1995. But he also showed that he was able to do well with cover songs as well. That was the case with his cover of The Guess Who's American Woman, which was featured on a expanded version of his 5 album. The song feels just as driven today as when Lenny recorded it over a decade ago. While he hasn't reclaimed his 90's glory, Lenny still is making music out there. Hopefully, when his next work comes out, he can do another cover song like this one.

Song: B",

A3B9DHWCMYQFD,B000TE0O7G,1,1,5,"...I will probably get negged right out of the top two thousand for admitting this...But...I like Kravitz's version of the song,  American woman, better than the older version. NOW HOLD ON BEFORE YOU OLDER FOLKS NEGG ME OUT! I loved the original. I always cranked it up when it came on the radio. I loved it! But BEFORE you judge me, find a good stereo...plug in this version of American Woman by Kravitz's and CRANK IT UP....Go on. I'll wait....Okay? Are ya done? Well!? Heh!!? The song was killer! Am I right!? Kravitz's slowed the tempo a bit. He played guitar with flawless, bone crushing chords with awesome force. And the dude can sing! The whole remake by Lenny Kravitz is superior in every way (except maybe the old solo...it was really cool and Kenny didn't quite get that ""whine"" out of his axe, but hey, this song is a great song for my ever EXPANDING digital library. Lenny, you the man!",

A17UXXQRJUD0I4,B000TE1BE6,1,1,5,"I was troubled by the subtle or overt sexual theme music my school age grandchildren listen to which is performed by today's Pop, Hip-Hop, Rock, and R&B artists blasted on their parents favorite car radio stations.  Therefore, I decided to compile a CD to introduce my school age grandchildren to a variety of wholesome music from various genres.  This classic song is performed by Bobby McFerrin, and  is a 'must have' to include on a playlist which is suitable for older school-age children.  The message is timeless, and best of all, this is a fun song, which is  family friendly, and a  favorite which I'm sure my grandchildren will enjoy.

A3PZDCOCZ8P3C3,B000TE10G0,-1,-1,1,not the version I thought it was I can understand all the lyrics in this version but way to slow,
AKUMRHVDLD47I,B000TE3P72,1,1,5,"Originally written for and released by Elvis Presley this is a great remake of the song. According to Wikipedia over 60 versions of the song have been recorded by different artists. This is probably the most successful.

With a different enough beat and production from the original to be a stand alone hit. Very distinctive sound of the band including Ali Campbell (I think) vocals and the simplified but sophisticated horn backed Reggae sound that UB40 specialized in makes this a classic.

If you don't have it download now. 3 quality minutes for $0.99 what a deal.",
A26L99MGEV891D,B000TE3P72,1,1,5,"The reason this song deserves 5 stars? Sinple one of the few songs of the era to still sounds so fresh to hear. It also succeeds on covering many genres In the one song yet never aspired to be anything other than a cover song. People that don't really know Elvis music might even say It's their favorite. So the song Itself Is also why It gets 5 stars.
Should remain a radio staple for years on oldies stations.",

A1KX30LMWH6QX5,B000TE3P72,1,1,5,ok,
AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000TE3P72,1,1,5,"This is another great hit from UB40, there other being Red, Red, Wine. If you like reggae this song is definitely for you, if you like pop this should catch your ears. The reason why I like this song is because I liked Red, Red, Wine. This is has a familiar ring to it, I am not into reggae that much but I do like those two songs from UB40; and Wild World from Maxi Priest. So if you know any of those song you should like this one, for those new to UB40 check out the MP3 sample. I grew up on 70's, 80's, New Wave, but I like Ub40, you might too.
THX,
Kris L. CocKayne",
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TE3P72,1,1,5,I cant help falling in love with you by ub40 touches on a man coming to terms with the strong emotions that he has for someone else. The song makes it clear that he is unable to stop the amorous feelings and is maybe thinking that he was meant to feel that emotion as part of spiritual kismet a.k.a destiny with the lyrics somethings are meant to be.,

I finally added it to my iPod last week where I shuffle a variety of songs from the last 80 or 90 years. When The Fishin' Hole song played, I smiled the whole way through.

A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B000TE54Q2,1,1,5,"I sang this to audition for a part in Mayflower Community Theater's production of The Music Man a few years after the release of No Rain. Shannon Hoon, the singer of Blind Melon, died of a drug overdose after I had given up drama as a crazy activity that made me more hyper than anything on stage when characters were running around in madcap disorder. This song was what Bob McNamara lacked as Secretary of Defense when draftees were being sent to Vietnam and the courts thought we had political powers to control what the powers that be do instead of courts and a Constitution. Hey, Bob, would you listen to this?",

A3SR2FSNU40ZSD,B000TE3FCC,1,1,4,"With a groove that is at once laid back and then flows rhythmically well, ""Before I Let Go"", is Frankie Beverly and the guys doing what they do best.

Though Beverly was born in Philadelphia, the band became transplanted San Francisco Bay Area residents and adopted that area's sounds of raw soul, elegant soul and message supplanted soul. Marvin Gaye also helped define their ""What's Going On"" to  ""I Want You"" soul which would also give them a Motown 70s pedigree, when the label successfully graduated from the #1 singles label, from an indie no less, to a great album label.",

A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,B000TE7LUY,1,1,5,"Richard Marx is one of my favorite singer/songwriters ever. In an era where most things felt over-produced, dramatic, or downright cheesy, the music of Richard Marx felt like a breath of fresh air. One of his most famous songs is a post relationship classic ""Should've Known Better."" Richard Marx voice allows the listener to believe that he has truly expierianced the heartbreak of which he sings. Something that is def. lacking in today's mostly soulless popular music scene. There's something universal in the loss of love that Richard Marx manages to capture though without delivering a four minute funeral procession in the process.",

A179EHWXB6NSIQ,B000TE9IR8,1,1,5,"In my opinion, this is Bing Crosby's best Christmas Classic: ""Do You Hear What I Hear?""  It has survived the test of time, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its release this year.  It is also one of a dozen of Bing's first STEREO Christmas songs, and it sounds great.  I enjoy Bing's version of this song better than any other artist, and this song even more than his signature song, ""White Christmas"".  Bing was one of the first two artists to present this song to the public, and he left a great lasting impression of ""Do You Hear What I Hear"".  A couple of other not as popular Bing Crosby Christmas songs to look-up are: ""I Sing Noel"", ""The Littlest Angel"", ""And the Bells Rang"", ""Round and Round the Christmas Tree"" and a duet with Frank Sinatra called ""We Wish You the Merriest"". Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.  May this season bring us peace, goodness, light and life.",

A1NADGMAR6GQW1,B000TEAYVW,1,1,5,At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.  So if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a CD of your chosing that expresses your love for her.,

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000TED2CK,-1,-1,2,"Yeah, daddy's girls could sing but the late eighties/early nineties sterile overproduction mars the track significantly. Although they had a hit with it, it hasn't aged well, like a lot of the music from that era (you know the era, back when people walked around looking like arsenio hall or will smith in the fresh prince) They migth've really produced a timeless track if Brian Wilson had produced. Never got the lyrics for the song either. Something about a change and breakin free from the change.",

A3ARWXNPHVQP1B,B000TEGI8K,1,1,5,The radio stopped playing it and years later it was forgotten. Then I started to listen to Pandora and this song played often. I remembered it and remembered that I love it so I bought it. It really is a lost hit of the 90's.,
A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B000TEGI8K,1,1,4,"The opening riff from that toy trumpet is unmistakable, an instant hook, unique to this song--smart production--its tone and timbre highly reminiscent of the traditional death march, even ovoking a little bit of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-James-Infirmary/dp/B00009KO4D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. James Infirmary</a>.  It harkens well back to the 1932 original from which this tune is built.

Then that chugging, mid-pace beat comes in, with a subtly clubby keyboard riff, and it's somewhere highly accessible between the Cure and hip hop. And then you get that thin, old-timey vocal pushed througha Victrola speaker, faux mono, and I'm hearing echoes of Murray Head's ""One Night in Bangkok,"" even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aqualung-s/dp/B00000GAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aqualung's</a>&nbsp;title track.

Ah, but to my listening the words are deeper than this AM pop veneer would lead you to believe.  Pay attention and it's not just boy v. girl, failed relationships, doubt and inadequacy, but the very nature of gender identification, gender roles, and the interplay between government and the governed.

Or, you could just dance to it.",

A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,B000TEKRPK,1,1,5,"The Spice Girls ""Wannabe"" holds a special place in the hearts of those who grew up in the 1990's. While some people dismiss it as light and pithy pop that appeals to the teenaged crowd, there can be an alternative meaning attached because so many girls have viewed it as something of a girl power/independence anthem because it stood out as something different in a rough sea of boy band pop that perhaps treats girls as though girls are puppy dogs looking to be lead into one night stands or something.",

As wrong as that may sound, some moms are just hot, like it or not. You might even dream about having that mom, to show her off to your buddies. But this song is about that feeling. And kudos to FoW for having the balls to write a song like this, put it out on the radio, and making the music video the way that they did.

This is an underrated rock classic, and certainly a classic song for the 2000's. You've never heard one like this before.",

A28FNKCGFS03VL,B000TETN96,1,1,4,"A young soul crooner influenced by some of the old-school masters, Javier's 2003 self-titled debut is a pleasing if not earth-shattering album that nods more to the likes of Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway than to many of the minimally talented competitors that Javier was up against at the time. Not to call him a male version of Jill Scott or anything like that; there are plenty of albums that sound like this, but Javier's pleasing charm, romantic sentiment, and minimal attempts to be hip-hoppish certainly make him and this album worth checking out.",
A17814AD8EWTN4,B000TETN96,-1,-1,3,"See i will never deny Javier of his talent. But i will deny him on this album because he really does not show it to the best of his abilitys on this album. He has a great voice, and he has a nag for writing really good songs. Not to mention he can play the guitar really well, which is very rare amongest most R&B singers these days. But even despite all of his positives this album lands right on the mediocre line. Its not a bad album, but he could have done alot better. The problem i had with this album is that it all sounds the same. I mean there are a few big shining spots like the single ""Crazy"" and the mid tempo track ""Biggest Mistake"" which tell the tale of how Javier lost his woman. But other than those two standout spots and a few select other tracks this album is boring. He stuck with the accoustic guitar to much on this album. All the songs sound like they were made by low end producers and none of the songs really have a groove to them. He is lacking that song that makes you wanna get up and dance. There is none of that here. Its all that neo soul accoustic guitar type of music, which by the way i love, but not when it all sounds the same. To sum it up real short, Javier has the potential to make phenominal music, he could be amongest the Ushers and R. Kellys with a little help and ALOT more promotion. This album debuted at number 86 on the top 200 albums. Thats horrible for a R&B artist on a big name recorod label (Capitol Records). Overall its an ok debut, but i hope the next one is better.

Grade:
C",
AAEA4STR27PN2,B000TETN96,1,1,5,Javier has a lush voice.  It is what's missing in today's r&b!  Too many people rely on the studio and not talent.  Not only does Javier have a great voice but he also plays the guitar.  Buy yourself a treat!  Get this cd today!!,
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000TETN96,1,1,5,"I've had this CD for about 4 years now and I must say that I wasn't thoroughly impressed until today (May 18, 2011). A bunch of the songs did stand out as good or great, but not everyone impressed me like they now do. I had a review up here previously that was pretty harsh on the songs that didn't tickle my fancy upon repeated listening. However, my whole outlook on this CD has changed and the only throwaway thing about this disc isn't even really a track (see interlude #1)!

Anyway, my favorite songs in order are BIGGEST MISTAKE, OCTOBER SKY, SHE'LL NEVER KNOW, CAN'T HAVE MY HEART and IN YOUR HANDS. The other tracks are just fine but they don't score between a 4.5 and a 5.

Excellent debut by a perfectly gifted singer-songwriter. There is enough depth and umph here to satisfy the average R&B enthusiast.

4.5 stars (or a 9/10).

RECOMMENDED:
""Biggest Mistake""
""October Sky""
""She'll Never Know""
""Can't Have My Heart"" &
""In Your Hands""",
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B000TETN96,1,1,4,"Javier - Javier (Capitol, 2003)
When Javier first released ""Crazy"" last year, I wasn't too, uh, crazy about it because lyrically, he wasn't saying anything new. If you're looking for more original songwriting on this album, you won't find it but you will find some wonderfully sung tracks like ""Song for Your Tears"" and ""Hey Little Sister"". Javier also does a good rendition of the jazz standard, ""October Sky"". Vocally, he is a cross between Eric Benet and Slim from 112. He has a good chance of staying long in the business if he is promoted right. Actually, this album came out last August, I only saw one video from him (""Crazy""), and I'm sure this album isn't platinum yet, so the future doesn't look too good. Pick this album up to support Javier, and for more underrated artists on Capitol Records, also get the new Van Hunt. -EJR",
A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B000TETN96,1,1,4,"Javier's self-titled debut CD is a smoothly executed and immaculately produced old-school R&B gem that is obviously influenced by Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway with a little Brian McKnight thrown in. Although I really love this release and it has received very positive reviews here, I am writing mine to further support Javier as I just read a couple reviews from well known reviewers that not only slammed Javier for sounding like Brian McKnight lite, but also took the opportunity to slam Brian McKnight. Cheap shot on both counts.
In my opinion, this is one of 2003s very best releases from a confident new talent who is following his muse and not jumping on the much too crowded neo-soul bandwagon or relying on hip-hop and collaborations with rappers to sell CDs. Keep in mind that I have no issue with any of the aforementioned genres, but cant a young black man be allowed (and even commended) for sticking to his guns as he is the real thing not the creation of some producer. Some critics may not know that Javier not only did his time in a jam R & B band, is also a multi-instrument virtuoso, and served as co-writer on all the songs on his album, a rarity in the world of contemporary R&B.
What about the record you ask? Some of you may have heard the first single title Crazy, which in my mind is also one of 2003s best. Its got a Stevie Wonder vibe, a chorus from heaven, and some hooks that make it. ""Song For Your Tears"" is one of my favorites combining wah-wah guitars and classical piano with Philly soul orchestration and some Stevie Ray Vaughn blues to produce a lush masterpiece. Here Javier sounds like a seasoned pro.  Hey Little Sister has a contagious Roots-crafter percussion which makes the song move and seasons Javiers infectious Falsetto and song runs. Although Biggest Mistake has a boy-band ballad feel to it, its still a great song that makes it an instant classic.
Authentic Latin flourish spices tracks like ""Can't Have My Heart"" and ""She Spoke To Me,"" are peppered with Latin influences, which is not surprising as Javier's father owned a Spanish-language radio station  and Latin music was a constant presence in Javier's family household growing up. The former sounds a little too much like Brian McKnights Back At One, but its still great. The latter is pure Javier which to me sounds a little like a contemporary Stevie. Not a parody or an imitation, just the voice and song selection is definitively more Stevie than Nas or 50 Cent. I love the guitar work and the sexy images that the song evokes. Think of a midnight dance under a full moon in a tropical island and youll get an idea of how great She Spoke To Me is and why its another of my favorites. In Your Hands showcases Javiers voice and songwriting strength. Shell Never Know also hits the spot with his pleading beat and sense of romantic loss.
The most magical song on the CD is saved for last. October Sky takes an entirely new direction with a jazzy late night feel that  has Javier sounding like a troubadour from the 1930s (with a detour at Stevie Wonders house) who somehow wound up in a modern day bar. I hope that this song is a window of things to come. Dont turn off your CD after the song ends as it picks up again in an organic feel that could also be the basis for what lies ahead for Javier.

All in all this is an outstanding debut that is solidly based on old school R&B, but spiced by jazz, rock, funk, and Latin grooves. There are only a couple of songs (Beautiful U R, Slow Motion) that are not as strong as the rest and sound a little too much like other crooners who specialize in mid-tempo songs. Even those songs are head and shoulders above the rest of what passes for R & B these days. While at first listen I can see why some may see Javiers debut as a poor mans Brian McKight, if you really listen to the music, there is no doubt that Javier is his own man and easily earns the 4 stars that I am giving it. It would have been 5 stars if the aforementioned mid tempo songs had been replaced by songs in the vein of ""October Sky""",
A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000TETN96,1,1,4,"I remember hearing ""Crazy"" on the radio all the time, and it was another one of those cases where I hear a great song and then I ask people who that is singing it -- and nobody seems to know. I went to pick up Javier's album to see if there were any more songs like that on there. And the answer is yes.
Javier appears to be caught in the group of overlooked singers, as his self-titled debut is a great album full of light soul songs, with a little bit of blues thrown in here and there. If you want to enjoy some other snap-your-fingers style jams like ""Crazy"", try throwing on ""She Spoke To Me"" or ""Slow Motion"" (the latter kind of reminds me of ""Don't You Forget It"" by Glenn Lewis [another overlooked singer]). Slow songs are also good, as evidenced by my favorite track, ""Biggest Mistake"", which is what you'll do if you don't play this song.
The songwriting is a highlight as well. Never before have I heard such well-crafted stories like the bluesy ""October Sky"" and, although slighty sappy, ""If I Never Get To Heaven"". The former talks about how his girl suddenly changed her ways, while the latter explains what his woman's love means to him. The fact that Javier had written or co-written all the songs himself especially makes these tracks stand out.
Some of the lyrics in ""Beautful U R"" come off a little trite, and ""She'll Never Know"" is kind of confusing, but those aspects can't ruin a great album like this. This album won't be leaving my stereo anytime soon.

A3RV0VQKIM2HSW,B000TETN96,1,1,5,"Javier is a new artist that is being slept on right now. His first single might sound a lil typical but trust me when I say it does nto represent the whole album. On this he has hip-hop, R+B, Jazz, Old school, Neo soul and a lil Salsa/Hip-hop to make a good mix. He really shows how versatile he is on this with the mix of songs on the cd. Now to the cd...whats good?
*Crazy
*Beautiful you are
*Hey Little sister
*Slow motion
*Cant have my heart
*She spoke to me
*In your hands
*October Sky
Overall these songs right here are the cream of the crop but you have to check this out. Im sure most who haven't heard of him will be suprised at the quality of the cd. Strong singing mixed with good songs always makes for good music in my book

A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,B000TE5MJ6,1,1,5,"Richard Marx has this unique ability with his voice and his songwriting to capture these really beautiful human emotions, which certainly wasn't the standard of the rather plastic and superficial music scene of the 1980's. Marx strikes again with ""Endless Summer Nights."" It tells the very intimate story of a summer love that for whatever reason is not going on anymore. We've all had these summer loves that stamp our lives in some way. There's this very real feeling--question really of where did it go? You wake up one morning and its' gone. There's a very proud tradition in this arena, but with cool mournful lyrics and vocal tones, Endless Summer Nights stands away from the others.",

A32I2F2QCTRP8K,B000THG2K6,1,1,5,"Was stuck in Miami in 1982 for several months on business and a long way from home. Became a loyal listener of WAXY 106 (Miami FM Rock and Roll format). This song stuck with me as did seeing ""E.T.""",
ARYVQL4N737A1,B000THHRKA,1,1,5,"This is another great song that gets played a lot on the oldies stations. I would rate this song, as well as the Stampeders ""Sweet City Woman,"" as having a more unique sound than most of the other popular songs from '70s radio. A great sing-along song, a timeless classic!",
A2UNAFWQOWM87B,B000THHRKA,1,1,5,I just had to get this song - it reminds me of my Dad (who has been gone for many years now).  But this song is kind of a description of how my Dad was & I just love it.  Brings back memories for me along with some tears when I listen to it.,
A2PWS2A7QL0EAK,B000THHRKA,1,1,5,A Feel-Good song.  I heard it in the market not long ago and it brought back a flood of memories from when I first listened to it.  Just had to have it again.,

A2Z0JW8EQ2EBIZ,B000THHRKA,1,1,5,I have enjoyed this song since I first heard it after it was first released by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band years ago.  My sister enjoy a it so much that she has yet to return my CD  with that song on it!  It is a tribute to an entertainer and I like songs of that kind as long as I can hear the lyrics without getting my ears so bombarded by rock music that I have have temporarily list my hearing.  I have immensely enjoyed this and other songs by this band.  This should be liked by other fans of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and those who lime either country or country-rock music.,
A3093X1KMWI5MI,B000THGDY6,1,1,5,This is the great music for the c'set le vie and it is the most song I requested in the world,
A20DZX38KRBIT8,9721717150,-1,-1,2,"Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need....well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.",
A1WCU50D5BH98B,9721717150,1,1,4,"I have no real complaints here, other than there's a few tracks I could go without.  I'm not a huge fan of the Bon Scott era songs, BUT the ones I DO like ARE on here: ""TNT"", ""Dirty Deeds"", and ""Highway to Hell"".  A really good mix here.

I really DO like this CD set...although I see no reason for the two discs...just cut a few songs off and make it one CD.

BUY IT!!!!!",
A1RX5ERL0QIZ3U,9721717150,1,1,5,"I have had the DVD for some time now and even burned my own CD's of this show to listen to, simply excellent. I am a big fan of Bon Scott and bet if he saw this he would have approved. Check out the DVD of this one as well. You might just see and hear that over this CD only set. Anyway, if your a hardcore fan or just a fan of Rock n Roll, you'll love this one. This one does NOT disappoint.
Drop by my website at ""JudeMac Forever"" & see what I have been up too sometime.",
A2PJBX24OT9534,9721717150,1,1,5,"It is amazing that 20 years ago, when AC/DC released their last live record, they were considered pretty much a spent force when it came to studio albums. I remember reading a review of ""live"" in Kerrang or Metal Hammer, in which the reviewer who gave ""Live"" 5 out of 5, stated that this was the only time now in AC/DC's career, that he could for see giving the band top marks.
How times have changed, with ""Ball Breaker"", ""Stiff upper lip"" & ""Black Ice"" (admittedly this album is a little hit & miss, but it will do), AC/DC's credibility has gone through the roof, being named checked by everybody as a major influence.
Which is why ""River Plate"" is much more than just a nostalgia concert, which is what you would get if it was The Stones or The Who releasing a new live record.
The new songs slot in well with the classic tracks(although no songs from ""Ball Breaker"", or ""Stiff upper.."", which is a shame) & the crowd are on fire, even doing harmonics, which I've never heard before at an AC/DC gig. The band still gives an energetic performance considering their ripe old age.
Live albums always work better, when there recorded from one venue, instead of a whole tour, constantly fading in & out after each song, losing momentum.  But ""River Plate"" feels like a one off special event, which always makes a live more appearing to listen to. It is interesting that back in the 70's & 80's, rock bands would regularly release a live album every 3-4-studio albums, but ""AC/DC Live"" was one of the last big selling live albums (Thanks Kirk Cobain).
Nowadays it only really Iron Maiden that do live albums, so it a little difficult to judge ""River Plate"" by contemporary standards, but then again AC/DC have never concerned themselves with shifting musical fashions.
The only nit-pick I have, is that it's a shame AC/DC didn't record the gig in a small club, like The Stones have been doing in 2012, perhaps that could be the band  next live venture.",

A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ,9721717150,1,1,5,"Review no. 58. So glad that I finally got around to purchasing a copy of this must-have live AC/DC 'Live At River Plate' 2-CD. As I got lucky and saw AC/DC twice during their most memorable 'Black Ice' 2009-2010 World Tour. Both times had a two-song difference in the set lists - so Angus Young and crew definitely does ~not~ play the same songs at every single gig they do. Didn't bother with the DVD - maybe later. Four tunes off the acclaimed 'Black Ice' CD - the frantic opener ""Rock 'N Roll Train"", ""Big Jack"", title track ""Black Ice"" and ""War Machine"". Can't get enough of those Bon Scott gems - that you might not hear every day - like ""Shot Down In Flames"" and the ass-kicking ""Dog Eat Dog"". Plus all the AC/DC live staples we have come to know [and love] ""Back In Black"", ""Shoot To Thrill"", ""Whole Lotta Rose"" (complete with giant inflatable blow-up woman), one of my all-time favorites ""Let There Be Rock"" and the grand finale ""For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)"". Comes with a handy CD booklet with full color photos. Essential.",
A1GY1HIA0XKF2G,9721717150,1,1,5,"Fantastic live album, one of the best ever. Angus does a fantastic job and plays exactly like the studio. Brian has lost a bit in his voice but does a great job. ""Gracias! That's all the Spanish we know.""",
A2NEMGBFLAFR7I,9721717150,1,1,5,"This is AC/DC's better album collections, it provides the earlier music along with the most modern/current releases. I love this album and I will never get tired of listening to it.",
A10613AZVJSR1F,9721717150,1,1,5,Very good live CD by AC / DC. Would recommend any AC / DC fan to buy. Will enjoy listening.,
ANJ8X1J5DVNMW,9721717150,1,1,5,"when you hear of ac dc , is only rock n roll to me, best live album yet, for acdc .................",
A1K0DL0KWRCQTJ,9721717150,1,1,5,"Not necessarily a fan of live CDs/albums but for fans of the band AC/DC this is a must have !  Some bands are recording artists, pure and simple. This CD proves that AC/DC have been and always will be, live rock legends !
Rock on, Skip Wieland",
ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,9721717150,1,1,4,"I'll start right off the bat and say AC/DC Live Special Edition released in 1991 is my all time favorite AC/DC album, live or recorded, so of coarse this one here was not going to stand a chance of being the perfect 5 star album from AC/DC, but I still give it a 4 star rating. Like many AC/DC fans who collect bootlegs from the band, or have rare live tracks in our collections, it's going to be hard for AC/DC to top a lot of the #1 fav live versions between 1974 and present. But this album is still great for us collectors, even those who have heard these same set-lists a million times before, with a few of the new songs thrown in the mix, but this album has a lively crowed that may not speak English too well, but they do know how to scream and humm along to the tunes, making them unique crowed interaction versions of AC/DC's classics preformed at River Plate in 2009/10?

I won't bore you and compare things like ""TNT"" just doesn't sound as good as the live version from 198somethign that was eventually included on ""Backtracks"" etc.. but I will say AC/DC have still got what it takes to rock your socks off as much as they did a 100 years ago. Kicking off with a great live recording of the new track ""Rock N Roll Train"" and into a classic blazing version of ""Hell aint a bad place to be"" and then onto what is possibly there biggest hit to date, ""Back In Black"" and so forth.

Some reviewers here said if you have heard AC/DC's previous set lists before, then you have heard it all and they are boring. Well, you will miss out on great new live tracks such as ""Rock N Roll Train"", ""Big Jack"", ""War Machine"" and ""Black Ice"", even tho most of us fans really wished they had preformed other tracks from the Black Ice album like 'spoilin' for a fight' and ""she likes rock n roll""... and then there is the typical songs of coarse... but what those guys saying it's all been the same, it surprises me AC/DC didn't take the chance to finally get an official live album version of ""Rock N Roll aint Noise Pollution"" down. What really would have been nice would have been a bonus track of ""High Voltage"" included that AC/DC subbed in during the Australian and New Zealand tour by popular demand. Just like they included ""Hell aint a bad place to be"" only on the Japan special edition of Live (1991). Oh well, what can you do?

Something else that makes this album different to other ones is that this whole tour, AC/DC tuned the guitars downwards a step, giving the songs a new spark of life in a same old song, but with a slightly different sound to what you have always heard. It also seems like Brian Johnson speaks his words more clearly, not sure what, maybe he was schooled on it or the effect of living in American now has rubbed off, but you can clearly understand every word he says and is singing, and there is no question by anyone like ""WTF is he saying?"" not that I ever had trouble understanding him. A few songs spark a little new life to by the way Johnsons sings them, it seems he speaks the words clear and propperlly, and doesn't sing them in a slang term cutting off the g from 'ing' words etc.. I dunno if you care about this or not, but I found it pretty interesting to compare what Brian is doing with the songs now compared to 20-30 years ago. Never diss the man, he is the silent rock n roll god at the top that some people slam as not being Bon Scott, but get over it guys, Bon is gone, and Brian has done a great job keeping AC/DC at #1 for all these years... compare him to Bon if you want, but Brian had been in the band longer, has not disgraced himself, kept Bons memory alive, and despite what you say, he's a rock n roll god who even on those so called ""bad ac/dc albums"" (not that I think they're bad at all) those songs are still better than most other groups greatest hits, so lay off Brian, understand he is the singer now, and STOP comparing him to Bon Scott. Bon was great, sure, Brian is different, but he is too great in other ways and deserves more respect then people always showing up on AC/DC's latest releases and saying ""Bon this, Bon that, Bon would've""... don't you think Bon is looking down on Brian and smiling at what a fantastic job Brian has done since Bon passed away? If there is an afterlife, both Bon and Brian will remain with the band, because I am convinced Bon would not say ""thanks for takin over, but i'll take it from here"" no, you would have two legends in the drivers seats!

A9WFV9DEWY4S0,B000TPHAJA,1,1,4,"I was always sneaking into the older Teen parties just because I wanted to hear what music they liked.  Growing up in SLC there were not any soul stations so 45 records were all we had.  I had a best friend who had all the latest music all the time so I was privy to all of the best music.

Eugene Wilde's Gotta Get You Home Tonight was in every young person's mind when it came time to getting home before your curfew..  It was easy to dance to and me and my friends made many dance routines from the rhythms of this music.  You did not always have a boy who was willing to dance because they were too shy so me and my girl friends just took to the dance floor and partied without them.  Great memory.",
A1AJ1L51PLRUMJ,B000TPHAJA,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite old time oldies.  I think if it was released today it would be a hit all over again.,
A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000TPHM5C,1,1,5,There are certain pieces of music that touch my soul and this was one of them.  I used to get depressed at times very severely depressed.  I found that listening to music I like at calming times of the day prevents my depression.  This is a very upbeat song about a man's reaction to a very fine lady.  This woman must be awesome because if you listen to his story this woman has his nose wide open to use slang popular in my day.  Simply Irresistible has awesome lyrics that tell an interestingly funny story to an upbeat solid beat.  For a mere $.99 the payoff in joy made this a prenium investment better than any anti-deoression medicine known to man.,
A218THF45IKWKH,B000TPHM5C,1,1,5,"I'm not a huge 80's fan or anything, but I do think the 80's was probably the last decade to have a lot of good music. This song is great in it's own right, but I think it also is a pretty good representation of 80's music in general (sure, there were exceptions, but it wasn't the standard). It has a catchy beat with good lyrics that convey a message you can relate to and doesn't have to stoop to vulgarity like so much of today's pop music. You could appreciate a woman's beauty without over sexualizing it. Be warned, if you listen to it you are likely to have it stuck in your head for awhile!",
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TPHM5C,1,1,5,"""Simply Irresistible"" is a great feel good type of musical track that is my overall favorite by Robert Palmer. In ""Simply Irresistible"" Robert sings a great tune on how a woman that use to just look good to him has gotten even more beautiful and appealing to him over the years. I love it when he sings the lyrics ""she is anything but typical"", and the lyrics ""she's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force"". I personally have learned ways to increase my self-love, and listening to this song is one of the ways I love to do this. I say this because listening to this song helps serve as a fun reminder on why it is important to see the beauty inside of yourself regardless of what is reflected in the outside world. Hearing this song serves as a playful reminder to always work on feeling good from within. ""Simply Irresistible"" is a great song that is like fine wine that gets better with time (just like his other track ""Addicted to Love""). You are going to love listening to this song if you enjoy Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" musical track and/or classic rock and 80's music.",

This is the only one I really like but I think the remaster is the best version.  You should find them on the internet to determine which version is for you before purchasing.

And how amazing is it that they thought to write a song about justifying infidelity.  I had no idea for decades until recently - something so hurtful is delivered so prettily and then the comeback by the female counterpart.  It's a song that give so much pleasure in a soothing, relaxing sweet way and the message of two-sided infidelity and self-excusing is something lethal that probably flies right over most people's heads hence its success.

I mean this is a song to make babies gurgle with pleasure and tweens beam after all.

A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000TPJ5FM,1,1,5,"Bobby Lewis's ""Tossin' and Turnin'"" has to be one of the greatest early sixties classics.  An essential addition to anyone's oldies' collection, the song is addictive for its throbbing interplay of guitar and bass and Lewis's spirited vocals which are infectiously backed up by formidable female singers.  While many understandably vote for Chubby Checker's ""The Twist,"" ""Tossin' and Turnin'"" gets my vote for ""Twistin' the Night Away"".",

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000TRVDQY,1,1,4,"A group I never heard of until I heard this song; and what a great song it is. I liked this song because it's not the tpical 70's song, this has more of an 80's beat to it. It's fast and it's explicit in a way, it kinda tells a story of a fast girl, but in a different way. I love the way it can get you to start sing the lyrics; and yes I have caught myself doing it. If you like those classic songs this is for you and for anyone who is willing to listen to anything differnt.

A18758S1PUYIDT,B000TRVDQY,1,1,5,"I have been going through a nostalgic phase lately, particularly in regard to the music of the 1970s.  And would you believe that I heard this song for the first time in many years in a hotel in Laughlin, where the median age of the travelers is 75 and it's not even their kind of music?  Hilarious, I know.

This took me back all right, back to the days of goofy synthesizers, very few lyrics or incomprehensible ones at best, and an undeniably catchy beat.

I would love to play this song at a party and see how many of my peers remember it.",

A11F8B8GQURI84,B000TRTMNU,1,1,5,"This song tells a story about Billie Joe McAllister jumping of the Tallahatchie Bridge and how the town of Choctaw reacted to that suicide. I honestly do not know if this is a True story, but Bobbie Gentry makes it sound as if it is a True story. This is the only hit by her that I know of and I still like it. The story is sad, though, and I have no idea what she and  Billie Joe McAllister threw off the Tallahatchie Bridge or why Billie Joe jumped. Maybe I missed part of the story.

A1JMR6MVOIC38K,B000UH5VNO,1,1,5,"As I write this review, I am listening to a CD-R I had made of my album, which I've owned since the late 1970s.  It sounds great. I bought this album for 99 cents at a Korvettes store.

This is one of Cher's signature albums as an artist, as opposed to entertainer.  Believe me, I make no hierarchal distinctions between artist and entertainer -- both are needed in society.  Cher, the entertainer, has brought me so much pleasure since I was a kid.  Cher, the artist, when singing a song like ""These Days,"" or ""Love Hurts,"" bares her soul.

What I find curious, still, is that even after Cher returned to Warner Brothers in the late '90s for the biggest album of her career, that her four Warner Brothers albums from the 1970s (including ""Two The Hard Way"" with Gregg Allman) remained unavailable.  In my ""man on the street"" opinion, these albums would have sold quite well if released after ""Believe"" became a blockbuster.  Also, let's not forget the two songs Cher recorded with Phil Spector after her split with Sonny, and her duet with Nilsson, released on Spector/WB Records.

""Please don't confront me with my failures, I've not forgotten them...""",
A1HBI9BBQIG1NH,B000UH5VNO,1,1,4,"Cher is a celebrated actress,singer etc.
Back in the 70's she was trying to expell her character gypsy songs-and forage a serious career. She was in somewhat of a dilemma considering her loss of a private life-a public life paired with a clothes horse reputation. It was a long shot to imagine musical crtics to come to her side.
This 1975 lp showcases her voice with Jimmy Webbs' lush orchestrations.
The best song here is the wailing ""Just this one time"",an under-rated gem,
that shows Cher at her most expressive. The last sentence in the song soars to a heighth never heard from the vocalist previously. ""Love Enough"" comes in 2nd with it's similar fully sung treatment.
The lp has several rockers,covers of the rock roster of the day-Clapton,Jackson Brown,Neil Young.
.Cher is best on the unfamilliar songs.
But like all her 70's warner cuts this lp is lost to those without a record player. It's an interesting and curious effort from the pop icon of her generation. She is one shot away from a home run.""Stars"" is a bit short on being completely an artistic statement.
Cher is a wiser singer today,and would probably sing this material even better 30 years later! Cher has a unique voice, and all her lps have some merit,(though Prisoner and Cherished have very little credibility)this one more than most because of her emotional commitment to the music.",
A1RUU0TEW8JRDC,B000UH5VNO,1,1,5,"""STARS ""  album  by CHER was released in 1975 her first release for Warner Brothers is here as a CD. I think the problem why this CD
was not successful was because Cher was coming off her TV show and her MCA recordings. For this CD  Cher sings 9 songs  penned by 9
male songwriter's and 1 by  female songwriter Janis Ian ( Stars)  the  album was  produced by Jimmy Webb. This album is  recorded, produced,
and sung by Cher  just  beautifully. Her version of ""These  Days"" by Jackson Browne is amazing. Every song on this CD fits perfectly.
This is Cher as a mature, serious singer with  the ability to do these songs as they should be. ""Just this one time"" is the best thing
Cher has ever recorded the range of her singing this song is down right perfection.  We all  know  Cher  is a great actress and i think
 this comes out in her singing this songs with such emotion and feeling. If you read the reviews you will see all Cher's fans love this
CD. We need Cher to do a complete album with songs recorded where great song  writer's give her the chance to sing the songs
her way.  The  dance able  releases by Cher were great for it's time but now Cher let's get back to a great rock, ballad release.  .",

A14FP7F9Q4Z6XV,B000ULCSAY,1,1,5,"One of the best rock songs ever written.  The beginning is monumental.  The body of the song is extremely moving.  The end of the song leaves you wanting more, which is exactly what I want from a great song.  The final chords of the song pound out a rhythm that leaves you breathlessly waiting for more.  So you hit repeat and do it all again.  Got to love it.",

It's funny because every time I give my bunny a bath, I always sing it to her, and she has a rubber duckies that makes that sound. It was so great to see it on the list of free songs Amazon was offering, and I played the sample, got nod of approval, downloaded, and STOMP! I got the ""Where is my tubby""? look, and the rest, as they say, is history. I think Mosie (my bunny), is one of the few small pets who loves a tubby, as it's always a fight to get her out. She used to just sit in tub watching TV, and I would sing while washing her. Now, I play this and have to have duck ready to squeeze along with song, and it was fascinating to watch her make the connection between words & sounds in song, and her tubby and duck! Yes, I do catch myself singing it around the house, but it is really for Mosie, and it's amazing how much she connects to certain songs, and the different versions. Definitely glad I got this!!!",

A3DPACNQCR3720,B000URYSW4,1,1,5,"Drove the old man crazy riding in the van in the early 70's.  I'm partial to Zappa's' early work with the MOI.  This collects all the best of the Verve output at the time.  Freak Out, We're only in it for the money and Absolutely Free, each a journey unto themselves.  Frank had to do a bit of tweaking to make this flow.  Before this came out, I 'made' a copy from the said 3 CD's for a friend of mine who only had it on vinyl and doesn't have a vinyl disc player.  Some parts were rocky, but it sufficed.
So, if you're new to FZ or just want a primer to his early work, get this, then you'll wind up buying  the 3 above mentioned CD's....you're welcome!",
A1DDRX0OKKN5TK,B000UWR1AU,1,1,5,I learned this song in school and it was the go to song during rainstorms.  It was often on the radio and quite cheerful.  Recommend to those who let the rain bring them down (this will give you a different perspective) and to those who want a cheerful song.,

AQL13WF76ZQQJ,B000V2GWJK,1,1,5,"Its Christmas time once again and all the Christmas music is playing on the radio, in the stores and at home. The tradional Christmas music is fun, heart warming. A couple of weeks ago I heard the song A Baby Changes Everything by Faith Hill, introduced by a friend. That song put a whole sense of feeling about life. Though it is about baby Jesus, but it touched my life about a baby that was born 23 years ago to me. The baby changed everything in my life. When I first heard it I was crying. Tonight Jamie who sings at the Hard Rock Lobby Bar in Tampa sang a song called  Grown -up Christmas List- I honestly have never heard this song before and I simply started crying, tears were flowing. Though it has been recorded by such very talented artist as Amy Grant, Kelly Clarkson, Natalie Cole- David Foster, Clay Aiken and Michael Buble. I have always had people in my life, a friend, my family, people who I meet. As I was crying the shock of reality came over me when I realized their are people in this world who do not have family, a friend, neighbor to talk to.

These are the people who are HOMELESS. I am a person who loves to give than  recieve, but when its time to see Santa you bet that I will wish for a new friend for Christmas and it will be on the top of my list.

This world is scary these days with everyone fighting, struggling during these hard times, jobless, finacial difficulty and no peace in the world.

To all of you: May you have a wonderful Holiday
Love, Roberta",

AUWU2GNZON784,B000V61688,1,1,4,Great song poking fun at celebirty. Mac Davis pokes fun at the dangers of celebrity and how it can quickly go to one's head. Luckily he stayed grounded enough to write this great and entertaining satire. Had me laughing the whole way thru.,

I hope to find more on here. I will download them as time permits.",
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000V617LO,1,1,4,"And very country.

I'm a fan of simple songs but there is not a country song by a male singer that I recall liking.

I guess this is the first. I'm not sure.

Not that it matters much, but I'm sure he's a Christian, speaking of ""Me and God"". Many country singers tend to be.

It's very simple and he even rhymes, ""Two peas in a pod"" with ""Me and God"", which could be considered a huge misstep.

But it was his reluctance to back down; a strong refusal to call God just a good friend, but his BEST. None other could get between the two, the sincerity he displayed in his words was what got me to stay and listen.

If my mom wasn't sleeping she might have looked at me a bit funny. But this song commanded my attention.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000V61B4M,1,1,5,"There is honestly a difference between a singer, and being a product. Unfortunately for divas these days like Rihanna and Beyonce', they have chosen to overexpose themselves and choose to be products, not people, and sadly the songs have became so overplayed, their voices have slowly passed away. For other divas, like Vanessa Williams, whom has been very sophisticated at the soul, and very True to her own heart, and strong at the voice, her songs have remained so timeless. Nearly 30 years after Vanessa Williams broke from scandal and heartbreak, after the Miss America Pageant, she found her own voice again through music and acting, and made herself a  worldwide staple as a diva that has never gone out of style. One of my favorite songs, her staple Saved The Best For Last, is actually one of those songs that has sincerely gotten much better with age, and the soulful melody aligned. I adore this song each time I hear it, and if you have never heard a Vanessa Williams song before, than I recommend you download this beauty.

I was into really hard rock and metal at the time and the group I hung with was very opinionated as to what qualified as a True ""hard core"" band. But secretly, I really liked it! The many years have passed, all those ""hard core"" bands AND my peers that were so quick to judge, well, EVERYTHING, are now a bunch of has been's or losers. Now, every time I hear the song I like it a little bit more. Especially accompanying the Young Guns movies. The songs were just SO made for those vids. Now I have them on my MP3 mix. Bon Jovi has stood the test of time.",

It's also nice on a nippy evening when it's just a bit to chilly, but you sit on the porch anyhow...because Skynard is plying you with alternating rhythms and sweeping chords, managing to make a twang sound sweet. That hypnotic sound holds you in place...and you really didn't want to move anyhow, so it's a win-win situation.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.",

Seriously though, it's on my music device, and the device is set on shuffle, but somehow out of 300 plus, songs, Free Bird manages to play sometime every day. And when we gather around the table, we all grasp each other's hands and we are thankful for America. We are thankful for, Mom, Baseball, Football, NASCAR,and Apple pie.

A1L1VZ854S2FB2,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5,"While basking with the success of the duet classic Jazz Samba, Stan Getz
  scored another blockbuster hit with this duet masterpiece which he made with
  Joao Gilberto in 1963 that became one of Bossa Nova's greatest moments as
  well as Getz' crowning achievement.  Hailed as one of the biggest-selling jazz
  albums of all time, Getz/Gilberto had bought two of the Bossa Nova's greatest
  innovators: guitarist- vocalist Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim, to New
  York City for the making of the wonderful recording as the album resulted with
  pure magic.  Starting with the international hit single The Girl From Impanema,
  the lyrical track set features solid hits, including Corcavado, So Danco Samba,
  O Grande Amore, a new version of Desfinado and Vivo Sonhando, which they
  performed with such unassailable beauty.  Astrud Gilberto, who had made her
  cameo appearance on the session, said that her husband Joao informed Getz
  that she ""could sing on the recording"", while producer Creed Taylor recall that
  it took Getz' wife Monica to bring both Astrud and Joao Gilberto into recording
  studio (Mrs. Getz had the sense that Astrud could make a hit while he himself
  insisted on Astrud's presence).  Highlighted by plenty of uncanny material it is
  no wonder that the album was a colossal success, as the musicians performs
  with effortless grace and honour, which even gave this crowning achievement
  it's universal immortality as Getz and Jobim pulled off the harmonic perfection
  in a relaxed charm of it's own.  As the part of the Verve Master Edition Series,
  Getz/Gilberto will certainly ring out even more brighter as a timeless landmark
  from jazz history in greater form.",

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5,"This 1963 album is one of the best examples of flawless bossa nova music to date. Stan Getz playing the saxophone, Joao Gilberto on guitar and Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano blend simultaneously into a uniquely talented trio of musicians as their hearts and minds create one exquisite song after another.

As another reviewer correctly notes, most of the songs on this CD were written by Antonio Carlos Jobim. He remains one of the most gifted musicians and composers to this day. I also especially liked Astrud Gilberto's singing in ""The Girl From Ipanema"" and ""Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars)."" Yes, Astrud sometimes sang flat; but it is no matter here. It works beautifully to have her singing along with the music.

Another plus about this CD is the addition of two tracks that were not available on the original LP release: the 45 rpm issues of ""The Girl From Ipanema"" and ""Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars.)"" I really liked comparing the shorter 45 rpm versions to the original, longer versions of both songs.

The sound quality was very good but not quite perfect. There is a slight hissing in the background especially when I hear the saxophone being played solo by Getz. I looked in the liner notes and they do mention that there was some ""tape delamination"" on track five (""Corcovado"") and that ""some of the master takes have been faded longer or later than they were on the original LP issue."" I wonder if this had anything to do with what I heard. In addition, the liner notes also offer a great essay by Doug Ramsey as well as the original liner notes for the LP. There are beautiful photos of Getz, Gilberto and Astrud.

This is a wonderful album to relax with or to play while you entertain company for dinner. The experience is sophisticated stylishness! The fact that most of the lyrics are in Portuguese is not a concern for those who do not understand the language; the music is so beautiful and the lyrics are so poetic anyway that the overall listening experience is memorable. Not only is this music timeless, it is so well performed with each and every subtle nuance that it possesses a universal appeal decades after its' release.

Highly recommended for bossa nova fans, fans of great Latin music and people who crave international music.",
A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B000V63C4Y,1,1,4,"This mini-lp sleeve version of this Jazz classic is the best version that's out there at the moment.  The remastering job is quite good and so the sound quality is decent.  We also get both the English and Japanese lyrics thrown in as an insert.  The cardboard packaging which is a replica of the original vinyl sleeve is also a work of art.  While the strength of ""Girl From Ipanema"" alone would carry this album, we also get ""So Danco Samba"" and a version of ""Desafinado"" here which is good but not as great as the brilliant version with that unforgetable Getz solo on the ""Jazz Samba"" album which although not as commercially successful as this album, is still overall the stronger album.  Still, there is no denying the great impact this album has had on jazz and on bringing the whole samba genre onto the world map that this is still essential listening for fans of jazz and indeed for any fan of music in general.  Recommended.",
A8IFUOL8S9BZC,B000V63C4Y,1,1,4,"This essential bossa nova  masterwork everyone agrees on in a historical context does miss perfection. Despite the commanding songwriting and singing, this newfound vocabulary of sexy chord changes does slightly replay itself throughout the short disc making for parallel melodies throughout, along with the sumptuous, at times slightly awkward vocal phrasings. This is not to negate the fact that this album is a complete triumph of aesthetics, overpowering any specific gripes with it's liquid smooth tranquility.",

A2VOVZMI83Y7L6,B000V64KJU,1,1,4,"A good song from the LS songbook.  Like the subject matter and the tongue in cheek lyric line.  Guys, we can all relate to this situation.",
A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5,"I'm sorry, friends, after twenty years of listening, buying hundreds of CD's and an improved stereo I now know CD's don't have enough bits. They don't capture all the sound that was in the original vinyl recordings. 44k and 2 to the 14th power was NOT enough samples (bits). Like looking at an old newspaper picture made out of large dots, it's not like a photo. Like a primitive digital print without enough pixels. Poor resolution.

With 4 times as many time slices (increments) in the x direction and 2 to the 8th power, 256 more bits (increments) in the Y direction, this SACD is the only format which really captures the sound of the original LP or master tape. You cannot hear the difference between this and the LP. It's the real thing.

If you thought CD's sound harsh, or bass-thin, not like a concert, well, you were right!

Beyond that, this album is the second best selling Jazz album of all time, behind Miles Davis ""Kind of Blue"". A timeless classic of the early sixties. ""The Girl From Ipanema"" was in the top ten songs on the Rock, Pop and Jazz Billboard charts for over a year in the '63-'64 time frame.

Yeah it's really that good!

 Hear Stan the Man effortlessly pour out his soul in the bridge of ""Corcovado"", for example. As a personal note, this was the first Jazz LP I ever bought, as a clarinet and sax player myself, I couldn't believe how good Stan Getz tone was. And I still love it.",

A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5,"The 1964 winner for Best Album was this mellow but spright cool jazz album that pushed Latin bossa nova and samba rhythms on the map.  With a lineup that included Joao Gilberto on guitar and vocals, Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano, Tommy Williams on bass, Milton Banana on drums, and on the two most memorable songs, Joao's wife Astrud.  However, the driving force behind this was tenor saxophonist Stan Getz, and his straight-tone, controlled-vibrato sound.
The album starts appropriately enough with the Grammy winner for best song, ""The Girl From Ipanema"".  This is the full 5:22 version that begins with Joao Gilberto singing in Portuguese.  Then comes that soft voice and those familiar lyrics:  ""Tall and tan and young and lonely/The girl from Ipanema goes walking/And when she passes/Each one she passes goes haaa.""  Well, the thing that makes me go ""haaa"" here is Astrud Gilberto's voice.  Getz's sax solo and Jobim's piano in the middle serves as a bridge between the two refrains.  There is a 45 rpm version of this classic, the 2:46 single edit of just Astrud singing, included later.  I must confess that I first heard a parody of this song, Bob River's ""The Girl With Emphysema"", and then sought hard to find out the original version, which led me to this album.
""Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)"" is the other song featuring Astrud Gilberto.  In the full 4:14 version, we have Joao doing Portuguese lyrics, as he did in the full version of ""Ipanema.""  There is a dreamy quality about this song, particularly when Astrud sings ""Quiet nights and quiet dreams/Quiet walks by quiet streams/And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea how lovely.""  And Getz's sax really enhances that exoticness as does Jobim's piano.  BTW, Corcovado is the name of a mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro.  There is a 2:21 45 rpm issue included here as well.
As for the rest of the songs, Getz's rich saxophone provides the rich qualities that make this a winner, particularly his solo on ""So Danso Samba"" with its ""vai vai vai vai vai"" refrain by Joao Gilberto.  The song title means ""I Only Dance Samba"", as opposed to calypso, the twist, and the cha-cha that were sweeping the country's dance floors in the 1960's.  And Joao Gilberto's soft vocals complement the soft qualities of the other instrumentalists.  Only complaint:  Astrud should've been featured on more songs.",
A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5,"These songs knocked everyone off their feet when they debuted at what seemed to be the end of the Bossa Nova craze --in the cool-post-Beatnik 60's cocktail era. But actually, in Brazil, the Bossa Nova fever never did quite cool off and in '72, when I was visiting family there, this album was still trotted out proudly at every gathering.
Not only is this album a great party CD for ""retro"" parties, relaxed evenings or just sitting at home and relaxing, but it introduces you to the greats of Brazilian music. Oh, there is a whole lot more great Brazilian music than just this, but this album is surely the place to start.  (By the way, if you have insomnia, this can be quite soothing. Lie back on that imaginary beach in Rio and float away on Gilberto's soft voice. Mmmmmmm....)",
A2BO41VARYGTAC,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5,"What else can I add about such a wonderful album? I have never before heard such relaxing, gorgeous music. Nothing is forced, everything just flows along so naturally. This was my first introduction to Bossa Nova and Brazilian music in general. And I adore it. Joao's voice is to die for, and the wonderfully controlled, relaxed playing of Stan Getz is terrific. Add to that the rythmn section of Jobim on piano, Milton Banana on drums and Tommy Williams on bass, and you have an album that will go down in history, and will never wear thin. And of course I mustn't forget to mention the pretty voice of Astrud. I wish and hope that everyone will have the chance to listen to this album at least once in their life, but of course, once you have you will want to hear it always. A must have!!",
A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5,"My all-time favorite jazz recording. 10 stars!! The best introduction to jazz, Cool Jazz, Samba, and Bossa Nova. Stan Getz makes each note sound beautiful, and three-dimensional, as if it were sculpted in blue velvet fog. Stan sounds less as if he was playing the sax than breathing the notes out from his soul. His contemporaries called him ""The Sound"".
Joao Gilberto sings and wife Astrud sings with a rather small voice. Intimate and romantic. For more Stan and less singing, ""Jazz Samba"" is similar but all instrumental.
Technical note: The recorded this record at 30ips tape speed when the industry standard was 15ips. Spectacularly well recorded, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday, not 35 years ago, on the new VERVE 20 bit version ONLY. Try listening on a Single Ended Triode Amp for the ultimate!",

A3FQ9WYUHG9CD,B000V64SZG,1,1,5,"Here's rock 'n' roll for you. An Irish band formed in Dublin and fronted by an Irish black man in
shiny leather pants. The members of the band also spanned the Irish Catholic and Protestant
communities. Quite something for 1969.

The song ""Jailbreak"", was an international hit, along with ""The Boys Are Back In Town"". These
songs are rotated regularly on hard rock and classic radio stations today and for good reason.

""Jailbreak"", features, like a lot of other of Thin Lizzy's songs, twin lead guitars. Superb guitar
work from both guitarists and a signature of the band giving Thin Lizzy a distinctive edge over
other bands. ""Jailbreak"" was on the album by the same name, and was their sixth release.

""Jailbreak"" lyrics speak for themselves. Working class sentimentality and total brazenness is
how this song will speak to you. This was another element of the the band's personality. There
is no doubt that when you hear that opening chord and subsequent riff you are hearing some
cool rockin' and rollin'.  The lyric riff is rather staccato and helps provide an immediate tension
within the song.

The release comes from the repetitive refrain, ""The boys are back in town"", as it is more fluid
and harmonic. There is a nice back and forth motion between the lyrics and the refrain each
time. The guitar fills and single leads are done perfectly as they accent each set of lyrics and
help transition from the refrain back to the lyric. This is a nicely written song.

Listening to this song always makes me want to learn it. It is also the kind of song that inspires
people to pick up the guitar or at the least play air guitar. Sustain. Great tone. Twin leads.
Cool lyrics. All make for a classic song that belongs on your turntable, or CD player, or whatever.

Put ""Jailbreak"" into your rotation and take a listen. Go ahead, break out now...",

A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000V63C7G,1,1,5,"The posthumous DECCA label LP, PATSY CLINE 12 GREATEST HITS was the #1 best-selling country music album until the 1990s.

All tracks are AAD stereo dubs, including ""Walkin' After Midnight,"" a remake of her 1957 hit. The six panel insert provides a bio, editorial, chronology, Cline MCA album catalog and complete session personnel for all tracks.

Patsy not only was the first woman to ever ""close"" various artist concerts and Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, she was also one of the earliest country stars to cross over into mainstream pop. With classy touches of strings, echo and backing vocals by the Jordanaires (and others), these dozen Owen Bradley produced sides stand the test of time. The music of Pasty Cline will simply never go out of style! Highest recommendation.

PROGRAM--

[2:01] Walkin' After Midnight

A1DH42FV47N8L,B000V63C7G,1,1,5,"I was first intoduced to Ms. Cline by an old girlfriend, Karen.  She used to love to sing ""Crazy.""

  Although she could do it serious justice, when I heard Patsy embrace that song, I was blown away!

  That's why I bought this CD...I needed more.

  ""Walking After Midnight"" is a classic.  You feel like you are there with her as she croons desperately about her guy.  ""I Fall To Pieces"", ""She's Got You"", ""Back In Baby's Arms""... Heck this entire collection is a must have.

  Country fan or not, this CD belongs in any music lover's collection.

  Karen died a few years ago of a brain tumor, but I can believe she's up in heaven singing ""Crazy"" with Patsy.",

A2MVZS39F3XKH3,B000V63C7G,1,1,5,"If you want the basics as it concerns Patsy Cline, the big hits are all here in glorious sound in songs for the most part written by prolific country writers, sung with heart and emotion and orchestrated in a way that thrills.  I remember the day Patsy died in that crash (country great Jim Reeves met the same fate the following year).  There has always been a sense of loss but she laid down some great tracks before she died. The best of them are right here for your purchase and pleasure.  You can take that to the bank. For a lengthier selection, try ""Definitive Collection"".",
AADJXNY9HSKJF,B000V63C7G,1,1,5,"I remember being a little kid *granted this wasn't too long ago* and my parents having a Patsy Cline tape they used to listen to in the car. I fell in love with Patsy's voice and her gorgeous songs. Now, I've never been a country fan, but Patsy is the one big exception. There is no genre to her voice. It's practically perfection. I rank her right up there with powerhouses such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. This CD offers some of her best material. Of course, most notably ""Crazy."" Everyone knows it. Also, ""I Fall To Pieces"" *my personal favorite*, ""Sweet Dreams of You"", and ""Strange."" Another stand-out has to be ""She's Got You."" It's a gorgeous ballad and perhaps one of Patsy's most memorable songs. This is a must buy for any music fan. Patsy Cline is truly timeless.",
AHUT55E980RDR,B000V63C7G,1,1,5,"Twenty six reviews, all five stars!  And I'll make it Twenty seven!  Patsy Cline is one of the all time greats, with the ability to express a voice that came from deep within, from her heart, from her soul.  She still lives today through the legacy of her recordings and also through her influence on so many country ladies including Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire, LeeAnne Womack, k.d. lang, Mandy Barnett, and Sara Evans.
But don't forget the others on these performances who contributed so much.  There are the Jordonaires (who called her a female Elvis?...well, she did have the vocal group backing her who backed many of Elvis' greatest hits) on all of the cuts; Harold Bradley's electric bass also on all of these performances; Floyd Cramer's piano on ""Walkin' After Midnight"", ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Crazy"", ""So Wrong"", ""Strange"", ""She's Got You"", and ""Faded Love""; Walter Haines' steel guitar on ""Walkin' After Midnight"", ""Crazy"", ""Strange"", ""She's Got You"", and ""You're Stronger Than Me"".  And then there are the writers of the songs that she breathed life and emotion into:  Hank Cochran's ""I Fall to Pieces"", ""She's Got You"", ""Why Can't He Be You"", and ""You're Stronger Than Me,""; Don Gibson's ""Sweet Dreams""; Willie Nelson's ""Crazy""; Carl Perkins' ""So Wrong""; Mel Tillis' ""Strange""; Bob Wills' ""Faded Love.""
All these talents together, backing a great voice of our times, have contributed one of music's greatest treasures to us, and we should be grateful to all those I mentioned and those I haven't.",
A1906RZITWT2K2,B000V63C7G,1,1,5,"This may be the best Greatest Hits/Best Of compilation ever. Cline knew how to sing a tune, and she knew how to make singles that grab you by your collar and don't let you get away.
These are songs you hear off a juke box in a diner at 2 a.m. and you suddenly understand. A cigarette, a cup of coffee, maybe some fries with brown gravy, and ""She's Got You."" It's something you can't recreate.
And what a voice. I've heard, in recent years, people calling Wynonna Judd ""the female Elvis."" Wynonna does have a magnificent voice, but talk about having no memory--Patsy Cline was as close as there's ever been to a female Elvis. She was masterful.",
A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B000V63C7G,1,1,5,"This essential country music album is a triumph for all who participated in its success:  producer Owen Bradley (whose lush, tasteful written strings pour sorrow on ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Why Can't He Be  You"") pianist Floyd Cramer and a first-class Nashville session band  (whose piano introductions to ""Crazy,"" ""She's Got You,""  and ""I Fall To Pieces"" are among the most treasured in music),  and, of course, Patsy Cline herself.
Many have attempted to copy Patsy  Cline's vocal range or stylistic ticks; Reba McEntire, k.d. lang and Mandy  Barnett being only among the more successful. But something about ballads  brought out the pain and emotional desolation in Cline's voice that few  C&W singers then or now could match. Listen to her sing the rather  trite line ""I've been so wrong for so long,"" and hear the sorrow,  anger and regret scribbled into her delivery. Hear her line, ""You  don't love me, it's plain,"" and tears nearly well up as if you're  hearing this with her for the first time. Compare her reading of the line,  ""I've got your memory, or has it got me?"" with Jimmy Buffett's  sloppy, careless version on ""Fruitcakes,"" and you'll see who is  the better musical caretaker.
Nearly every song on the LP fits that  model, as Cline and her stellar support keep the spirit, if not letter, of  what country music is and should be to its fans. Everyone who enjoys  country music or female singers in general should own a copy of this album.",

ACPPRYMDKYFSH,B000V64LIA,1,1,5,"This is a fairly laid back song which focuses less on talent with an instrument, though Ryan Tedder plays the piano quite well, and more on showcasing the vocal talents of Tedder himself. As to Timbaland's role, he helped this song gain popularity by remixing the original OneRepublic song with a fantastic beat and providing some background vocal support. Timbaland also added his own notoriety to help push OneRepublic's song into the limelight be re-releasing the song as a remix on his own album.",

A39O0G68QQZ126,B000V6577O,1,1,5,One more time Sugarland has done it again. I am a late comer to their music and I recommend all of their albums with this one at the top.,
A1O7Q969VFF8QA,B000V6577O,1,1,5,"First off, I don't really like Kristen Hall. But Jennifer and Kristian i love yet! This cd is full of talent and awesome songwriting. I dont't really like Jen's vocals but the songs are amazing. I have to admit, when I first heard this album, I didn't really like it. I wasn't sure what to expect. But that's what has happened with all of their albums. I love ""Fly Away."" It's my favorite! The ratings are below:
1. Something More- 4/5 Great song, True lyrics. What more can I say?
2. Baby Girl- 5/5 Great lyrics, amazing song.
3. Hello- 5/5 Love this one.
4. Tennessee- 5/5 This one is great to.
5. Just Might (Make Me Believe)- 5/5 Great lyrics, beautiful song.
6. Down in Mississippi (Up to no good)- 3/5 Not really my type, but ok.
7. Fly Away- 5/5 My favorite one!
8. Speed Of Life- 5/5 Love this one
9. Small Town Jericho- 5/5 this one has great lyrics and a great tune.
10. Time, time, time- 4/5 Pretty good, its also very True.
11. Stand Back Up- 4/5 good song with positive lyrics.

Like I said, it's a great cd.",
A3PEZQQ3I0B036,B000V66IVS,1,1,5,I bought this with the idea of getting a distorted sound. I was shocked to hear the quality digital perfection. Quality Sound!!!,
A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000V6577O,1,1,5,"Usually, I don't listen to Country music, but I made the exception when I saw these guys on the Grammy's.  They are fantastic and I not only love Jennifer Nettles voice, but the music is so catchy and fun and great.

Fly Away, Something More, Just Might (Make Me Believe) and Stand Back Up are my favourites, but then they are all good songs and I'm surprised about how much I love this since I'm really mainly into R&B and Hip Hop.  These guys are talented and write such great songs.  They also performed on Las Vegas and look like they are having fun on stage.  They sound fresh and I have really taken to this group and this cd.  I hope they keep releasing music like this.  They might just convert me yet.  I love it.  Even if you aren't a Country fan, you too might surprise yourself.  Give this a try.",
A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO,B000V6577O,1,1,5,"Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful, & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, & all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific.",
A2SQOAQT6XTK31,B000V66IVS,1,1,5,Yeah he can be my man. Lol,
A2VVILVIL5ZG6P,B000V66IVS,1,1,5,Love his voice!!,

A3G6Z28R3RIMUT,B000V66IVS,1,1,4,Hadn't heard this song in a while so when I heard it on the radio the other night I ordered it for my music library.  Great voice.  Good song.,
A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000V6577O,1,1,4,"Jennifer Nettles, Kristen Hall, and Kristian Bush are ""Sugarland,"" and this debut album by the trio is a solid beginning to their career as such.  However, all three of them have had careers long before this.  Nettles fronted her own band.  Hall gained respect for her writing skills and Bush was part of Billy Pilgrim.  As of this writing, Hall has already departed from the trio.  Who knows what that will lead to in the future.

As for this disc, Sugarland knows how to craft music that is rather appealing to a mass audience.  They meld traditional country, folk rock and pop to make a sound that fits comfortably somewhere between Kenny Chesney's fluff and Allison Krause's commercial bluegrass.  The first three singles from this album, ""Baby Girl,"" ""Something More,"" and ""Just Might(Make Me Believe)"" ring True of contemporary pop country, but songs like the title track and ""Small Town Jericho"" show that this group does have a little more weight to them than most johnny-come-lately's.

The only song that I have a problem with is ""Down In Mississippi.""  It's an attempt at a barn-burner that wants to sound like Southern rock but fails to satisfy.  Nettles' voice comes across as forced, and the song just feels out of place from the rest of the album.  If this trio has any shortcomings, it's that their sound is too tight to sound tough.

Give this album a chance if you enjoy female vocalists or tight harmonies in the Diamond Rio vein.  Also, if you're a fan of commercially cranked out country like Rascal Flatts, this album has plenty of that too.",

I like the passion Ms. Nettles brings to the music.  I knew nothing about Sugarland until I saw them perform ""Something More"" on an awards show and they brought the house down.  Jennifer Nettles has such strong stage presence and she can really work a crowd.  I then listened to the c.d. and was surprised at how strong it was from start to finish, really a complete c.d.  I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates really good music, even if you, like me, are not normally into this type of music, give it a try, I'll bet you'll like it.",

A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000V6577O,-1,-1,3,"The Top 10 single, ""Baby Girl,"" is really super-catchy, but if you listen to the whole album, which is mercilessly packed full of tightly-crafted rock-tinged pop hooks, you might find their sound gets kind of monotonous and exhausting after a while.  In particular, Jennifer Nettle's phony, exaggerated twang gets pretty irritating after about four or five songs... But as a singles-based band aiming at radio airplay, these folks'll do just fine.",

He was a marvelous vocalist and today in the 21 century greatly and fervently admired for his vast body of musical excellence in his work. I buy his MP3's today right here on Amazon, his display as a recording artist is my buying motivation.

A3U3PA6J2XOVFK,B000V672Y0,1,1,5,"Yes, oh yes, this was a great album of songs; funky and soulful, gritty and bluesy, and also quite poppy and tuneful in parts. Some definite candidates for Top 40 hits, and some groove-laden tracks where Robert and his musician buddies (if you don't know the names by now, look 'em up; it's an all-star cast) stretch out and get down with it. How much fun? A lot! Hard to believe that this was the same guy who later got slick for MTV and his chorus line of models. But this album, and a few more that came after it, show what a fine singer and interpreter of songs that he was.",
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000V672Y0,1,1,5,"During the mid to late 70's Robert Palmer was far from the household name he became during the mid 80's. At the same time at this point in the 70's one of the more fasionable things for a lot of white rock musicians was to record in the Crescent City with many of the local musicians from Dr. John,Allen Toussaint,Little Feat and The Meters. None of these projects were bad at all but strangly enough many of them were one or two off genre excersises that the said artist(s) never again returned to. This was not one of those efforts. Throughout even the 80's the core of Robert Palmers music was always soul and funk so it was only fitting he would make his first solo album in New Orleans with of course all the best people in town on board. Two of the most remarkable things about this are related to Palmer himself. He wrote or co-wrote almost all the music on this album and had a very keen understanding of how to create great funk music,from the honeyed nuances (as opposed to loud bellowing) of his vocal style. Now he does a great job for sure in interpreting Big Easy styled funk here from the rolling clavinets on Allen Toussaint's title track and ""From A Whisper To A Scream"" which Palmer also delivers with his great soulful understatement. There's more of an obvious Mardi Gras-style hump to the grooves of Lowell George's ""Sailin' Shoes"" and ""Blackmail"" but some of the most impressive songs on the album are the ones Palmer wrote himself. ""Hey Julia"" is an excellent song-a great rhythm box percussion led have jive/funk sort of groove with a really deep Carribean rhythm under the service;not so obvious it's emmediately detectable but it's there if you recognize it. ""Get Close"" and ""How Much Fun"" both illustrate an understanding of the elegance of funk and elegance is a quality that Palmer himself always possessed very strong. Of course for a SERIOUS represenation of that there's the twelve minute closer ""Through It All There's You"" where Palmer really works a hardcore jam to death with his wonderfully jazzily phrased licks and how the song builds up and down from a full band sound back to it's lower key tones from the beginning. It was only fitting that his 70's sound was built very strongly on the type of music presented on this album and it's a credit to his integrity that maintained a strong connection to this particular element of his sound throughout his career as opposed to totally disgarding them when they were no longer trendy in mass culture.",
A2HWD9PTM7RBXN,B000V672Y0,-1,-1,3,"I have very mixed feelings about this CD.  The musical support provided by Lowell George, other membrs of Little Feat and the Meters are simply stunning.  The keyboard parts stand out very much and the drumming is very funky.  The best song by far is the title track.  What a cool groove.

Outside is another strong track.  Whereas I like Sailing Shoes, it just does not compare to the Little Feat version.  It all starts with the vocals.  Robert Palmer just can not compare to Lowell George on this track.

AS a matter of fact, Robert Palmers vocals are erratic on this CD.  He's very good on the title track, Outside and decent on a couple of others.  However, that last song, Throught It All With You, Mr. Palmer just sounds like he is grunting and does not rise above the solid backing unit.

Also many of the songs do not have solid hooks.  Robert Palmer would go on to record more solid hook driven songs later in his career.  On this CD, it is very hit and miss.

Basically the style is good but the substance is not there full time yet.",
A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B000V672Y0,1,1,5,"This is the debut album from Robert Palmer and its brilliant. His successful 80's albums are not a touch on this. Don't get me wrong I like Riptide, but this is in a different league.

With members of The Meters and Little Feat backing him, this album is really tight. It would have been quite something to see these guys live. The material is a mixture of originals and two classics by the great New Orleans musician and producer Allen Toussaint. These are the title track and ""From a Whisper to a Scream"". Palmers vocals are as smooth as you would expect and unlike much material from the early 70's this doesn't date.

This album and Pressure Drop (Palmers 2nd I believe) are both well worth getting. Robert Palmer changed styles throughout his career but never matched these two early classics.",

together without a pause and each song compliments the other.

A208QEPAI30Z4G,B000V68LJ0,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

While a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE / CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

A3B9DHWCMYQFD,B000V68LJ0,1,1,5,"...I do not mean any disrespect AT ALL. This is NOT sarcasm: People that are in one of the greatest bands ever, should NOT get near a plane! Seeing them in the sky is as close as you should get...ever. This song sums up Lynyrd Skynyrd. The older VanZandt brother and a couple of other band members and crew died in a crash. It seems very odd to me that so many great musicians lost their lives jetting around. These guys lived they're lives just like the moral of this song. They did not play for fame and fortune. They never let themselves be changed one bit when all the other bands were going ""hair band."" They were good ol' boys from Alabama that played songs that had a certain timeless and profound pride in being just that: good folks. Skynyrd touched so many of us (now middle aged) people when WE were the future. It was our turn to run the world, and being humble, respectful, and doing the right thing was important. Now that we've retired, the world is way too small, and common courtesy seems but a distant memory. Everything they put out went platinum. Their first song, to the last, was straight up American. The whole Rock Music world mourned when that plane went down. That was it. The other members went back home and would have never played again. BUT! Those guys knew that the older brother, Johnny, I believe (God forgive me if I've got the two mixed up) would want them to try to show the world what was being lost and try to get people to just slow down, realise what is truly important in life; forget greed, be kind and respectful, and just live, simple. Because, ""if you do, you will be satisfied."" Fans of all different kind of music came to see a band that was not really a band any more. All these people came to listen and give their respects. Skynyrd toured one more time. The younger VanZandt brother finally put his grief away for long enough to tour one more time. The whole venue was packed. We went and seen them at Starwood Amphitheatre in Nashville. The younger brother wore a flat brimmed hat just like his older brother used to. He stepped up to the mic and did something he swore not to do...it just hurt too bad: He sang his brothers songs. They played, I swear it was like Jonny was there. Freebird was last song of course....

And that's all I have to say about that.",

A33M07VZBYRMPY,B000V6759W,1,1,5,"Burnin' is the album that promotes the Bob Marley & the Wailers into international fame, despite that they were already achieving commercial success especially in the Western Hemisphere. Although it is not the debut for the ban, many would considered Burnin' to be the debut album on an international level of fame.",
A2162NFEC5ZSDQ,B000V6759W,1,1,5,"This is a wonderful album and absolute perfection from beginning to end and the extra tracks are a nice addition as well.  The original Wailers were such an influential band and one of the precious few who while changing the music scene also managed to change culture as a whole.  I've always thought Mr. Marley was the Truest poet in music due to the fact that he lived every song he ever wrote as did his primary co-songwriters, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  Their music and lyrical content stired up revolution both in their country, in music and in the hearts and minds of people around the globe.  This is one band that still generates a tremendous buzz today years after the release of this fantastic album.

They weren't the first to write, produce & perform reggae (Music of the Islands) but they did bring a cohesiveness to their genre and showed that, by this time, it had matured into a force just like the other top genre's of the day.  The Wailers also were able to seemlessly blend aspects from R&B, Jazz, Gospel and Blues bringing a different and unique flavor.  The Wailers, along with Jimmy Cliff, were truly the 1st to make us stand up and pay attention to Reggae and what it would soon mean on a world wide scale!  I recenly ran across an online poll that asked a simply yet profound question. ""Who was more influential: Bob Marley or John Lennon?""  There were a variety of opinons one way or the other, as you would expect, and the debate got somewhat heated.  However, the final response given by a participant on the forum was one of the most profound I've heard on the subject and I think sums everything up in a nutshell.

He stated about the two artists in question: ""One wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, ended a war single handedly, and is looked at to some in Africa as the second coming.""  ""The other wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, Enough Said!""  I couldn't have said it any better myself and that is the difference between The Wailers and every other band of any influence, their songs touched people on a level that made them want to get up, stand up and fight for their rights, not just sing, dance, go to parties, etc.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with the latter, however, it's the former that truly makes a difference in the direction of a people and nation.

Listening to this CD really took me back to that first moment when I heard this album.  Putting needle to wax and hearing ""Get Up, Stand Up, Stand Up for your rights!"" come shouting through my speakers absolutely sent chills down my spine.  Understand the time frame, this was 1973 and the Civil Rights/Black Power movements were still raging in the U.S., to hear a band sing a song like that was so mind boggling to my young ears.  Radio stations weren't prone to play such revolutionary themes at the time and especially from a genre that was just making a name for itself on a worldwide scale.  Then you had the sweet and angelic sounds of Bunny Wailer's ""Hallelujah Time"" with it's wonderful bass guitar and clavinet intro.  This song is so powerful in that it reminds you of the beauty of the simple things in life in the midst of such gross oppression.

Then you have the ultimate song of rebellion and revolution, a song that would become an anthem of both Reggae & Revolutions around the globe, Bob Marley's masterpiece ""I Shot The Sheriff.""  What can be said about this song that has not already been stated millions of times over.  It has so many layers and displays Marley's incredible mastery of writing and storytelling using allegories and metaphors.  At the same time it's a song about an individual and a nation of people defending their right to live in peace according to their beliefs & fighting against genocide of a ""seed"" planted.

There's a wonderful interplay of songs as Reggae is music of what I call equal opposites.  This is displayed constantly in the writings of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  From songs like ""Burnin' and Lootin'"" to ""Put It On"" and ""Duppy Conqueror"" to ""Reincarnated Souls.""  All 3 men were able to, at the same time, be revolutionary and spiritual, fighers and lovers, Rastafarians and Rebels as they saw one as the other and all inclusive.  The songs they wrote were both complex yet simple, deep with practial meanings and applications for everyday life for everyday people.

Just like there's a postive for a negative and an up for a down a left for a right, Reggae music deals with the entire spectrum of life.  This music is so very deep and personal, it truly gives you a glimpse as to what it was like in Jamaica back in the time The Wailers first formed and the strife and struggles they had to go through and not just there but in all the Island nations and anywhere were those of African descent were living around the world.  This was the music that changed generational perspectives and was, then and now, adored by millions and millions of people around the world.

When you have fans as varied as the Freedom Fighers from both South Africa & Zimbabwe, The Hopi & Havasupai Indians of the Southwest U.S.A, The Maoris of New Zealand & even the United Nations, there's really not much to argue about concerning how broad and vast your influence has become. In India, there are many tributes to Bob Marley to this day including restaurants, hotels, and cultural festivals. There has never been anything like Bob Marley & The Wailers and we won't ever see their likes again.",

A34Y1FT0MTD7C9,B000V6759W,1,1,5,"Bob Marley & The Wailers-Burnin' *****

Released in 1973, the same year as the bands debut Catch A Fire was released, and while many consider one significantly greater then the other, which varies who you ask, I must say they both go hand in hand. Catch A Fire and this, Burnin' are sort of like a ying, and yang thing, not to sound too cliche. Catch A Fire seems to be more about peace and togetherness while Burnin' is the opposite spectrum, more empowering, and more about overcoming and getting yours. Marley was always an activist through his lyrics, you could say he was to reggae what Johnny Cash was to country as far as civil justice and spirituality is concerned.

Containing two of the groups biggest hits, the great opener 'Get Up, Stand Up' and the immortal 'I Shot The Sheriff' which is far better then the Clapton cover, and also shows the vicious side of Marleys lyrics. But it's 'Rasta Man Chant' 'Small Axe' 'Pass It On' and the vehement 'Burnin And Lootin' that make this album a classic.

The new release of the album contains three bonus tracks. 'Reincarnated Souls' being the best, and one that would have perfectly complimented the original album. The other two being less impressive but still great, 'No Symphony' and the chilling 'The Oppressed Song.'

After Burin' Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh would both leave to form solo projects, Tosh being the most successful of the two. His album Legalize It is another classic. The departure of those two members would forever change the sound of the band. They would aim for a more commercial appeal while that isn't a bad thing it did seem to loose something. Though I did enjoy the later background vocals they were not as good as the first two albums, and neither was the musicianship which is something Burnin' has an amazing amount of. Burnin' is an album which I would recommend to anyone who is interested in more then Bob Marley & The Wailers hits.",
A26NLSTT75FMJM,B000V6759W,1,1,5,"In my mind, Bob Marley has great songs, but generally inconsistant albums. This is the exception to the rule. Bob's angry at the state of the human race here, and he wants you to know. And people tend to make good music while angry. This is no exception. Pretty much every song is classic: Get Up, Stand Up (which got even better virtually ever time he played it live); I Shot the Sheriff; and Burnin' are the best-known, and best. Also check out the politically-charged, pro-revolutionary Small Axe; Duppy Conqueror, with great harominies; Pass It On; and the call for unity One Foundation. I'd call Hallelujah Time the weakest of the bunch. But as for the rest? It's all good. BUY IT! (For the record, Natty Dread and Rastaman Vibration are pretty good too, Live! and Legend, greatest hits comp or not, are indespensible).",

A256JOUD8X0J7R,B000V66VGA,1,1,4,"I never really liked this song when it was new.  It was so popular, but that wasn't why I didn't like it.  I don't care if something is popular or not, if I like it I'll listen to it.  I think the fact that it was associated with Barbie, which I wasn't into anymore, and that I didn't like a lot of 90s pop, just made me feel alienated from the song.  But many years later, I like it.  It's catchy and gets stuck in my head.  Maybe it's because I've been into collecting Barbie again.  Or because I don't hear 90s pop a whole lot anymore, and I can just listen to it now and then when I feel like it.",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000V68RZI,1,1,5,"There is honestly a difference between a singer, and being a product. Unfortunately for divas these days like Rihanna and Beyonce', they have chosen to overexpose themselves and choose to be products, not people, and sadly the songs have became so overplayed, their voices have slowly passed away. For other divas, like Vanessa Williams, whom has been very sophisticated at the soul, and very True to her own heart, and strong at the voice, her songs have remained so timeless. Nearly 30 years after Vanessa Williams broke from scandal and heartbreak, after the Miss America Pageant, she found her own voice again through music and acting, and made herself a  worldwide staple as a diva that has never gone out of style. One of my favorite songs, her staple Saved The Best For Last, is actually one of those songs that has sincerely gotten much better with age, and the soulful melody aligned. I adore this song each time I hear it, and if you have never heard a Vanessa Williams song before, than I recommend you download this beauty.

Song: A",

AIGH2GH9V4IQ6,B000V68TJM,1,1,5,"I really used to like Thin Lizzy and then something reminded me of them this year (2014).
So I picked my three favorites and got them on Amazon in MP3 form. You'd like this if you're
a rocker, I'm thinking.",
A3FQ9WYUHG9CD,B000V68TJM,1,1,5,"There is definitely something rockin' here. The song made #12 on the American charts and #8 on the
British charts. Rolling Stone Magazine, in 2004, put this song at #499 in the top  500 greatest songs
of all time. In 2005, Q magazine place it at #38 on its list of 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. Yes, it should
be.

The reason? Great almost-poetic lyrics by Phil Lynott, hitting his peak, and dynamite intertwined guitar
leads, all done with a working man's sensibility. The twin guitar leads were essentially a trademark of
Thin Lizzy, after 1975, and helped the band stand apart from the rest of the rock 'n' roll pack. The lead
and rhythm guitar  playing uses very sharp crisp chords that pulsate and propel the song. Wait for the
sparse twin guitar lead as the rest of the band lays back; then the singer comes back in as the twin
leads repeat their riff underscoring the lyrics and subsequently the Boys bravado.

The song was released in 1976 and featured a black Irish lead singer/bass player and a mixed band of
Protestant and Catholic musicians. Talk about cross cultural influences, this band was it. Amazingly
the song was used at the 2012 Republican Convention to introduce the Vice-Presidential candidate to
the stage. Again, the Republicans used a song unauthorized (Reagan and ""Born In The USA"") and was
criticized for its use. This was objected to by the Lynott family citing that Lynott would have objected
to the anti-gay policies of the party and never let them use it for political purposes.

Nonetheless, this song sounds immediate no matter how many times it is played. This is why it has been
used in countless movies, television commercials and sporting events. The energy on this song, displayed
by the band, keeps you glued to your air guitar and keeps you wondering if the song will have a different
ending each time you play it. To me it always seems fresh and exciting; in one word, timeless, and that,
to me, is what a great rock 'n' roll song is all about.",

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B000V68V4A,1,1,5,"I confess that I haven't heard the original Vicki Lawrence version of this song -- indeed, I didn't even know this song was a remake until I looked it up out of curiosity.  So I have no idea how Reba McEntire's version compares to Lawrence's.  Normally I prefer the original version of a song over a remake (unless it's a Weird Al ""remake""), and I suppose one of these days I should look up the Lawrence version as a comparison/contrast to McEntire's.

But as of now, this version of ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"" is one of my favorite songs of all time.  It's a dark ballad with a complex but compelling storyline, and a surprisingly shocking ending.

The song is played in an eerie, almost menacing key, quite befitting the building dread of the story as a man tries to track down his unfaithful wife's lover and gets far more trouble than he bargained for in the process.  The piano and electric guitar track mesh well, and the drum track is appropriately intense without overpowering the song.  And Reba's vocals carry the song well -- she doesn't scream or holler, but lets the lyrics convey the song's emotions on their own.  This song could easily have played out as melodramatic in the hands of another singer, but Reba doesn't overdo it, and so the song hits the right balance.

By now I'm sure the song's twist ending is well-known, but it can still be shocking to first-time listeners.  I won't spoil it further.

One of Reba's best songs, and one of the best country songs I've heard.  If you don't mind your music dark and with a complex storyline, give this a listen.",

While it's not old blues, it has some serious heart in it, like many of the the old blues do. Johnny Lang sings is with a ton of soul. A song about a guy who knows a relationship isn't working out, she's moving on, but he isn't ready to let go. He wants to stay together, closing his eyes to what's going on right behind his back, and not yet accept the inevitable. Great song with some deep meaning.",

I guess she was singing songs that would be appropriate for a 16 year old. I think the best/standout tracks would be The Magic is Working, Come Give Your Love To Me, Young Love, and Don't Mess Up This Good Thing. Love and My Best Friend reminds me of Michael's Ben. It's mushy at best but compliments Janet's sweet/soft tone that gives it more of a pleasure, worthwhile listen for hardcore Janet fans like myself.",
A967PDAQ425EF,B000V6980Q,1,1,5,"So here we have the elusive album by Janet Jackson that i have been trying to convince retailers actually exists ! Those of you in the know,know what i'm talking about.....trying to explain that Janet did have two albums prior to Control. For some reason people [among them Janet] have been trying to avoid this album's existence and i for the life of me don't know why,sure it doesn't have all the ""attitude"" of a Control or a Rhythm Nation but this was 1982 four years before Control and music was different then. To compare this to Control or ""rhythm"" is unfair,first off as i stated before music WAS different then,secondly,even tho the ""Minneapolis Sound"" was in full swing,it was done by grown folks like Prince,The Time,Vanity 6 among others,Janet was a 16 year old girl still living under the jackson's Compound and it was not until 1984's Dream Street that she started showing signs of rebel. I'm giving this album five stars because the music is good on here and Janet was in her purest form, just an r&b/pop teen singer doing her thing. For those of you who care...there's a longer version of ""say you do"" on this album and it's better than the one that appeared on the original release, in my opinion also i have a new found fondness for the song ""forever yours"" and i always loved ""young love' that was my jam ! Anyway,buy this album before it ""disappear"" again.",
A256JOUD8X0J7R,B000V6980Q,1,1,4,"I loved the Control and Rhythm Nation albums in the 80s.  I didn't know that she had two previous albums out.  The radio and MTV didn't play the older songs anymore at that time, and I never noticed them in stores.  I heard Say You Do a few years ago while watching an episode of Soul Train that Janet was on.  I bought this cd before it went out of print.

While this and her sophomore record aren't as memorable as Control, there are still some pretty good songs on it.  My favorites are Say You Do, You'll Never Find a Love Like Mine, and Come Give Your Love to Me.  The ballads aren't so great.  The upbeat tracks are better.  Very early 80s R&B, disco, Jacksons, Off the Wall sounds.  Come Give Your Love to Me is more rock/new wave, kind of a hint at the sound of her next album, which I think is better than this one.  Both are worth buying if you like 80s music.",
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000V6980Q,1,1,4,"I'm sure there are many people out there who still believe<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Control/dp/B000002GFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Control</a>&nbsp;is Janet Jackson's first album. That was not in fact the case-she had two False starts beforehand and this was her first. At the time of this release Janet was the one member of her family not really considering a career in music. Acting seemed to be her call to ""fame"" (no pun intended) and she was doing very well in that field lending her charming,coy personality to TV shows such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Times/dp/B001DSNELU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Times</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diff-rent-Strokes/dp/B0002JZT5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diff'rent Strokes</a>&nbsp;and later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fame/dp/B002BYYAKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fame</a>. In the latter two series her appearances often including her singing in some capacity. So at this point being only 16 years old and very much ""doing what her father said"" she recorded this debut album. Even at this point her voice possesses the same coy charm as her attitude. It's definately not soul shouting of course but she has a pretty good range and,in a lot of ways has the sound of a female version of her brother Michael. The music was another matter however. With Leon Sylvers handling the production on this album (with his sister Pat contributing some keyboard parts) there is something of the flavor of both early 80's Solar R&B and some of the period Jackson family sound which,as most will remember share certain similarities anyhow. ""Say You Do"" is a great open,an extended dance-funk jam that builds from a beat to a BAAAD bassline with some great echo on it and,of course it isn't all that unlike something Michael and/or his brothers might've come up with at that time. (""You'll Never Find) A Love Like Mine"" has the same effect through the guys of a bubbling disco-pop tune and both tunes showcase her maturing voice very well. On these songs it would seem there was an effort to turn Janet into something of a lower key version of Stacy Lattisaw but when the funk gets percolating on ""Don't Mess Up This Good Thing"" the electronic textures of the song demand Janet belt out the song more and she does to great affect. The ballads ""Love And My Best Friend"" and her version of ""Forever Yours"" are not only just a tad over arranged but somehow don't quite seem like suitable material of the teenage singer. However the than very forceful disco freeze out the out and out four-on-the-floor disco-soul production of ""Young Love"" best explemlifies where Janet was coming from at this point and fits well with her persona at this point in time. It was on 'Diff'rent Strokes' that Janet first premired her song ""The Magic Is Working"" and this is a great and very Shalamar-like ""The Magic Is Working"" and again it fits well with who she was at the time. The album closer ""Come Give Your Love To Me"" puts her into a new-wave rock style and although the track slams again with a mean bassline leading the way Janet's voice is just not quite into rockier material at this point. Nevertheless the song itself will grow on one with the passage of time. This is not by any means her definative early album. I'd say that would be her very,very underrated second outing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Street/dp/B00000DNA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Street</a>. However this did serve the common function of what a debut album does for most artists: give them a loose musical concept and allows them to develop appropriatly in a variety of settings.",
A28FNKCGFS03VL,B000V6980Q,1,1,4,"Released when she was just 16, this is the underrated debut album from the now-legendary Janet Jackson, and while it doesn't bear the signature Jam & Lewis sound that would make undeniable classics out of her Control and Rhythm Nation albums, it's a great album if you like perky, innocent (and somewhat disco-ish) dance pop, and the producers on hand, including Rene Moore and Angela Winbush (aka the soul duo Rene & Angela), give Janet some bouncy, vigorous landscapes to work with, and they seem to be a good match here, especially on ""You'll Never Find (A Love Like Mine)."" Foster Sylvers also serves her well with the infectious grooves of ""Don't Mess Up This Good Thing"" and ""Come Give Your Love To Me."" Jerry Weaver also works a little magic on the outstanding ""The Magic Is Working,"" and check out ""Love And My Best Friend,"" a tender, impassioned ballad that may be Janet's best sheer vocal performance.",

,B000V6AEI6,1,1,5,"""Wide angles"" is (to my view) among the three best recordings of this unforgettable sax virtuoso ever made.

It has such kaleidoscopic scope, container of vibrant themes and hovered by contagious flair that, once you listen you will hardly be able to do without about it.

Since the Latin beginning ""Broadband"" , passing through the marvelous and suggestive ballad ""Angle of repose"", the original song of African roots ""Timbuktu"" , the magnificent theme ""Night Jessamine"" with funk accents, to the most experimental and dynamically moving ""Scylla"" in which harmonizes expression and introspection, until the last track ""Never alone"" Brecker always exposed with his inimitable style and touch of class tracks like ""Brexterity"", the captivating ""Evening faces"" and the fabulous ""Modus operandi"" makes me think about an innermost musical journey .

This album has not waste. You must acquire as soon as you can. It's far from being just a fashionable album. It's precisely the contrary: a timeless item for connoisseurs.

,B000V6AEI6,1,1,5,"My dumb behind didn't know what a quindectet was before I bought this album. I'd never even heard the word used before. It wasn't in any of my dictionaries and my computer refused to recognise it as a proper word. Maybe Michael Brecker made the word up? Ah, whatever. I guess you live and you learn.

I love the idea though. Brecker basically does big band and playing with his fourteen cohorts here gives him the opportunity to paint a canvas of very complex textures upon which to play his beautiful tenor sax solos. The whole ensemble works well but, apart from the bandleader of course, I have a personal fondness on here for Alex Sasha Sipiagin on trumpet, Adam Rogers on guitar and the drummer, Antonio Sanchez (now of The Pat Metheny Group). My favourite songs include ""Broadband"" (which is the opener on my CD and not ""Loxodrome"" as mentioned in the product overview soundclips), ""Night Jasmine"", ""Scylla"" and ""Never Alone"". Gil Goldstein does a great job co-arranging with Brecker and doing the overall orchestration.

I'll always wonder though, if I'd have liked the album more if Vince Mendoza had done it?

Still. Great stuff. Anyone who likes this will probably also like some of the big band stuff Bob Mintzer (the horn man with Yellowjackets) did back in the 90s. So I respectfully suggest you check him out too.","My dumb behind did n't know what a quindectet was before I bought this album .. I 'd never even heard the word used before ..

,B000V6AEI6,1,1,5,"Whoa. I was used to hearing Brecker in your average funk-fusion (a bit smoother than I like sometimes), and straight-ahead blowing sessions, so this one really took me by surprise. Here he assembled a unique combination of instruments - among them strings, guitar and a somewhat unique (including French horn and Baritone) brass section - which gives the music a kind of heft and richness that is just a joy to hear. The arrangements are great - interesting horn/string lines underneath Brecker's usual masterful and fiery soloing. My faves are ""Night Jessamine"", and ""Modus Operandi"" which are two of the grooviest and funkinest jazz songs I've heard in quite a while. The only tiny complaint I have is that Brecker is virtually the only soloist. He gives bassist Pattituci a few spots, as well as a couple for the guitarist and trumpeter, but most of the time it is him wailing on and on. Mind you, he is an awesome soloist, I love his playing, but sometimes you need to break it up a bit and let the other guys shine for a while, too - that is what Jazz is about, individual expression, while still serving the collective. Not even the great Coltrane had a problem letting Eric Dolphy, Don Cherry, or his own McCoy Tyner shine for a while. But, aside from that, this is a superb effort from one of the most important saxophonists since Coltrane. Keep it up, Mike.","Whoa ..

,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,3,"Just about everything bad and good has been said about this album. 50 Cent's major debut was a decent album in 2003 that was highly blown out of proportion on how good it was (sort of like Nelly's ""Country Grammar"") but there are some good parts to it and some bad parts to it. 50 Cent's gangsta attitude would be shown all over the album, mostly about guns, sex, drugs, and money. The 2003 rap song of the year ""In Da Club"" was overrated to me, but it was a decent track at best. The second single ""21 ?'s"" I hated because of it's pop style and lack luster beat that it carries. The third single ""Many Men"" was one of my favorite tracks that was dedicated to more violence. The fourth single ""P.I.M.P."" was a medicore song about pimping on the origonal version, although the remix that features Snoop Dogg and G-Unit that doesn't appear on here is better. The rest of the tracks range from decent to good that will make your head nod, some I enjoyed and some that I hated. ""Patiently Waiting"" featuring Eminem is possibly one of the best songs on the album, as both of them have above average verses. The track ""If I Can't"" has a fast paced piano beat, that makes the song gangsta and listenable. ""What Up Gangsta"" will have little kids thinking they're hardcore repeating that song, because of it's catchy hook. 50 Cent's slurred vocals could get a liitle annoying at some parts of the CD, because he was shot in the jaw when he took those nine bullets.

Production is done by Dr. Dre, Eminem, and more.
It sold about 9 million copies, so I'm pretty sure that most rap and alternative listener has at least taken a listen.

,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4,"On ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" 50 was a new fledgling rapper with a new major label, and he had something to prove. He showed everybody who he was, a tough rapper from Queens, and he actually had something to say. His only beef here was with Ja Rule, and that was actually pretty entertaining, especially since now 50 makes a beef with every rapper he lays eyes on. He gets some good production and guest appearances from Eminem, Nate Dogg, and the G Unit family. I hope 50 can be remembered for this album rather than for the Massacre, which is terrible, and whatever else he makes from this point on.

Pretty much all the tracks here are good to listen to. He really sounds tough here, not all worried about women and his star status like he would be later. ""What Up Gangsta"" is good, good chants at the end and all. ""Patiently Waiting"" with Eminem is memorable, crazy production, good lyrics by both parties. ""Many Men"" was a hit, 50 telling all about his gunshots, why he's here, the whole bit. Everybody's heard ""In Da Club"", not much I can say there. ""Blood Hound"" is the infamous Ja Rule diss, pretty funny, but he went crazy dissing everybody later. ""21 Questions"" was the love song with Nate Dogg, pretty good, but there would be way too much of this on the Massacre. The bonus tracks are all good too, ""Wanksta"" being the original single, spawning a new term to the masses, ""Gotta Make it to Heaven"", ""Don't Push Me"" and ""Nobody Likes Me"", a funny song.

This actually was a really good album, and I liked it a lot when it first came out. If it sounds like I have a hard time saying it, it's True, because I can't stand what he's done to the hip hop world since its release. Now he's concerned only with women, the pop star lifestyle, and beefing with every rapper he can find, which makes me pretty mad, especially because Nas, Fat Joe, and Jada are all tougher and better than him and have been around longer. He's got nothing left to prove now. 50 did a good job here and would not be able to duplicate it ever again.","On "" Get Rich or Die Tryin ' "" 50 was a new fledgling rapper with a new major label , and he had something to prove .. He showed everybody who he was , a tough rapper from Queens , and he actually had something to say .. His only beef here was with Ja Rule , and that was actually pretty entertaining , especially since now 50 makes a beef with every rapper he lays eyes on .. He gets some good production and guest appearances from Eminem , Nate Dogg , and the G Unit family .. I hope 50 can be remembered for this album rather than for the Massacre , which is terrible , and whatever else he makes from this point on .. Pretty much all the tracks here are good to listen to ..

Its all hype, soon he'll be just as relevant as M.C. Hammer and doing commercials for insurance.  His plans are clearly obvious, look at the title!  Get Rich or Die Tryin', thus meaning, trying all the easy shots at getting fame and money.  Act tough, look tough, become the biggest hype, rap idiotically cause its something that they'll play at the clubs or raves because everybody will like it cause they are tripped out on PCP or something, and then they'll start using 50 Cent as a code word for drugs, because in time that's all anybody will remember him or at least the slogan for.  No body will care about the ""music"", only about this cool little code word that will pop up in time.  I may be wrong, but don't be surprised if it comes True.....or maybe its already in affect right now.... *gasps*

You got to hand it to 2 Quarter, his wildest dreams came True.  He got rich at the expense of the masses.  His reign of annoyance is almost at its end as apparently, his new CD flat out sucks even more.  Well, now its time of his career to die.  Don't be surprised if he puts out a CD titled ""Stay Rich or Die Tryin'"", when he runs out of ideas to avoid doing commercials with M.C. Hammer by his side.

This album is raw, his raps blend well with the different musics and beats and producers and he is just dynamite on the Dr. Dre-produced songs (even ""In Da Club""). The ones that Eminem produced are just as solid too.  And his song ""21 Questions"" shows his softer side and pleasant compliments to the girl he's talking about on the song.  Better than hearing the heavy gun themes that dominate the album.  But his being from the streets justifies his stand in his songs' lyrics.

,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5,"When I originally heard ""How To Rob"" from the ""In Too Deep"" soundtrack, I liked the song and the clever wordplay involved, but I wondered if 50 Cent had enough to carry a whole album.  Rappers like Jay Z, Ghostface Killah, Sticky Fingaz from Onyx and others weren't too pleased with what 50 had to say and they came out with their own things to say about the song.  Just as 50 was about to record his 1st single from ""Power Of The Dollar"", ""Thug Love"" w/Destiny's Child, 50 was shot multiple times.  After he recovered, 50 called his label and they acted as if 50 had never even existed.  To reestablish himelf, 50 hit the mixtape circuit and would appear on various mixtapes freestyling or with songs that were supposed to appear on ""Power Of The Dollar"".  In early 2002, Full Clip Records released ""Guess Who's Back"" which included underground songs and freestyles that included 50, G Unit, Nas, Nature, The Bravehearts and Bun B of UGK on different tracks.  Shortly after that, 50 Cent & G Unit released several mixed Cds and the buzz definitely had been recreated.  Eminem heard ""Guess Who's Back"" after he completed ""The Eminem Show"" and that was the beginning of 50 Cent being signed to Eminem's Shady Records.  50 Cent's popular mix tape track, ""Wanksta"" appeared on Eminem's ""8 Mile"" soundtrack, as well as,  ""Places To Go"" and ""Love Me"" which was  a collaboration with Eminem, 50 Cent and Obie Trice.  These songs and the mixed CDs were enough to keep 50 out in the streets until his highly anticipated CD, ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"", was released.  When ""In Da Club"" was released to radio and started appearing on MTV and BET, 50's CD was definitely going to be in demand.  Dr. Dre's club banger had everyone sayig ""Go, go, go, go, go.."".  The song would propel ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" with over 800,000 units sold in the first four days of its release.  The CD gets off a nice start with ""What's Up Gangsta"".  Fans of 50's street releases will definitely like this track.  Next up is ""Patiently Waiting"" as Eminem and 50 collaborate on the Eminem produced track.  50 and Eminem rip the track to shreds.  On ""Many Men (Wish Death)"", 50 speaks about how after being shot multiple times, how he reflects on things and how your enemies and people that are jealous of you are always plotting behind your back.  This is one of ""Get Rich Or Die Trying's"" best tracks.  Dr. Dre shows up again to produce the passion filled ""Heat"".  50 is back in street mode once again and has an anthem for anyone that wants to come at him and his G Unit crew.  ""If I Can't"" is more of a radio friendly Dre song but you will forget the commercial appeal of the song once you hear 50 rhyming to the track.  ""Back Down"" has 50 speaking on his long term beef with Ja Rule.  This is the CD's best track, in my opinion, as 50 says, ""You're a pop tart, sweetheart, you're soft in the middle..."".  Since then there have been several back and forth disses with the latest being ""Hail Mary 2003"" with Eminem, 50 Cent & Busta Rhymes.  The 2nd single, ""21 Questions"" with Nate Dogg is an ode for the ladies that will definitely continue to keep ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" on the charts for awhile.  ""Don't Push Me"" w/Lloyd Banks of G Unit and Eminem, has 50 Cent rapping a little too much like 2 Pac for some people.  I like the song as the rappers flow lovely to the Eminem's beat.  ""Poor Lil Rich"" is a Sha Money XL track that plans keep 50 in heavy club rotation along with the aforementioned ""In Da Club"" and ""P.I.M.P"".  The only song that you will have to fast forward, in my opinion, is ""Blood Hound"" with Young Buck as it sounds like DMX is barking throughout the whole song. ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" also includes ""Wanksta"", ""U Not Like Me"", and ""Life's On The Line"" as bonus tracks, but loyal 50 fans have heard these tracks already.  50 recently released a DVD, ""The New Breed"" that included a bonus CD with 3 tracks:  ""True Loyalty"" with G Unit, ""8 Mile Road"" (G Unit Remix)with G Unit, and the Dr. Dre produced ""In Da Hood"" with Brooklyn.  To anyone who doesn't know G Unit is 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Bang 'Em Smurf and a cast of other characters.  G Unit recently signed with Interscope Records, so a G Unit CD and a Lloyd Banks solo CD should be out by the end of the year and expect a new 50 Cent CD by February 2004.  For 50 Cent the sky is the limit.  If you judge ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" by just ""In Da Club"" and ""21 Questions"" then you will be saddenly mistakened.  This CD has more than club friendly songs on it.  Fans of 50's street anthems will enjoy this CD as well.  I wonder how Columbia feels now that 50 Cent has sold more than 4 million records in 10 weeks?  I would advise you to get ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" and ""Guess Who's Back"" to start your 50 library.  FREE YAYO!!!!

,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5,"How can you not know who 50 Cent is?  50 Cent has done something that hasn't been done in a while.  A COMPLETE DEEBO of the Industry.  Strategy or fate?  A little of both.  His controversial How To Rob garnered much attention.  Then consequently he was shot multiple times and survived through it all. (there's your street cred).  By this time, the bootleg of his supposes debut 'Power Of The Dollar' was hot on the streets and the internet.  Quickly following that, 50 gets dropped from a deal.  Later on he releases Guess Who's Back and again has the streets talking.  By this time his beef with Ja Rule & Murder Inc. is in full effect.  Somehow Eminem gets tapes of 50 Cent and they begin chitter chatter.  Then in an almost assassin like fashion 50 releases THREE mixtapes to the street featuring his crew G-Unit (50 Cent Is The Future, No Mercy No Fear, God's Plan).  Uh oh...now he has the streets on lock...only one more step.  50 Cent signs to Shady Records, features on the biggest hip hop movie soundtrack at the time (8 Mile) and releases his first single entitled ""Wanksta"" and grabs the media by the throat.  By the time everyones singing on Wanksta, Dr. Dre produces the hit ""IN Tha Club"", an instant club anthem, and has everybody EAGERLY anticipating the album.  The album soon follows and sells nearly 900, 000 copies the first week...topping Snoop Dogg's debut album record for most copies sold in the first week.  Hook, Line, sinker.
Now about a month after the initial hype I have come to see this album as a modern classic.  It doesn't hold a candle to universal hip hop classics such as Doggystyle, Illmatic, or SouthernPlayalisticCadillacMuzik.  But the reason it's a classic is because 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin has/ will change the game.  And any album that can do that has to be considered a classic.  There are so many standouts on this album....""Back Down"", What Up Gangsta, Many Men, In Da Club, Heat, High All The Time, 21 Questions....the whole album is bumpin.  There's no filler and I can definitely play this joint over and over straight through.  Hotness.  The beats are top notch, the lyrics are tight, the flows are on point (even with the slur; but keep in mind he was shot in the jaw/mouth area), the guests don't bog down the album...Overall just a great album.
Just trust me on this one...this cd is definitely a must have.  50 Cent is something special.  I don't know what it is but whatever it is 50 Cent definitely has it.  If he can stay alive...he will do many great things in hip hop.  Let's just hope his talent and controversial lyrics don't lead to another talent being lost.  5 stars!","How can you not know who 50 Cent is ?. 50 Cent has done something that has n't been done in a while .. A COMPLETE DEEBO of the Industry .. A little of both .. His controversial How To Rob garnered much attention .. Then consequently he was shot multiple times and survived through it all .. By this time , the bootleg of his supposes debut ' Power Of The Dollar ' was hot on the streets and the internet .. Quickly following that , 50 gets dropped from a deal .. Later on he releases. Who 's Back and again has the streets talking .. By this time his beef with Ja Rule & Murder Inc. is in full effect .. Somehow Eminem gets tapes of 50 Cent and they begin chitter chatter .. Then in an almost assassin like fashion 50 releases THREE mixtapes to the street featuring his crew G - Unit ( 50 Cent Is The Future , No Mercy No Fear , God 's Plan ) ..

I would't go as far to say 50 is in the ranks of pac and biggie, in fact he's no where near them but don't hate on fiddy for doing what he's doing. this is great album. i'm not going to make the call on a masterpiece i'll wait till his next album to do this. but this is a good album to listen to and jam to. i can only say that you will not be wasting your money when/if you buy this cd. go pick it up, the lyrics are up to par and of couse the beats are the best [dre did them], so if you don't have it by now, you missing out, don't do that to yourself, cop it ASAP.","This is a great debut album ..

,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4,"Well we know dude is rich. I mean dude was one of the biggest drug dealers in the NY. He got 1 mil to sign with Eminem. He has already made about 1 1/2 mil from his independent CD ""Guess Who's Back""(he got 5 dollars for every CD sold and he's sold abt 250,000 copies already) and This CD has sold about 1.8 million copies in a week and a half. So yeah dude is rich. Is the bang to hype ratio right should be the proper question. I'd have to say yes. Listening to this CD to me is like the first time is saw ""New Jack City"" or heard the infamous GETO BOYS. It's just unadulterated thugism! Being shot 9 times and havin such a horrible childhood really proves to be a backdrop for this CD. The CD starts with ""What up Gangsta"". A cool lil song settin the tone for the rest of the CD. Track 3 ""Patiently Waiting"" features Eminem.. They go real hard on this one. Great sound effects on this one. One of the better cuts on the CD. Track 4 ""Many Men"" is cool but I was really feelin the lyrics, especially when he talks about dude that shot him. Of course track 5 ""In Da Club"" probably will be the club song of the year. I've never heard a song looped so much in the club. They play this song for 10 minutes straight and the club stays hype! Track 6 ""High All the Time"" is his tribute to the sticky icky! Good cut. Track 7 ""Heat"" is classic Dre production. This song is just raw! A gun cocks in the background on the wholeeeee song. Track 8 is another Dre staple song. Track 9 ""Blood Hound"" is a cool song with a nice little chorus. He sounds alot like Bushwick Bill on this one. Track 10 ""Back down"" is one of the CD highlights. Dude rips Ja Rule apart!!!! Track 11 ""P I M P"" is another banger. Track 12 ""Like My Style"" features his crew G UNIT. My  2nd favorite cut on the CD is track 14 ""21 Questions"". It's a Dre production with Nate Dogg. This song is essentially a song talkin to a girl and askin her questions to see where her mind is at. Great song and Nate Dogg hasn't sounded this good in a longgggg time. The beat is off da hook. Track 15 ""Don't Push Me"" features Eminem again and once again is STRONG. Track 16 ""Gotta make it to Heaven, I'm going thru Hell"" pretty much sums up this CD. Just raw East Coast Gansta Rap! ""Wanksta"" makes an appearance here but really it's just a playful radio cut to me. Overall this CD is great. He puts his foot down and even steps to Nas and Jigga. My favorite tracks are 2-11, 14-16. I personally haven't heard anything this raw in a long long time. The hype for this dude is incredible and fortunately the CD comes about as close as it possibly could to that. After a few earchecks this is a must have for the True hip hop fan..","Well we know dude is rich .. I mean dude was one of the biggest drug dealers in the NY ..

,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4,"50 Cent has surprisingly went from ""Most Hated"" to ""Most Anticipated"" to ""Most Celebrated"". You may remember him from 1999's single, ""How to Rob an Industry N"", where he jokingly talked about robbing many famous artists like Mariah Carey (who was on his label, Columbia) while ribbing them at the same time. Not many artists found that funny, the song turned into a gimmick and soon he was dropped from Columbia (maybe it wasn't a good idea to sing about robbing your labelmates???). During his downtime, he made many foes, including Jay-Z (in 1999's ""It's Hot"", Jigga rapped, ""I'm about the dollar/WTF is 50 Cent?""), and I think that he's even been shot more times than 2Pac. But after Eminem picked 50 up and signed him to his Shady Records label, and 50 dropping ""Wanksta"" and a few underground albums with his crew, the ""GGGgggg-uuuUnit!"", the streets embraced him and anticipation was at an all-time high.
Get Rich or Die Tryin' is one of those debut albums that actually lives up to its hype. In fact, if you're in your car playing it to the end, you may just feel like playing the whole album again. While the lyrical content may not break any new ground, 50 Cent, whose flow sounds like a mixture of Jay-Z, 2Pac, and Mase, knows how to deliver it WELL. See ""Gotta Make it to Heaven"" (an otherwise played-out subject matter with gangsta rappers), where he gives the topic an interesting twist, and ""In the Club"", where he takes topics like cars, drinks, and women and make them sound original. Fans may say that song sounds radio-friendly, but he didn't go to mainstream, mainstream went to him.
The production on here is also stellar; not one track sounds similar to another, a problem on most rap albums today. Check out the dark beat on ""Patiently Waiting"" with Eminem and ""21 Questions"" and notice the difference in production. And what would a rap album be without a diss record? (See ""Wanksta"" and the funnier ""Back Down"", both aimed at Ja Rule.)
Even though ""P.I.M.P."" is embarrasingly old-school and lazy on 50's part, Get Rich... is one of those rarities in hip-hop: a highly anticipated album that truly delivers, by a rapper who disregarded gimmicks to let people know why Slim Shady signed him.","50 Cent has surprisingly went from "" Most Hated "" to "" Most Anticipated "" to "" Most Celebrated "" ..

Underground for a long time, nice to see him drop an album commerically, and see that he hasn't sold out on anything.

Ninteen tracks total including intro and 3 bonus tracks. Standout tracks for me at the moment are: ""Patiently Waiting"" Feat.

,B000V6M7TA,1,1,4,"The most historically successful chart climber of all time, better than the Beatles, better than K. Clarkson, and a surprising #1, this song really deserves it. It has all the elements to make it radio-friendly, from the catchiness, to the dancing, to the aspect that makes me karaoke to this song everytime it comes on. Amazingly, this song also sounds better censored too, the language in the original seems out of place and downright weird, but the 'phhh' in this version actually adds to the song.

Overall, I love any non-rap song that makes it to #1 on the Hot 100, but this is one of the better ones to achieve the feat in recent years, along with Avril.

Wake Up Call, the secong single from their sophmore album It Won't Be Soon Before Long is a very upbeat driven song that remains as deep of a staple to what Adam and the band had captured to fans alike for the past several years. It really is a great track from the album, while the lyrics showcase a man who is scorned from a cheating so-called significant other. I hope Maroon 5 can make another great single like this.

,B000V7C370,1,1,5,"Hypothethically, if you made an album of The Beatles' best solo songs, it would make sense to gather them from the early years after their infamous split. This paradigm is not new, and its concept was introduced by a columnist whom I cannot recall, so I have to paraphrase it by memory.

Anyway, I would vote for Ringo Starr's ""Photograph,"" arguably the best song of his post Fab Four career.  Contractually, Ringo was given rights to sing one song per Beatles' album, so this one fits the bill.  Can you ""imagine"" (sorry) an album with ""My Sweet Lord,"" ""Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five,"" ""Imagine,"" ""Love,"" ""My Love,"" ""Listen to What the Man Said,"" ""Give Me Love,"" ""What Is Life?"" ""Whatever Gets You Through the Night,"" and, of course, this one?  If George and Ringo didn't feel like they got the support they desired back in the day, they sure make up for it by (characteristically) supporting each other (George allegedly wrote most of the song) and with a ""little help"" from Ringo's many friends.  Gloriously, ""Photograph"" is as grand and corny as they get.  The rewards are twice that.","Hypothethically , if you made an album of The Beatles ' best solo songs , it would make sense to gather them from the early years after their infamous split ..

John, Paul and George would certainly go on to have hits songs and chart toppers but it always seemed to me that Ringo was over looked a bit in what he accomplished in the years after going out on his own. Yeah he maybe didn't have as big an impact as his former bandmates on the charts but that doesn't mean he wasn't putting out some great music. He most definitely was. The album ""Photograph: The Very Best Of Ringo"" (a greatest hit compilation) is good proof of that. His music maybe didn't have the depth and social message to it as the other former lads were but Ringo's music I always thought was great good times, party kind of music sure to please and entertain anyone looking for some uplifting music.

My favorite Ringo song of all time one of his earliest hits, ""It Don't Come Easy"". Not necessarily one of his ""party"" songs but with a good beat, strong lyrics and Ringo in fine voice makes for an enjoyable piece of music.

,B000V8CBB2,1,1,5,"It's difficult to say if a song is timeless, but ten years later, I could say already. Times have changed, beats, tempos, lyrics have taken the trend of club hits. Enrique now has songs like ""I like it"" and ""Tonight I'm lovin' you."" Mr. Iglesias continues to give us hit after hit.

However, this song is nostalgic already, even just after just ten years.

My thoughts:

- Wonderful pace. The instrumentals, pauses, soft and high notes are perfect and timed well. Many songs are repetitive but you don't sense that from this song. The lyrics and chorus may be similar, but the tone and his voice definitely transforms throughout the song, building with tension, emotion, and heartfelt love.

- Fun to sing out aloud. I sing this song every time I go to a karaoke place. So easy to follow and sing a long. Lots of fun!

- Solid lyrics. Full of metaphors, variety, and rhythm, this song will take you away.","It 's difficult to say if a song is timeless , but ten years later , I could say already ..

 More pop sounding than her 1974 version ""I Will Always Love You"" was produced by her band leader Gregg Perry. Many have said this version is a bit inferior than 1974's, but Dolly's voice here is pure, heartfelt and filled with emotion. Dolly herself was going through a breakdown in her own personal life at the time of this recording in early 1982 as she battled weight problems, family issues, an attempt by people to blackmail her and a personal heartache that she refuses to talk about. This all led to the amazing vocal range on this track.

 Also, the song would only peak at #53 Pop, but would garner Dolly a Grammy nod for Best Country Vocal Performance.","Dolly Parton made music history when she rerecorded her classic "" I Will Always Love You "" for the soundtrack to her 1982 film "" The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas "" ..

,B000V8CJI2,1,1,5,"For anyone wanting to hear the debut of ""I Will Always Love You"" look no further than here. Recorded in June, 1973 at RCA Record's Nashville Sound Studios and released the following year Dolly Parton introduced the world to the greatest song ever written. She had written the tune in honor of her duet partner and mentor Porter Wagoner.

 By 1973 after being the biggest duet team in country music history for 6 years Dolly wanted to go off on her own, conquer the pop music market and star in films. Porter was totally against this as he thought Dolly could never make it in popular music or in motion pictures and he felt Dolly owed him a great deal of gratitude for helping her be so big in the country field. The fighting got worse and the arguing ever worser as Porter refused to reason with Dolly, so Dolly thought to herself, ""You can't talk to this man, so do what you so best: go home and write a song and perhaps he will somehow understand what I need to do"". So, one night in the late spring of 1973 with only her guitar in her music room at her Nashville mansion Dolly wrote ""I Will Always Love You"" in less than an hour. The following day she went to Porter's office, and knowing she was going to go one way or another, told Porter, ""I wrote a song for you"". He sat at his desk and cried all the way through it and told her that was the greatest song she ever wrote.

 When Dolly went into the recording studio to cut ""I Will Always Love You"" a few weeks later she herself cried through the entire song. To this very day it remains one of her greatest recordings.

 ""I Will Always Love You"" came out on Dolly's breathough album ""Jolene"" as the second single, hit #1 and quickly became Dolly's signature song. The following year Linda Ronstadt covered the track on her ""Prisoner in Disguise"" album, although it omitted the last verse.

 Also in 1975 ""I Will Always Love You"" (Dolly's original version) made its first ever appearance on film in Martin Scorsese's ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" when the character of Alice takes a break from singing in the bar she works at and is having a talk with her soon-to-be boyfriend. Unfortunately, Dolly nor the song did not receive screen credit.","For anyone wanting to hear the debut of "" I Will Always Love You "" look no further than here ..

Last summer had its share of good music as always, and we at least had a little variety on the radio. Enter, Fergie, the seemingly sex-crazed double-entree singer who sung about her humps, and London Bridge, and a myriad of other metaphors. But this time, instead of doing that stuff, it's a breakup song, with acoustic guitar, and only the hint of a beat.

The lyrics aren't too bad, pretty simple, with hints of 'where did that come from?' Such as, ""We'll play jacks and uno cards."" The verses are overall OK, nothing to brag about, and the vocals lack in some parts. However, the chorus comes out strong, and it and the acoustic guitar really make this a good song.

So overall, a good song, not a great one. A great change for Fergie, and definitely her best song by far, Black Eyed Peas or not. But in terms of getting this song, I wouldn't buy it, but I'd get it by other means if you know what I mean.","Fergie 's Best Is n't That Great , March 19 , 2008.

,B000V9AUC8,1,1,4,"There is so much you can say about Fergie from her fame as part of The Black Eyed Peas. But, her solo debut The Dutchess has had a few surprise songs. Big Girls Don't Cry, the third single from that album is a very heartfelt, and down to Earth ballad. It is a real departure from her other hit songs which are more upbeat. It has a simplistic feel that matches that is very mellow and elequent. I like the song a whole lot, because it shows a more natural tone to Fergie's soulful voice, and what she does to make it worth while. I really hope Fergie can keep making more songs like this one on her next record, or with The Black Eyed Peas.

,B000VAMKRA,-1,-1,1,"This song is supposed to be a summer love song, that's sweet and cute, but let me say, Taylor Swift blows this out of the water, and half-way across Asia. Ironically, the two are doing a duet, which is like Rosie O' Donnell doing a duet with Leona Lewis. Totally mismatched.

All sarcasm aside, the song has more cheese than Wisconsin, more horrid sounds than a Chinese takeout kitchen, and more annoyingness than Rosanne. Really, whenever I'm forced to listen to this song at the gas station, I want to light a match, and drop it.

Boyce Avenue's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for, but it's still a 4-star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history. What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it's sort of catchy. It's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity. So in summarizing, don't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds, because you'll choke, and don't listen while you're depressed, because you'll kill yourself.

Here are the titles we've read bout over the years and had to the chance to hear in part on the Anthology installment I.

The stars? Harrison and McCartney. I think George's stuff here could have been freeze-dried for a hearty repast on any number of 1963-64 Beatles l.p.s.

The big reason I bought this CD are the three Lennon and McCartney compositions, ""Like Dreamers Do"", ""Hello, Little Girl"", and ""Love of the Loved"", which originally arrived via Beatles' friends' discs. ""Dreamers"" might catch the extra attention of Roy Orbison fans, as the title sings out the same phrase from Roy's Classic, ""In Dreams"".

"" Dreamers "" might catch the extra attention of Roy Orbison fans , as the title sings out the same phrase from Roy 's Classic , "" In Dreams "" .. Sound is very good , not great - VG is not up to standards .. Hence , 4 big ones , not 5 ."

The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable.

Sure its raw and whatever else.  Whoopee.  On a decent sound system it sounds quite good as it has a pretty clean sound.  And it also shows that Ringo was the better choice for drummer.  He just had the edge on Pete.  Having said that, Pete Best did a pretty darn good job.

,B000VRNCBQ,1,1,5,"Where Have I Known You Before proves to me once AGAIN exactly how much different (and better) jazz from the 70's was. This is *phenomenal* instrumental playing.

It's not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination. These band members had a unique ability to really make you open your mind and appreciate instrumental chops played tastefully and creatively, and chops that are constantly full of passion and energy.  You feel like you're getting a complete experience when you hear albums like this one.

This is perhaps one of the finest recordings from the mid 70's you will ever hear, right next to the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Visions of the Emerald Beyond.  I seriously mean that.  Yes, I've heard quite a bit of albums around the same time Where Have I Known You Before was released, and despite the fact this album wasn't exactly popular doesn't really MEAN anything when it comes down to it.  What matters is that I've heard the album, and I'm trying my best to convince YOU why you need to hear it.

The fact that instrumental skills of THIS caliber actually exist, and have been laid down on tape for this recording, really proves to me Return to Forever were more than just a talented group of fellows. This is a band that really gave listeners a challenging and lasting experience.

The keyboard playing is a constant feature of the album. Tastefully played, engaging, and always being displayed in a way that proves the keyboard player is giving everything he has and then some. The guitar playing is the same way. More passion than most guitar players would be able to lay down, that's for sure.

Again I have to ask the magic question- THIS is jazz?  The lengthy and intense keyboard and guitar jams that come and go are considered jazzy?  Are you sure this kind of music doesn't belong in the rock camp? Perhaps rock fusion is the appropriate choice of words.

The album cover shows a sun appearing in a hazy red sky. The only thing hazy about these compositions are the images you get in your head. The music is certainly nothing hazy, or unorganized, or played lazily, or ANYTHING like that- this is just a straight up perfect example of jazz that at one point in time wasn't afraid to be as experimental as possible.

Does Where Have I Known You Before leave a lasting impression? You BET it does. A positive one at that. I'm more than happy giving an album with such brilliant instrumental playing a perfect 5 stars. Replay value is important to me as well, and this album most certainly delivers in that respect.

If you're someone just getting into jazz and would like to hear a fantastic piece of music, check out THIS album. You will be blown away by many moments among all the instrumental jams, I guarantee it.  You simply must check out the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jade Warrior, Camel and Santana as well because these bands have their fair share of music focusing on jazzy and tasteful instrumental chops as well.","Where Have I Known You Before proves to me once AGAIN exactly how much different ( and better ) jazz from the 70 's was ..

,B000VRNCBQ,1,1,5,"This is one Return to Forever album that somehow passed me by and I am not quite sure how (or why) because it is phenomenally good and ranks right up there as one of my favorite RTF albums.  The style of music on Where Have I Known You Before (1974) is somewhat similar to Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973) although there is a bit more in the way of softer textures, making for a very balanced listening experience.

The lineup at this point included Chick Corea (Fender Rhodes electric piano, acoustic piano, clavinet, Yamaha organ, ARP Odyssey synthesizer, and percussion); bassist extraordinaire Stanley Clarke (Alembic electric bass guitar, Yamaha organ, bell tree, chimes; excellent drummer Lenny White (drums, percussion); and newcomer Al Di Meola (electric and acoustic guitars; acoustic 12 string guitar).  I think it goes without saying that this is a musician's band.  These guys are all unbelievably talented, with Stanley Clarke setting new standards for performance on the bass that would be equaled by few - this guy is mind-blowingly fast.  For his first time playing with RTF (Al was 19 at the time), Al does an incredible job, although his playing is not as dominant in the mix as it would become on later albums.  With this album, Chick had started weaving synthesizers into the RTF sound and he gets some great tone colors out of the ARP Odyssey on this album, which is plastered everywhere.  As a huge fan of progressive rock and electronica, I do not mind the analog synthesizer use at all, although some jazz fans might be turned off.

The eight tracks on the album range in length from 1'02"" to the 14'21"" Song to the Pharoah Kings suite.  In terms of the music, it is an incredible amalgamation of jazz; jazz rock; progressive rock; space rock; funk and even a tiny bit of classical - more like a proggy jazz rock actually.  In fact, as a progger, I really appreciate the dense arrangements and virtuosity.  Speaking of which, just about every odd time signature under the sun is used on Where Have I Known You Before and there is some incredibly complex ensemble work.

Sandwiched in-between the highly electric rave-ups are three of Chick's acoustic piano improvisations including Where Have I Loved You Before; Where Have I Danced With You Before; and Where Have I Known You Before.  This is the closest this album comes to sounding like traditional jazz and showcases Chick's considerable talents on the acoustic piano.  The softer acoustic tracks provide a nice contrast with the highly charged electric tracks.  Earth Juice is the ""funkiest"" piece on the album, although this funk is pretty far removed from Sly and the Family Stone.  Of course, Chick's work on the clavinet here and there on the album really lends to the funkiness.  The suite that closes the album out is a high point for me and opens with a great synthesizer arrangement, which then launches into some extremely complicated ensemble work that sounds very similar to some of the music that was coming out of the English progressive rock scene at the time.  Although there are solos on this lengthy track, they are really very interesting and are seamlessly integrated with the arrangement - in fact, they sound pre-composed.

Although it may not appear to be the case, this Verve release was remastered (albeit a low budget remaster), and the sound quality is very good.  There are a few photos of the band and a lengthy bit of ""cosmic"" verse from Neville Potter.  The imagery of the words is both colorful and evocative.

All in all this is an excellent RTF album (my ""new"" personal favorite) and is very highly recommended along with Romantic Warrior (1976).  Proggers should definitely check this album out.","This is one Return to Forever album that somehow passed me by and I am not quite sure how ( or why ) because it is phenomenally good and ranks right up there as one of my favorite RTF albums ..

,B000VRTJI6,1,1,5,"The punk rock world was in a questionable state by the turn of the millennium.  One group that undoubtedly ruled the '90s scene -- Green Day, in October of 2000, would issue a nearly-all-acoustic record (""Warning""), which, while being okay, seemed to signal a change in direction, that could have been seen as a death-knell for the genre.  Were it not, that is, for a new crop of young bands, all of whom were just pre-teens in 1994 when Green Day released ""Dookie,"" that emerged around this time to save the day and inject some much-needed youthful vitriol to the sound.

Perhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto, Ontario's Sum 41, who began recording their second release and the album being reviewed, ""All Killer, No Filler"", in October of Y2K, just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew.

Wow!  Talk about this record being a return to form for punk!  After a mood-setting intro, on track number two ""Nothing On My Back,"" the listener is introduced to the band's striking, distinctive, and razor-sharp guitar sound, which was equal parts traditional punk-rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude.  It is a guitar tone that is truly raw, inspired, and decidedly ""old school"" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow.  Often imitated, but never duplicated, because no one ever did it again like Sum did.

And yet, on this same opener, it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up, and then some!  From vocalist/co-guitarist Deryck Whibley's ultra-memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone's well-placed and twanging mid-song interlude, these guys prove they're the real deal, and it doesn't let up from there.  This cut segues into the 50-second ""Never Wake Up,"" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I've heard.  The two best songs, though, lie in the disc's second half.  One is ""Summer,"" a rerecording from the group's debut ""Half Hour of Power,"" and boy, is it a masterpiece!  The main driving force in it is a simple, three-chord progression, but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective.  And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days!  No doubt, one of Sum's signature tunes.  Perhaps my all-time favorite, though, is track number ten, ""Crazy Amanda Bunkface.""  This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss, and Deryck's raging guitar solo, which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day's earlier ""Haushinka,"" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria.  Again, a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk.

And there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music, with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found, that will surely have you putting ""All Killer, No Filler"" on repeat.  I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily, and almost exactly 15 years on from its release, it hasn't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you.  I want to add that I'm 41 (incidentally) and have been listening to underground punk rock (Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, the F.U.'s, et al) for decades, and I still think that ""All Killer, No Filler"" is among the best-crafted punk LPs in my collection, with perhaps the highest replay value of them all.

The band received radio and televised airplay like crazy. Sum-41 also landed soundtrack spots for copilation CD's, the film Spider-man, and the television show Malcom In The Middle. It was clear that the public had finally come around to listening to the punk group's music. The public had good reason. Sum-41 has a great sense of when and how much distortion to use in their very interesting and fast paced rhythm changes. The guitars have a great taste in creating simple but very unique melodies. The bass gives the extra fill in creating the band's harmonies, and the drums keep everything together. The lyrics to ALL KILLER NO FILLER are amusing and can even be considered to be slightly contraversial for the track ""Fat Lip"". The lyricist makes honest and ""in your ears"" remarks about society and its expectations of its citizens.

,B000VRQPLA,1,1,5,"Blue Merle--file them away in that place in your mind where you put scents long remembered, summer mornings when the roses have been out a little too long and the air is full of their fragrance, lovely and sweet.  This is music to explore, like a boy explores the cliff in the woods outside his house, delighted to find so many things to do and see.  This is music for lakes, and for rivers, and for ice-cream.

Much has been made of the resemblance between Luke's voice and that of the lead singer of Coldplay.  Indeed, his voice is eerily similar; fortunately, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Chris's voice is emotive and anguished, and Luke's is much the same, which suits this lovely music perfectly. Some might persuasively argue that it would better serve Blue Merle to have a vocalist with a voice more uniquely his own.  While a voice less reminiscent of that of Coldplay might be desirable for some, ultimately, no one can deny the power and maturity with which Luke uses his voice.  Did Chris influence him?  Probably.  There is no crime in that.  Could Luke have chosen to sing in a different style?  Perhaps.  But would that have suited the music as well? Probably not.  I think that he was blessed with a voice that performs well in the style in which he has chosen to use it, and we should be grateful.  Maturity and further listening will probably help to separate the two in our minds as the bands grow in different directions.  Musically, the two bands are not that similar, although there is much to admire in Blue Merle for fanatics of Coldplay.

Now, about the music itself?  At the risk of sounding trite, the  guitars really do shimmer, the banjos sparkle in a setting of solid drumming and inventive bass.  The lyrics are excellent, and reveal more on repeated listening, which is a benchmark which I use to decide who gets my 5th star or not.  The entire album is excellent, no weak tracks, and the more I hear it, the more glad I am to listen to it.  Some might consider it a flaw that there is no one ""stand out"" track--no one track that is so instantly memorable or catchy as to be the obvious single.  But this is not music for singles, a treat to be digested quickly and best given with insulin--it is music for sustenance.

For fans of Coldplay, John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows and Jeff Buckley, this is likely a band to watch and an album to love instantly, suitable to for enthusiastic recommendation to friends.  For fans of the well crafted pop song, this album is reason for excitement as well, especially if you like your pop drenched in complicated guitar work and gilded with a newgrass sensibility.  For everyone else, find out what you are missing.  Blue Merle are worth the ride.","Blue Merle -- file them away in that place in your mind where you put scents long remembered , summer mornings when the roses have been out a little too long and the air is full of their fragrance , lovely and sweet ..

,B000VSNSM8,1,1,5,"Blowing off enough steam to trounce a dozen Don Juan wanna-be's - Alicia Bridges power punches her way through the classic 'disco dancing' ballad ""I Love The Nightlife""; with no more than an original set of vocals, wildly emotive inflections & intonations (that easily set fire to the 'serious self-stature' themes in the song), a dizzying display of 'unrelenting feminine' provocativeness, and commanding control of her deeply emotional crescendos.

We take in her message to unfaithful boyfriends, how they line up in her perception of romance, and how she deals with their galavanting all over town - thinking she would stay home and stitch their socks. More couples danced way into the night in wild excitement with this one song - than anyone could imagine - from Moscow to Manhattan - from Paris to Omaha. There is so much life, vigor, and honesty in this song with the trumpets blaring their triumphant salute to her 'stand your ground if he messes around' anthem for women throughout the world. A truly remarkable accomplishment for the artists involved. Written by Bridges and Susan Hutcheson; produced by Steve Buckingham.

""Please don't talk about love tonight.
Your sweet talking won't make it right.
Love and lies just bring me down
when you've got women all over town.
You can love them all and when you're through,
maybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you.
I got to go where the people dance.
I want some action ... I want to live!

Action ... I got so much to give.
I want to give it. I want to get some too.

Oh, I ... Ohhh I ... I love the nightlife,
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
Oh, I love the night life,
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.""","Blowing off enough steam to trounce a dozen Don Juan wanna - be 's - Alicia Bridges power punches her way through the classic ' disco dancing ' ballad "" I Love The Nightlife "" ; with no more than an original set of vocals , wildly emotive inflections & intonations ( that easily set fire to the ' serious self - stature ' themes in the song ) , a dizzying display of ' unrelenting feminine ' provocativeness , and commanding control of her deeply emotional crescendos ..

Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title. Christmas doesn't have to extravagant but it should be happy,nice,peaceful,comfortable,and enjoyable. If it weren't for Frank Sinatra we wouldn't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging. The original version had somewhat different lyrics. The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung. ""In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow. Until then we'll just have to muddle through somehow."" Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him ""I like your Christmas song"" but that he needed that line ""jollied up"" to include the piece on his Christmas album. Sinatra said ""The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly that line up for me?"" And,of course,as Martin put it ""You don't say no to Frank Sinatra."" The new lyrics in this line became ""Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow. Hang a shining star upon the highest bough."" Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics.

But of all of them from the 80's, the one that stands out intimately the most is Sacrifice from his 1989 album Sleeping With The Past. It is a very classic piano ballad that sits well, where in a era of songs that were tacky and not as strong from Elton, because of his abuse and marriage ended, it still stands absolutely tall from Elton in voice and harmony. If you're new to Elton John, this is a nice download as well as for die hard Elton John fans, and that is a sacrifice worth taking.

However, I think that it can also be  a positive love song about two people who are in a relationship together who also keep on the rose-colored glasses (metaphorically speaking) even after they have been together for a long time.","Wonderful by Eric Clapton is a heartfelt classic love rock song that covers what it feels like to be with someone who sees the inner and outer beauty of you ..

I would recommend this song to anyone, it's truly not your typical Eminem song, if you liked Lose Yourself by him you will love this one.

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording.

Don't you know that there

Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe.""","Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity , depth , and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "" Ai n't No Mountain High Enough "" ; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross ; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson .. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition .. We are lost in its lyrical poetry .. We are captured by Ross ' genteel and unique voicing , inflections , and intonations ; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity .. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it .. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic .. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song ' secreting ' itself into our memory or ' relaxing ' in our romantic , nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning , enrichment , and themes so present in this joyous , uplifting recording .. "" Just send for me , oh baby .. "" 

 "" Remember the day I set you free 
 I told you you could always count on me 
 From that day on , I made a vow , 
 I 'll be there when you want me , 
 Some way , some how .. 'Cause baby there ai n't no mountain high enough , 
 Ai n't no valley low enough , 
 Ai n't no river wide enough 
 To keep me from getting to you babe .. My love is alive 
 Way down in my heart 
 Although we are miles apart 
 If you ever need a helping hand , 
 I 'll be there on the double 
 As fast as I can .. Do n't you know that there 

 Ai n't no mountain high enough , 
 Ai n't no valley low enough , 
 Ai n't no river wide enough 
 To keep me from getting to you babe . """

,B000VWOQIY,1,1,5,"I'm going to do something that some of you out there reading might consider highly unusual.  I'm going to pick this song apart and explain why each and every part of it is so irresistibly awesome.  ""Reflections"" might just be the greatest song Diana Ross & the Supremes ever released.  This song must have come on the radio a million times throughout the country over the years, and I wouldn't mind listening to it a million times myself.  Here we go!

It starts off on an unusual note for the first few seconds with swirling machinery-type sounds that seems totally out of place at first but now that I've heard the song so many times, I believe these chaotic sounds are supposed to represent the confusion and emotional distraught that Diana Ross feels through her rollercoaster emotional state of mind.

Then Diana Ross begins to sing... and her voice *alone* is brilliant.  It sounds so tender with *just* the right hoarse sound.  Like a young woman who's finally had enough of having someone hold her down, so she's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels.  Like she's on stage and it's her turn to speak, or sing in this case, what's on her mind.  I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger.  I LOVE it!

Then we have the Supremes providing the really somber and suspense-building ""ooooo, oo-oo-oo"" behind Diana's powerful vocals.  Listen to the perfectly executed way the ""oooo"" dreamily soothes and creates tension during the way Diana sings the line ""Through the mirrors of my mind, through these tears I am crying"".  With the Supremes providing back-up, now this song takes on a whole new meaning.  Without the Supremes Diana's vocals would have been great as it is, but WITH the Supremes?  Now it's just insanely good!

What proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line ""I'm all alone now, no love to shield me, trapped in a world of distorted reality"".  Suddenly, during this particular line, the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone.  What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past, they feel cold and angry.  If my words aren't clear, this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is.

It took me a LONG time to notice there's a speedy bass section playing in the background, and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change.  It's brief and easy to not notice unless you're playing REALLY close attention.  And how about the orchestration at the 1:50 mark?  It's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana's emotions all coming to a head and she's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible.  This is ANOTHER really powerful moment.  Granted, my interpretation probably isn't the same as Diana's, but that's okay- we all interpret music differently.

The song finishes on a more optimistic note with dramatically more promising vibes the way Diana Ross demandingly sings ""Reflections of, the way life used to be"" with a pounding rhythm illustrating a brighter future.  The tone of the song right here at this point seems to paint a picture of someone who's learned to move on from a troubled relationship and won't dare repeat the same mistakes again.

And just to throw in some humor, it's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- ""In the UFO!""  No Diana is actually saying ""In the you and I"" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here.  BUT!  If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions (in the beginning and when Diana sings the line ""happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories"" and the line near the end ""I see a dream that's lost from the hurt you have caused"") you could actually be led to believe she's singing about UFO's, haha.

So what is it about ""Reflections"" that is so magnificent?  It's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned.  Sadness, optimism, worry, fear, deserted... these are just some of the feelings I experience.  If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do, you should be able to detect all these emotions and more!  Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3-minute song, and that my friends is downright amazing.","I 'm going to do something that some of you out there reading might consider highly unusual ..

 If you love ballads or mellow songs that are a cut different than your standard pop tune that are still catchy and beautiful you must do yourself a favor and check out Blue Eyes ."

,B000VWSIC4,1,1,4,"The Fox is one of Elton's least known outputs in his entire catalouge.  It justed missed the top 20 (in the US) upon its release in May, 1981.  It also marked a transitional period in his career, coming off the sometimes successful but ultimately unfocused albums like 21 at 33 to the more straight ahead pop smarts of Too Low for Zero.  Although The Fox leans much more toward the unfocusedness of 21 at 33, due to the mishmash of writing partners and use of outside musicians in places, it is a much more interesting and satisfying experience than anything he had turned out in years.

I find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit, prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory.  As a few reviewers have noted previously, this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas (who would also produce his next 3 albums). Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement.  This ambition shows up in songs like ""Fascist Faces"", the beautiful instrumental trio ""Carla/Etude/Fanfare"" and the more traditional love ballad ""Chloe.""  The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir, a full string orchestra, and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this isn't meant to be a cohesive statement, but meant to try to satisfy trends and make ""the cutting edge"" for 1981.  Most of the time, it acheives this due to Elton's tunefulness and ultra-competent instrumentation.

Highlights of the album are many and scattered throughout.  It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit.  While ""Just Like Belgium"" is fun and lively, it really doesn't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks, and ""Heels of the Wind"" seems unneccessary, almost like an afterthought.  Big departures from his previous work are the tracks ""Heart in the Right Place"" with its forceful, blues-rock tone and ""Fascist Faces"" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir.  Both tracks are propelled by the biting, metalish guitar play of Richie Zito, which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton's canon.

In the end, The Fox is far from a masterpiece along the lines of Honky Chateau or Yellow Brick Road, but it is one of the most interesting in Elton's now 35 + year solo career.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the more arty side of what would become ""I'm Still Standing"" and ""Sad Songs"" just a few years down the road.","The Fox is one of Elton 's least known outputs in his entire catalouge ..

,B000VWSIC4,1,1,4,"You know what to expect from Elton John, some nice, lush ballads, a few uptempo numbers and a little bit of rock. Nice melodies, mot so much passion, but a lyrics sheet that, no matter how one tried, could not find a single reference to his sexuality, except Big Dipper.

And so 'The Fox' goes, his usual servings of pop, still using self-serving metaphors (But 'The Fox' is a long way to plummet from 'Captain Fantastic' don't ya think?) (And who's fault is this anyway, It's not as if Elton writes the lyrics, or does he?? Did Bernie Taupin really bestowe the crown of 'Captain Fantastic' on Elton, while relegating himself to role of 'Brown dirt cowboy'?)

But The Fox is a surprise. Although it is not an experimental album, fairly straight-forward, it is still a very inspired album. From the sleazy-journo ode 'Heart's in the right p;ace' to classical music 'Carla Etude' and the all-our rocking opener 'Breaking down barriers', the songs on 'The Fox' are very solid and enjoyable. There is also a lot of diversity here too. Rating 3 1/2 or 3 3/4 or something like that, worth rounding up.

But if you are hoping for a return to his country-rock days; you'll be disappointed, you'll have to wait for the last song and even then you won't get any humility: ""And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
'Cause I am the fox, like it or not"".
But who wants humility in their rock music anyway? I DO!!

It is filled with great uptempo, complex arrangments like, ""Breaking Down Barriers"" and""Fascist Faces"".  ""Just Like Belgium"" is one of Elton's most upbeat romantic songs since the mid-seventies and ""Carla/Etude/Fanfare"" (which runs into) ""Chloe"" is a testament to Elton John's creativity.  However, the best song on the album and the only single, ""Nobody Wins"" beats out the rest for arrangment, lyrics and heartfelt tearjerking.  Amazingly, this single is omitted from all collections.

,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5,"Oh yeah, if you are looking to have your brain slammed back and forth from one ear to the other ear, this is the one! I have heralded only one track/song by the Queens as the ultimate new age piece destined to become the fashion of the new generation in 2013 and beyond (actually it came out on the airwaves years earlier) and it is one of the two and only two (so far) pieces they were able to write and play that I really love and enjoy hearing it over and over again so much that I would buy the album. The superior details of my pick as the new age tune of the coming age are;
first the subject which carries a universal message that everything they tell you or feed to you isn't True. There is a mystical truth that no one knows but you can know if you want to. Simple, right? Nothing earth shattering about that, but I find such deeper nuances and openings to a deeper or higher truth in it every time I hear it.
  Second is the orchestration of the piece, and the organization of my perfect song is wonderful. It begins with string entry on electric guitar, (although I've seen the tall guy banging away on an acoustical guitar in concert) . First thing is a tentative mid range chord swipe followed by a second bold strum using the same chord then blazing away into the chords banged as a rhythm, with varying chords that raise up to the high range and then cut off by a single plucked string that's allowed to fade off for a while a second or two and that leads into the voice singing in a soft tone, suggesting a secret whispered into your ear then raising to a pitch that wails across the table at a bistro you're sitting at with him. As the singer carries on with his performance the harmonizing players join on key notes while the electric guitars jam on at a feverous rate, keeping the same rhythm and beat underneath them swelling when there's a pause in the song, eddying away after he rejoins until without warning  (well, I know where and when by now) it all freezes, stops suddenly and there is only the bass thrum of a string , low and reverberating, steady and carrying the whole band, the world and the secret on it's powerful,confident back. That all too brief sound  is the one I wait for as I fall under its spell and it tells me the secret and the meaning that no one knows. I didn't know what to do about the ending going into a Mexican radio station and the announcer crying ""avey,..avay,..avey,..aiyee..."" but now I do know that the Queens had cradled the entire album around and within leaps into various broadcast stations in order to carry the secret out into the world  and seek a change, I have come to enjoy the brash announcer as another performer doing a job, yet a part of mysteries beyond us. The second song on this album is the Mosquito song, perhaps a dig at music producers and bean counters who would suck the life out of composers and performers? however one that I have come to interpret as music of another creation that is living and composing music in its own way and I avoid judgement on its efforts. For sure the whine of a mosquito gives me chills and snags my interest as I prepare to fend it (her?) away from my flesh, but there's something broadcast-y and remenisent about the sound she makes resembling the whine on a radio being tuned in. As of yet I haven't found a single song I would say I can stand after those two, but the ease,flexibility, quality is above average and excellent.","Oh yeah , if you are looking to have your brain slammed back and forth from one ear to the other ear , this is the one !.

,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease. On the other hand it's both historic and great music. The historic aspect is this is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come.

Listen to the sound samples on this page and even those short snippets will reveal the magic of this album. I am not going to try to dissect the music or impose my personal taste on you, but if you love swinging and tight quartets with a piano and vibraphone in front you will be more than pleased with this album.

While I promised to not dissect the music I will say that the intensity that Jackson brings to the performances match the backing trio - Peterson and bassist Ray Brown in particular were renown for intensity even on ballads, and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well. So the chemistry among the four is natural and one of the reasons why this album appeals to me.

The album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two sessions (September 15 and 18, 1961.)  Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions, two of which are logged as 'untitled Peterson originals' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue. Regardless, the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile.","At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease ..

,B000VZJS84,1,1,4,"The reunion of the ""very tall band"" whet my appetite for the first meeting.  Musically, it doesn't disappoint.  From the very first track, ""On Green Dolphin Street,"" Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint, drawing the listener in as on few other recordings (he's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis).  And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes, he's neither intrusive nor overwhelming.  In fact, he's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session.  And Bags is, as usual, the master of bop and blues, a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets (Gary Burton would cut the rotators, add two more mallets, and take the instrument in a different direction).  As recently as 5 years earlier, Milt was still playing with fast-spinning rotators, but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place.  (To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ, if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis, check out ""Bags and Trane."")

One caveat: the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment.  Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of ""stereophonic sound"" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms.  Oscar's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted; Ed Thigpen's drums lack dispersion and upper-register presence. In fact, there's a slightly ""canned"" quality to the overall sound, making you want to take the lid off.  I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording, they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound.  (Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import.  Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money.)","The reunion of the "" very tall band "" whet my appetite for the first meeting ..

,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"This is a Jazz album that everyone should have in their collection. The Oscar Peterson Trio is joined Milt Jackson and what a beautiful album they create together.

Recorded in 1961 the album starts with On Green Dolphin Street. This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson's very restrained and delicate Piano solo. Even when the solo reaches the swing section there aren't the torrents of notes that you might expect. This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent.

Of course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers. In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell. Milt Jackson plays with a fire that, to me, was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ. Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming. He really hits some great accents when you really don't expect them - and they work! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good.

Sadly only Oscar Peterson survives from this marvellous quartet at the time of writing. This disc captures them all at the height of their abilities and is an essential purchase.","The Oscar Peterson Trio is joined Milt Jackson and what a beautiful album they create together ..

,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961, along came the other two members of Oscar's trio, Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD, Brown and Thigpen were great players, and add a lot to the success of this effort. The opener, ""Green Dolphin Street"" is relaxed, but ""Heartstrings"" and ""Work Song"" jump. Then comes the wonderful, almost eight-minute take on ""John Brown's Body"" that soars. The final two cuts, ""A Wonderful Guy"" and ""Reunion Blues"" are also superb. Milt and Oscar, of course, went on to do great work up to the mid-90's, but they were already old pros 41 years ago. If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz, play this for him or her. It's a perfect blend of the four instruments and a great introduction to the category.","When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961 , along came the other two members of Oscar 's trio , Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums ..

,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"Just a perfect record.  There is so much swing in this LP, and it comes out of a handful of instruments.
The vibes rule the record, but it is Peterson's piano that holds down the fort from beginning to end.  Tasty bass, economic drums, and a sharp choice of tunes.
The soft intro will fool you.  Two minutes in you will find yourself ready to move with it, and it doesn't let go.
I have gone through 3 copies of this record--2 vinyl and 1 CD--over the past 20 years, and I never get tired of it.
This ranks with the best of Mingus or Miles Davis, in my book.","Just a perfect record .. There is so much swing in this LP , and it comes out of a handful of instruments ..

,B000VZLMWO,1,1,5,"""The Middle"" by Jimmy Eat World is a positive song about having the self-confidence to see your own beauty and great qualities in yourself regardless of what others may think. This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can, and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life. I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think (also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would). Last, but not least, this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong (thick-skinned), and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine. My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner:

It just takes some time
Little Girl You're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

  ""The Middle"" is a brilliant track that applies to both men and women from all walks of life even with taking the ""little girl"" metaphor into account. I suggest this song (with absolute self-confidence) if you know that events in your life are going to unfold perfectly and in a joyful manner, but you also crave listening to a song that powerfully gives this reminder (in addition to sending the message to always see your personal beauty and unlimited power regardless of how others may treat you)",""" The Middle "" by Jimmy Eat World is a positive song about having the self - confidence to see your own beauty and great qualities in yourself regardless of what others may think ..

,B000VZO4QU,1,1,5,"Apparently Britain knows something us Americans don't... This song is the best thing to come out of dance since 'Canned Heat.' Written by the legendary Elton John, Scissor Sisters single handily bring back the dance scene, if only for a few gay, happy, short minutes. But really folks, you can't get through this song without at least tapping your toes. In fact, Larry Craig probably did his scandalous foot things to this song.

This song is incredibly catchy, and impossible not to love once you get into it. And the dance factor is cranked up to max here. Whether it be in a closet, or an empty room, or a bar, or a club, rest assured, you'll dance at some point. The vocals, the beats, and the music completely fit the song. And in fact, the structure is perfect for creating all those classic dance vibes.

Overall, a pleasurable experience that really brings back the True dance movement. Not those thumping, trance remixes they put out today, but the quality stuff. So check out this song, you probably haven't heard it here, but it was a huge hit in Britain, so see what you're missing, cause this song is just plain fun.","Apparently Britain knows something us Americans do n't ....

I heard this song a few years back, it was playing in the background of a car commercial and everyone in the room wanted to know the name and who sang it. I had to find it and add it to my collection. Since then, I've heard it on 3 more commercials and it was on Lincoln Lawyer soundtrack, and featured in the movie The Italian Job. From the time the music starts playing, you know you're in for a treat and you get it. The music is upbeat and the melody is sweet. Marlena's voice is on point; it's uniquely powerful and full of soul. She has great control of her instrument and you get swept up in the soulful way she delivers each and every note. This song is still going strong and this is a testament to how great of a singer she is. It's no wonder - California Soul has been sampled over and over by rappers (Gang Starr, The Game, etc.), beer manufacturers, Dockers, countless television commercials and a driving game - Driver: San Frisco. I like the album, but I LOVE THIS SONG. You can't listen to it once, you have to play it over and over because it's so good. It's a timeless classic.

,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,"KISS is a rock n roll band. In the 1970-80s era, they embodied an aspect of rock alongside the Who, the Stones and the others. Most of their music is high testosterone, like ""Strutter,"" ""Hard Luck Woman,"" and ""I Was Made for Loving You,"" bordering on self-parody. They were and are fun.

Then there's ""Beth."" It is a quiet song, but is gritty in its message. It isn't a metal ballad, but could have just easily been performed by Bread. There is depth, passion, and love. It is poetic, melodic, and, in my opinion, has earned its spot as one of rock music's greatest songs.

If the rest of KISS' songwriting was on par with ""Beth,"" KISS could've been more than a fun band stuck its era, but had a legacy to last until the end of rock n roll.

It begins:

Beth, I hear you callin'
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playin'
And we just can't find the sound

It ends:
Beth, I know you're lonely
And I hope you'll be alright
'Cause me and the boys will be playin'
All night

Look, if you are reading this review, you already know the song. Nothing here that's new. I suppose my review is for that one guy on the planet who loves KISS but magically, mysteriously missed this song. Is that even possible?

,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5,"The 90s backlash has been ugly, with this not only 90s classic, but music classic being pushed aside since radio chewed it up and spit it back out, 1,000 spins later. It still lives on in the minds of millions of fans who still put this high up on their life's soundtrack.

It's a song that runs on a million trains of thoughts, ranging from karma, to self-appreciation, to celebrity-bashing. It's certainly ground-breakingly awesome, bringing awesomeness to another level not only in the world of pop rock, but music period. Hearkening back to those piano-driven pop ballads of the 70s, this outwardly simple song holds a lot of complexity to it. Just ask U2 guitarist/song-writer ""The Edge."" When asked in Time Magazine back in '06 what songs he would most like to have written, there was ""Wonderwall,"" and ""You Get What You Give."" And even though some would say it's a throwback to years gone by, it keeps itself a modern eye, staying relevant not only in the 90s, but also in the 00s.

Then you gotta love those vocals, using the False, and they're just so perfect for the song. And again, it's a throwback to the 70s. As for the last few verses, although some outlets have cut them, I don't really care about them, and they kind box the song in the 90s a little bit too much. Although the way he sings it is great, it's kind of here nor there, didn't need that.

So looking at best 90s songs, this ranks in the top 10, which is pretty impressive considering the litnia of the decade. Once the brutal 90s backlash is over this song and ones like it will once again receive the credit they deserve, but until then, ""You Get What You Give"" will play on as the soundtrack for a moment in time, forever frozen in splendor.","The 90s backlash has been ugly , with this not only 90s classic , but music classic being pushed aside since radio chewed it up and spit it back out , 1,000 spins later ..

,B000VZV70Q,1,1,5,"If you don't like drive-thru records or TSL, why do you feel you're qualified to rate this record? I swear i'll never understand why people feel the need to trash on something simply becuase they don't like it.

Despite what you'll hear from these retards below me, TSL's ""say it like you mean it"" is legendary, marking one of the last good DTR releases, before they went downhill. Each one of the record's 13 songs are amazing, and no two sound similar in the least. High production value and good mixing only add to this records greatness, and you'll probably have it in your cd for more than a couple weeks before moving on to something else.

Standouts would have to include the infectious ""up and go"", the first single ""best of me"", the punk rocker ""hello houston"" and the somber acoustic ballad ""the drama summer"". Other noteworthy tracks include: ""the leaving song"" and ""left coast envy"". Pretty much any fan of pop-rock in general can find something to appreciate on ""say it"", and because replay value is so high, you find that the songs that just didn't stick before get better and better with time

TSL has since released a load of crap called ""based on a True story"". This record is nothing like ""say it"", and if you're only going to buy one TSL record, make it ""say it like you mean it"". I seriously hope these guys can come out of their slump and put out an amazing third release.","If you do n't like drive - thru records or TSL , why do you feel you 're qualified to rate this record ?.

With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression. It is just a tragic reminder of how very fragile someone's life can really be from beginning to end. Soundgarden really was more of a underrated band in the realm's of grunge music's legacy. Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul. That is the case with some of Soundgarden's masterpieces, and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to. The song has been a very deep hard rock delight at despair, sorrow and prayer at the soul of the rifts by the guitar. If you have honestly never heard a Soundgarden song before, this should be the first and the last one that you should go back to each time.

I remember hearing it and loving it in my childhood and teens, and even as an adult it captivated me.

,B000W02O2K,1,1,5,"Dreams by The Cranberries is a powerful 90s rock song that is both stirring and healing to the soul.  Fighting the Urge to Look Up The Meaning to the Song, Dreams is about coming to terms with multiple changes happening in someones life while appreciating a person who occupies a large place in your heart (metaphorically).  I recently enjoyed hearing Dreams by The Cranberries on iheartradio because it is not played as often on the radio where I currently live  I completely understand that this song could mean something completely different from what Im guessing it is but for me the song reminds me of my husband in a benevolent way.  This is because he has helped me add even more brighter colors (metaphorically speaking) to my life and has helped me appreciate life even more just by his example of how he sees the positive benefits in certain things that would test even the strongest of souls.  Hence, when the lead singer of Cranberries sings you're a dream to me it reminds me of how I have told this to my husband before (just in slightly different words).

,B000W03IQ6,-1,-1,3,"In the follow up to 'Cork Tree,' Fall Out Boy had to capitalize on their success to engrain themselves. Their first single here, comes off less as a single, and more as an arena-anthem. As a single, I thought it was good when in first came out, catchy, unique, good build-up. However, this song has worn on me, and not by radio mind you, but just the song itself. The song could be described as an angry power-rock (rather than power-pop) anthem, and because of the style that goes along with a song like this, it just doesn't hold any staying power. Maybe for a month or two, but then it's history.

So overall, if you've never heard the song, try it, you might like it. Beware though, it's not very long before it'll get sentenced to the shelf.","In the follow up to ' Cork Tree , ' Fall Out Boy had to capitalize on their success to engrain themselves ..

The song could be described as an angry power - rock ( rather than power - pop ) anthem , and because of the style that goes along with a song like this , it just does n't hold any staying power .. Maybe for a month or two , but then it 's history .. So overall , if you 've never heard the song , try it , you might like it .. Beware though , it 's not very long before it 'll get sentenced to the shelf ."

A lot of people thought she would fall off or come back weak on this but she came from left field with some of these tracks.

,B000W11NDU,-1,-1,3,"Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album? Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself, and everyone said he was coming off too cocky. Well, Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition's Home Again came out, so wasn't he being a little cocky himself? Yeah, everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo, but to be honest, this wasn't his best album.
Take the Babyface-penned title track, for example. The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus: ""Let's get the mood right/Turn on your heart light."" Turn on your heart light? That's too cheesy, even for Babyface. And ""Love In An Elevator"" is full of corny lyrics like ""They say there's no luck on the thirteenth floor/But I found love and so much more"" and ""Like The Staples, I wanna take you there."" ""Simply Say I Love You"" is okay, but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember hearing Stevie in that song.
The only songs that really stand out are ""Maybe"" and ""It's Your Body"". The latter features Roger Troutman, and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible. The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing: sex, sex, and more sex. The sleepy production doesn't make things better, either.
Another problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs, especially the very last track, ""So Gentle"". It features a rap from Ron DeVoe, so you know what the main problem is. But the thing is that the preceding song ""I Know You Want Me"" features uninspired rapping from some other guy, and his rapping is actually worse than Ron's.
I still like Johnny Gill, but this album seems like it was rushed. And the strong adlibs he's known for usually adds feeling to the songs, but here it seems like they're trying to hide the questionable material. You're better off getting the solo albums he made before this.","Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album ?.

,B000W11N6W,1,1,5,"It isn't hard to say that this is a good album, it fact, it is not hard to say this album is nothing short of a masterpiece.  India. Arie delivers a brilliant sophomore album entitled, ""Voyage to India"".  In fact, if this album was really a ""voyage"" to somewhere, many would probably pay top dollar to be there!

 This is such a positive album.  The lyrics just make any listener smile.  Anyone who knows anything about India knows she loves to play the guitar, and it is evident that she loves the guitar when listening to her album.  There is a guitar in every song on the album.  Although I think she's a bit indulgent with the guitar, she doesn't bore the listener with it.  It actually sounds right nice and adds something distinctive to her album.

 ""Good Man"" is definitely an album highlight.  The lyrics are meaningful and real.  The song is about a man who has children and if anything ever happens to him, he wants his children to know he loved them and that he was a good man.  Many parents can relate to this song because it's the same way they feel about their children.  ""Talk to Her"" has one of those beats you can snap your fingers and bob your head to.  Aside from the laid back beat, the song offers a very relevant message in today's world; talk to women with respect (men).  This song has simple lyrics, but they say so much.  I love it!  ""God is Real"" is another one of the many beautiful songs on ""Voyage to India"".  This song has a very noticeable guitar in the background.  India's vocals are really good on this track, they help the song to be more believable.  The song is about questioning the existence of God.  India does an excellent job of stating her claim of why she thinks or as she says ""knows"" that God is real.  ""Can I Walk With You"" and ""The One"" are just nice love songs.  India's vocals are, again, on point for these tracks.  If anyone were to ask me to pick to tracks to listen to on this album, I'd go with these.  The album contains no fillers, just brilliant work by a great artist of today.  If debating on whether or not to cop this one, GET IT NOW!  India will take you by surprise, like she did men.  I am very impressed with the talent of this woman.  She's a shining star! 5 star album!

,B000W11N6W,1,1,4,"Sometimes simplicity can go a long way. That is why artists like India. Arie manage to survive and succeed in an industry of overproduction and glitz. Arie returns after bearing her ""Acoustic Soul"" to the world. She is now ready to take us on a ""Voyage To India"" and it's worth taking.
Although the first track'""Growth,"" is an interlude opening up the second chapter in Arie's anthology, this record, in many senses, is more of a continuation of the previous rather than an evolution of the artist.
The only difference is the first single ""Little Things"" which is a track that, surprisingly, does not have any guitars on it, but its lyrics capture the same granola down-to-earth essence as her debut single ""Video.""
""Talk to Her"" is a run-on song. But Arie's way with melodies is best depicted by the mood jam ""Slow Down"" and the uplifting folk ditty ""Beautiful Surprise.""
Considering all aspects Arie brings into her craft, one could say that Arie's sound is a cross between Erykah Badu and Tracy Chapman.
Arie's diverse influences play a role in her distinct sound. As she has stated in her previous album, her influences range from Stevie Wonder to Karen Carpenter.
""Get It Together"", a song about maintaining strength when times are rough, captures that with her warm vocals and guitar-lead melody. Then, ""Headed In The Right Direction"" starts out like an '80's Luther Vandross anthem and then wanes towards the end.
All songs aside, Arie shines most on ""Can I Walk With You"" - a song about the need to belong. Arie's vocals on this song depict a yearning like no other. This is definitely a gem, if Motown Records had any sense this would be the next single.
""Voyage To India"" then meanders into sharp beats on ""The One"" and ""Complicated Melody,"" which is exactly what it says - it doesn't go anywhere. But the fall is cushioned by ""Good Man"" and the bonus track ""Interested,"" which keeps Arie's soulful tradition alive.
This album is bound to be a coffee shop favorite.
It contains slow jams, simple, yet deep folk numbers and sultry vocals. Although it is a well-rounded album, it sounds more like ""Acoustic Soul 2"" rather than a record with its own unique taste.","Sometimes simplicity can go a long way ..

,B000W11N6W,1,1,4,"I read some of the negative reviews of India. Arie's Voyage to India album and I wonder if those reviewers listened to the whole album. Sure, she gets preachy at times on here, but that's only on two or three songs, and even those are good. And every time I listen to this album, I love it even more.
""Little Things"" is an okay song for a first single, but there are better songs than that on here. Check out the two highlights, ""Good Man"", where India tells a story about a man who tells his wife to remember him if he dies someday, and ""Talk to Her"" (which is still very preachy), where India tells men to respect their women. The latter, as well as a few other songs, features Laurnea, who's been M.I.A. from the industry for a while. Where did India find her??? Even as a backup singer, she shines like she always did.
""Can I Walk With You"" has that ready-for-VH1 feel to it, as does ""Interested"", but that doesn't make these songs any less engaging. Also, I noticed that ""Slow Down"" has the same melody as last year's ""Back to the Middle"". But this album is still solid.

The songs on this cd are beautifully arranged and performed flawlessly. Alot of the lyrics are pure poetry; expressing love, exhortation, positivity, and all the things that would make us better people to humanity, ourselves, and loved ones.
The vocals and music showcased on this stellar project are warm and enchanting. ""The Truth"" is my absoulte favorite track with its haunting background vocals and its acoustic spanish motiff. ""Little Things"" is tight and has that ""All That I Can Say"" by Mary J. music flavor. ""The One"" is a catchy tune that will have you singin' ""Laa Laa Laa Lalalala"".

I 've Voyaged To India numerous times since I 've acquired this cd and just can not get enough of this mind , body , and soul candy .. The songs on this cd are beautifully arranged and performed flawlessly .. Alot of the lyrics are pure poetry ; expressing love , exhortation , positivity , and all the things that would make us better people to humanity , ourselves , and loved ones .. The vocals and music showcased on this stellar project are warm and enchanting .. "" The Truth "" is my absoulte favorite track with its haunting background vocals and its acoustic spanish motiff .. "" Little Things "" is tight and has that "" All That I Can Say "" by Mary J. music flavor .. "" The One "" is a catchy tune that will have you singin ' "" Laa Laa Laa Lalalala "" ..

I was hoping for more inspirational lyrics. this time around, it seems that India has fallen in love and has to tell the world about it. There is nothing wrong with love songs but i expected more than that from her. Her praises for a man gets a little tired. Overall, this is a pleasant CD to listen to. My favarite song is ""Talk to her"". Anyone who enjoyed her first Cd will enjoy this one.

,B000W11N6W,-1,-1,2,"After the multiplatinum success of ""Acoustic Soul"", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup ""Voyage To India"". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on ""Voyage"" as this album is severely so-so.
First off the production is weaker than on ""Acoustic"" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either.
Tired duds like ""Little Things"" and the predictably titled ""God Is Love"" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for ""deep"" when they come off like Hallmark card messages.
Bland ""folk""-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead ""Voyage"" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. ""Good Man"" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record.
Fortunately, ""Voyage"" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. ""The Truth"" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired ""love yourself"" retreads.

Look, ""Voyage To India"" makes India to be more of a ""Black-girl"" version of bland, ""folk"" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being ""bootylicious"" or partying or ""her man"" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on ""Voyage"" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not ""deep"".
India. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'. She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the  bland R&B that dominates this album doesn't do much for both the listener or her.","After the multiplatinum success of "" Acoustic Soul "" , India ..

,B000W11N6W,-1,-1,3,"Coming off of a classic first album, we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician/singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts.  The grooves swing, the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great. The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record.
But you know how an artist's intentions can be TOO clear?  The messages too in-your-face?  How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away?  That's what's wrong here.
The problem I have is with the lyrics: they're WAY too preachy.
I thought that the music was so well-done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio, but that's turned out to not be the case.  A song will come in with a great beat, great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you're inundated with Sunday School-level lessons for three minutes.  Where's the risk-taking of ""Brown Skin"" or the gutsy self-confidence of ""Video""?  Where's the humanity of ""Ready for Love"" or the philisophical punch of ""I See God In You""?  It's just not there this time around.  It's almost as if she's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages.  This album is cursed with the kind of ""We Are the World"" heavy-handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year.
Great playing mired in WAY heavy-handed and too-simple lyrics.  The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar, which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much-needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity.  This, however, is too far at the other end of the love/hate spectrum.  If I wanted a gospel album, I'd have bought a gospel album.  She's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well, which is fine, but because of that there's a lot of not-great sap here too.  Not even racy, midnight-mood, slow-jammy sap...it's just simplistic I'm-in-love type stuff that, lyrically, you could get anywhere.
The shining track here is ""The One"" but it's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record.  This is all a terrible shame; I wanted to like this one, especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of (groan) Alicia Keyes, but this record falls short in the most important department: the message.","Coming off of a classic first album , we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician / singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts ..

Johnny co-wrote it with his soon-to-be-wife June. Their daughter Rosanne said, ""The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.""

I have this on my running playlist. There is are mariachi-style horns and guitar-drum beat which pace this excellently for runners looking for more pep in their step.

""Love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire.""

I full recommend ""Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash.

,B000W11NQ2,1,1,4,"Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one, and for the most part it works well.  After dabbling with country on the ""Riddles In The Sand"" album, Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on ""Mango"".  ""Please Bypass This Heart"" is nothing spectacular, but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it's best with ""If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me"".  I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song (this is coming from a guy who does not like country music).  Other highlights on the album include ""Frank And Lola"" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re-kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida.  ""Desperation Samba"" is another great Buffett ""south of the border"" tune.  The title track ""Last Mango In Paris"" is classic Buffett.  The album closer ""Beyond The End"" is a song a lot of Buffett fans don't seem to care for, but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc.  The album also includes several of Buffett's popular concert favorites ""Jolly Mon"" and ""Gypsies In The Palace"".  Some of the production on this album is very 80's oriented which dates it a bit, but overall this is another good album from Jimmy.","Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one , and for the most part it works well ..

But when he did a cover song that was out of the ordinary, he not only made it his own nicely, but it sometimes still stands taller than the original artist in that tone. The prime example of Johnny's musical intimacy came nearly at the end of his life when he did a cover of Nice Inch Nails song Hurt. The song is definitely something still worth listening too. Not just from Johnny's voice, but also because of his simplicity of the guitar and piano. It is a great song to listen too, not just if you are a die hard Johnny Cash fan, but also for anyone who is new to his music. Get this, and you won't be hurt.

,B000W1877U,1,1,5,"Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year's ""Ys,"" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk.

And after the solemnities of ""Ys,"" apparently Newsom has decided to go a bit more lighthearted. ""Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band"" is an unpretentious little EP, with some new songs and new takes on older songs -- a fun little treat.

It opens with the strong folky chords of ""Colleen,"" a slice of Celtic-flavoured balladry that trickles through an oddball melody. ""I tell it as I best know how,"" croons Newsom in her crazy-fairy voice. ""Pick me up and toss me round/I lost my shoes and tore my best gown...""

She then follows it up with new versions of two older songs: the gentle haunting reimagining of ""Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"" and a full-band version of ""Cosmia,"" which seems nicely fleshed-out and polished.

After to the legendary grandeur of ""Ys,"" this little EP seems relaxed and laid-back, as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set. They're done with an ear for fun, but that doesn't take the delicate, appealing edge from the music.

Her twangly, delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes, and what sounds like some soft drums, all mingled together. In ""Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"" we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp. And over it all is Newsom's creaky, meandering vocals, wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy.

One new song and two reworkings, but ""Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band"" is stil worth getting for anyone who likes eerie, weird little folk songs.","Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year 's "" Ys , "" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk ..

 She then follows it up with new versions of two older songs : the gentle haunting reimagining of "" Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie , "" and a full - band version of "" Cosmia , "" which seems nicely fleshed - out and polished .. After to the legendary grandeur of "" Ys , "" this little EP seems relaxed and laid - back , as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set .. They 're done with an ear for fun , but that does n't take the delicate , appealing edge from the music .. Her twangly , delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes , and what sounds like some soft drums , all mingled together .. In "" Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie , "" we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp .. And over it all is Newsom 's creaky , meandering vocals , wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy .. One new song and two reworkings , but "" Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band "" is stil worth getting for anyone who likes eerie , weird little folk songs ."

,B000W176MM,1,1,4,"I would hear Kem on the radio, mostly on the stations which focused on playing jazz music and said to myself, ""This is just where this artist belongs"". I liked his voice from the first time I was introduced to it. It's very unique and befitting for jazz. It has been a long time since I have heard Kem on the radio, but something just compelled me to pick up his debut album and listen closely; I'm glad I did.

Please be warned: The younger generation may not like or appreciate this album. For example, when I was listening to this album, my brother gave me a crazy look and said, ""What the hell are you listening to?"" On the contrast, my older sister heard me playing the LP and said, ""You know about Kem? I didn't know you liked Kem!"" I really don't want to limit him to a particular audience, by this really is grown folks music. There is not one up-tempo song  in sight, just slow jams and mid-tempos. Everyone doesn't always like fast music anyway; I'm one of them. I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music. I get so tired of it, I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays. ""Love Calls"" was the first single from ""Kemistry"" and what a fantastic song it is! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about. This song is very laid back and mellow; it's sure to put one in a romantic mindset. Also, the lyrics are really good. He's letting the listening know that when love calls, there is no where to hide. ""Inside"" and ""Cherish this Moment"" are fine moments on the album. These tracks actually bring Sade to mind. I love the hook on ""Inside"" simply because it's catchy. This album is slightly flawed because it was boring in a few areas, but overall, I was impressed.  He did a fine job.

,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"Kem sings about love, a universal subject. Some of his songs are spiritual, which is terrific. His lyrics are intellectual. Kem is a very talented musician. He sings about letting things happen in their own time, missing your lover, wanting to be with your lover, cherishing moments, finding peace, and so on. It's a mixture of jazz and r&b/soul. I highly recommend this album to everyone.","Kem sings about love , a universal subject .. Some of his songs are spiritual , which is terrific .. His lyrics are intellectual ..

,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"First let me say that I love the wordplay used for the title of Kem's debut album.  Now on to the music - initially when I heard his first single, LOVE CALLS, I thought it was Al Jarreau but as the song went on I realized that it was a new artist named Kem. The rest of the songs are totally and unmistakably, KEM!!

I love the vibe of this entire album and had a hard time not pressing repeat on a few songs, namely: LOVE CALLS, MATTER OF TIME, SAY & YOU ARE.
Yes, it is more of a ""chill out"" album but certainly not one that bored me - I found myself paying attention to the adult lyrics and the beautiful music production.  I'd highly recommend this disc to lovers of r&b mixed with subtle jazz notes - it's a great debut from a real artist who I hope to hear much more from in the future (despite his sorry label and lack of promotion).","First let me say that I love the wordplay used for the title of Kem 's debut album ..

I did not have a boyfriend back in the days because I valued music more than most of the boys I knew and they were too shy to want to dance.  This song came on and one of my high school crushes came and asked me to dance.  It did not matter that he could not dance very well, I was just on top of the world that I was dancing to one of my favorite groups singing my favorite song at the time.  LTD was not the same for me once Jeffrey Osborne left the group but I still listen to his music.  It was and is still soothing, I play it when I am studying or when I am having trouble falling asleep or when I want to go back to sweet memories.

,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"Yeah, the '80s may have watered it down with excessive layers of synthesizers and the general favoring of style over substance. Sure, the '90s have all but stomped it out due to the ubiquitous presence of hip-hop's ""dark"" side (heavily-programmed instruments, blatant sampling, offensive lyrics, bad singing). However, thanks to budding artists like Kem Owens, soul music has finally come around full-circle after 20+ years of musical diarrhea.

Kem's sparkling debut should truly set the standard in terms of what to look for in good soul music: REAL INSTRUMENTS (played by REAL MUSICIANS, of course), REAL SONGS (inspired, meaningful lyrics and solid composition skills), and REAL SINGING ABILITY (knowing HOW to sing in addition to having vocal talent). If more and more artists today would just adhere to these relatively simple guidelines, then there wouldn't be so much bad music out there to begin with. An album containing a few hit singles and a load of filler doesn't do it for me. That's why I'm recommending 'Kemistry' to ANYONE who honestly craves good music without the hype to go with it.

,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"I remember hearing ""Love Calls"" being played on the radio at work all the time, and the DJ never said who made the song. Maybe the DJ didn't know, because nobody else did either. When I finally found out the song was from a newcomer named Kem and that his album Kemistry was out, my brother and sister told me to pick the album up. And boy, talk about good advice.
Since ""Love Calls"" is the first single, it's probably also the most recognizable song on the album - but I don't know if I would necessarily say it's the best song. Not to say it isn't a great song, but there are other great tracks too, like ""Inside"" (no, it's not about sex) and the gospel-flavored ""This Place"". And ""Brotha Man"" is a great storytelling track.
With ten tracks at around 47 minutes, it's clear that Kem isn't a debut artist who's trying to overprove himself. And he doesn't need to, because every song on this album is great. So why isn't he getting the recognition he deserves? Probably because he's on Motown, the label that seems to only promote artists when they feel like it (see also Remy Shand). But hopefully Kem will soon sell several copies of this great release.","I remember hearing "" Love Calls "" being played on the radio at work all the time , and the DJ never said who made the song ..

,B000W176MM,-1,-1,3,"Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound. Well not new just different from most contemporary music today. Essentially he's a jazz singer when you break it down. Listening to his CD is like an extended set of the ""Oasis After Dark"". He released this CD on his own a year ago and after sellin 10,000 copies he managed to get the attention of Motown. Listening to this CD is difficult because while the tone is great and his vocals are good there seems to be something missing. I often found myself asleep before the CD was finished. Kinda like listening to one of those ""Sounds of The Earth"" CD's ... or something to help you go to sleep. 10 distinct songs about love and life. He goes from an Al Jarreau sound on Track 7 ""Brotha Man"" till a Simply Redd feel on Track 3 ""Say"", my favorite track on the CD by the way. Soothing is the best thing I guess you can say about this CD. A nice CD to go to sleep to. Now whether that's a compliment or not I'm not sure. This is definitely not for everyone, but the Jazz Enthusiast will probably be more likely to find use for this CD. ""Is it like Floetry""? No. They are more hip than this CD. ""Is It like SADE""? No. She invokes more soul in her music. ""Al Jarreau?"" No. Jarreau is more livelier than this cat. This one still kind puzzles me. My favorite cuts are 3,4,5,and 6. See if you can get a better grasp on it than I can.","Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound .. Well not new just different from most contemporary music today ..

,B000W176MM,1,1,4,"After hearing ""Love Calls"" on the radio, I had to hear more from this gifted vocalist. At first listen, I could hear the purity and the many dimensions of that VOICE, which is soothing, smooth like 18 year old Appleton, seductive, and playful. Kem is not your ordinary run of the mill singer but an extraordinary song stylist. His voice dips and dives, rounds syllables (much like Al, Anita, & Phyllis), scats, and just downright croons.
After getting ahold of Kemistry I was not dissappointed, rather joyous of the fact that I owned a solid musical experience. This is adult music at its finest. The ambience is intimate and jazzy. The instrumentation is also complimentary to Kem's vocal prowess. There are also nice percussive elements that add to the vibe of the cd.

,B000W1AO4Y,-1,-1,3,"I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw (in the good sense) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums. First, on the Hank Williams tribute album, ""Timeless"", where she did a cover of his classic tale of love's trials and tribulations ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself. I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt's ""Beulah Land"" on his tribute album. Finally, I noted the fine job that she did on a duet with John Prine on ""Wedding Bells"" on his ""In Spite Of Ourselves"" cover album of country classics.

That said, although I have high, very high regard for Ms. Williams' cover work I am more ambivalent about her own albums. This album under review is such a case. I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs. She, obviously, can write thoughtfully of love, lost, the cruel nature of the world, her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above-mentioned efforts is missing here. A few do, however, stand out. ""Mama You Sweet"", ""Words"", ""West"" and ""Rescue"" clearly rise to the occasion.

,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4,"Although Lucinda Williams has been doing her thing for almost thirty years, it seems that she didn't really get a WHOLE lot of attention until she released Car Wheels on a Gravel Road in 1998. That album was so influential that it seems that all of her albums after that point will be compared to it, which might account for all the negative reviews for her latest album, West.

Actually, now that I think about it, this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options. But if this is your first Lucinda Williams album, I suggest you get educated on some of her earlier material first. She doesn't sound different or anything, but, well, Lucinda is another one of those singers that makes great songs yet she doesn't have a great voice, so if you're not a fan of hers, this album might put you to sleep. But it really IS very accessible.

Lucinda composed this album following the death of her mother, which is probably why most of the songs are mellow. They don't drown into each other though, as I can easily pick up highlights like ""Are You Alright"", ""Learning How to Live"" and the title track. And the songs about her mother are poignant yet exceptional, as shown in ""Mama You Sweet"" and especially ""Fancy Funeral"". But my favorite song would probably have to be ""Words"".

While I can do without ""Come On"" and the nine-minute spoken word ""Wrap My Head Around That"", the rest of the album is quality Lucinda. It might not be her best album, but it's far above-average, so if you want to find exceptional music, go west.

,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"The career of singer/songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP, ""West.""

A moody collection of life, love and Americana, the record testifies to her ever-evolving talent and drive for musical perfection.

Williams is a tough chick -- the kind you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of -- but her sensitivity comes to the forefront once again.

""Are You Alright?,"" the lead single and opening track, is beautiful in its stark vulnerability. Asking questions such as, ""Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?"" and ""Is there anything I can do?,"" Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would-be lover. She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored, unyielding honesty.

This upfront quality permeates the collection. ""Everything Has Changed,"" for instance, underscores the monotony of life, whereas the richly melodic ""What If"" has Williams questioning many so-called facts of life.

""Where Is My Love?"" is passionate and pleading in its quest for the ultimate affirmation, appropriately going hand in hand with the autobiographical song ""Learning How to Live."" A particular standout, the latter finds Williams picking up the pieces of her life and moving on after a difficult breakup:

""'All I have left is this dime store ring/But I wouldn't trade it for anything/The days ahead will never be the same/For you I might have even changed my name/I'm learning how to live.""

The melancholy edge of the disc can also be attributed to the recent death of her mother, whom she pays tribute to in the desperate yet understated ""Mama You Sweet."" This experience surely played a part in the composition of another standout track, ""Fancy Funeral."":

""So don't buy a fancy funeral/It's not worth it in the end/Goodbyes can still be beautiful/With all the money that you'll spend/There's no amount of riches/Can bring back what you lost.""

Her search for love continues on the haunting, lyrically intense ""Unsuffer Me.""

Alternately, ""Rescue"" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress.

Different melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album. ""Wrap My Head Around That"" has funky, organic grooves with clean-cut lyrics that don't mess around with pretense or metaphors, and the surprisingly upbeat ""Come On"" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame.

""Words"" attests to the life-affirming power of language, whether uttered or harbored within, providing the most seductive melody of the disc, while the title track closes the album with her most evocative lyrics yet:

""I sleep out in the desert/Under the stars above/And keep making an effort/To wander into love/Who knows what the future holds/Or where the cards may fall/But if you don't come out west and see/You'll never know at all.""

Williams will likely never be able to replicate the cultural impact of her already classic 1998 album ""Car Wheels On a Gravel Road,"" but ""West"" proves that her talents as a musician continue to mature.

With her compelling abilities to connect with listeners on such an intricate, personal level, it is no surprise that more than 20 years into her career, her fanbase only continues to expand.

iTunes and Best Buy are among a myriad of music retailers that sell slightly different versions of ""West,"" offering various bonus demos of the album's selections.","The career of singer / songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP , "" West ..

I do agree with others the lead-off track is one of the weakest on this disk. The repetativeness is completely distracting and not worthy of Willams' talents.  Ditto w/""Mama You Sweet"".

The strongest tracks are by far ""Unsuffer Me"", ""Where is My Love"", ""Rescue"", ""What If"" and ""Wrap My Head Around It"".  Especially the strings on ""Unsuffer Me"" and the guitar on ""Where is My Love"" really make the songs.  They are subtle yet make all the difference.

I do like ""Fancy Funeral"", though it is a little down...even for me.  ""Come On"" starts really good, but it doesn't really go anywhere.

The good thing is, the rest of the songs are perfectly serviceable.

,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4,"Lucinda Williams is in my opinion one of the most overlooked musicians in our era, considering that it's taken way too many years for her to get critical and some commercial acclaim, starting with 1998's ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". The current decade has found Williams to be very productive, with 2001's ""Essence"" and 2003's ""World Without Tears"" studio albums and one live album. Now comes the new studio album.

On ""West"" (13 tracks, 69 min.), Lucinda Williams sings about her usual topics of relationships, loss, loneliness, heartache. She also confronts the death of her mother (""Mama You Sweet"" and ""Fancy Funeral""). The opener ""Are You Alright"" sets the tone for the album: a slow-tempo, aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame. There are not many up-tempo songs on here, which may bother some people, but it doesn't bother me as in the end this is a mood album. Highlights for me include ""Unsuffer Me"", which is the best song on this album; the bitter yet funny ""Come On""; the epic 9+ Min. ""Wrap My Head Around That""; the sweet ""Words""; and the title track, which closes the album. The CD I bought came also with a 2 song (11 min.) bonus CD, which brings demo versions of ""Where Is My Love"" and ""Rescue"". Nice, but not really essential.

In all, I have come to like this album more with every listen. This is certainly not the most accessible Lucinda Williams, nor her best (that would still be ""Car Wheels""), but this is a rich album in every sense. But it's not for anyone in a hurry. I saw Lucinda Williams live on her ""World Without Tears"" tour, and was blown away by her stage presence. I can't wait to see how the songs from ""West"" will translate in a live session.","Lucinda Williams is in my opinion one of the most overlooked musicians in our era , considering that it 's taken way too many years for her to get critical and some commercial acclaim , starting with 1998 's "" Car Wheels on a Gravel Road "" ..

,B000W18GBW,1,1,4,"Hearing the four man crew from Queensbridge, The Lost Boyz, once again brings back nostalgic memories of the golden age of hip hop music. Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah (R.I.P.), Spigg Nice, and Pretty Lou knew the formula to making good music, with most concepts working. With many dope recognizable singles such as ""Music Makes Me High"", ""Renee"", and ""Lex, Coups..."" (there is a remix floating out there I strongly recommend you hear). But what separates this crew from other groups is personalty. Mr. Cheeks is very charismatic on the microphone, and Freaky Tah plays the background vocals (those unfamiliar, think of him being what Flava Flav is to Chuck D in Public Enemy, only more serious).

One reason that makes this album great is their creative hooks, some of them will have you remembering for a while. ""Music Makes Me High"", and ""The Yearn"" are both entertaining (although I believe ""Da Game"" is very similar to the latter song). ""1,2,3"" is another great song too with the late Freaky Tah on the solo. ""Get Up"" is another song to easily remember, and slightly changes the atmosphere on the album. Other dope tracks to check out are the title song, and ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless"".

This album is great for the '95/'96 era and can easily stack up to the many east coast hip hop albums that came out around that time. The album flows great, and I personally believe many fans will enjoy. The lyrics are definitely on point majority of the album. Peace.

,B000W18GBW,1,1,4,"In my mind, this CD is what east coast hip hop should sound like.  This album had an impact in that was summed up well by one reviewer that said: ""When this album dropped in '96, everybody's ears perked up a bit and heads turned.""  This was one of those albums that you could turn on and just zone out to.  Tracks like ""The Yearn"", ""Music Makes Me High"", and ""Get Up"" were sure to get any party started while cuts like ""Legal Drug Money"", ""All Right"", ""Straight From The Ghetto"", and ""1,2,3"" were equally effective tales of ghetto life.  Then you throw in classics tracks like ""Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz, & Benz"", ""Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless"", and ""Renee"" and you have as good a rap album as you're gonna find on the east coast.  Even the intro is hot without taking all day to get to the point.  This is easily the best album released by the Lost Boyz.  It seems that Mr Cheeks leads the charge while Freaky Tah picks up the slack.  Tah doesn't rhyme much, but he does manage to spit a few bars on ""Legal Drug Money"", ""The Yearn"", ""All Right"", and ""1,2,3"".  And when he's not rhyming, he's ad libbing in the background on most songs (don't front like I was the only one that was singing along with Tah in most of those songs).  There are a few shortcomings that keep this album from achieving classic status.  Freaky Tah has a very simplistic flow that can come off as boring from time to time (but not often).  Then there are tracks like ""Da Game"" and ""Is This The Part"" that could've been left off the album and no one would've missed it.  Aside from those mishaps, the rest of the album is flawless.  It's been 8 years since this album came out (damn, that was 8 years ago?!) and you can still zone out to it in 2004.  Overall, this album is near classic with party jams and street tales that are effective in their purposes.  This CD is definitely worth your money if you're considering buying it.

,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"On August 10, 2005 Lucinda Williams played at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh.  It was the last live concert that my wife and I saw together.  Lucinda was touring in support of ""Live @ the Fillmore"" & said she was writing songs for a new record.  As I recall, she played a new song she said she'd recently written, ""Everything Has Changed.""  I preordered Lucinda's ""West"" set while my wife was still here.  Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe.  Lucinda lost her mother; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me, they punctuate every breath I take.  I spin the CD & Lucinda's gentle aching voice comes on, ""Are you alight?""  When people ask me that, I want to say, ""He*l no!""  But when she sings, ""All of a sudden you went away; I hope you come back around someday; I haven't seen you in a real long time; Could you give me some kind of sign?  Are you alright?  ...Cause I've been feeling a little scared,"" it sounds like she's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love.  What an amazing song, ""Just tell me that you're okay.""  If this were the only song on the CD, it'd be worth it.

""Unsuffer Me"" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss.  Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it.  ""Anoint my head with your sweet kiss, my joy is dead; I long for bliss,"" she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone's electric guitar churns mercilessly.  Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity.  During my wife's last weeks, my daughter said to me, ""It's like watching a train wreck; you can't look away.""  There something of that strength that comes through in Williams' music.

Other cuts are also amazing.  ""Learning How to Live"" is a breakup song, adjusting to loss.  ""Fancy Funeral"" may sound a bit bizarre, but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed.  The sheer force of Lucinda's anger in ""Come On"" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed-breakup song, ""Dude, you're so fired; shut up, I'm not inspired.""  ""Words"" has Lucinda's voice, weathered, worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best, writing a good song.

Yes, Lucinda has an amazing catalog of recordings from ""Happy Woman Blues"" to the self-titled record to Car Wheels & World Without Tears.  ""West"" takes a well deserved place at the table as one of her most compelling, moving works.  Bravo!","On August 10 , 2005 Lucinda Williams played at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh ..

,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"This is an album about loss and survival. It's darker than some of Lucinda's other releases. It may not be for all Williams fans; it certainly is very different and more experimental than her last three albums. If you're uncertain about it the first time, give it a couple of other spins--it'll grow on you. The depth of emotion and Lucinda's raw vocals (meaning they weren't re-recorded--producer Hal Wilner used the demo vocal tracks as he loved the emotion in the performances) give this album an extra kick. I've seen some mixed reviews from fans here--I suspect this is an album that fans will probably come back to later and realize how good it is.

Clearly under the influence of later Dylan (perhaps ""Time Out of Mind""), the album features a nice mixture of midtempo numbers and killer ballads. Williams' voice which aches with longing and bitterness in many of these songs continues to be one of her strengths in addition to her top notch songwriting. She strikes reminds me somewhat of John Hiatt. ""Words"" has one of the sweetest melodies Williams has come up with the opening line sums up much of this album--""I would rather suffer in sweet silent solitude"". She may feel like she's in solitude but these moving, observant songs open up a world to music fans everywhere.

The music clips might be a bit deceptive. This is a moody, atmospheric album (even more so than her previous efforts). It also sounds even more personal than usual. The musicians that provide backing on the album including vets such as Jim Keltner give the album a distinctive sound. Producer Hal Willner does a great job of capturing the rich, distinctive qualities of Williams' voice.

This is one of Williams' finest albums holding its own with ""Lucinda Williams"", ""Sweet Old World"" and ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". Be aware, however, if you are a Williams fan that this is probably one of her more experimental albums and one of her most moody, atmospheric productions yet. Kudos to Hal Willner who convinced Williams to keep many of her raw, demo vocals for the album. What they may lack in polish they make up for in emotion.

BestBuy is currently offering an edition with a second disc featuring two demos for tracks on the main album. ""Where Is My Love"" and ""Rescue"" (both terrific songs). Personally, I'd love to hear some acoustic demos or performances of some of these songs vs. electric demos but that's me. Pick it up today!","This is an album about loss and survival ..

,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"Lucinda Williams has made a career out of doing things her way.  Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be.  With the success of CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD, that relentless fight finally paid dividends as the commerce finally caught up with her art.  Rather than repeating CAR WHEELS formula over and over, Lucinda left behind the Southern travel logs and delved into more emotional material.  The songs on ESSENCE and WORLD WITHOUT TEARS not only dug into the deeper depths of her psyche, but also loosened up musically, mixing more rock and hard blues into her Americana palette.  WEST seems like a logical extension of the two previous albums emotionally, while moving into new territory musically.

Produced by veteran Hal Willner, WEST takes a quantum leap from her previous releases by taking arrangements far beyond where her previous music went.  Saving the vocals and guitar from demos, the songs are built up layer by layer with strings and keyboards and various session players including Jim Keltner and Bill Frisell to create music quite different from her past efforts.  The good news is that the production is not camouflage for weak material.  Williams has delivered a solid set of tunes, at times harrowing, as she pokes at he emotional scabs of broken relationships and the death of her mother.  I can see how this material will put some off, when they are looking for material closer to CAR WHEELS regional sketches.  Still, you cannot deny the solid songwriting on songs like WHERE IS MY LOVE, WORDS (a ode to her poetic muse) and ARE YOU ALRIGHT?  Other songs like UNSUFFER ME, RESCUE and the talking blues/rap of WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT move into new territory, to my ears at least, with great success.

I'm glad that there are artists like Lucinda Williams who choose to challenge themselves and their fans with each new output of work.  Those that take the ride with WEST will be rewarded with a CD of solid songs and performances that rank with the best of Lucinda's previous work.  WEST seems to me to be the end of a trilogy of work that includes her post CAR WHEELS work.  If you're not a big fan of the previous two albums, you'll more than likely be disappointed with this new one.  In that case there is always the back catalog to enjoy.  I'll be interested to see what new directions she chooses in the future, and will no doubt, continue to enjoy this CD for years to come.","Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be ..

A beautiful mid-tempo from Miss India. Arie. This is definitely in my top 2 favorite songs by her. In fact, if you were to ask me what song is better than this one from her first two albums and a few of the tracks from her third, I'd say this one takes the cake.

It just doesn't get more contemporary soul-ish than this. The runs and the deep notes are so amazing on this track. And it means that much more when you actually know like all the lyrics to the song!

Other songs with meaning recommended (all by India):

Nature (Acoustic Soul)
Slow Down (the remaining three are from her second album, Voyage To India)
Little Things &
The Truth.

The lead singer, a man called Graham Bonnet, does an awesome job of getting the message, and 'feeling,' behind the Title (and lyrics) out to the listener.

The video inspired me to purchase this song, and, although my mood is not always angry, spiteful, or vengeful - I am usually able, upon 'demand,' to 'conjure up' the proper memories and female related pain and torment to completely, and thoroughly, enjoy this classic British rock song from the late 1970's!

You can't literally give 110% in anything that you do - the numbers will simply not allow it.  But (and you need to watch the video to fully understand appreciate where I am coming from here) in this case, with this song, and in this video, 110% is, in fact, given.

,B000W1MEEC,1,1,5,"Lovely music!

This beautiful album was RECORDED on September 16 and 17 (not originally released as the data on the amazon claimed at the time I wrote this review)- Kenny Burrell, a True giant of mainstream and moderately modern jazz guitar really shines here in the illustrious company of Richard Davis on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.

Some of the songs are really swinging, some are beautifully sad, some are pretty darn modern, but the general feeling of the album would be - in my interpretation - warm. The cozy tone of the leader's guitar really enriches his fanciful solo flights as well as the numbers where the rest of the trio has a larger role.

Initially issued on LP in 1960, the album was re-released in 1966 under the title ""Man at Work"", with really beautiful photo by Don Brownstein reproduced inside the CD's package (the cover photo of Burrell, taken from the original edition, is by Chuck Stewart). Actually, my only problem with this lovely CD is that the original liner notes - printed twice, are too small even for a reasonably young fellow with a normal eye-sight... Keeping the cover art was smart, but the backside of LP is not visually interesting enough to compensate for too small letters.

If you like jazz-guitar or mainstream jazz, you should get this album, to hear fresh and convincing versions of various standards (f. i. Ellington-Strayhorn's ""Just a sittin' and a-rockin'"", Monk's ""Well, You Needn't"") as well as some less often performed songs.","Lovely music !.

,B000W1SRR0,1,1,5,"Nina Persson's ""Black Winged Bird"" is lilting and soothing, romantic and bordering on melancholy.  The relaxing flow of this song makes it inherently listenable as foreground or background music.

I particularly like the fact that the song relies on Nina's vocal talents and not on overdone electronica or instrumental overkill.  The strings and other back-up instruments that complement Persson's voice are spot on.

While this song may not have the pop appeal or driving force it usually takes to gain major recognition, I've had this track on my iPod's playlist ever since it was made available at Amazon.com.

This song isn't what I'd cal mainstream country, folk, or even pop, but is an intruiging mixture of those genres.  I don't really like country that well, but I LIKE this song.

Thanks for a nice track Nina and Amazon!

,B000W1TKEY,1,1,5,"What happens when one of the greatest composers of R&B/Funk discovers a woman who would go on to become one of the greatest singers of R&B/Funk is Tell Me Something Good. Stevie Wonder was deep into his Funk classics like You Haven't Done Nothin' and Boogie On Reggae Woman when he first heard Chaka Khan & Rufus and the word is, virtually on-the-spot, wrote Tell Me Something Good for her. It's one of his best songs, one of her best songs and one of the best early 70's songs, period.

It's stripped down, too, right to the essentials. It doesn't have the multiple rhythms of a typical Wonder song of the time, it doesn't have the elaborate vocals of Earth, wind & Fire or Kool & the Gang, or the smooth horn section of the Ohio Players. But it doesn't need all that because it has Chaka Khan singing her heart out. This song tore up the airwaves in 1974 and is just as good today.","What happens when one of the greatest composers of R&B / Funk discovers a woman who would go on to become one of the greatest singers of R&B / Funk is Tell Me Something Good ..

Longtime fans call it their poppiest, and while it's definitely the mellowest, that doesn't mean that it's not noisy or self-indulgent for the mainstream. While the lyrics don't mean all that much, it adds up the eccentricness of the album, making it more fun with each listen. About the only other flaw with this album is that Lee Ranaldo doesn't sing on any tracks on this album.
""Bull in the Heather"" is a classic, as is its video with that Le Tigre girl cameoed in it. Kim has an excellent voice on it, as well as it being loved among the fans. The outro part sounds real cool.
Opener ""Winner's Blues"" is a real nice track, as it's an acoustic-like track, a brilliant track on this album.
I just love ""In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader"". It's a punk-like track here, probably the fastest one, and Thurston sounds as if he's having a lot of fun during the recording of it. Then it goes into ""Sweet Shine"" the only song with any real length on the album. It's a great love song.
She has some pretty interesting tracks as well. Her style overall has a sexy sound to it. ""Bone"" is very awesome, I love the energy of the drums on it, then the chords are well-progressed. It's just a real memorable one on this album. She sings 7 of the 14 songs.
'Experiental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' is something that really shines on track 12 ""Tokyo Eye"", a very noisy song. It's very awesome to listen to either in the car or on your stereo.
This one's good for introducing people to SY. I got this January of this year, and I think it's excellent. There are some flaws, but overall, I think it's pretty good. The songs are very short, which helps, 'cuz it doesn't really contain enough epic stuff. So yeah, I am recommending it here.

,B000W1SB94,1,1,5,"""Dry"" is P.J. Harvey's debut album, released in 1992 it was a critical success while it did modest on the commercial side of things. Harvey was a breath of fresh air to the industry and was that generation's Patti Smith. Her mixture of pounding riffs and raw vocals created one superb album, the multi-talented Harvey wasn't content with just singing she had to co-produce the album, play guitars and violin, and write all but two of the tracks (those two she co-wrote). There are standouts but the album is overall a solid effort and flows well.

The album starts with the simplistic ""Oh My Lover"", the track is simple yet effective and isn't an all-out assault on the ears. I really like the starkness in P.J.'s voice.
""O Stella"" seems a bit like a reprise of the previous track, though I do like this song better, it's shorter and does more musically, but that doesn't mean I hate ""Oh My Lover"".

Next up is ""Dress"", I like the repitition in the lyrics and the double bass part which is played to perfection. The song has a very syncopated feel, even though at times an irregular feel.
""Victory"" is another great track with a nice echo section in it and some nice guitar parts. The bass is great, the drums are probably stronger than ever since the start of the album.

""Happy And Bleeding"" sounded like it had elements of country and folk in it upon first listen and I still can hear little elements of it, though not as much now, it's another great track though a bit of variation in the riffs would've be nice.
""Sheela-Na-Gig"" is one of the best songs on the album and the most successfull single off the album, the structure of the song is perfect, especially the 'I'm gonna wash that man right of my hair...' bit. I like the chorus, it's really catchy.

""Hair"" keeps the same formula that has made the album what it is and doesn't interrupt the flow at all. All the basic things are here, good lyrics, catchy hooks and superb instrumenation.
""Joe"" is another short track that is set at a very fast tempo, it seems to be gone and over really quick. It's still a nice track though.

""Plants And Rags"" is the best song on the album and seems a bit out of place on the album, I love the way the strings are used and written. This song is without a doubt the most emotional album on the album and P.J. proves her voice's potential well on this track.

""Fountain"" starts off incredibly lo-fi and then breaks into the signature sound of the album. I like the contrast and how it makes the song a bit segmented. ""Water"" has been described as the 'lightest' track off the album, although it does seem a bit light, it still has that punch about it. Great vocals by P.J. again.

Overall, ""Dry"" is special, it retains it's rock-alternative sound while still displaying emotion and beauty. The two best tracks would have to be ""Plants And Rags"" & ""Sheela-Na-Gig"", simply because they well, standout. This album though is incredibly solid throughout and flows nicely making this an irresistable album by a True musical genius.",""" Dry "" is P.J.

Less accesible efforts along with Is This Desire however it is an aquired taste and of course what kind of music you listen to. Less heavy and hard rocking and agressive as it's follow-up Rid Of Me. Dry has 7 fantastic songs Oh Stella, Victory, Happy And Bleeding, Sheela - Na - Gig, Hair, Plants and Rass and Water but the 4 other tracks are so forgettable. And also do to poor production the album which was obviously recorded in mono does not deliver the goods that it is supposed to deliver. It is sometimes disturbing and heavy but it doesn't exactly kick your butt because it is so hidden. It also laks in great hooks and brilliant guitar riffs like her other albums.

This one, 1999's '20th Century Masters' is the way to go if your new to this wonderful trio. 'Dancing In The Street,' of course, is their biggest hit. That was actually the song on my old Motown CD, but I liked it a lot. Other highlights for me are 'Jimmy Mack,' 'Heat Wave,' and 'Quicksand.'

So, if you want some more great Motown to add to your collection, don't pass The Vandellas by. They are simply too good to ignore. Highly, highly recommend. Plus, as always, the sound quality is excellent.

Enjoy this one!!!","I 'm a big Motown fan , and I figured it was time to add some Martha Reeves to my collection ..

,B000W1W96K,1,1,4,"After Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown's biggest female stars.  But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition.  Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session.  The song, ""I'll Have to Let Him Go,"" which is not included in this collection, was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas.  The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes, although the lineup changed over the years; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites, Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese).  The group's second single ""Come and Get These Memories"" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way.  Other Top 5 hits included ""Dancing in the Street,"" """"Nowhere to Run,"" ""Jimmy Mack,"" ""I'm Ready for Love,"" ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,"" and ""Honey Chile.""  These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968, when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip.  The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown, Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 1995.  This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group's hits, but is limited to only 11 cuts.  Consequently, while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy.","After Diana Ross and the Supremes , Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown 's biggest female stars ..

One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic/harmonic instincts he might've developed during his Traffic period. Also he might've also had the sense that,although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi,that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall. And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings. The result was this album-one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist.

  ""While You See A Chance"" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for. With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction? This is essentially an electronic/new wave re-imagining of the uptempo gospel/soul he started doing from the outset. The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder-like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number. ""Second Hand Human"" is a hugely melodic,chiming synthesizer heavy pop/pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album. Starting off as a melodic,folksy ballad ""Slowdown Sundown"" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains. ""Spanish Dancer"" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody. ""Night Train"" is a sleekly electronic jazz/funk jam while the dynamic ballad ""Dust concludes the album.

  To my way of thinking? Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose. Winwood didn't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out. He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco/new wave synthesizer touches. And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive. He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them. I include Prince and Stevie Wonder in with that too. Although this album does have its detractors for that very reason among some of the less tolerant followers of the ""keeping it real"" music critic brigade? It would be very difficult to debate how much this album successfully extended on what was started on Winwood's commercially failed debut album and actually began an entirely new and fruitful career for him as a solo artist with a lot to say.","Now I have a feeling that following the disappointing reception of his debut album&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Steve - Winwood / dp / B001GHSFMQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Steve Winwood</a>&nbsp;three years earlier that some refinements had to be made in order for Winwood to become as commercially successful as he was creatively so ..

,B000W20FY2,1,1,5,"During my MTV days, Steve Winwood's big 80's splash with songs from Back In The High Life didn't go unnoticed by me.  After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat ""While You See A Chance.""  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.  I find myself enjoying this song more than ""Higher Love.""

The title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  ""Spanish Dancer"" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called ""lazy music"" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.  This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life.

I wonder why ""Second-Hand Woman"" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being ""a slot machine to take my dime"" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds True for the near eight minute on-the-run opus ""Night Train"" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.

Two non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are ""Slowdown Sundown.""  A wistful ballad, calling wine that ""glassful of memories""  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track ""Dust"" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, ""a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing,"" meaning time, ""the universal healer.""  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote ""the sands of time wash us all clean.""

Mellow, but not ""lazy music"" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads.","During my MTV days , Steve Winwood 's big 80 's splash with songs from Back In The High Life did n't go unnoticed by me .. After discovering that album and Chronicles , I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver , which I copied .. My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat "" While You See A Chance . "". Winwood 's sweeping organ - like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit - it reached # 7 in 1981 - along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio - friendly beat , with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing .. I find myself enjoying this song more than "" Higher Love .. "" 

 The title track reached # 48 on the singles chart , a slower midpaced affair .. "" Spanish Dancer "" along the same languid lines , may be an example of what many called "" lazy music "" to describe Winwood 's early solo stuff .. This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life .. I wonder why "" Second - Hand Woman "" was n't a chart - topper , as it 's a more lively affair with Winwood 's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat .. Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being "" a slot machine to take my dime "" but it is quite the danceable track .. The same holds True for the near eight minute on - the - run opus "" Night Train "" with its funky beats mixed with guitars , particularly a solo around the six minute mark , and the usual keyboards .. A single mix of this could 've done well , but alas .. Two non - singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs .. A wistful ballad , calling wine that "" glassful of memories ""   and something to soothe the balm of yesterday 's pain .. The tempo goes up during the bridge , which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life .. The closing track "" Dust "" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away , in this case meaning time with a woman , yet how to deal with a love that 's gone , but a friendship that still remains ?. Indeed , "" a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing , "" meaning time , "" the universal healer . "". That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote "" the sands of time wash us all clean .. ""

,B000W20FY2,1,1,4,"Steve Winwood's second solo album, 1980's ""Arc Of A Diver,"" remains one of his most popular releases, and it is indeed an excellent album. Winwood produced it, co-wrote all the songs, and plays all of the instruments himself. And, of course, he sings with that marvelous Ray Charles-ish voice. The album is a keyboard-heavy platter of pop, and it's all good. The catchy ""While You See A Chance"" was a big #2 hit for Steve on the U.S. singles chart, but there are also other goodies including the atmospheric title song, the breezy ""Second Hand Woman,"" the great grooves of ""Spanish Dancer,"" and the up-tempo funk-pop of ""Night Train"" (featuring some fine electric guitar from Winwood). Steve also slows things down a bit for the cool mellowness of ""Slowdown Sundown"" and ""Dust."" ""Arc Of A Diver"" is a great Steve Winwood album.","Steve Winwood 's second solo album , 1980 's "" Arc Of A Diver , "" remains one of his most popular releases , and it is indeed an excellent album ..

""Arc of a Diver"" (7 tracks, 40 min.) contains the hits ""While You See a Chance"" and ""Second-Hand Woman"", and the title track is well known too, but it all sounds a bit... 80s synth-lite now. The only track that really remains a stand-out now is the brooding, grooving ""Night Train"".
This album set the stage for the commercial blockbusters ""Back in the High Life"" and ""Roll With It"". With the hind-sight of 20 years or so, it is strangely clear to me that Steve Winwood's solo output simply hasn't aged well.

Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.

I was in high school when these guys rocked the world with 'Buddy Holly'. It meant nothing to me at the time though. Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90's (You know, the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE's thing. I didn't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth. I was just super lame.)

Looking back on it now, after having enjoyed Weezer for the last decade or so, they really are amazing. They have a distinctive sound that's very alternative but also very much their own. It's also not a hard sound. I find their instrumentals to be soothing ear candy.

And it's not an accident that 'Buddy Holly' is the song everyone remembers form the blue album. It's the best song on the album. Yeah it's the one with the most radio play, but that's because it's awesome. 'Susanne' is a close second, mainly because it reminds me of the closing credits to Mallrats. (Which I loved in the 90's but had no idea it was Weezer sining. I told you I was lame.) But 'Susanne' is only available on the deluxe version of the Blue Album. It's not available via the Prime streaming option. If you're buying the album, the Deluxe version is the only way to go.

,B000W21ER4,1,1,5,"Weezer's infamous self-titled debut (otherwise known as ""The Blue Album"") is one of the few pieces of music from it's time that still holds up just as well today. When they made their mark in 1994, Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling, uninspiring grunge clones. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate, they did, however, create a quite perfect debut, one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today, but Weezer remain vital, and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple. You can't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who, whether they realize it or not, knows a good Weezer tune. So, it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release, a Deluxe Edition made it's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b-sides, outtakes, demos, live songs etc. The question is, is it worth buying again?

The answer? A resounding yes. For starters, I'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it, what better time to get yourself another copy. And even if it's still in perfect condition, the bonus material is worth it alone, for the Weezer fanatic. I don't have to tell you how good the original album is. You've heard it, you know. It's perfect, front to back. The material on the second disc, while admittedly not as good as the album itself, is still worthy. Take, for example, Rivers' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub, ""Mykel and Carli"" (who passed away in a tragic car accident), with it's chorus that, in typical Weezer fashion, sticks in your head for the rest of your life. ""Suzanne"" and ""Jamie"" are probably the most well-known b-sides among Weezer fans, while a trio of demos -- referred to as ""The Kitchen Tapes"" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history. There are also live songs (""My Name Is Jonas"" & ""Surf Wax America"") and acoustic versions (""Jamie"" and ""No One Else""), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of ""Say It Ain't So"" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album). Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics (finally) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer. The package is very well done, and surely outshines the bare-bones nature of the original release.

Overall, a good album just got even better. Despite it's price tag, the average Weezer fan just should not be without this. It might make you love the band even more. You definitely get your money's worth. And as I said before, the original album itself is just classic. Say what you will about Weezer's newer material, but this stuff just can't be beat. They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty. I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album, an accomplishment a lot of musicians cannot acheive.","Weezer 's infamous self - titled debut ( otherwise known as "" The Blue Album "" ) is one of the few pieces of music from it 's time that still holds up just as well today ..

Along with seven other great songs, this was a first album that yielded some perennial material, and founded the cult that Rivers Coumo rides today.
So why should you pony up the extra dough for the ""expanded"" edition? Is the second disc really worth it? For a change, the answer is yes. You get four great live tracks, complete with some funny self depreciating comments, one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer (""Jamie""), and a handful of demos. The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled ""My Evaline"" that highlights Weezer's uncanny harmony abilities, something occasionally lost in the din.
If you're reading this, you're probably already inclined towards buying this. Go ahead. Maybe we'll get lucky and ""Pinkerton"" will get the same royal treatment.","It 's kind of hard to expound on Weezer 's classic debut ..

But out of all the songs the trio had done, the one that has stood the test of time and beyond in Every Breath You Take.

It's an upbeat tune that blends the 1990's sound with classical icons remembered through lyrics like Mary Tyler Moore and Buddy Holly. Whenever I hear it, I just get the almost irrepressable urge to stop whatever i'm doing and rock out or pop out, if one has trouble figuring out where the line dividing pop and rock was during the nineties.","Not really a Weezer fan when considering entire bodies of work , but I do love Buddy Holly because there 's something kinda crazy about the song and the video that just screams 1990 's before music went into the witness protection program that currently encases it ..

,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5,"Ah, the Supreme Warbler!  She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical.  Were they parody?  Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil and spat them out when they were spent?  There were, after all, musical satirists like Anna Russell and much later, The Bonzo Dog Band and Monty Python, who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits, and made pots of money doing it, too.  But they knew exactly what they were doing.  What about Mrs. Miller?

Jonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller, but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller.  The former act was, in case some readers don't know it already, a gifted piano player/bandleader Paul Weston, and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer's singer, Jo Stafford.  She eventually became Weston's wife.  They were best known as themselves, but forged a separate career in musical parody.  What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing isn't easy, and Jo did it by singing sharp.  Try it.  It's harder than singing flat; believe me (and sounds even more horrible).  Now, you may be asking, what do Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have to do with Mrs. Miller?  For me, it's personal, but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people.

I tried to introduce a foreign-born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene.  He would have none of it.  He said, ""she's doing that deliberately; that's not funny.""  You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller.  In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny, and Mrs. Miller roll-on-the-floor hysterical, I got an unexpected response.  No, he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you, and maybe even some songs you hate.  Somehow, she's innocent, charming, and yes, very, very funny.  Whatever the True story, and you'll read of several in these Amazon reviews, what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures.  She may or may not have been exploited, or she may have exploited herself, but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal.

Just listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming.  How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time?  And face it, who's gonna take ""Sweet Pea,"" ""Catch A Falling Star"" and ""I've Got A Tiger By the Tail"" seriously, anyway?  This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting.  And her ""Boots?""  Sorry, Nancy, Mrs. Miller's is The Definitive Version.

My one, small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of ""Up, Up And Away.""  Talk about Definitive! (If you're a Mrs. Miller fan already, and haven't heard ""Up, Up and Away,"" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity). But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in ""Lover's Concerto.""  She NAILS it!  And people said she couldn't sing!

I think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task, both musically, and as comedians, but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof, enjoyed it, made some money, and did it with purpose; you can even hear them winking in their recordings.  I do think they are funny, but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny.  My coworker was right about one thing:  Mrs. Miller was Grandma.  And you might laugh WITH her and even AT her when her back was turned, but never would you sneer at her face to face.  No, you want to give her a hug, because somehow these crazy, one-of-a-kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer.  I completely disagree with those who say that laughing at Mrs. Miller's music is cruel.  I think Mrs. Miller might have understood, had she lived to witness her digital revival, that she had created something entertaining and unique, even if it wasn't taken as she had intended.  Nothing to be ashamed of there, and if her life was in some ways tragic, its legacy is not the least bit sad.","Ah , the Supreme Warbler !.

,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5,"If you've ever heard of something called KARAOKE and have been forced to sit through it, you should know that Mrs. Miller lives in all of us, or maybe atleast many of our close acquaintences.  I personally like Mrs. Miller but hate Karaoke.

Mrs. Miller was the epitome of a loveable housewife singing music with the most non-hip and non-understanding of innocence and that is what makes this album great... She tried so hard and was so diligent and serious.  And the risks she took!

In the end, Mrs. Miller was definitely the ED WOOD of vocal-dome period.

,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5,"Elva Ruby Connes Miller was truly one of the most amazing voices of the twentieth century. That isn't to say that she has a great voice, or even a good voice, for that matter. What she has is an amazing penchant for an off-key vibrato intensive warbling that makes her second only to Florence Foster Jenkins for most hilarious soprano of the last century. Miller was a fixture in local community theater and amateur productions, and at one point even took her talent to Vietnam to entertain the troops. I am sure they were very entertained. Truly this woman had a heart of gold, even if she had a tongue of lead.

This compilation is stunning in its breadth. The treatment she gives to these songs cannot even be imagined until heard for oneself. She covers a variety of styles, with a heavy concentration of 1960s sugar-pop like ""Monday, Monday"", ""Let's Hang On"", and ""Yellow Submarine"". (Yes, it's True that Ringo sings substantially better than Mrs. Miller.) Particularly entertaining is the truly dreadful altered lyric masterpiece ""Queen of the House."" I can't imagine having been a supporting musician or recording technician that had to sit through multiple takes of these masterworks.

Listening to this CD is delightfully awful, and I recommend the experience highly to any audiophile who thinks they have heard it all.

Over time, I became truly blown away by Amy's sweet, sexy, breath-y voice.  And in the course of 4 decades, it hasn't changed all that much -- it's slightly become deeper and much more mature.

The title of the song says it all , it 's one of those songs that describes life in school to a T. I love this song and still do to this day , it 's one song once you hear it you will be like I experienced that ."
,B000WGRNA2,1,1,5,"This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits. In Europe, an expanded 13-track collection was released adding the other three but this version is long out of print. So this album, apart from being a high quality original album, also served as hits volume 2 until the more comprehensive Definitive Collection was released.

The one track that made it onto the American hits collection is Where've you been, which has become Kathy's signature song. However, in this particular song it is the lyrics that people seem to love - they relate to the sentiments expressed. The other hits were all upbeat, catchy songs - Come from the heart, Burning old memories and She came from Fort Worth Texas.

Of the other songs, my favorite is Hills of Alabam. No surprise, really, as this was written and originally recorded by my favorite bluegrass singer, Claire Lynch, who adds backing vocals. Claire's own version can be found on an untitled album by the Front porch string band, of which she was lead singer. The title track is also excellent, as are Here's hoping, True north, Love chooses you and I'll take care of you.

While I slightly prefer her two previous albums (Walk the way the wind blows, Untasted honey), there isn't much to choose between the three and those two are better represented on that hits collection. So if you already have that, this should be the next Kathy Mattea album on your shopping list.","This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits ..

,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5,"CooleyHighHarmony is a classic album that has yet to be topped by any of these so-called R&B artists that are out now. Boyz II Men put Philly on the map as well as laid themselves a strong foundation in R&B with that album. There was only one way they could have went after Cooleyhighharmony: up. And they did with this superb sophomore release.

There are too many tracks that are vintage Boyz II Men tracks. Thank You, All Around The World, Vibin and U Know are excellent tracks the the Philly quartet. I'll Make Love To You and On Bended Knee were on Blender(cheap knockoff of Rolling Stone) and Vh1 as awesomely bad songs countdown but those love ballads are classics so the hell with Blender and VH1! These are the songs that these immature little freaks were conceived to and they have the nerve to trash it but never once do they mention any Eminem, D12 or any Shady records artists as well as Justin Timberlake. Are they trying to say that none of these artists make awesomely bad records? Really? I find that type of favoritism questionable. Plus forms of media like Vh1, Blender and GQ only appeal to idiotic trendies that think that saying ""Meh"" at the beginning of every sentence and defending movies that stink to high heaven makes them hip.

50 Candles, Water Runs Dry, Trying Times and Yesterday are more smooth R&B ballads that give this album a much needed boost. There are no bad songs on this album so I'll keep going on.

Bottom Line: Boyz II Men's II is the best sophomore album from an R&B quartet of all time. The ballads are exceptional and the fast songs aren't bad plus the group still has what most groups R&B groups now sorely lack: harmony. If you love 90s R&B in its purest form you cant go wrong with this sophomore effort by Boyz II Men.

This LP begins with the deepest of gratitude on ""Thank You"" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.  Both ""All Around The World"" and ""U Know"" are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights.  One thing they do is provide another angle for Boyz II Men.  For a more relaxing environment, ""Vibin'"" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.

,B000WKT6B2,1,1,4,"Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to ""Cooleyhighharmony"", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group.

HIGHLIGHTS:

This album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before ""Khalil"") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half.

Part 1 has ""Thank You"" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. ""Vibin'"" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'/dancin' the night away/Groovin'/Vibin'/non-stop until the break of day). ""I Sit Away"" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and ""Nobody Knows""..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)

In the ""slow side"", Babyface's ""I'll Make Love to you"" set a record for the length of time at #1. ""On Bended Knee"" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and ""Water Runs Dry"" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic ""Yesterday"" and they pull off the True feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.

LOWS:

""All Around the World"" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's ""Travelin' Man"" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, ""Khalil"" is a pretty blah track. ""Jezzebel"" is a dull overlong affair. ""50 Candles"" includes the lyric ""Holding your body like a plastic molding""....'nuff said.

BOTTOM LINE:

There are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like ""I Sit By"" and ""Yesterday"" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans.","Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups ( Temps and Tops ) with more up - to - date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip - hop stylings ..

,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5,"This CD is a throwback to my youth.  I was about twelve years old when it came out--back when Boyz 2 Men was truly  a hot commodity.  They have a wonderful ""old school"" flavor reminiscent of the old doowop guy groups of 1960s.  This is especially evident in the four part harmonies, the smooth and romantic lyrics and the original interpretations of old standards (""Yesterday"").

Where do I begin to describe the mood of this wonderful and innovative R&B album?  There is something for everyone on this CD.  We have the funky, catchy ""Thank You"" that samples from ""La-Di-Da-Di"" performed by Doug E. Fresh.  The hook is infectious!  We have ""All Around the World"" to get you up and dancing, no doubt.  One of my personal favorites is ""I Sit Away,"" written by Tony Rich (of the Tony Rich Project fame).  It has a haunting hook and a beautiful, introspective feel.  Truly an ode to solitude.  There are also a couple of songs on this album that became huge hits for the fellas back in the early 1990s.  They include ""I'll Make Love to You"" (on those songs to get you in the mood), and ""Water Runs Dry.""

One of the strongest points of this album is the luscious arrangements and fine tuning of production on each of the cuts.  Even my least favorite of the songs--""50 Candles""--has a very sexy, clean and catchy arrangment.

Check this out!  And all of you young ones out there, don't write the Boyz as just another R&B band from the 1990s.  They were truly in a class by themselves.","I was about twelve years old when it came out -- back when Boyz 2 Men was truly   a hot commodity ..

Nope, this song isn't afraid to let out a yell or two, or three, but their not screaming through the whole song either. Nope, it's a perfect blend sure to please a real rock radio listener.

The verses work very nicely, and keep the song moving toward the main show of the chorus. And the chorus really rocks. Sure, it might be a little too familiar for rock radio in its short burst of the 1st round, but it saves all its energy for the rest of the song, when it brings the house down with its catchy and infectious energy that sounds right out of the 90's.

Overall, with its loaded gun of energy, and familiar, but still rockin' elements driving it, if you listen to rock radio, you're going to love it.

You also get some of his finest songs of the 1990s as a country chart topper, including 'Lead On' and 'Carrying Your Love With Me.'

And, MCA did a great job remastering the songs too. The sound quality is excellent!

Overall, this is a great set to own. And if you own 'Greatest Hits Vol. 2' and/or 'Greatest Hits,' pair it with this, and you have a mighty fine George collection.

,B000WLIE7I,1,1,5,"The album picks up George's career where the boxed set (Strait out of the box) ends, so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998. It shows that George's style was evolving but still firmly rooted in traditional country music.

The album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album, the first (The best day) being an excellent ballad. The second song (Murder on music row) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle, a bluegrass performer. Here, George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson. George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet, George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song. While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place, they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days.

The remaining tracks are taken from just four albums, these being Lead on (Adalida, Lead on, You can't make a heart love somebody), Blue clear sky (the title track, Carried away, I can still make it to Cheyenne, King of the mountain), Carrying your love with me (the title track, Round about way, One night at a time, Today my word slipped away) and One step at a time (True, We really shouldn't be doing this). Of these songs, Today my world slipped away is a cover of a Vern Gosdin country hit but the others (as far as I know) are original songs.

Picking out highlights in such a strong collection is difficult, but I'll nominate Murder on Music Row, Adalida, Blue clear sky and King of the mountain. If you are new to George's music, this compilation makes a great introduction.","The album picks up George 's career where the boxed set ( Strait out of the box ) ends , so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998 ..

,B000WLIE7I,1,1,4,"Hallelujah!  George Strait and MCA have finally released a single-disc collection of hits that isn't skimpy!  Unlike Strait's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks, of which two are new recordings.  Specifically, it picks up where the multi-disc retrospective Strait Out Of  The Box leaves off, with the old hits culled from Strait's 1994 through  1998 albums.
 While more extensive, this anthology is far from  perfect however.  ""Lead On"" and ""King Of The Mountain"" (the latter barely  scraped into the top 20) drag along unmelodically and are slower than  molasses.  Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits  (""I Can Still Make Cheyenne"" recalling ""Amarillo By Morning"" and  ""Adalida""  bringing to mind ""The Love Bug"").  With ""Carrying Your Love With Me"" and  ""Carried Away,"" Strait even repeats himself within the same collection.
  If you think I am getting too nit-picky about this set, you may be right.  The crisp, heartfelt delivery on ""You Can't Make A Heart Love Somebody"" is  just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country  music.  And as ""Blue Clear Sky"" and ""Round About Way"" illustrate, no one  handles a play-on-words more effectively than Strait.  You'd also be  hard-pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than ""We  Really Shouldn't Be Doing This.""
 The two new singles contribute in  mixed degrees to the Strait legacy.  Recent chart-topper ""The Best Day"" is  nice, but it also seems too similar to some old hits (""Love Without End,  Amen,"" ""Check Yes Or No).""  Here our protagonist progresses through a love  for camping, cars, and finally, his ideal woman.  Much better is ""Murder On  Music Row,"" a duet with Alan Jackson.  This mega-event pairing of two of  modern country's most traditional (and successful) artists is an  effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today's  country....
 As  noted earlier, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is not flawless.

DOIN' SOMETHIN' RIGHT opens and closes with foot stompers (""I Wanna Be A Hillbilly,"" ""She Knows What To Do With A Saturday Night"") which will have you dancing in the streets (or at least at your local honkytonk).  It between, we get a somewhat gentler Billy, with the title track/lead off single providing a relaxed yet heartfelt delivery, and a lusty ""Little Bit Lonely"" plus ""Here I Am"" showcasing incredible charisma.

""Good Directions"" is the type of down home, good ol' boy number that Kenny Chesney succeeds with (again and again and again).  Billy's remake of ""Lucille"" is a nice update, hitting a little harder than Kenny Rogers' original, while a collaboration with Michael McDonald on ""She's Got A Way With Me"" offers a power ballad change of pace.

Hopefully, this diverse collection will elevate Billy to the next level on the country music food chain.

,B000WLNUN6,1,1,4,"As odd as it may be, out of the hundreds of CDs in my collection, few of them are Christmas CDs, and of the Christmas CDs I do have, there aren't many of them that I listen to very often, even during the holidays. This one is one of the exceptions. One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall ""laid-back"" feel. I like that it isn't wild or very rocking. Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me (usually, anyway). Burl, with his warm, friendly voice, doesn't come across as a ""celebrity"" but as more of a ""grandfatherly"" figure. The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back-up vocals. Of course, the title track and ""Rudolph"" are probably the most-known tracks on the album, but the others are good, too. The album has one of the best versions of ""Little Drummer Boy"" that I've heard! ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" closes the album perfectly. Right now, it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s) from the album, but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song, and it would probably be ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away."" The only thing I really dislike about this album is how short it is (under 30 minutes). It would have been nice if it had included some bonus stuff, or had been paired with Burl Ives' Christmas Album (which contains completely different material). But still, this is a wonderful album!","As odd as it may be , out of the hundreds of CDs in my collection , few of them are Christmas CDs , and of the Christmas CDs I do have , there are n't many of them that I listen to very often , even during the holidays .. One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall "" laid - back "" feel .. I like that it is n't wild or very rocking .. Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me ( usually , anyway ) .. Burl , with his warm , friendly voice , does n't come across as a "" celebrity "" but as more of a "" grandfatherly "" figure ..

Have a Holly Jolly Christmas

There are a few different Burl Ives Christmas CD's on the market and so I encourage you to check them out to see which one you like the best.  This is a very very good one.  The version of ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" here is NOT version from the famous cartoon.  This version is much slower than the famous version, but is equally good.  Whichever CD you choose, if you're going to play Christmas music, you ought to have a Burl Ives CD along with your Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby CDs.

Santa Claus is Coming To Town is on here too. Burl puts his own spin on holiday faves like White Christmas, Winter Wonderland, Silver Bells and I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.

There are some unfamiliar songs on here that you don't hear, like  Christmas is a Birthday, Christmas Child and Snow For Johnny. Burl does justice to all of them. A nice CD to have in your holiday collection.","It contains two of Burl 's classic holiday songs , Holly Jolly Christmas and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer ..

,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5,"Burl Ives really isn't remembered as much as he should be these days; and that's a shame. On this album Burl sings wonderfully; and his friendly, grandfatherly vibes go into every song he sings! This CD is a must-have for fans of Burl; and anyone who wants some very special holiday songs would do well to add this to their music collection. The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is very nicely done.

The title track opens the album; this catchy, infectiously happy and upbeat tune could never go out of style; and Burl practically owns this song the way he delivers it. He puts a lot of positive energy into his version of this song; and it shows quite clearly when I hear him perform it. Great! ""Christmas Is a Birthday"" is very easy on the ear; what a charming ballad--and it's religious, too. ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" switches gears back to a more secular song; Burl puts his own stamp on this tune by playing a bit with the tempo and a few key changes--and it all holds its own very well.

""White Christmas"" glows brighter than silver and gold combined when Mr. Ives sings it; that background chorus rounds out the number nicely although wisely the arrangement makes it so that they can't attempt to share the spotlight with Burl. ""The Little Drummer Boy"" has another terrific arrangement; the percussion and guitar are used very well and the music fits perfectly with Burl Ives' singing. In addition, ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" leaves nothing to be desired--this music is all THAT good!

""Winter Wonderland"" shines bright in Burl's capable hands; I really like this number. ""Silver Bells"" couldn't have been done any better and the CD ends with Burl Ives performing ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day."" I haven't heard this number as often as I've heard the other tunes on this CD but it's really quite beautiful and it even leaves me wanting more.

Burl Ives turned out a wonderful record album back in 1965; and it's amazingly wonderful to have this on CD in our times so that we can enjoy it over and over again. I highly recommend this album; it's full of splendid holiday music.","Burl Ives really is n't remembered as much as he should be these days ; and that 's a shame ..

,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5,"The only complaint about ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas"" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums.  His first, ""Christmas Day in the Morning,"" came out in 1952, followed by ""Christmas Eve"" in 1956.  ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas"" came out in 1965, with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" the following year.  The title song of this album was written by for the special by Johnny Marks, who also wrote the song ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" which Ives sings on this album, and the final track, ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.""  That is a pretty good trio of Christmas songs, which would make Marks one of the best writers of Christmas songs ever.

How this album is different from the previous Burl Ives Christmas albums is that he has shifted to this point to more of a pop-oriented approach to singing Christmas songs that the traditional folk style that defined his earlier albums.  There are still some folk songs on this album, with ""Christmas is a Birthday,"" ""Christmas Child (Loo, Loo, Loo),"" ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away,"" and ""Snow for Johnny.""  But most of the songs are definitely more popular than secular, with ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"" ""White Christmas,"" ""Winter Wonderland,"" and ""Silver Bells.""  I tend to think of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" as being more religious than it really us, but that is more because the music is more hymn-like.

The net result is that you have Burl Ives singing eight recognizable Christmas songs and introducing you to four songs that you have probably not heard before that are perfectly suited to his strengths as a singer.  Ives started out in the 1920s as an itinerate folk singers, moved to Broadway in the 1930s, appeared on the radio in the 1940s, and became a popular folk singer in the 1950s.  But most people today probably remember him as the Snowman who narrates the story of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" that still airs each holiday season forty years later.  Because of that connection it is entirely possible that a Burl Ives Christmas album will be warmly received in your home by those who do not know about the rest of his resume.  He certainly produces the requisite warm seasonal feelings.","The only complaint about "" Have a Holly Jolly Christmas "" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums ..

,B000WLTDIM,1,1,5,"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play ""Amarillo By Morning,"" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to ""Amarillo by Morning.""

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","I grew up in rural West Texas , where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals ..

I hadn't heard of Enrique Iglesias until he showed up on my Pandora radio play list, but this song is a truly lovely dance song. The instrumentals are stunning, and Iglesias' smooth and deep strains complement the style perfectly. There's nothing terribly *new* in this song - it's a very standard dance-and-romance song - but a song doesn't need to be innovative to be beautiful, raw, and real. Listen to the sample and you may love it.

Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.

It has 'Crazy', that great Willie Nelson song that has played from jukeboxes and bars throughout American for the past few decades, always sounding as good as ever. I think it's considered to be the most played song ever, by whoever keeps track of such things. Its worth getting this album for that track alone, although if you are download friendly then you could shortcut that process and simply purchase the track all by itself.

But if you did that, you'd miss the 21 other great songs here, starting with 'Walkin' after Midnight', and continuing one after another to transport us to those days in the late 1950's and early 1960's when Patsy Cline was at the top of her career.

,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5,"Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley, September 8, 1932 - March 5, 1963) was a superbly gifted country music singer--very few could, can or ever will match her ability to take any tune and make it sound wonderful, special, fresh and very new! Patsy also put her heart and soul into everything she sang; and that's grand. Sadly, she died so young in a private plane crash; but at least she lives on through her music. This is an excellent CD of her artistry for both fans and newcomers alike.

There's not a single dud in the lot here; every song is just that good! ""Walkin' After Midnight,"" written by  Alan Block and Donn Hecht, is a fine way to start the track set--Patsy is squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! The music, as is the case with all the tracks here, fits in perfectly with Patsy's vocals. ""A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)"" is very well done and Patsy does a great job on ""Lovesick Blues"" which is a number I really like. ""I Fall to Pieces"" (Pasty's first #1 hit on the country charts and her second hit on the pop charts) and ""True Love"" from Patsy's 1961 album entitled ""Patsy Cline Showcase"" are most poignant and Patsy sings ""San Antonio Rose"" with panache--I love it! ""Crazy,"" a number by Willie Nelson, shines bright in Patsy's more than capable hands; it's her signature song despite the fact that she didn't like it at all initially!

""Strange"" is very well done--there's some backup vocals for Patsy and while they do sound pretty good Patsy never really needed backup; her talent carried her through every time! Patsy's interpretation of Hank Cochran's ""She's Got You"" is very impressive; and Patsy's ""Heartaches"" is easily the very best I've ever heard! ""Half As Much"" is easy on the ear even if the lyrics aren't all that happy while ""When I Get through with You (You'll Love Me Too)"" is certainly more upbeat. ""Imagine That"" gets a fine treatment from Patsy and ""So Wrong"" yet again features Patsy's beautiful contralto voice. ""Why Can't He Be You"" is another moving number.

""Leavin' on Your Mind"" is an incredibly fine tune that gets the royal treatment from Patsy Cline and ""When You Need a Laugh"" is a real gem! ""Back in Baby's Arms"" has a great sound to it as do the other numbers here and songs like ""Faded Love"" make me wish so badly that Patsy was still with us. ""Always"" is a classic for sure and the album ends with two splendid songs, Harlan Howard's ""He Called Me Baby"" and Don Gibson's ""Sweet Dreams (Of You).""

Patsy Cline shared so much of her gift with us that we are all better off for it. I highly recommend her exceptional music.","Patsy Cline ( born Virginia Patterson Hensley , September 8 , 1932 - March 5 , 1963 ) was a superbly gifted country music singer -- very few could , can or ever will match her ability to take any tune and make it sound wonderful , special , fresh and very new !.

I enjoy every song here, but the stand-outs surely are ""I Fall To Pieces"", ""Walkin' After Midnight"", ""Back In Baby's Arms"", and of course ""Crazy"". If today's country radio sounded this good, I might still listen to it. These songs are wonderful to play around the house, with your kids, and especially with your ""True Love"".

,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5,"Whether you love classic country music or hate it, whether you were there to hear Patsy sing ""Walkin' After Midnight"" in 1957 or saw the movie ""Sweet Dreams"" OR just discovered her, this is a compilation that will not let you down. This Winchester, Virginia, native thrilled the music world like no other and continues to do so, long after her untimely death in a plane crash with country singers Hawkshaw Hawkins and Cowboy Copas.  Patsy could make her voice break and thus break our hearts with her soulful rendering of songs written (and often recorded) by some of country music's greatest.  Consider ""Sweet Dreams"" (Don Gibson), ""Crazy"" (Willie Nelson), ""I Fall to Pieces"", ""She's Got You"", ""Why Can't He Be You?"" (Hank Cochran), ""Back in Baby's Arms"" (Bob Montgomery whose life has been rich in ""country"", including a pre-Crickets duo with Buddy Holly), ""Faded Love"" (co-written by Bob Wills of Texas Playboys fame), ""Leavin' On Your Mind"" (co-written by country/honky tonk great Webb Pierce) and ""Always"" by one of the all-time great composers of American standards, Irving Berlin.

,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5,"Patsy set the standard for female country singers, with many of those that followed trying (or so it seemed) to be the next Patsy Cline - even today, over forty years after her death in a plane crash. Many compilations are available but most of them seem to miss something important. Not this one - all of Patsy's classic songs can be found here.

Crazy was a top ten pop hit in America and (in 1990) a top twenty hit in Britain. Heartaches was Patsy's first American top forty pop hit. Don Gibson wrote Sweet dreams and had a big country hit with it, but once Patsy recorded it, it became much more popular and will be forever thought of as a Patsy Cline song. She's got you was an American top twenty pop hit and was also Patsy's first British hit, albeit only a minor one I fall to pieces was yet another top twenty pop hit in America. Walking after midnight is the song that began it all for Patsy in the fifties. Poor man's roses, Back in baby's arms and Leaving on your mind are other Patsy classics included here. Faded love, a cover of a Bob Wills song that, like Sweet dreams, is regarded as a Patsy Cline classic despite being a cover.

Also here are Patsy's fine interpretations of Lovesick blues, Half as much (Hank Williams), True Love (Bing Crosby), San Antonio rose (Bob Wills), Always (written by Irving Berlin) and many other fine songs.

If you just want one CD of Patsy's music, make it this one.","Patsy set the standard for female country singers , with many of those that followed trying ( or so it seemed ) to be the next Patsy Cline - even today , over forty years after her death in a plane crash ..
