AMXH6AEME9AIN,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,I listen to this song for my exercise. Love it.,
AST761ZN9MH3R,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,A song that you can not forget and brings back many memories.,
AVKHYC2D7MD56,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,"One of the best songs from the glam band Europe, another song they wore out playing on the radio. I was in 7th grade when this hit came out. I remember some of my friends and I before school would start walk the halls singing this song. I mean you do crazy things when your 12/13 years old. The reason why I like this song , I guess it's because its not like other glam band songs, this one sounds different. I like the lyrics and the beat isn't the same copycat beat you hear from some of the other glam bands. I recommend this hit to any glam band fan, 80's music fan or anybody looking for that old school sound.",
A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,"I love the music of the '80s... but somehow I was blissfully unaware of this song's existence until I stumbled upon it in a list from Cracked -- ""The Most Terrifyingly Epic Songs of the '80s.""  I had heard most of the songs on the list, but had somehow overlooked this one entirely.  Cracked has a sketchy record when it comes to recommendations, in my opinion, but given that I loved most of the other songs on this particular list (""Eye of the Tiger,"" ""Don't Stop Believing,"" ""Holding Out for a Hero,"" ""Love is a Battlefield,"" etc.), I decided I had to give this one a listen.

I'll just say... if you're an unabashed fan of cheesy '80s poodle-hair rock, you will love this song.  :D

There's nothing subtle whatsoever about this song.  From the triumphant and soaring synthesizer opening to the epic guitar and drum riffs, this song's instrumentation is the epitome of goofy '80s rock.  The lyrics, while simple, are also rather nonsensical, seeming to hint toward a group of astronauts leaving Earth but otherwise defying easy explanation.  And the lead singer's voice is nothing to write home about, though at least he actually tries to carry the tune and doesn't just yell into the microphone.

And yet somehow, this all WORKS.  It's a goofy song, yes, but it's the kind of goofy that leaves a huge smile on your face.  It's a song that's completely over-the-top but in the best possible way, and you can't help but want to bang your head and sing along when it comes on.  I haven't listened to anything else by Europe -- and from what I understand this is their only real hit -- but they sure hit a home run with this number.

This song has found plenty of new fans thanks to ""Arrested Development,"" but even if you've never seen that show, it's almost impossible not to like this song.  It's not the greatest hit of the '80s, but it sure is one of the most fun... and yes, one of the most terrifyingly epic.",

ALIBRR4PLLLX2,B00136NOGC,1,1,5,"I've played this theme song more times than I can count.

This song is about how people in fear have the Ghostbusters to call.  How when in danger they have heroes to turn to.  The song inspires and entertains.  The music energizes fans everywhere, and the Ray Parker Jr.'s voice is powerful.",

Andy had the most beautiful voice.",
A7Y6AVS576M03,B00136NIJK,1,1,5,"I was very impressed by ""It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year."" It is a great uplifting song for Christmas. This is from Andy Williams Christmas Album and it is a quality recording. Andy Williams voice is just so evocative and identifiable with this song. This one is to be cherished and savored.",
A3PNWDTE3B3JXV,B00136NIJK,1,1,5,"My Father used to play this album when I was young,  so it brings back great memories.  This version is simply a Christmas Classic!",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136NOGC,1,1,4,"There are some songs that are just meant to be covered, where in this case there are some songs that had been worth sampling over time. When Ray Parker Jr. came out with the original Ghostbusters theme song, it was caught under innuendo and storms, with him using the Huey Lewis & The News song, I Wanna New Drug back in the 80's. But with time and space, the song has still been as iconic today, as it became a hit back then. When I had heard Fall Out Boy do a cover of this definitive song, Ray Parker Jr. & Huey Lewis got credit for in the 80's, and the original version isn't bad after all this time. It is definitely one of those movie songs that has still stood the test of time, in the way other movies songs like Purple Rain did for with the late great Prince and Footloose for Kenny Loggins as well. It surprisingly still shows a lot of longevity that is worth listening to, and much more worth the download for new fans of the upcoming Ghostbusters remake, and die hard fans of the classic films with Bill Murray & Dan Akroyd.

A1VE933MFXTG18,B00136NOGC,1,1,5,"I love this song. I  have made a CD of this song and many other old and new family friendly songs for all of our road trip we take all summer long. Is a great CD when traveling with the grand kids for sure. We all sing the songs together and talk about our favorite parts of the movie or show the song comes from. We are making new memories associated with the songs on my traveling CD. Very nice to have when you cant get reception on the radio in some places and we never have to worry about songs being inappropriate for the kids. This was a great idea and so glad I thought of it. Happy travels for us, we will enjoy these songs for years to come. as many songs on it has been around for years already it is great to share with the kids.",

A324A25PC1DFMF,B00136NJXU,1,1,5,"what else can be said about dave brubeck's ""unsquare dance""?  nothing!  it is witty, funky, fun to listen to and even more fun to dance to!

that is why i bought the track but not the rest of the cd.  i didn't nned it at the time but it will be one of the many i will add to my jazz collection.

when i began to learn tap dance, i learned a phrase from tap master (he would hate me for calling him this but he is) bruce stegmann's choreography to the music.  and, now that i have become decent enough to do it properly, i set a piece of my own, usung stegmann's steps as a theme.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136NMRI,1,1,5,"When it has came down to Whitney Houston's best movie songs, the one that is always turned to is the definitive I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard. But to follow it up with Waiting To Exhale, Whitney continued to make ""her-story"" of her own as well. Exhale (Shoop Shoop,) is a sweet and simple song that ignites well in simplicity and soulfulness. It because the first song from a movie to debut at #1 on Billboard in 1995, and it still shows a lot of soul and simplicity. I have always liked the song because it really is better than most of the jokes on radio today. While Whitney somberly passed away a year ago, her songs still carry a tune beautifully. If you are discovering Whitney Houston for the first time, this is one song I definitely recommend for your music library.

Song: A-",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136NMRI,1,1,4,"There is no question about my deviated heart on the world losing Whitney Houston. I have never felt so outrageously hurt in all of my life, but I am so glad that everyone is reminded of how important and beautiful her voice has been to the world. Her songs have broken so many records in the deepest of ways, especially with the movies. The massive success of The Bodyguard dominated the soundtrack world in the 90's and beyond, but her songs from Waiting To Exhale are not to be overlooked, especially Exhale (Shoop Shoop.) It became the first song from a movie to debut at #1 on the Billboard charts, and showcased a sweet and simple voice that Whitney displayed in elegance by Babyface's music. Just like I Will Always Love You, this shows Whitney Houston, at her simplest and best. God bless the sweet voice.

A2QUAQ4GR6SLF7,B00136NIJA,1,1,5,"And I'm the first to give this song a review?  Amazing.

On the strength of hearing this single once on the radio (with of course no statement as to who sang it) I embarked on a quest to find this singer.  I bought one CD (Hotel Paper by Michelle Branch) which I ended up giving to my daughter - it was good, but sort of ordinary...  My second try netted Wreck of the Day, the right one, and it was worth every bit of effort and two purchases.  This is an awesome song, and every song on the CD is excellent, too.

I just hope my 5 stars lift this track up to where someone else might find it and discover Anna's incredible voice and superior songwriting.

The chorus for others who may be looking for the right one...

'Cause you can't jump the track
We're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass
Glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So just cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe",

A34VCCL1YO6D0I,B00136NIPO,1,1,4,Although I believe I might prefer the Jeff Buckley version of this song for melody and tenor who can fault the rich vibrancy of Leonard Cohen.

ABS2A1OWX5Q8,B00136NIPO,1,1,5,"Leonard Cohen was a modern-day master poet/singer/songwriter. A True musical hero now gone. This song was written by Cohen quite a few years ago, but it fits into our political climate like it was written yesterday. He writes songs from the heart and I consider this Canadian-born poet a better songwriter and singer than Bob Dylan, who he is compared with often, but Cohen sounds nothing like Dylan. He sounds like no one else. Perfect song to start out with if you never heard of Cohen. And it is not religious if that is what you were thinking by the title. You have to listen to the lyrics and if you aren't teared-up by the end, you aren't human.",

A131WEOLG7Z4GB,B00136NOVM,1,1,5,"First, I'd like to say that I am not a big fan of country music other than the classics. I purchased this song for a special occasion, that being my mother's funeral. It was requested by my daughter because she said my mother and her were recently talking about how it reminded her (my mother) of my her and my father who passed away 14 years ago.
This song is in itself a classic. Few country singers today can match the voice of Alan Jackson. Sometimes there are certain songs by certain artists that stick in our memories and bring a smile on our faces and this is one of them. Both of my parents were big fans of Alan Jackson and I am as well. Many of his songs bring me back to the days of hearing my dad singing them. This song is one that will always stick out to me and bring that smile as I think of my parents and ""Remember When...""",
ATQ0ISIPEUCLD,B00136NOVM,1,1,5,Using it for a slide show...........the part where i show wedding pics of my older relatives' wedding days.....wow - made me tear up a little.,

Even though I'm not thinking back on the same things exactly that the song says, I still think back on all the relationships and events that I shared with my family many years ago, and really moves me when I'm listening to Alan Jackson sing this song.",
A2N160B3VFV8AW,B00136NM4G,1,1,5,I would definitely recommend adding this to your Amazon Cloud.  If you are a True music lover this is a great addition.,
A32W8WR1QHAOP6,B00136NM4G,1,1,5,"This song expresses what is really important in life.  It talks about love and how at the end of one's life, the only thing we will all think about is whether we experienced love.  Whitney Houston knew how to interpret a song and she conveyed the importance of love to a well lived life in each lyric. At the end of the song listeners have a chance to hear Houston's greatest love, her daughter, sing.",
A1X3AM904OIM4X,B00136NM4G,1,1,4,"Its a shame she got involved with the drugs with bobby brown. she had a great voice and doesn't over do it with all that Mariah Carrie,  Christina Agularia crap,  trying to out do one another with there screaming and hollering. She sang straight and tasteful.

 A bit of a kook though with that visit to Israel with the ""my people"" thing but if you judge her on her singing she is one the top singers of all time.

All you soul singers can take a lesson from her...... sing it straight and powerful and don't over ad lib!!!!",

First of all, the parties didn't continue on the beach still the break of dawn, not a single latino woman said ""Aye Papi"" to me, and I didn't see a single hundred-thousand-dollar car.  What I did notice was that if you're at a traffic light and you don't gun it as soon as the light turns green, everyone behind you honks.  And there's no where to park.  Anywhere.

A1PIRSADYLJUSV,B00136NH1Y,1,1,5,I went to see a movie and the actors sang some verses from this song and I was hook. Babyface has a way of singing a song that makes a woman feel respected and sexy at the same time.,
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00136NH1Y,1,1,4,"October 29th, 2009

And I say positively because this one is more upbeat compared to a lot of his sadder affairs, although not an uptempo.

Face talks about being at work and wanting to come home to the girl that he loves so much, so they can have some bedroom fun. Or in general, anyone being stuck at work, unable to wait to get home to the one that they adore to be next to them once again.

Whip Appeal serves as a sexy mid-tempo number that hasn't really aged much at all. In fact, it feels like it was made in the 90s!

Written by Babyface and L.A. Reid.

4.5 stars.

edit: It's a shame I don't have more stuff to review. I would do it more often *if* new things were coming into my life at a dizzying rate. But alas...",

APPV1ZDETO7B,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"I don't think there has been a more definitive example of ""fusion"" in music history as with Earth Wind & Fire.  Now I'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz (which by definition IS fusion, like in Fused On) no, I'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro-Latin Gumbo Rock!  Dig That Fusion Baby!  Artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Traffic, Pink Floyd, Genesis, even Yes and ELP; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor's stable of jazz giants.  Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers' label (not represented here of course) got word of mouth disease, it was jazzy, funky, rock-drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago, this music was not a stretch at all, especially if you were also a fan of War, with or without Eric Burdon.

So this groovy 17-track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential.  The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order, not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music.  Listen to Can't Hide Love and try not to think about ""smooth jazz"" a decade later, way ahead of its time, way!  This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide.  It contains all of The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire (1978) save the weakish Love Music, six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2, and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story (from Open Our Eyes, '74) and the title epic from Gratitude ('75).  Even if you have most of their studio releases, how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life!

The CD comes with full music and track credits, a terrific bio (The Eternal Groove) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in-depth history (The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks) all packaged with some beautiful artwork (always a staple of EWF albums).  Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group, full of positive vibrations and inner peace, Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it.  Get a heaping helping right here and you won't regret it.",

I don't know what ever happened to this group but this song made them famous, and wore out air time back in 85. Turn Up The Radio takes me back to the days where everyone loved their music loud and people were in their own little world. In the mid 80's there were no cell phones, tablets, smart phones, Internet,  ETC.. We were more social, computers didn't dominate our life. We had MTV with music videos, and that awesome sound of rock coming from Ur ghetto blaster/boom box.

My sister sang a few verses of the song as part of her vows...then this was their song for the first dance.

INCREDIBLE!!

Check it out...

""I love you more than I have
Ever found a way to say to you

Next door, there's an old man who lived to his 90's
And one day, passed away in his sleep
And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way
To tell you that I know we belong
That I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest""",

A36C1OM6I2ETXX,B00136NVE2,1,1,5,"I am putting together what I call the "" jukebox"".  It consists of tunes I grew up with from the 40's through present day.  It is a big and fun project and includes various genres from ""long hair"" to jazz.  Eventually I will get all of them on to a stick drive and have non stop music whenever I want.  All these are great tunes in my opinion.",
A15T3Y3BL2AJ9V,B00136NVE2,1,1,5,"That was during the 'Psychedelic' era in 1967. This was Grace Slick at her best, I think. This track is a live recording. It is good, but a little too short, I think. I like it better than the studio version which lacks a bit of intensity. I still like it a lot. I must say, however, I was never on the drug scene. I could enjoy music easily without it.",
A3MGZWFEPAWQH4,B00136NVE2,1,1,5,I grew in the SF Bay Area in the 1970s and Jefferson Airplane was a band the locals are very proud of. So this song can be interpreted as an acid (LSD) or some type of drug-induced experience. I am not sure. Jefferson Airplane's lyrics tend to be thought provoking and can be interpreted many ways. I like lyrics that are abstract and can mean different things to different people.,

A1XJ97KVHBJ5K8,B00136NVE2,1,1,5,"I don't know if there's anything more to be said about Jefferson Airplane (and Starship, for that matter), that hasn't been said. A Super Group from the 60's and 70's that had all the right ingredients. Grace Slick (as was Stevie Nicks) was, and still is by most of us early rockers, the Queens of Rock n' Roll!

White Rabbit was one of Slick's first songs written by her, and she brought it over from The Great Society (a band mostly associated with the Acid Rock era of 1965/66) when she joined Jefferson Starship in 1968. It was a huge hit for Starship with Grace Slick doing some of her best vocals!

Long Live Starship!",
A2TRDULU6DNT8W,B00136NVE2,1,1,4,"Fun nonsensical song, reminds me very much of Alice in Wonderland, perhaps a slightly darker version than the Disney adaption. And No I'm not talking about Tim Burton's Version.",

A3D9KO6R1JB845,B00136NQKG,1,1,5,"Although I generally prefer female voices for the ""wintery""  themed Christmas songs Johnny Mathis is an exception to that general rule. Johnny Mathis performances Sleigh Ride is PERFECT and it IS the best version of Sleigh Ride that exits. The tempo is very good and the singing is excellent. I prefer Johnny Mathis's version of Sleigh Ride over the Carpenters vey good version because all of the original lyrics are retained. Much like with It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas it's clear Johnny Mathis holds claim to the most superior version of Sleigh Ride. 5 out of 5 stars.",

.",
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00136NVZQ,1,1,5,"This is a very strong song about someone lusting after someone so much that they only have the best intentions in mind to ""rock the world"" of the one that they want to give their passionate and physical love to.  This is made abundantly clear with the following catchy lyrics: I need your love and I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same
I'm for the real and for you I'm True blue
Let's make a deal, sugar, all I want to do is be your one and only lover

  This also implies that she only wants to give her lover a pleasurable experience. She really puts so much emotion and authenticity in the song that you can easily picture yourself saying this at the same time that the song is playing. She has really good vocals to go with this very classic song.  This definitely sounds like ""beautiful music"" with the way she raises her sensual voice at the end.  A very memorable, creative, and passionate song.",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136PSAM,1,1,5,"There is no doubt that with when anyone has tried to do The Star Spangled Banner or America The Beautiful and knocks it out of the park, it can be amazing. But for Whitney Houston doing it back in 1991, she made it more dominant than what Francis Scott Key could've ever imagined. It came on the heels of the Persian Gulf War, and hearing how bold and somber it is, sadly after Whitney had died, it is a unparalleled trademark of why someone is that strong. Whitney dominated that song beyond what words could've ever said, and that lightning in a bottle will never be replicated. I will never get over the sadness I feel without hearing the voice of our times pass on. Whitney Houston will be missed, and definitively never forgotten.

A17UXXQRJUD0I4,B00136PQ2M,1,1,5,"As an early Baby Boomer who enjoyed the hey-day of jazz during the 60's, Dave Brubeck was among my favorite.  His masterpiece, 'Take Five' remains a classic.

I've long since lost my collection of jazz recordings, having few left when transitioning to CD. And now that I'm slowly adapting to today's new technology of 'cloud' storage, I am slowly compiling a playlist of Jazz Favorites.

Fortunately, this 'Take Five' track is authentic, and probably the best choice for MP3 players.  It's great to include in your playlists to download on your media player.

If you are a Dave Brubeck fan and enjoy jazz, choose this track.  You won't be disappointed.

A19W8QII5ZCYAE,B00136PQ2M,1,1,5,"This particular rendition was introduced to me by my father at an impressionable time in my music life. I can feel and re-live the passion of loving the jazz genre as if it were yesterday. What makes it even more special is that the two of us set to discover the cleverness of 5/4 rhythm together. Magic.

That said, this piece is yet unparalled for its artful uniqueness, And the backup personnel could not be more precise. Beautifully ""conversational"" together. The ""Brubeck machine"" at its finest.",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136PSAM,1,1,4,"There is honestly so much that can be said about anyone, whom can try and sing the Star Spangled Banner. It has been done so many times, and by so many people, but there have been a lot of faults that haven't been able to outshine others. Arguable, the biggest version of the Star Spangles, is definitely from the great Whitney Houston. Her legacy to deliver any cover, has been beyond what words could ever be ignited from the soul of the heart. Her rendition from the Super Bowl back in 1991, still ignites from the impassioned soul. Whenever I hear this version that ""The Voice"" honorably showcased, I am constantly reminded of how beautiful she still can shine, where so many singers like Beyonce' Knowles have not even came close to singing and delivering a simple note where Whitney ignited from first to last place. If you have never heard a song by the dynamic Whitney Houston, than this song is one I sincerely recommend.

Song: B+",

The song is a good rocker and builds. There is a great backing vocal and the crying steel guitar throughout is a highlight (and a lost art in country today). I'd recommend it - a good, sweet, jam.",

He played Take Five, and I'll never forget the song (or the evening). It was jazz, but not jazz. It was definitely something new and VERY different. How was I to know that 40 years later, I'd be living within 4 miles of his birthplace? I was sorry to hear about his passing last week, but very thankful that we had him and his music for 60 years!",

AA5HPTKCEJWZ,B00136PQYU,1,1,5,I have always loved this song. The year was 1979 disco was still alive and Barry Gibb was at the top of his game with song writing. Take a song produced by Barry Gibb and combine the voice  and talent of Barbara Streisand and you get a powerful and timeless love song. Barbara sings this song with such emotion. I have always felt that nobody sings a song like Barbara.,

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136PYNI,1,1,4,"There is no question about how Michael Jackson had to follow up his monster album Thriller with his Bad record; While Bad wasn't as strong as Thriller in sales, it did have some great songs to follow in stride. But very rare there is one without the theme of being a perfectionist in video. I Just Can't Can't Stop Loving You, the duet with Sieda Garett, whom co-wrote Man In The Mirror is one of those songs that still sounds irresistible to the heart and the ears for anyone that is a hard core fan of Michael Jackson. Surprisingly, the duet was suppose with be with legend Whitney Houston in heart, but didn't actually go as planned because of other things. But this is one song you can definitely enjoy without him being too much demand as a singer, or what Michael was able to accomplish without fault of his legacy.

Song: B+",

AFY8MKXMZCNKC,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"I love it!!!! I'm 24, so growing up, I was raised on classic rock, and (new?) rock. My family has always been a bit racist, so anything black musicians wrote, was terrible, except K.C. and the Sunshine band, since they had two or three white guys. Fortunately for me, I never cared about race, so I made friends of every color, and was able to broadly expand my horizons on the music front. I've never really cared for R&B, and still don't.  But some Rap, and Funk, really hit the spot. Earth, Wind, and Fire, was one of those funk bands. I LOVE Funk/Disco! Even my family hears me listen to EWF, and says ""Hey! That is really good! Who is that?!"" But, of course when I say ""EWF"" they say ""Oh, It's alright"". I KNOW THEY CAN FEEL THE FUNK!!!!!! They know it is great! EWF is probably my favorite, when it comes to funk! Anyway, enough about racist families. If you like Funk, and/or R&B. You can't go wrong with EWF!",

AB6O8EM172B74,B00136PX6Q,1,1,4,"Sometimes, all of us want to escape the 'drudgeries' of every day life.  The idea of someone holding '2 tickets to Paradise' in their hand - and just waiting to give them to me - to 'take me on a trip so far from here' - is, quite appealing to me - especially at this juncture in life.

Although there is no 'love' component to the song, which, typically I find to be the most attractive aspect - the promise of 'relief' from daily pressures, plus, the idea that I might have a '+1' on my 'trip,' brings me inspiration and, most importantly, hope.

Good stuff - the song, that is.

I created a slideshow on my computer with this music - paradise is looking pretty good - even if me and my '+1' just get to spend two weeks at an all inclusive resort somewhere in the Caribbean.  There is, after all, in reality - 'No place like home.'

They just don't make'em like they used to.

$1.29 for '2 Tickets to Paradise.'

A wise investment - in one man's humble opinion.",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136PY9M,1,1,4,"There is no question that it still feels so surreal that Whitney Houston passed away at 48 years old. Yet, she left behind a remarkable and beautiful imprint on voice and song. How Will I Know showed that extremely well. Her 4th #1 hit from her debut album, showed she not only could sing, but drive definitively from voice and heart alone. The song and Whitney's pop elegance stands shoulders above a lot of the pop music of today in droves. Still, no matter what diva has shown to be dominant whether it is Beyonce', Madonna or Mariah Carey, none of them will ever duplicate the immortal voice that Whitney Houston showcased for the world to hear and see.

Then not too long ago I saw this new compilation of EW&F's greatest hits listed among one of Amazon's $5 album offerings.  I checked it out and found track after track that to me epitomize this iconic group during it's R&B and disco eras.

There are 17 tracks in this collection, and IMO, at least 11 of them are solid gold.  I have to admit that this kind of music appeals to me because I was in HS/college during the heyday of Earth, Wind and Fire.

Particularly popular and notable tracks that were popular ""back then"" and regularly make appearances here and there on oldies stations as well as in movies, etc., are:
- Shining Star
- That's the Way of the World
- September
- Got to Get You into My Life
- Sing a Song
- Fantasy
- Reasons
- Let's Groove
- Boogie Wonderland
- After the Love has Gone
- Getaway

Some of these tracks are so iconic of the disco era that you can almost see the silk shirts, huge collars, and white suits...scary isn't it.  Yet, it's completely fun!

5 stars for great songs and great memories!",

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00136PM3K,1,1,5,"Despite the title, this song is actually a pleasure to listen to.  I must first start off by saying how much I love the fact that that Three Days Grace manages to turn a song about love involving pain into a genius art form.  This is another fun song that I have on my zune player and I like how he expresses himself when he sings lyric such as ""trust me and take my hand"" ""when the lights go out you will understand"" and then the song pauses for s split second before he belts out pain among the right timed guitars to help break the pause.  He raises his voice some times during the songs but he does it at the right times in the songs such as in the end of it and at one of my favorite moments in the song when he sings ""I'm always here for you"" ""Iknow, I know, I know, I know that you'll thank me later"".  The lead singer's awesome voice goes perfect with this song. Anyhow, the interesting thing about this song is that if you would like to listen to a sensual erotic song that falls under the hard rock/alternative rock genre then this song would be a must have in your musical collection.  It's been a couple of years since this song came out but I am still enjoying it and I am glad to have it as part of my musical collection.  This song is definitely recommended for rock music lovers amd even music lovers that may only be lightly into rock but would like to add something different to their musical collection.",

The previous summer the South African trumpeter/bandleader/arranger Hugh Masekela had taken his instrumental version of this tune all the way to #1.

That being said, this collection isn't really enough to satisfy my craving for their music. I agree that it covers their essential hits, but I am much more content with buying the original releases. There is maybe two songs max out of discs 1974-1981 that i do not have rated 5 stars on my iPod, or even have but that's it!

As some of the other reviews have said, this is a great compilation for those who just want to start out basic or just have some hits.

I am a huge 80's music fan, and the music is still popular today. I am so happy young people know what great music is, I guess that's why 80's music is so popular in the 21st century. I am sure most people have heard this song, it is worth the 1.29. I think this is the only song Scandal had success with, but some of those one hit wonders live forever.",

There are other songs that this group did, mind you, but they weren't nearly as powerful, nor as wonderful and memorable as this song was and still is!  I would highly recommend this track for anybody who enjoys listen to some hard rock once in a while; but I wouldn't definitely recommend buying it from Amazon.com because that's where I purchased this and many other tracks that I own now.",

A23Q1T4MXZHFM7,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Earth Wind and Fire is one of the greatest R&B groups which scored a number of great hits during mid 70s to early 80s. It has released a number of greatest hit compilations so far, but this one is most suited for ordinary music fans who have never bought any of EW&F albums.

Earth Wind and Fire is regarded as a disco hit maker because during late 70s to early 80s the group had produced such tracks that might fit well for disco-dancing from slow ballad AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE to dance-pop BOOGIE WONDERLAND and LET'S GROOVE. But up until mid 70s they created some great spiritual songs with ethreal out-of-the-world chorus. CAN'T HIDE LOVE is one of the good examples to show their chorus style. FANTASY is by far the most successful single release in Japan. KALIMBA STORY and MIGHTY MIGHTY are the funky pop songs representing their early days' music style.

Verdict: Well-balanced and great one-CD compilation showcasing their career.
Rating: 90 out of 100
Recommended for: Music fans who want to get a glimpse of great 70s music.",
A32JXG7CMQWX0F,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"There are more extensive collections out there: the three disc ""The Eternal Dance"", the two disc ""The Essential Earth Wind & Fire"", but this single disc cuts right to the chase and delivers an entire CD's worth of the group's best and most beloved material.

You can put this on at a party, let it play in its entirety, and not hear one complaint about any of the music, not only since EWF are one of the best groups ever, but they had so many hits that even someone who says they're not a fan is familiar with at least half of these tracks, and they upheld the quality along the way.

An indispensable CD if EVER there was one.",
A14W8HXP3RM3ZS,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"EARTH, WIND & FIRE-GREATEST HITS: Named for elements in leader MAURICE WHITE's astrological charts, EARTH, WIND & FIRE seamlessly tempered their spiritual funk/soul vibe with a glossy pop sheen that also dabbled in jazz and gospel...the rare group with something for everyone. After several years as one of RNB's best kept secrets, EWF broke through in a big way with the award winning platter THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD and never looked back. Former RAMSEY LEWIS drummer turned belter WHITE fronted horn heavy, positive-groove party starters SHINING STAR and SING A SONG, while PHILLIP BAILEY's velvety Falsetto carried ballads like REASONS and AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE into the stratosphere. GREATEST HITS is the total package spotlighting early showstopper MIGHTY MIGHTY, a sparkling cover of the Fab Four's GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE and BOOGIE WONDERLAND (a duet featuring soul sisters THE EMOTIONS)...proud testaments to EWF's knack for filling the charts, dance floors and concert halls during their late seventies hey-day.

When others say that this was their best (perhaps along with The Boxer) I can definitely agree! The lyrics are indeed poetic and the music fits in so smoothly and beautifully with Art Garfunkel's singing; I just can't believe how this succeeds on so many levels at once.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits has many hits that I remember from when I was a kid in school; it brings back a lot of memories for me. This is a strong single CD compilation although as others have noted it doesn't give you every last one of their hits. However, what we do get is very high quality control music from Earth Wind & Fire; and that's great. The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that artwork, too.

""Shining Star"" rocks! This came out and hit the airwaves big time! Earth Wind & Fire simply never sounded better. They really handle this well; they never skip a beat nor do they ever let go of a superfluous note. The tempo and key changes make the number strong; and they sing this very well. ""That's The Way Of The World"" quickly shifts gears for a much more mellow sounding tune; this features the group squarely in the spotlight--right where they belonged and still belong! ""That's The Way Of The World"" was always one of my very favorite Earth Wind & Fire tunes; and I think just one listen will tell you why--this is all THAT good.

""September"" has an awesome beat that would even get the dead tapping their feet to the rhythm; ""September"" was yet another huge hit that got a lot of airplay when it was originally released. I still hear it sometimes on an ""oldies"" radio station in my area; and that's grand. ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" is one heck of a snazzy tune; they make this a masterpiece and they deliver this with a lot of feeling. In addition, ""Sing A Song"" has them harmonizing to perfection--and beyond! ""Sing A Song"" is another major hit on this CD.

""Serpentine Fire"" uses the percussion to great advantage; and of course another big hit for this group is ""Fantasy."" ""Fantasy"" charms me with its beauty and it's truly a stand-out on this album--how could they ever get better than this? I'm amazed. ""Mighty Mighty"" has quite a beat that gets you up and dancing nearly wherever you are; and listen for ""Reasons."" ""Reasons"" has a mellow, pensive flavor to it that is absolutely stunning--and the backup singers harmonize well.

""Let's Groove"" is another tune that still sounds good all these years later; and I really like ""Boogie Wonderland"" which Earth Wind & Fire performs with The Emotions. ""Boogie Wonderland"" was a huge success for these artists and I still love to hear it today. ""After The Love Has Gone"" again showcases Earth Wind & Fire at their mellow best; and the album ends strong with Earth Wind & Fire performing ""Getaway."" ""Getaway"" has a strong beat that makes me want to dance; and it also leaves me wanting so much more!

This is a great album for fans of Earth Wind & Fire, but if truth be told they would need other CDs to have all of the hits from this fantastic group. This album is particularly good for the casual fan who wants most of their hits on one single CD; and it makes an excellent starter CD for people just discovering the fine talents of Earth Wind & Fire.",

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"In their seventies heyday, Earth Wind and Fire were one of the hottest touring acts in the world and an unstoppable singles machine. Band leader Maurice White and main singer Phillip Bailey had a chemistry that was almost unbeatable, and top notch musicians brought the chops. White eventually hit a supple groove that was both funky and popular, and when the hits started coming, like ""Shining Star"" and ""September,"" they helped make disco into a bit less of a dirty word.

They had another secret weapon in the EWF Horns. Punchy when they needed to be, smooth jazz when required, they often provided an 'x' factor in the band's best work. The band mixed these elements into a dynamite stage show that rivaled George Clinton's Mothership era for sheer audacity and showmanship. While there are no live tracks here, if you've ever seen the camp classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band/dp/B00009APB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>, you'll see a tiny fraction of the excitement when the band performs ""Got To Get You Into My Life.""

Listening to this CD several years after what EWF tunes had been trimmed from my library is a real trip down memory lane. From the opening Black Pride Themed ""Shining Star"" to the road-trip classic ""Getaway,"" these are all memorable hook-fests that livened up many an AM radio in the 70's. White often had a Utopian vision that he emphasized in his lyrics making these tunes both danceable and uplifting. Bailey's distinguished Falsetto livened the ballads (like ""After The Love Has Gone""), but EWF's real genius was making songs that were irresistible funky grooves. If you don't find yourself bopping to ""Boogie Wonderland,"" check and make sure your feet are still attached.

Only frustration - missing ""Love's Holiday,"" ""Magnetic,"" ""System of Survival"" or anything post 1983. Could have been a double disc, easily. But really, even without them, this single disc EWF CD is indispensable if you're an oldies buff.",

However there are plenty of shoulda been classics like the groovin' Saturday Night and the cool ballad Reasons.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136NUG6,1,1,4,"The music of the 70's today has shown a definitive effect on what we hear on radio and on television today. Although there are times where we see the past as something better than the future. That has been the case with acts putting their music into musicals like Billy Joel for Movin' Out, and John Lennon's music for the short-lived Imagine. That also has happened with Earth Wind & Fire, who recently had there catalog of great songs showcased for the upbeat Off-Broadway show Hot Feet. It still has proven that there music hasn't been forgotten by the public at all, and this collection of their music is also not forgotten either.

Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits is a single disc reflection of the group during their 1970's hey day and all of the tracks that are still just shown as True guilty pleasures today. The songs on this collection still stand out today, and they sound better than they did before on this collection. The album includes classics like their standard Shining Star, the soulful and elequent After The Love Has Gone, Fantasy, the funky & upbeat September, and Let's Groove. They are just delightful to listen to, and still stand out very weel with the essence of Disco, Soul, Funk & R&B.

Although it is a shame that the group hasn't captured what they had back in the 70's, but Earth Wind & Fire are still great to listen to today. Their 1998 Greatest Hits is a truly a really definitive record, and I absolutely recommend this a whole lot for anybody who wants to be a shining star.

1. Substitute the studio version of 'Reasons' with the classic LIVE VERSION (8:22) from 'Gratitude'!!
2. And include BOTH 'Love's Holiday' & the 'Brazilian Rhyme' (interlude) for a BETTER (Almost PERFECT!) SINGLE DISC COMPILATION!!

I did this, and there's more than enough time on a CD, so EWF fans can make the perfect CD to take out in the car or at work. Missing tracks aside, 'Greatest Hits' is a sound investment, and I love the linernotes & packaging. Maybe Legacy will get it right next time, but why wait!

This group had some outa-sight funky songs that made you tap your foot and roller skate to the rhythm.  Their songs, reflecting the innocence of the era, were colorful and upbeat.  The direction and genius of Maurice White was responsible for making this funk possible.  Vocally, they were a soulful chorus with Phillip Bailey's Falsetto leading throughout most of these songs.

The opening number ""Shining Star"" is more than a far-out funky tune.  Just listen to that vocal blend and that rousing arrangement.  ""That's The Way of the World"", ""September"", ""Sing a Song"", ""Mighty Mighty"", ""Saturday Night"", and ""Get Away""  are trade mark songs of the group.  Nobody can remake these or has even tried.  Yet, the group has successfully recorded other's songs like ""Can't Hide Love"" and ""Got To Get You Into My Life"".  The highlights that deserve giving more than a quick listen are ""Fantasy"" which is a gorgeous blend of voices,  ""Kalimba Story"" which a totally original song written by Maurice White, ""Reasons"" which is a gorgeous love song with Phillip Bailey in the lead vocal, and last, but not least, ""After The Love Has Gone"" which is a very fine ballad.

One cannot leave out the musical arrangements that accompany the vocal group of Earth Wind & Fire.  While it is extremely rare today to find comparable talent on a recording, it was also quite rare in the 70's era to find such artistry on studio recordings.  But this is what added to the group's sound and what made them so popular.  There were rich sounds from not only keyboards, guitars, drums, and saxophones, but instruments that brought the full experience:  trumpets, trombones, congas, flutes, violins, violas, tubas, harps, and timpani.

This collection of songs is fun for those who remember the funk era and fun for those who just want to experience enjoyable, upbeat music.  A must have treasure!!!",

A26CCP0YRR14AQ,B00136PSJI,1,1,5,"The question is asked ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go"", can they find their way home.

No one asked that question better than Whitney did.  When she sang it you knew she'd been there and had asked herself the same question many times.

This is one of Whitney's best songs because it ask so simply all the questions that run across your heart when it's breaking.

""If somebody loves you, don't they always love you"", how many of us have asked that very question?

A tragic loss for all to have lost one of the truly greatest voices for all time. A loss that has many a soul asking ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go""?",

ADUSWSN9R4MI1,B00136Q5ZY,1,1,4,"I have enjoyed this song for a very long time.  I probably wouldn't have bought an entire album just for this song, but now that you can buy songs individually at a reasonable price, I am going back and filling in some of the holes in my collection.  My husband is all about the music and the musicians (he was at Woodstock and the ""dress rehearsal"" 2 weeks earlier in Atlantic City, he can tell you the various members of virtually every one of his hundreds of favorite bands (and when they were with the band, why they left, and what other bands they were in).

Their music was as beautiful as it was thought provoking.  My life would not be the same without their music.

A2UR38SZPVA07I,B00136PY5Q,1,1,5,"Jimmy Webb's epic The Highwayman (1984) is the song that gave the country supergroup of Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson their name (The Highwaymen), and was the first song on their first album. It was the group's signature song, their first #1 hit single and still remains their most popular song ever.

The Highwayman tells the story of death and rebirth in four parts, and each part is sung by a different member of the group. The first three characters (Willie, Kris, Waylon) meet their deaths and are somehow resurrected. Johnny's character has already left his former life and is in the process of being reincarnated. His character may also represent all of The Highwaymen.

Or all of us...

Willie:

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bas***ds hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

Kris:

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
With the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner around the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

Waylon:

I was a dam builder. Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell to the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around...I'll always be around

Johnny:

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a Highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain

And I'll be back again...",
A20JK8DT702CWE,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"It's got all the hits and more all right, and so, so fine they are.  The remastering is absolutely awesome - - crank up 'September' any time of the year and you're guaranteed to get gone.  It isn't chronological - - the earliest track, 'Kalimba Story', comes smack in the middle - - but this is a party, not a history lesson.  I could do without 'Boogie Wonderland' myself but you can't not have everything, and I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go nitpick on someone else.  Awesome, wonderful.",
A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Although there are several greatest hits packages available for Earth Wind & Fire, most notably the Best of EWF Volumes 1 & 2, their Greatest Hits compliation which was released by Columbia Records in 1998 is easily the best one available. Containing most of the band's hits as well as lesser known tracks that are just as strong, Greatest Hits is the perfect introduction to this talented band's music.

 Simply put, every track here is top notch with most of them hitting the Top Ten on both the pop singles and black singles charts. The tracks ""Mighty Mighty"", ""Saturday Nite"", and their only #1 pop single ""Shining Star"" are excellent funk songs punctuated by their trademark snappy horn lines. The tracks ""September"", ""Serpentine Fire"", and ""Sing A Song"" are near perfect pop songs with soaring harmonies and melodies that stay in your head immediately upon first listen. Their late-70's hits ""Let's Groove"" and ""Boogie Wonderland"" are very strong disco tracks with the former track aging wonderfully compared to most of the music from that genre. While the harmonies are strong on all of their material, harmonizing doesn't get much better than on ""Getaway"", arguably the finest song they've ever recorded. The ballads here are all fantastic with ""After The Love Has Gone"", ""That's The Way Of The World"", and ""Reasons"" being not only among the best recorded in the '70s, but of any era. Other great tracks here include their cover of the Beatles' ""Got To Get You Into My Life"", ""Fantasy"", and ""Kalimba's Story."" This is a phenomenal greatest hits album that should be part of every music fan's collection. Highly recommended.",

A2MTWO8TQZNBK6,B00136Q5ZY,1,1,5,"This is an older haunting song that I always loved but never hear on the radio. Now I can listen to it at whim. Roger Whittaker's smooth deep voice, the lyrics, and the instrumental behind it place you in a misty ocean scene.",
A2BAIVKTJFDBWJ,B00136PYJW,1,1,5,"It's a great inspiring song. You are never to old to believe in these things. You must never forget these things. Here are some lines from it, ""to fight for the right, without question or pause"" ""to fight the unbeatable foe"" ""to run, where the brave dare not go"" ""this is my quest, to
follow that star"" ""and the world will be better for this, that one man,
scorned and covered with scars...""",
A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Mid-1970s black music seemed dominated either by fun, mindless party jams like ""Jungle Boogie"" and ""Skin Tight,"" or dour warnings like ""Future Shock"" and ""Living For The City."" Stevie Wonder sang his share of life-affirming music but Earth, Wind & Fire, here with a definitive one-disc greatest hits, made such positive strength the heart of their musical identity.
Some of the era's most needed, heeded messages ran deep and sweet atop Verdine White's bass grooves (front and center on ""Getaway""), brother and leader Maurice's drum and percussion tracks  honed over years with Chess Records' rhythm section (""Saturday Nite,"" ""Kalimba Story,"" 1977's dazzling ""Serpentine Fire""), Louis Satterfield's horn section scrambling through jazz-rock mazes every track (becoming a 80s rock stalwart backing Phil Collins), and Phillip Bailey's high, clear Falsetto on ""After The Love Has Gone,"" the prom dance standard ""Reasons,"" the soaring chorus of ""September,"" and the elegant ""Fantasy"" which, with ""Serpentine Fire,"" gave R&B one of its best 1-2 LP opening tracks. (It's restored to album length here, with Larry Dunn's superb keyboard intros, after being edited on two previous best-ofs).
Messages like ""You're a shining star...shining bright to see what you can truly be,""  ""If you sing a song today, you will make a better way,"" ""Try to resist all the hurt that's all around ya..."" moved feet and hearts, misinterpreted by spiritual seekers and hedonists alike in the ""Me"" decade's last discofied days. The Whites understood disco's falsity: ""Morning deals a bad hand to a woman who has made too many bets,"" Maurice sings on 1979's galloping disco smash ""Boogie Wonderland,"" adding, ""You dance and shake the hurt."" But by early 1982, needing a hit after a slow-selling double-LP the year before, EWF gave in to the dance grooves and party-down lyrics of ""Let's Groove,"" their last Top 5 hit.
Despite a generous 18 tracks (and an excellent geneology of the group by Kevin Goins), longtime fans will miss ""In The Stone,"" ""Fall In Love With Me,"" ""Head To The Sky,"" ""Let Me Talk,"" and others. These are found on 1995's ""Eternal Dance"" box, the ""Elements of Love"" ballads collection, or two previous best-ofs. This ""Greatest Hits"" packs their best-known pop songs into an exceptionally sounding disc (thanks to Mark Wilder's remastering), providing an essential introduction to one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's most surprising, satisfying member groups.",
AXPYGNIC5ZIXS,B00136NUG6,1,1,4,"With the possible exceptions of Rufus and Sly and the Family Stone, there is virtually no other band to so successfully marry elements of funk, R&B, and pop as Earth Wind & Fire. Their heavy horns, infectious rhythms, and disco overtones are nothing short of an all-out party, and the digital remastering some of their best-loved tracks are granted here make the aural results all the more delicious.
Funk workouts like ""Shining Star,"" ""Let's Groove,"" ""Boogie Wonderland"" and the classic ""September"" are solid, irresistible works that age like fine wine, and silky ballads like ""That's the Way of the World"" and ""Reasons"" proved that they could be twice as smooth even when the tempo was half as fast. The band even offers up one of the strongest Beatles covers ever recorded, an irresistibly bright reading of ""Got to Get You Into My Life."" But their hands-down masterpiece will always be ""After the Love is Gone,"" a simply-perfect cut that boasts flawless vocals, lush horns, and a striking chord progression.
Of the songs that weren't crossover smashes, some are revelations (""Mighty Mighty,"" ""Saturday Night"") while others simply aren't up to snuff (""Serpentine Fire,"" ""Kalimba Song""). Regardless, for a single-disc collection of a supergroup of Earth Wind & Fire's magnitude, you really couldn't do much better.",

I especially like this song because if your working out it makes you workout that much harder, so you can become that much stronger.

This song appeared when Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat would enter the arena and walked to the ring. This was his entrance music. Today, when I listened to this song, I get goose bumps all over.

It has a pleasant, easy going sound to it; it isn't rock and roll, pop, country, or elevator music (but it is closest to the last one).  I like the percussion and the guitar sounds in this song.

A376KW9VEPA6GJ,B00136Q306,1,1,5,"This album is OUTSTANDING.  Why in the hell are we not hearing more about these guys???!!!!  Terry Kath Chicago fans UNITE!  CTA is the REAL deal, and the new songs fit well and show this group has fantastic potential. With all the hubbub about the latest release of Chicago's ""lost"" Stone of Sisyphus, I think I'm going to puke.  The reviews for SOS all sound like old fans trying to convince themselves that SOS is the best since the Terry Kath days and that they should be excited and happy.  It might be best, but it is still a gigantic cry from that early magic. Chicago since Terry Kath's passing and even the ""transitional"" Hot Streets album is a completely different band and should have changed their name.  All the blues and grit from the early days has continued to be replaced with slick production, synthesizers, and seriously stripped down guitar.  California Transit Authority DOES have that early magic, and I hope and pray they can continue to create and perform.  The WORD must get out. And before you get the idea these guys are just an old Chicago cover band, forget it!  They add their own spice and the new songs show they are every bit as inovative and appealing.  Be prepared to be blown away.

It is truly tragic that Pankow, Loughnane, Parazaider, and Lamm are not a part of Danny's new adventure. The songs are polished, the sound is GREAT, and, if they are honest with themselves, as musicians (with any personality conflicts set aside), I would imagine they would be crying inside not having been part of this wonderful project.

When I first heard that the brass sound on the tracks was done on keyboard, I thought it would sound nothing but cheesy.  NO WAY.  No way at all.  In fact, when I listen to the tracks, I cannot tell the difference except on 25 or 6 to 4 which, I believe, was done live.  I can easily imagine that Pankow, Loughnane, and Parazaider made the studio sessions in secret, but due to contractual obligations, they are not credited. Wouldn't that be a gas?!  Anyway, time will tell if the band can pull off some new tunes that equal or surpass Pankow's inovative big brass sound.

The new musicans really, really cook!!!  Marc Bonilla is fantastic find.  Though no one can replace Kath, Bonilla has his own magic and the playing is phenomenal. He definitely HAS the down and dirty blues.  Larry Braggs from Tower of Power is a perfect fit for the group. All the other musicans are just great, and they play tight.

One more comment.  I already knew that Danny was a rock drum genius, but this album makes it painfully clear he was an extremely essential ingredient to the early Chicago sound.

If you like the Terry Kath Chicago, this is an absolute must buy.  RIGHT NOW!",

A11GY1G10WSE8,B00136Q306,1,1,5,"For those not familiar with Danny Seraphine, he was a founding member and the original drummer for the legendary band Chicago from 1967 through 1990.  He is also considered one of the great stylists and innovators on his instrument, forging a unique jazz-based rock style that propelled his supergroup through 20 top ten hits, 16 million-selling albums and numerous sold out concerts around the world for millions of fans. After Danny was ""fired"" by the group in 1990, he went into seclusion and put his drums aside.  Following years of production projects in the sudio and even Broadway, Danny got back into form in recent years with the inspiration of top industry musicians.  His jam sessions resulted in the formation of ""CTA"" and now the release of this studio work with a wonderful mix of Chicago classics and originals and other rock standards.  Bottomline: Every track works and every track cooks.  Danny's drum chops are back intact as he leads this band of top flight musicians with the amazing Marc Bonilla on guitar and Tower of Power's incredible Larry Braggs on vocals.  Yes, Danny Seraphine is back, back with a vengeance and showing the world a return to the original musical inspiration that made the early Chicago great.  While his former bandmates earn a paycheck entertaining the wine and cheese crowd with Peter Cetra covers like ""If You leave Me Now"" Danny and CTA are playing real music for the sake of the music itself and blowin' the door down.
""California Transit Authority"" is a superb CD and is a must listen for all Chicago fans and fans of rock music in general. The current members of Chicago could also stand to listen to this exciting work as a reminder of what they set out to accomplish musically in 1967, while using ""Chicago XXX"" as a coaster for their drinks.",

The song has great lyrics, but the musical and vocal elements to the song all seem overdone, overcooked, and trying too hard. In fact, somebody tried too hard to make this song a hit, which never really caught on, but you hear it on radio constantly, to the point where you cringe every time you hear this song.

And by the way, does anybody else think that an inspirational song from somebody like Avril Lavigne, who is not the best of role models, is just plain wrong? In either case, the song doesn't work, except on a lyrical level, and even that's been done before.",

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00136RFJY,1,1,4,"Alright, take yourself to back in the day, before all the personal stuff, and when Britney ruled the music world with an iron poppy fist. Still not there? Oh well... This song, her last real song that anybody would pass more than a horrifying glance at her. And while not her best vocally, you just can't get away from that beat. Congrats, kudos, and bravo to the producer that created that, because it is simply amazing. Perfect for spy movies, and when it was used in ""Chuck,"" and it's just so darn catchy. You know the opening chords, you know the riff, it's all familiar, and lovable.

As for Britney herself? She's okay, normal dance club fare. Nothing special vocally here. Lyrics? It's Britney, b**ch! Who needs lyrics? Just a beat, and a music video!

So overall, you might want to skip the vocal version, and just get the instrumental version which I am just lovin' up on now. So hurry, get it, use it as a ringtone! Or use it next time you can't get the James Bond/Mission Impossible Theme for your secret spy activities.

By the way, some great covers have been made of this song, and most of them come out surprising well. Some offer a different take, some are fun, some are strange to say the least. Hard-Fi did a great low-fi indie cover of the song, which all but removes the original melody, and just keeps the lyrics, while adding some car effects.

Nickel Creek did a great humorous live performance that you can find in various places. In that version, one of the band members readily admits, ""This song kicks a*s!""

And Yael Naim did a cover of the song, which is very strange and haunting. I didn't care for it, but some will and do.",
A3OSZMNBO13W93,B00136RQZM,1,1,5,I will always love the subtle firmness of these words and Deniece Williams' delivery of them!! Gorgeous song forever & ever!!,

The harmony of the singers is very good, and I like the background guitar work.  The song is short, around 2 minutes.  If you lived in the time period, it may bring back memories, if not, experience a little sixties nostalgia.  Enjoy!",

A3K5LACYLUHBF8,B00136RFJY,1,1,4,"I wouldn't consider myself a fan of Britney Spears. I grew up in the 90's and yes, then I was a total fan. I grew out of it, came to discover a full array of music from little known artists or bands from the far reaches of this world. My taste was a bit more refined from the days of me buying my first CD. Or so I thought! When ""Toxic"" came out, it honestly annoyed me but the more I heard it, the better it sounded. I realized this was a departure from the simplistic arrangements I'd come to expect from Britney, it was actually full of layers of sound and lyrics that had something to them. I know somebody reading this will say, ""huh?"" when I'm talking like this but I actually think there's some substance to this song, even a challenge to Britney's usual music. It's cool if you totally disagree but I think that it's a great pop song, whatever that means to every individual person.",

The girl is telling the guy I like you so much and your so addicting that your toxic to me! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!",

A2ROCLA9ULNK39,B00136RS5A,1,1,5,Even better than I remembered it. Brought back memories. I would reccommend it to everyone. His voice is excellent and the quality of the sound is great. If you care for the old love songs this one is perfect. I also put it in the same catagory as Johnny Mathis & Perry Como music of the same era.,
A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B00136RIS2,1,1,5,The words are perfect for anyone who cares about how much really matters in life. Education as a form of regimentation for uniformity has never been as exciting as the ideas in this song.,

AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00136RKKI,1,1,5,"The Fray is one of those contemporary soft-rock groups that show that that genre's stereotype of being slow and dull need not always apply.  ""Over My Head (Cable Car)"" describes lead singer, Isaac Slade's, contentious relationship with his older brother Caleb (nicknamed `cable car').  In the music video for ""Over My Head"", Isaac plays the role of his older brother, while his real life younger brother, Micah, portrays Isaac.  The lyrics are very relatable and that type of connection to a song gives it tremendous staying power.",

A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00136PYH4,1,1,4,"""The Girl Is Mine"" was the first single off the Thriller album and was a duet with Paul McCartney. It was released in October 1982, a month and half before the album itself.  The song is a light, fluffy piece of pop music that didn't really set a good tone of what to expect from the album, but it is an infectious piece of ear candy.  Mr. Jackson has said that the song's recording was one his favorite moments in the studio and you can hear the good times reflected in the song.  The playful banter and vocals between the two megastars transmits through the music.",
A1DC3104FVGWYT,B00136PYH4,1,1,5,"I always enjoyed Michael, he is truly missed.  No matter what he did, I found very entertaining.  I try to get all his music and I loved his videos, no one danced like Michael",

A1XVVT4YLGXZAV,B00136RS8C,1,1,5,George Jones' singing of He Stopped Loving Her Today is the best of the best.  All of the sadness of loving someone who does not really love you as you should be loved is a work of art.  A standard for all time in my opinion.,

Most remakes of songs I like are not worthy of  being listened to.  The Isley Brothers' rendition is an exception to that rule.  The song for me has 2 parts, the beginning and the wind-up.  It starts off slowly, with great care and respect to Seals and Croft.  Isley vocals of course shining thru...With an increase in tempo and a sizzling guitar solo (by a Hendrix taught Ernie Isley) the song takes off and lands in a place totally unexpected!!!

A14W8HXP3RM3ZS,B00136RSW8,1,1,4,"RICKY VAN SHELTON-16 BIGGEST HITS: He may have typified the ""hunks in hats"" era of late eighties/early nineties country, but RICKY VAN SHELTON had a lot more going for him than a dazzling smile and a twinkle in his eye...an honest to goodness, authentically expressive set of pipes that served him well on a hit batch of sprightly honky tonkers and bittersweet ballads. Like his non-songwriting contemporary GEORGE STRAIT, RVS made the most of material from outside contributors, from legendary tunesmiths ROGER MILLER to HARLAN HOWARD. Whether tackling well loved oldies such as NED MILLER's FROM A JACK TO A KING and JACK GREENE's STATUE OF A FOOL or kicking up his heels for modern day barn burners WILD MAN and CRIME OF PASSION, his passionate Virginia-bred baritone and spirited delivery was always front and center. VAN SHELTON racked up nine chart-topping singles and many more top tens during his hey-day, most of which are collected on 16 BIGGEST HITS, an indispensable offering for fans of ""in the pocket"" new traditionalist country.

RATING: FOUR STETSONS",
A2K7GCHDI8PEDQ,B00136RSW8,1,1,5,Ricky Van Shelton has so many good songs. This one is one of his great ones. Good beat and great to dance to.,
A9GYC5DZSSSLT,B00136RUJO,1,1,5,"if you are a fan of 70's soul,then you cannot let this one slip by! I've known about The Delfonics for years! But i didn't really get into them until the Quentin Tarantino film ""Jackie Brown"" came out! This band really jams! And with this particular CD,I have to assume it's been re-mastered,because it sounds awesome in my car!! Which shouldn't be taken for granted! i have bought CDs in the past from the 70's and they still sound like I'm using 70's speakers! But not this one! All of the bass comes through,as well as their harmony. i don't know why I chose this particular CD,but this is it!! And for this price,you can't go wrong! Buy it today!!",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136RXH8,1,1,4,"It is absolutely so sad that a love that was inseparable had faded away. Unfortunately, for Celine Dion, she has been hit with so much sadness in her personal life from two devastating passings n her beloved heart. One of them is the sad death of her brother Daniel, whom died of cancer at 59 years old. Another one is the heartbreaking news that her soulmate and manager Rene' Angeil died after a severe battle of throat cancer that hurt their love and tore them apart. He battled in 1999 and survived, but it came back to take him for several years. When I think of Celine's sadness, I think of her song My Heart Will Go On from Titanic. It is one of those songs that really do strike you at the soul of the heart, and even more with the recent death of James Horner, and the hypnotic song that really grabbed you. Celine's heart will go on, but the heartstrings of her loves will always be in that song. That their souls will go on.

A9KI7CIEC0BU7,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"growing up listening to Cyndi Lauper maybe I missed out on how great her songs were, and it took me by surprise as an adult to listen to them again, realizing they really are great and what an awesome voice she has!",

A3J9YG8IXH56HS,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"A lot of Cyndi Lauper's songs in this collection were hits in the 80's.  There are fun catchy songs like Goonies 'R' Good Enough and Girls Just Want To Have Fun.  Then there are slower, deeper meaning songs like True Colors and Time After Time.",
A12XFLHBQUHD6R,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,I've always loved her music.  It's fund to have all the essential songs on one CD.  Great to put on and think of times and music past!  The 80s put out such amazing music!,
A2KH3UW2QQ7TSM,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,Great album. This has the oldies I love and a few differnet songs I hadn't even heard before this download. It is a great price and well worth a listen. Keep it up Cyndi!,
A2WVU68D1ZEX6N,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,"Cyndi Lauper, imho, the best female vocalist in the last 25 years. She makes me want to get up and dance around the room. Buy this CD!!!",
A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,"Ever since the early days of MTV, I started falling in love with Cyndi Lauper's music.  She was NOT like any other artist out there.  She was wacky, creative, quirky, fashionable (check out her various outfits) and didn't take herself so seriously.  And that New Yawk accent!!!  Quite simply, Cyndi just wanted to have fun.  But before she became a megastar on the pop map, she had previously fronted a rock band called Blue Angel.  They put out their first and ONLY record in 1980.  It really IS worth checking out.

Once Cyndi became an actual solo artist, her first order of business (aside from being on MTV) was to recruit another band called The Hooters.  They helped her launch 5 mega smashes on her 1983 debut, ""She's So Unusual.""  First, there is the opener, ""Money Changes Everything.""  Cyndi showed the world who was boss and that she wasn't going anywhere.  Next was the most important staple, ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun.""  The whole indescribable nature of the song was what got her noticed in the first place (most notably on Dick Clark's American Bandstand).  Then there was the much more serious ballad ""Time After Time"", which remains one of my personal favorites to this day.  This album was only the tip of the iceberg of what would catapult Cyndi's 30 year career longevity.

In 1985, she released 2 tracks for The Goonies movie:  the theme song (""The Goonies 'R' Good Enough"") and the much faster rocker, ""What A Thrill.""  A year later, Cyndi spread out her artistic talent even further with ""True Colors.""  Each song was a hit on its own, and Cyndi had A LOT of guest stars (The Bangles, Billy Joel, Aimee Mann, and even Pee Wee Herman).  The title track and accompanying video is another one of my personal faves.

In 1988, another minor hit:  ""Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)"" from the movie Vibes.  It's a VERY elusive song to find, if that is even possible.  I actually got it from an 80's compilation disc on eBay several years ago.  It's just one of those feel good songs that you really need to have!!!

Next came 1989's ""A Night To Remember"".  Cyndi was becoming much more serious as a songwriter and performer.  ""I Drove All Night"" had a much more rock feel to it, and it proved that Cyndi was indeed evolving.  Sadly, this was the only real hit on her record; in hindsight, the rest of the songs deserved MUCH more appreciation and should not have been cast aside.  What about ""Unconditional Love"" or ""Heading West""??

In the 90's, Cyndi would release 3 more records.  By that time, she was getting even deeper into her artistry and would even release some non-album tracks.  For example, you may be familiar with the ethereal 1992's ""The World Is Stone.""  In 1993, Cyndi re-teamed with the Hooters for some delicious tracks on ""Hat Full Of Stars.""  There were, again, some minor hits:  ""That's What I Think"", ""Who Let In The Rain?"", and the lilting, hushed title track which is still another of my personal faves.  Unfortunately, the album wasn't getting the right amount of airplay.  But that never stopped Cyndi at all.  She kept having great song after song.

In 1995, Cyndi released her first greatest hits record, ""Twelve Deadly Cyns.""  I loved the candy coated, luscious album cover, and so 3 new songs were added to Cyndi's ever growing repertoire:  ""I'm Gonna Be Strong"" (this was an updated version of the 1980 Blue Angel track), ""(Hey Now) Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" (a sequel to the 1983 megasmash), and ""Come On Home.""

By 1996, this was when Cyndi was at her peak and had started to re-invent herself.  She wanted to be an ARTIST, not a ""hits"" maker.  On ""Sisters Of Avalon"", Cyndi went all over the map (but in a very good way, mind you).  There's the forceful, in your face title track.  2 other minor hits also took notice:  ""Ballad Of Cleo & Joe"" and ""Unhook The Stars.""  Sadly, this particular album was one of her most underappreciated.

Overall, this ""greatest hits"" CD covers Cyndi Lauper's timespan from 1983 to 1996.  Since then, Cyndi would release 6 more albums in 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2010.  No two records were EVER the same.  And that brings me to the 3 reasons that Cyndi is MY favorite female artist of all time.  One:  She created albums on her OWN terms and wouldn't conform to the record companies.  Two:  She played various instruments -- whatever she could find, she would put to use!  And three:  many of the songs were very euphoric and would make a person feel good about himself/herself.

So, if anyone is having a bad day, all you need to do is put on a Cyndi Lauper record and learn how to have fun.  I'm sure glad that I did!!!",
A1EJ9BMB058DRV,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"This compilation of Cyndi Lauper is a pretty decent one, it's got some of her best songs. The only downside I can see with this, having liked a couple songs of hers before buying this, is that a couple of the songs here aren't up to par (particularly her later ones).

There are some treasures on here though and for the price, it's definitely worth picking up if you want to discover her music more or just own some of the best songs she ever made (the Goonies song for instance is amazing and not easy to find).

So for die-hard Cyndi Lauper fans, the Goonies song is probably the main attraction for you. Other than that, you may disagree with the ""greatest hits"" selection.

For people who want to explore her music more after liking a song or 2, this is perfect for you.",
A3922C2IZWR09A,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"I bought this Cindy Lauper CD as a birthday present for my wife, who has always liked her more than I did.  But this CD is making me a bigger fan every time I hear it.  I would recommend it for any of her fans or for those curious about her music.",
A3G326R9YCU7MR,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"I really enjoyed this album, it took me back to my childhood days. All of her most recognizeable songs are here along with the rarity ""Goonies R Good Enough"" (which is much better than its title suggests). Songs like ""True Colors"" and ""I drove all night"" really bring out her chops as a vocalist. There were a few skippable songs from her later CD's but those didn't detract much from the whole.",
AD6G5M3KL7GTB,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,"Cyndi Lauper became one of the most well-known singers of the 80's.  If it weren't for Madonna she would have become huge.  Lauper's original style will evoke memories of the 80's for those living in that era.  These songs have a classic and magical style to them that gets better with each listen.  Lauper's vocals are not for everyone.  For some they may be irritating but for others comforting.  Her powerful vocal range makes Madonna's vocals pale in comparison.  She can sing ballads as well as up-tempo 80's pop songs.  Co-writing every song on this album she proves to the public that she is a respected artist for the most part.  In 2008 she released a new album called ""Bring Ya To The Brink"" which is the style of dance-pop.",
A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"The Essential Cyndi Lauper really should have been a two CD set. While we get a good number of her biggest hits on this album, there isn't quite enough to satisfy me. Although the material that we do get is wonderful; where are some more very good tunes? At any rate, Cyndi worked hard to produce great music for her fans; and just one listen to this album proves it. In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very well done.

""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" starts the CD off with a huge number that was one of Cyndi's earliest hits. ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" celebrates women who just want to enjoy their relationships with men without long term commitments; and Cyndi delivers this like a pro! The number is full of positive energy and it's great music for dancing even today. ""Money Changes Everything"" was another early hit for Cyndi; this has that mid `80s dance flavor to it and Cyndi's really good diction enhances the number even more. ""Who Let In The Rain"" features Cyndi front and center--right where she belongs! ""Who Let In The Rain"" is a fine number that proves Cyndi can easily tackle a rock flavored ballad to make it take flight!

""She Bop"" was always one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper hits; this hit the airwaves big time during the summer of 1984 and I remember going to dances where the DJs played this very often. ""She Bop"" has a great, power-packed melody that is also rather catchy and it remains one of Cyndi Lauper's best hits ever. ""Time After Time"" also comes from the mid 1980s; and Cyndi does this wonderfully. ""I Drove All Night"" comes from Cyndi's great album entitled A Night To Remember and just one listen proves that Cyndi is a champ! ""Hat Full Of Stars"" is a ballad from the album of the same name; and listen for ""All Through The Night."" ""All Through The Night"" is one of Cyndi Lauper's best hits ever--period. The percussion enhances the musical arrangement and Cyndi's excellent diction makes her performance even better. ""All Through The Night"" is another one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper tunes and it deserves its place on this CD.

""When You Were Mine"" comes from Cyndi's first album entitled She's So Unusual; and Cyndi's cover of the song originally done by Prince really shines bright. ""True Colors"" comes from the album of the same; Cyndi does this with great sensitivity and the guitar work enhances the melody quite a bit. Awesome! ""Unhook The Stars"" plays with major and minor keys as Cyndi sings this very well; and the album ends strong with a great number from the movie The Goonies entitled ""The Goonies 'R' Good Enough."" I agree with other reviewers who write that this last number is a most welcome addition to this album.

I always liked Cyndi Lauper; so while I love the tunes on this album I must admit that it's not as complete as it should be. There should be several other songs here. Specifically, I would have wanted extra songs like ""Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China);"" ""My First Night Without You;"" ""Ballad Of Cleo & Joe;"" ""Boy Blue"" and maybe even one or two more. That's a missed opportunity; and I can only hope that we get a better Cyndi Lauper ""essential"" collection two CD set soon. Nevertheless, I still recommend this album for Lauper's fans; and it makes a great starter CD for people just discovering Cyndi's talents. It's also a fine CD for people who merely want a small sampling of Cyndi Lauper's incredible artistry.",
A12M96JJHEOYMT,B00136RVP2,-1,-1,3,"Cyndi Lauper was an icon of 1980's MTV generation hooray of fake importance. ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", written by Robert Hazard as a wry comment on sexual mores was uptossed upturned and confetti celebrated as an anthem for pre-adolecent girls wanting to wear colorful clothes and kinda rebel at the same time.

Cyndi had much more in mind. She was in a recored band ""Blue Angel"" that sold nothing. She found herself in finding song writers that fit her fairy tale. A classic 1980's LP/Cass/CD ""She's So Unusual"" had 4 (Four !) hits  ""Girl's"", the cover of Brains' punkish ""Money Changes Everything"", the Hooter's cover of the ballad, ""Time After Time"", and the winking smirk of female masturbation, ""She Bop"". All included in this compliation. + the subllime ballad, ""True Colors"".

One star docked for the inclusion of one of the worse songs ever, ""Goonies ""R"" Good Enough"".",
A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"Cyndi Lauper is one of those eighties singers whose talent was modest but personality was overwhelming. It was what made ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-s-So-Unusual/dp/B000051Y0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She's So Unusual</a>"" so brilliant; Cyndi was so totally outside the mold that everything on it quaked with the stellar portrayal of the artist as a young woman. From the classic anthem ""Girls Just Wanna have Fun"" to the emotional bulls-eye of ""Time After Time,"" Cyndi and all her friends established the pattern that would follow for the rest of her career. Cyndi found songs to match her one-of-a-kind voice and would deliver them with style.

That she had a knack for plucking gems from obscurity also helped. The Brains' apocryphal ""Money Changes Everything"" is one such example, ditto for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Colors/dp/B00000266K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Colors</a>'s"" rocking ""Change of Heart."" She was such a colorful fusion of styles and personality that the singles on this ""Essential"" collection still often sound buoyant and alive even now. It was around the time of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Night-to-Remember/dp/B0000026KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Night to Remember</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatful-Of-Stars/dp/B00005G3WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatful Of Stars</a>"" that Cyndi's efforts to sound serious got the better of her. On ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twelve-Deadly-Cyns-and-Then-Some/dp/B000002AM9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twelve Deadly Cyns and Then Some</a>,"" Cyndi wisely chose to include ""Sally's Pigeons"" (co-written with Mary Chapin Carpenter, of all people), where the emotional heft matched the ambition, where the title track here didn't.

That ambition also lead to Cyndi's activism. ""True Colors"" has become something of a gay anthem, a call to recognize yourself as the person you are. It became the Nom De'Tour of Cyndi's summer 2007 tour for the Human Rights Campaign (along with Debbie Harry and Erasure, among others), and her tireless work on behalf of the Matthew Sheppard Foundation and other causes. Her timeless music couples with her work for the future.

Her attempt to broaden the style works OK on ""Sisters of Avalon"" and ""Unhook The Stars,"" but I would have happily traded them (or ""When You Were Mine"") in for ""What's Going On."" All is forgiven however, by finally finding ""The Goonies R Good Enough"" on a proper US Cyndi Lauper CD. A quickie knock-off to a Steven Spielberg screaming kids movie, it is all the things great about Cyndi's hits; melodic, energetic and sing-along-quirky. It makes ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Essential-Cyndi-Lauper/dp/B00008PX8X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Essential Cyndi Lauper</a>"" the best single disc collection of Cyndi you can get without shelling out for pricey double-disc imports.",
A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"Actually, the person who wanted this was my spouse, but it's really an enjoyable CD.  I'm glad to see the Goonies music on here--that was one of my favorite songs from a hard to find soundtrack.  I'd never heard ""Sisters of Avalon"" before and that's definitely a song that intrigued me.",
A3VM7UUS9OBX6D,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,". . . is the first impression when hearing certain artists. Out of the ordinary perspectives on everyday emotions, captivating energy and impressive tonal/harmonic range, even clothing - all of these ""quirks"" are evident when Ms. Lauper is heard/seen for the first time.

And, as time passes, the hair still rises, the eyes still well up & a smile is dearly evoked. She is clearly a treasure, one which I am allowed to experience and humbly I say - she has enriched my life.",

AE42JLYPXUI45,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,"Cyndi Lauper has been another one of the most successful female solo artists of the early 80s. Her career started to take a fall with the release of 1989 album, A Night To Remember. After the unwanted failure of A Night To Remember (1989). In 1993, Cyndi released another album that failed entitled, Hat Full Of Stars.
  In 2003, she was able to release, The Essential Cyndi Lauper, her second greatest hits compilation since Twelve Deadly Cyns ...And Then Some (1994). I definitely call it a must-have album.
GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have loved this song since my years in middle school. I love it's fun-filled energy and I love it's crazed vibe. It's a classic all the way.
MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Another great song, but in my opinion, not among the best. I hope you know that it's True that money, in most ways, most certainly does change everything.
WHO LET IN THE RAIN
  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). The album Hat Full Of Stars (1993), as for I know, only had three songs I ever liked and they are That's What I Think, Hat Full Of Stars, and Who Let The Rain In. This is a moving ballad and I recommend that you all listen to it.
SHE BOP
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I still can't get over the fact that this one talks about female masturbation. Nobody wagged their fingers at Cyndi for making a song like this, but if Madonna recorded this song, the critics and parents would have been down her throat. This is a great song. I remember watching Cyndi's Behind The Music on VH1. When they were talking about this track and all the controversey, Cyndi said that her mother called her up and said, ""Is this song about... that?"" I was laughing for days.
TIME AFTER TIME
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have always enjoyed this song because of its moving arrangements and vocal arrangements. Everytime I see Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow dance with Alan Cumming to this song in 'Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion', I cry after laughing so hard, even though they did a great job with the choreography. I know shouldn't be laughing because they danced so great, but it's just that they chose a romantic ballad that requires slow-dancing and they decided to use ballet as their dance.
I DROVE ALL NIGHT
  From the album A Night To Remember (1989). This is one of the best songs I have heard from Cyndi Lauper and it came from the best album Cyndi Lauper has ever recorded, A Night To Remember. The album did not get the recognition it deserved, it is her best album by far.
HAT FULL OF STARS
  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). Another great song from the Hat Full Of Stars album. I knew from the moment I read the title that it would be a great song and I was right. I love it when I'm right.
CHANGE OF HEART
  From the album True Colors (1986). This is one of the three songs from the True Colors (1986) album that I like. The True Colors (1986) album is not a favorite album of mine, all though I love the front and back covers of that album. This song has a great vibe to it and the lyrics are well-written. Cyndi's voice was amazing on this one to begin with, but The Bangles', who provided back-ups, vocals thicken Cyndi's voice, making her voice sound like it has more enthusiasm.
SISTERS OF AVALON
  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). This is a good song, but it's not like her original sound. If she decided to change her sound, she shouldn't have made it sound like this. I know she has the talent to better than this.
ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). This is another song with a moving sound. The vocals are incredible, the music is incredible. Who would not love this song, except for people with no brains?
WHEN YOU WERE MINE
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Although, this is a great song, I don't like the fact that it was originally done by Prince. I literally hate Prince with a passion. In my opinion, he's a great lyricist, but he and his music can go straight to hell because I can't stand him or his music.
TRUE COLORS
  From the album True Colors (1986). The second of three songs I like from the True Colors (1986) album. The guitar arrangements are incredible.
UNHOOK THE STARS
  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). She did reinvent her sound for the Sisters Of Avalon (1997) album and not well at all. This is a song I always skip. I can't waste my time listening to a song that sounds like crap.
THE GOONIES 'R' GOOD ENOUGH
  From the original motion picture & soundtrack The Goonies (1985). The Goonies has always been one of my favorite movies. The movie was filmed and released in 1985, the year that I was born. It's hard for me to believe that this movie is as old as I am and I still get a kick out of it. This song is amazing and Cyndi was the right choice to record it. The movie, original motion picture score, and this song all remind me of Wildwood, New Jersey. I don't know why, it just happened. This is one of the best songs from Cyndi Lauper and I'm happy to know that it was included in this incredible collection.
  If you are a Cyndi Lauper fan, then you need to buy a copy of this collection. It's worth all the money you pay and you are guaranteed to be impressed.",
A1HOVGEE981HS0,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"Although calling it ""essential"" might be stretching the truth a tiny bit; this compilation is a must have in every way shape and form.  The album reaches through all of Cyndi's work through Sony and provides new listeners with the chance to love and cherish this absolutley fabulous and amazing singer.  And available as a budget release now means no more excuses to not add Cyndi Lauper to your collection.",
A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,I used to love Cyndi in the 1980's and she has some great songs and this album is a total must have and I would also recommend 12 deadly cyns and I would like to say that every single song on this album is great and I love this album and I recommend anyone who likes 1980's music to buy this cd it is so nice to have !!!!,
AADJXNY9HSKJF,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"Sure, before you could buy the pricey imports, but ""The Essential Cyndi Lauper"" is much better than her previous American ""hits"" collections. It's not perfect, yet I think it's superior to ""12 Deadly Cyns.""
The big complaint was that for so long, american fans couldn't get ""Good Enough"" from ""The goonies."" Well, FINALLY it's included. Whether or not Cyndi likes the song, it's an 80's movie song classic and was a top 10 hit. Eight of Cyndi's top 10 hits are on here including the classic ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", ""She Bop"", ""All Through the Night"" and ""Time After Time"" frm her debut. all four of these were massive radio hits and still heard to this day. ""True Colors"" and ""Change of Heart"" were big hits off of her sophomore album. Her last top 10 single is included too from ""A Night to Remember"" which is ""I Drove All Night"" *recently Celine Dion did an amazing cover of it.* ""Money Changes Everything"" is graciously included also which didn't hit the top 10, but was still a big top 40 hit. The non-hits are also very worthy. ""Hat Full of Stars"" is gorgeous and ""Sisters of Avalon"" is very catchy.
So why 4 stars? As outstanding as this collection is, ""What's Going On"" *a top 10 hit from ""True Colors""* was left off as was the minor hit ""Hole In My Heart."" These are minor gripes but would've really put it over the top. Still, it's a great hits collection and well worth the money. Cyndi is awesome.",

A1UHVLIX5CKVSN,B00136RVG6,1,1,5,"This familiar music came through vibrantly, especially the subdued, ominous episodes with sustained strings and that stark recurring detail of two plunked-out repeated notes.  The saxophone was beautifully played, with exotic harmonic tensions between George and the Saxophonist . Given the preoccupation with meanings and representations, musical and otherwise, it would have been ideal to show George in his most daring ensemble, shirtless. Nevertheless, he sang Careless Whisper with soaring ease, lovely tone and fine sensibility.",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136RVG6,1,1,5,"Hard to believe that it has been 30 years since George Michael and Andrew Rigley of Wham made it big beyond their wildest dreams and became household names in America. Musically, Andrew has ended his music career, while George has withstood the test of time on his own with great songs. But his first which he wrote before joining Wham, Careless Whisper still remains a beautiful and simple ballad, which sincerely had been a beautiful joy to continue to listen to after all this time. It is sincerely one of his best songs, and still stands better than all the joke songs that are on radio and television today. If you have never even heard a George Michael song before, even when he was a part of Wham, this is the first song you should go to, because it still comes from the heart in mind.

Song: A 1/2-",
A1RUSVRWZ312LS,B00136RVG6,1,1,5,Hauntingly beautiful!,

A1E33ER4JG5B11,B00136RVG6,1,1,5,Brings back memories of Junior High and going skating with my friends every Friday night.  I always loved this song.,
A1ONUF6LB72IYE,B00136RVG6,1,1,4,One of his best solo songs he made.  A romantic song which would be perfect to do a slow dance with someone you deeply care for.,
A357SWZ1O4MFRS,B00136RVG6,1,1,5,"George Michael out did himself with this cut, that is a total jam then and even now.  I have added this to my playlist on my radio show, and many can relate to his message.

It is a smooth slow dancing stepping song I enjoy dancing to, as well as sitting back listening to it even though it is so very sad to me..",

A13X93M7A4HGW,B00136RVG6,1,1,5,"George Michael ( WHAM), was ICONIC to big 80's music. This song demonstrated a more serious and mature side of the band. It really highlighted that these are True musicians, which amazing chops.

A timeless song, and beautiful words.  A must have for any music lover.",
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B00136RVG6,1,1,5,George Michael  wrote this  song as a  teenager  and it had held  up so many eras.  one  of the baddest slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh.,
A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I,B00136RR3I,1,1,5,They played Footloose in Zumba and I couldn't get enough of it. I ended up getting online afterwards and looking at the original album and picked out this song because it was 1) awesome and 2) made me just as nostalgic.,
A36RAZ5A9H23XW,B00136RR3I,1,1,5,I grew up on this movie. I was recently curious about the latest version of Footloose and it was o..... kay. It motivated me to watch the old one and buy the songs.,
A2XZWMTCQWOIX3,B00136RR3I,1,1,5,"I hate to admit but I remember this song when it first came out so the opportunity to purchase it was welcomed.  Digital music has pluses and minuses, frankly after all this time I sometimes miss the noises made from the needle on the record.  Anyway, clear music and True to the original song.  And, it always reminded me of accolades to my brother.  All considered great purchase.",

A3GGA163GM7VX7,B00137G6XO,1,1,5,"This particular song might not be for everyone, given that it's a little slower, more quiet, and even could be called a sad song.

But for me it has a deep and personal meaning. It's one of Mayer's tracks that simply speaks to me in a way I'm not able to put aside.

Even if you're not someone to whom this speaks, though, it's a still a fine song, well crafted, beautifully written and performed, and well worth your time.",

A2GD999Y349O6N,B00136RWCO,1,1,5,"love their songs, too bad there was such a reaction to what one person said. We have much bigger threats in the world today then one little girl's opinion. And we certainly hear much worse opinions now. And that is what they are, because we live in America and we are allowed to state our opinions, at least for today.",

A3923W0OJNGUHN,B00137G9K4,1,1,5,I had to get as many of D&B as I could. They put out great songs and had to get this one.,
A3JQ7JBTC4M50Z,B00137G9K4,1,1,5,"This is it, and who better to do it than Brooks & Dunn.  It evokes what it sings about, a darkly lit bar, a place where you can hide in the misery of being jilted.  If the neon moon highlights the tears running down your face, move a couple of inches to the left or right.

At some point you will recover from your broken dreams, but this song will remain a favorite.  It is mellow and with just the right touch of apathy and a hint of hope.

Go for it.  You'll play it again and again.",
A2QANOGP5LLPBQ,B00137G9K4,1,1,5,"This is one of my favorite songs.  Even if you aren't a Country music fan, I encourage you to sample the music - great 2 stepping song!  I downloaded the MP3 version - it worked fine and sounds great!",

A16EAKILNT8A0E,B00137G9K4,1,1,5,"Needless to say, Brooks and Dunn have had many many hits over their years of writing and singing together.  The way their voices complement each other, and their songwriting skills are phenomenal to me.  Out of all they have written and performed, for me, ""Neon Moon"" is their most beautiful song.  I've heard it countless numbers of times, and it still moves my heart exactly as it did the first time.  I absolutely recommend purchase of this heart-touching song.",

A1ISYVPFV83QRO,B00137G7SS,1,1,5,"I won't lie.  This is a bit of a generic song review.  But what I can say about "" Calling All Angels "" is that as an older consumer of classic rock from the 80's and such, (and a few other music genre's from then), I do find this piece a rather agreeable tune and enjoy it every time it comes up on my mp3 player!

All joking aside, a very cool song, love it every time I hear it.",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137G8OG,1,1,5,"Hard to believe that it has been 30 years since Marvin Gaye made his last hit, Sexual Healing form the Midnight Love record. The song definitely still is a classic today, as it was when it came out back in the 80's, when Marvin really was coming to terms with redemption, and ultimately lost his life to the man that helped make him alive, his father Marvin Gay Sr., who murdered him 2 years later. The song is definitely one of those songs that still does not go out of style, even with Marvin's classic from his Motown era. I definitely still love this song so much. He really placed his signature on this ballad from top to bottom. If you have never even heard a Marvin Gaye song yet, this is one to own for your music library.

A1X8M5BP52ZAPG,B00137G8OG,1,1,5,"Although I don't think it is a naughty song, it is definitely one of Marvin's best. He always conveyed such emotion with his beautiful voice. Sexy, absolutely!",
ADS5APY1NKTL4,B00137G8OG,1,1,5,"If anyone is looking for an introduction to Marvin Gaye at one of his finest hours, vocally, ""Sexual Healing"" is a prime example. For starters, that hypnotic ""Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up"" hook that is softly whispered over the rhythmic beat calls us into the theme of the track. Marvin's voice is like that of an ecstatic angel living with one foot in the clouds and another in the entrance way to the bedroom. I can picture hips gyrating, beautiful women dancing in the background, red satin sheets, candles, rose petals and the whole bit.

In all my years of listening to music, never have I heard a song quite so stirring and smooth. Marvin states in no uncertain times that he is seeking some sexual healing from his partner (or partners) and is not shy about laying his cards right out there throughout the duration of the song. The song starts beautifully and truly ends too quickly.",
A1XZLNZ2FOXX21,B00137G8OG,1,1,5,"First....Put his album on and it's on..The music the Beat,the words,the voice,,,,I really love this album,so will you.it speaks of LOVE in ever way,you can't miss the genius here. I cant stop selectingthe repeat button.",

A32T2H8150OJLU,B00137G8MS,1,1,5,"What can I say?  I graduated from HS and went on the college in the middle of the age of disco.

Play that Funky Music was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the R&B charts the same year.  ""Play That Funky Music"" hit #1 on the charts in 1976 and ended up in the #5 slot for the top 100 songs of 1976.  It is also listed at #73 of the top rock songs of all time.

This music is classified as funk-rock, a cross between disco and rock, and probably the best example of this that there is.

Yeah, ""Play that funky music, white boy!""

5 stars, mainly for nostalgia and staying power.",

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00137GKUS,1,1,4,"A Latin flavored rock song that's seems for the most part like a vehicle for both Santana and Chad Kroeger to stay in the radio spotlight, as it's released on a best-of album. And although this appearance is better than the last song they did together, this one still lacks. Vocally, Kroeger fits the song, and Santana plays some awesome riffs that keep you moving, and the song afloat. Without that amazing aspect, the song sinks with sub-par lyrics, however, you can only keep coming back to Santana's amazing guitar mastery and craft. A good song musically, a somewhat lazy performance vocally.",

A1L8FZAMSG73HN,B00137GHF6,1,1,5,"I must say this is probably Journey's finest song.  It is fun, rollicking, and the bass parts are phenomenal!  Most songs will feature one, maybe two bass parts in their songs, but this one weaves the bass throughout the entire song.  The song seems to be written around the bass!  I don't think I've met anyone yet who hasn't told me this is their favorite Journey song.  Journey is a great group and has a signature sound that distinguishes them from everyone else.  Everyone should have this classic in their music library!",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137GHF6,1,1,5,"When it has came down to Journey, they've honestly been one of the best guilty pleasures in Rock music. While it is honestly a shame that they haven't scored well with anything new after the abrupt departure of Steve Perry, they do know that they have a legion of fans that never get tired of their classics. That is honestly the case with many of their songs including Don't Stop Believin'. The song is such a great classic of 80's Rock, that it simply never really gets too old. I love a lot of those classics that Journey made from that time, and it truly is a must to have as part of their music library, if you want it, any way you it for your MP3 Player.

Song: A-",

A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00137GCGK,1,1,5,"""Dancing In The Dark"" is a dark and moody song that is offset by a commercial and catchy synth riff.  The music provides an upbeat note to a song about the ennui of a single man's life.  He is sick and tired of his life and wants to change everything about life, his look, his clothes, the dump he lives in, but he's getting nowhere.  He knows that all kinds of action outside his window, he just can't seem to find it.  The song became the biggest seller in Mr. Springsteen's career peaking at number two in mid 1984.",

Michelle Branch is an alluring song that seems to be about someone giving the singer jittery feelings of infatuation (akin to having a crush on someone).  Michelle Branch's vocals and the music of the song fit perfectly together. The duet with Carlos Santana, and the romantic music video are both superb.",

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00137GK12,1,1,5,"...did i mention there won't be a song to touch this, this year? there seriously isn't gonna be a better song. i don't need no psychic nor a phony like miss cleo to tell me this! alicia's album is pure F I R E and out of 14 tracks there's one that i don't listen to. classic.

this song already is changing lives and making people think! I hear on youtube a lot and in real life sometimes that, ""this song makes you think about your life..."" and ""it makes me want to change and never take anything for granted.""

now that's soul. when it touches you deep, deep down and won't let go.

for all those living under a rock, this song is about loving someone like it's the last time you'll see them. a great thing to say, but how many of us will actually and actively do this? follow through?

not enough. and that's ok! it's the human condition to take for granted things in your life, daily; friends, lovers, family, mothers, dogs and cats; hell, even ex's!

but this song is about looking at what things mean to you and what's most important. it's like a lullaby w/ a back beat! just listen to the production. i can listen to it all day and i really don't get tired of it much. alicia has helped produce a bunch of bangers; girlfriend, how come you don't call me, mr. man (2001), you don't know my name, diary, slow down, if i ain't got you, samsonite man, nobody not really, the interlude (on the album) (2003), unbreakable, every little bit hurts (2005) and finally, no one, superwoman, sure looks good to me, the thing about love, lessons learned and finally, this masterpiece. it's definitely her best track yet and i don't see her getting much better than now. but has any of her main albums ever disappointed? hardly, for the fans!

6.25 stars.",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137GK12,1,1,4,"When it comes down to it, Alicia Keys really does know how to conjure some beautiful songs. After the souful success of No One from As I Am, her fourth album, she shows absolutely no signs of ending her reign in R&B. Her latest single, Like You'll Never See Me Again, the second single from that album shows a softer side from her voice that remains strong from the soul, and still shows a pitch in her voice that has grown with her style in writing. I really think this one follows the way No One helped make As I Am shine. This track works better than anything from wannabe artists like Fantasia or Jordan Sparks. I definitely know Alicia really will make her next single just as good as this one.

Song: B+",

A11EF8QS25OKE4,B00137GCI8,1,1,5,"I saw him in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas for the Born in the USA tour. His album perfectly reflects the mood of nation at that time.

A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00137GCI8,1,1,5,"""Born In The U.S.A."" is the lead track off of Bruce Springsteen's 1984 album of the same name.  The song is a look at a Vietnam vet who returns home to find that his country has forgotten all about him.  The song's dark lyrics are masked by a stirring, anthemic backing track that embodied a patriotic sound that caused confusion over the real meaning of the song.  All the misunderstanding aside, the song is both pro and anti America.  It takes on the yin and yang that is this country by on one hand, celebrating the majestic and glory of the flag and then the dark underbelly where we send the less fortunate to keep them out of sight.  It is a perfect song and one of, if not, the greatest single of all time.",

This list starts simple enough with the title traits, but quickly extends to a series of qualities as unrealistic as the airbrushed qualities of a centerfold. My favorites: ""...uses a machete to cut through red tape..."", ""...fingernails that shine like justice..."" and ""...she is touring the facility and picking up slack..."".

Heck, forget the relationship part: maybe the singer just wants a great boss or high-speed co-worker.

Give this song a listen. It's sweet, funny and singable!",
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00137IDUS,1,1,5,"Cake is a unique group to say the least, where the singer doesn't sing, he just talk to a rhythm and a beat. However, this arrangement and quirk works perfectly for them and their style. Can you imagine a song like this being sung by anybody else?

This song is about what girl the singer wants, and it's a rather long list, and like a child's Christmas list, it starts off general and reasonable, but by the end it gets very specific, ""She's changing her name/From Kitty to Karen/She's trading her MG/For a white Chrysler LeBaron/I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket."" And when the song gets to the Na Na Na Na Na part, then you're instantly hooked, dancing, and singing. This song is amazingly catchy, and brilliant. You won't hear lyrics like these from Beyonce, or anybody else, except for Weird Al.

Overall, a great song that shine with its subtle poise, humor, wit and brilliance. This is a excellent song not only for Cake, but for music in general. And to this day, nobody has made anything like it...",

I loved this song when it came out in `82.and I was in my middle twenties. It's a great song to listen to while driving - keeps me awake and chair-dancing in the drivers seat.

Back in those days I recorded it on a cassette as part of my ""driving mix"". It's still great driving music and this new copy became part of my driving playlist. Some happy memories and feelings come up when I hear Rosanna and I'm glad I found this forgotten favorite again.

It may not be Kansas anymore,Toto but Rosanna still makes me happy. Hope it makes you happy too.",

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00137IDW6,1,1,5,"After her radio-friendly first album that just seemed too much like it was hacked over and created by a producer, rather than an artist, Clarkson comes out with this track, the best from her album, and the best of her career thus far. This song really brings out the best of Clarkson, and to my knowledge, it's not a breakup song, so there's no anger, just plain Kelly and her vocals. The song is well-crafted, the lyrics are good, and the vocals shine.

I'll always remember the song by a little moment I had with the song a few years back. Riding through Orlando, Florida at 4 o' clock in the morning, moving to my new house in NC, I was flipping through the radio and came to this song. And there I listened to it, in the back seat of a car, the lights of Orlando outside, and I just stared out my window. That's the atmosphere this song creates. And the song is a classic, and Clarkson's best in its own right.",

A6ZKAHCONUHX5,B00137IDW6,1,1,5,"Although I'm not a fan of Kelly Clarkson, this is (in my opinion and logically-speaking from a musician's point-of-view) the best Kelly Clarkson song. Ironically and suitably, this song mirrors Kelly Clarkson's rise to fame from a ""small-town girl"" to a mega pop-star. This is another inspirational, feel-good song that will lift you up and brighten your day if you work a dull, punitive, minimum-wage job (better than not working or being a criminal) or if you're just having a bad day. Listen to this song to feel good about life and count your blessings!",

ARYVQL4N737A1,B00137GFC6,1,1,5,I believe James Brown was on a downward slide or wasn't on the public's conscious by the time this song came out. It's a great comeback song and the video for the song is great. A once in a lifetime performer!,
A24RRTWFT5KILR,B00137GFC6,1,1,5,"Great song from 1985 used in the Rocky 4 movie. James Brown was a major force in American music since the 1950's. I don't believe James was given due credit as he sang to ethnic audiences. Whereas, say, Chuck Berry, sang to a white audience (Chuck was a genius. I don't know how he was able to relate/sing to a white audience). James Brown is the ""God Father of Soul"". I miss you James, your enthusiasm and your talent. Listen to many black artists and they claim influence from James Brown. For example, the ""King of Pop"" Michael Jackson did many of James Brown dance moves. For some strange reason Amazon encoded this song at the bizarre rate of 247 kpbs. No matter, buy this song! Listen to the fade out at the end of the song. James sings ""I feel good"" as a reference to his 1965 popular song. Also, James's reference to ""Eddie Murphy eat your heart out"". This is in reference to SNL's Eddie Murphy's ""getting in the hot tub"" spoof of James Brown.",

She had a short life but she lived big...in fact, with that big voice I am always re-amazed at how petite she actually was. Those who love her love her forever. Those that don't, well, you're missing the opportunity to hear Janis lose a piece of her heart, to reawaken yourself, and to be awestruck. If  you are too young to remember Janis Joplin, I think you owe it to yourself to get some of her songs and introduce yourself. It will change your life. She has changed mine. Rest in peace, little queen. You'll never be a whisper.",

AK0CENM3LUM28,B00137GGZC,1,1,5,"Hips Don't Lie (Shakira) / B00137GGZC

Shakira is a truly talented singer and dancer, and this song definitely shows off her lovely voice and the dance rhythms that she is rightly famous for. I don't really care for the duet aspect of the song - I would have been much happier with more Shakira singing and a lot less Wyclef (nothing against the man, I just prefer her voice to his), but I still love the song and can't hear it enough. The beat is so compelling and alluring, it's hard to *not* dance when this comes on. Give it a listen and see for yourself.

Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.

A Romeo and Juliet flavored love song, complete with suicidal overtones, couched in one of rock's greatest riffs, which sounds like a long lost Byrds riff, if the Byrds had embraced distortion.  Throw in a straight up metal jam in the middle that sounds like an entirely different song, with Buck Dharma squeezing the last note of his solo to death as the majestic riff returns, ushering in the final verse, and you have an exhilarating rock classic.  Long before every band mixed genres, Blue Oyster Cult was boldly embracing folk rock (heavily electrified), heavy metal, the cowbell, and unabashed romance, and then compacting them all into five minutes of genius.

A3TLIA64FX0O1G,B00137IJUM,1,1,4,"How can you not like this song?  Okay, it's borderline satanic, but other than that though?  To be honest I think ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" has gotten a bum rap.  I don't think it's satanic at all.  In fact, I think most critics read too much into the lyrics.  Perhaps the narrator was simply waxing poetic.

Regardless, it's a fun track that rocks like an old school record.  Crank it up and shake a tailfeather.  And don't...you know...fear the guy in that gothic hoodie from Old Navy.",

AV648VU7JR5D5,B00137IJUM,1,1,5,"Is there a more romantic death song than Don't Fear the Reaper? Buck Dharma sings it like a lullaby, calm and easy. Death is a natural occurrence, and belief in an afterlife can make a person less afraid of it. They may even run to it.

Classic guitar riff, anyone who plays rock guitar has probably practiced it at some point in their lives. And of course there is the COWBELL! That SNL sketch was so brilliant, Christopher Walken 'THE Bruce Dickinson.' Yeah, the cowbell is fairly non-stop but it's low in the mix and often falls into a sonic blind spot so it tunes in and out of my consciousness. I think I almost typed couscousness there, ha ha that's what I was thinking...weird.

The guitar solo is pretty classic as well. Sometimes I wish they hadn't let the last note sustain so far into the verse, but not a deal breaker, Blue yster Cult. What a great name for a band. When I was younger, I thought they were scary, based on the cover of the 45 I had of Burnin for You. Ha ha, these guys are goofy. Where does one find blue oysters anyhow? Or is it a blue cult that worships oysters? Or does an umlaut over the 'o' mean something entirely different? Talk amongst yourselves.",

A2IHB3M0ZIKNOZ,B00137IJUM,1,1,5,"One of the great rock classics, (Don't Fear) The Reaper was a big hit in late 1976 for hard rock band Blue Oyster Cult, a band that generally had big album sales from their FM fan base. But this song was so special it broke out into an AM singles hit. It was very toned down for Blue Oyster Cult but that's what made it work. For all it's theme of death it's not angry or hysterical but rather uses a mellow, almost folk-like vocal by Buck Dharma (who wrote the song) along with tightly harmonized backup vocals and guitar to carry it's ultimately positive message of accepting the inevitability of The Reaper. Everything is restrained until the wonderfully explosive guitar interlude about two and a half minutes in. The band's engineers created an echoing acoustic for the instruments that also serves the song well.

All in all a melodic and memorable hit. Oh yeah, it's also got that cowbell!",

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B00137ILRS,1,1,5,"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad ""Total Eclipse of the Heart""; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.

Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.

""And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart""",

A6M5U2YWC3YFF,B00137KI1U,1,1,5,"Much as I love Shakira's international breakout hit ""Hips Don't Lie"" (with Wyclef Jean), this song (and its Spanish version ""Suerte"") is I think even stronger. It's about the thrill of being hip-shakingly in love, and it throbs with passion and pleasure as she dashes gleefully through all the things she adores about her lover up to the orgasmic promise of its ""Whenever, Wherever, We're Meant To Be Together!"" refrain.",

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00137KNB0,1,1,5,"As many know, this classic pop/rock song Hungry Eyes by Eric Carmen has been connected with the classic Dirty Dancing movie (starring Jennifer Grey and the late Patrick Swayze). Additionally, Hungry Eyes by Eric Carmen appears to be a song about powerful romantic attraction coupled with the singer/narrator feeling that the particular romantic love for the person of interest is meant to be. From a writers perspective, Hungry Eyes by Eric Carmen could probably easily fit into a book or movie plot about a character meeting somebody who they feel is a strong part of their fate and/or destiny.",

A1534MBU6VJXYN,B00137KNB0,1,1,5,"Eric Carmen, one of the archetypes of the 'power pop' sound in the 1970s', managed to update his sound with this marvelous 1987 single, a monster pop hit and one of the best remembered songs from the classic movie ""Dirty Dancing."" ""Hungry Eyes"" has a simmering, shiny sound to it that recalls those early Raspberries singles Carmen was so much apart of, and the chorus is especially catchy, anchored by Carmen's fantastic vocal. An absolute classic.",

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00137KL2Q,1,1,4,"""If We Are The Body"" is the only great song off Casting Crown's debut album. It had a good beat, an off-beat message, and is done in such a way that it saves itself from being like the rest of the album. This is actually still my favorite Casting Crowns song, still. Well, actually it's still the only song the band has done that is great, still, after 4 years. Sad. But again, the message is great, and amazingly, I have experienced this with many a church, and the majority refuse to let this great message go through their head.

Overall, great song, great and important message.",

A2ORRNBMF3K2ZL,B00137KLBW,1,1,5,This is one of the best tunes of the 80's.  That is probably due to the fact that it sounds like the classic rock of the 70's.,
A283HYRKHPCZT5,B00137KLBW,1,1,4,"BOC delivered some classic sounds back in the day. Burnin' for You is just one of them, but a gem nevertheless as is the title track from Don't Fear The Reaper. Brings back great memories and is one of those songs that stands the test of time.",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137KNCE,1,1,4,"It is just so sad that Patrick Swayze had just died recently. He had such a very nice Down to Earth appeal that was dynamic and so compelling, that it just melts your heart away. But when it has came down singing, he only has had just a single song to his credit. She's Like The Wind from Dirty Dancing is a great guilty pleasure for anyone who has enjoyed Dirty Dancing over the years. But for anyone whom hasn't even yet seen him dance or sing from Dirty Dancing, it is a very simple song, while it might seem like it lacks what songs deliver today, but back in the 80's, this was a deep and surprising #1 song. If you are looking for a classic movie song from that era for your MP3 library, than She's Like The Wind would be a nice scentimental addition to download.

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B00137ILRS,1,1,5,"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad ""Total Eclipse of the Heart""; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.

Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.

""And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart""",

If you like pop-rock and haven't heard this yet, I strongly recommend it! Kelly's vocal power is shown once again, and that keeps me coming back to this album about once or so a week.

Walk Away's video is silly too. The lyrics are a bit grown up on one specific line but most have already heard this on the radio more than once before.

AK0CENM3LUM28,B00137KSGU,1,1,5,"Beautiful Liar (Beyonce & Shakira) / B0018Q16DU

Beyonce and Shakira both have incredible voices, so this duet is nothing short of perfect blend of perfect talent, and is worth listening to for that fact alone. But I also dearly like the lyrics - the song is between two women who find out that the man they trusted has been seeing them both, secretly. Instead of the more common musical fight over who will win him in the end (see Brandy's lovely&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boy-Is-Mine/dp/B000007NCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boy Is Mine</a>), Beyonce and Shakira ask one another if they can't just consider themselves lucky for finding out when they did, and can't they just laugh it off and go on with their lives? What, really, have they 'lost' beyond a ""beautiful liar""?

What's really meaningful is that though the two women recognize that the best response would be to shrug the whole thing off and move on, it's clear that this response is by no means easy and that the process is still unfairly agonizing to both women. It's a rare song that manages to be empowered without being trite, and realistic without being overwhelmed with self-pity.

Although written and recorded in the 70's, it defines the sixties, at least what they were for me, living as a teenage runaway in Haight Ashbury in the sixties, taking as much LSD as I could, trying to get to heaven but ending up so often in hell, more than any other song I have ever heard, this is what it was all about.

Well, my heart was feeling very alive when my 12 year old daughters started singing along to this song. They like it so much that I went and found my Kansas CDs, and introduced them to their greatest hits. This song still resonates with me after 30+ years. A True classic!",

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00137MFXY,1,1,5,"Judging by the reviews left on this song, it seems that many people were introduced to it via the TV show ""Supernatural.""  While I'd heard the song before, thanks to both my mom (a music nut) and a school bus driver who insisted on keeping the radio on an oldies station all the time, I didn't particularly love it until I, too, started watching ""Supernatural.""  For a show whose focus was on two brothers hunting demons, vampires, ghosts, and other creepy creatures, it certainly features a LOT of classic rock and older but still awesome music.  And at the end of every season the show plays a recap of the season's events right before the season finale... and said recap is invariably accompanied by this stirring number.

I haven't listened to anything else by Kansas, but if ""Carry On Wayward Son"" is any indication, they were a pretty epic band.  ""Carry On Wayward Son"" balances out the more energetic portions of the song with some slightly slower, more low-key bridges that have an almost thoughtful sound to them, and are mostly piano instead of the guitar-and-drums of the rest.  Not all songs can hit this balance successfully, so props to the songwriters for this.  And while no ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" it is a lot more musically complex than most songs of today.  Whatever happened to these songwriters anyhow...

A classic rock number that's enjoying some newfound popularity thanks to ""Supernatural,"" this is a great song for both classic rock fans and ""Supernatural"" fans to enjoy... or heck, any fans of quality music.  They don't write 'em like this anymore...",

It's definitely a dance song that doesn't have a lot of words.  This is one of those moving songs, where the rhythm does all the talking.  This is a classic that lovers of Latin rhythm music must have.",

A3JRW716H3AX14,B00137KQJO,1,1,5,This is a great Five for Fighting tune. It has the usual great vocal with plenty of high pitched but right-on Falsetto notes. It is accompanied with some great piano and some loping percussion which about half way through the tune shifts from a folk song to a light rock rhythm. The lyrics are unobtrusive and positive. The understated but rewarding finale has some nice nostalgic lyrics and accompanying harmonies.,

A1TYCWFOY7OCON,B00137KS2O,1,1,4,"Music pundits often talk about female artists having ""grown up"" when most of their clothes come off in videos, but to me a real grown-up woman is someone like Sade or Alicia who reaches into her soul and brings up pure and beautiful emotion. Love, compassion, loyalty and devotion for someone is timelessly beautiful. If we ever stop appreciating such expressions, then we have ceased to be human.",
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00137KS2O,1,1,5,"When you are in love, you can feel this song 5 fold. If you're not in love, but a dreamer like me, then you aren't left out.

Alicia picked a good single. Making it her first, to me, at first wasn't the smartest because this was not the song that impacted me on the first listen. The keyboard (or organ) in it is fantastic but it just wasn't what we were used to with her...it was really different. And the video was kinda too.

But the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love with the song! Her voice was (and still is!) very, very heartfelt. It starts out with your basic piano arrangement; pretty; lulling; uncomplicated. Then comes in the ""organ"" and it's nice; fitting. But you continue on, hear the chorus twice, and then the beautiful bridge comes in, and once you've heard it about 5x, you sing along;

""I know-ow....some people search the world..."" ""To fi-ind...somethin' like what we H A A A A V E."" ""I know-ow...people will try...try to define...somethin' so R E E A L. So till the end of time...I'm tellin' you that...No one...""

And that's the part that grips you, and makes you continue to sing it, along with Alicia...

Great tune. Will get stuck in your head after a few listens.

4.5 stars.

End Note: Great tune. Might have to sink in after repeated listens. Her second single, Like You'll Never See Me Again is even better, believe it or not..",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137KS2O,1,1,4,"When it comes to really good R&B, there are very few divas that've shown that heart like Alicia Keys. After the mammoth success of her pervious albums, Songs In A Minor, Unplugged and Diary Of Alicia Keys, her first single from her fourth album As I Am, No One, is one of the best R&B songs I've heard this year. The song is very soulful, and ignites a real fire that is sophisticated and True to Alicia's soulful style. I absolutely love this song, because it is a great pop song that stands out. It really is one of the best songs of 2007 and 2008. Now that it is finally available as a MP3 download from Amazon.com, I absolutely recommend this as a must buy for your MP3 player.

A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B00137MI7C,1,1,5,"One message in this song (shown clearly in the music video) is how judgmental, haughty and insensitive some Christians can be. Instead of being Christlike, some stay in their little cliques, paying no attention to those who need to experience the love of God.

Another message - and the main reason why this is an important song for parents, guardians and youth leaders to share - is that when a young woman engages in premarital sex, it isn't always about sex. I believe that, sadly, these lyrics ring True for many females:

She is yearning for shelter and affection
That she never found at home
She is searching for a hero to ride in
To ride in to save the day
And in walks her Prince Charming
And he knows just what to say
Momentary lapse of reason
And she gives herself away

This song is an enlightening truth for Christians with a message of hope for lost and lonely people.",

The synthesizer sounds slightly off-beat for some reason but that sort-of adds to the charm and sincerity of the song.  At first I didn't like the fake record noise which I hadn't noticed the several times I heard the song on the car radio, but even that's OK now.  Contrary to one reviewer, I love the bass!

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00137KRYS,1,1,5,"I tend to find Sarah McLachlan to be a bit melodramatic of a singer (not to mention her gut-wrenching performances in the ASPCA ads), but I can't deny that she's a gorgeous songstress, with a melancholy but lovely voice.  Of her repertoire, I find ""Angel"" to be her best song -- it's emotional without being over-the-top, and has a quiet, laid-back piano accompaniment that doesn't overwhelm the singer's voice.  It's relaxing, lovely, and well worth owning as a single.

And yes, I know this is the very song that features in those tear-jerker ASPCA ads... but that doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the song.",

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B00137MMAU,1,1,5,"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic ""Un-break My Heart""; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, ""Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain..."" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.

Braxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, ""Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!"" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like ""Mourning Becomes Electra"" with the lights turned down.

This in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.

""Bring back the nights when I held you beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life

Un-break my
Un-break my heart oh baby

Angel

By Sarah McLachlan

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay

There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard, at the end of the day

I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins

And maybe empty
Oh, and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don't make no difference
Escape one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here",

A208QEPAI30Z4G,B00137KRYS,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was fairly cheap on Amazon....69 cents, I think?  But most of the songs I download are free..  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137MMAU,1,1,5,"There is honestly no question about when it comes to female singers today in song, they absolutely do not even come close to the heart and soulful intimacy of the voice of within, that others have shown in voice and style years ago. It has been over 20 years since Toni Braxton took on the music industry, and her success as a part of Laface records still has been a cornerstone of what great female R&B music is absolute;y like. Un-Break My Heart, is honestly one of Toni's masterpieces from the sensual Secrets record. The song is definitely one of those songs that blends beauty, voice and soulfulness all into one, which Diane Warren had beautifully wrote for her. The song is absolutely one of a kind, and still sounds much more beautiful every time I heart it. Something that acts like Rihanna, Mariah Carey and Beyonce' Knowles could take a real page on that female songstresses did like Toni back then. If you have never heard a Toni Braxton song before, this is really the one to go to first. I sincerely recommend it.

She is a great singer and a great individual and I continue enjoying her music.",
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137MMAU,1,1,5,"There is no question that when it has came down to Toni Braxton, musically she has shwon no boundaries for all. Her songs from her days with LaFace have been the strike of her career. Un-Brak My Heart, which originally was featured from her 1996 record, Secrets is her strongest opus musically and soulfully. The Diane Warren ballad still remains as strong as stirring as it did when it was released over 15 years ago. While Toni hasn't been able to top what she did with that song, it still is a classic today that hasn't been replicated. There have been others that have done Un-Break My Heart, but no one has done it like Toni Braxton.

To know that wherever you are, whatever you are going through all you have to do is Cry Out To Jesus.  Such truth and honesty is rare in the world of music these days.  I give so much credit to the men of Third Day for putting out honest, honorable songs with incredible lyrics that can touch everyone listening to them.  These guys are amazing songwriters.  This song gives you a reason to keep holding on.  In your darkest hour, all you have to do is Cry Out To Jesus.

The pace of the beat, combine with the period during which the song is released to produce an image you can't forget.

AK0CENM3LUM28,B00137MSX6,1,1,5,"Irreplaceable (Beyonce) / B001BKPZPI

Beyonce has the voice of an angel, and this slow beat song really showcases her talents. A fantastic affirmation 'break up' song, the vocalist is in the process of quietly, calmly, and firmly throwing her love interest out of her life. The man in question, who has been unTrue, is blustering loudly that no one can ever replace him in her life, and that she is making a big mistake, and she retorts that he is so foolish that he can't even recognize that SHE is the irreplaceable one, not he. Perfect for anyone who's ever had a painfully similar choice to make.

Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137MTF8,1,1,4,"It has been over a decade since Carlos Santana made history, with Supernatural, and the historic win of 8 Grammys making it the record that won the most Grammy Awards in music history. There is no doubt about it when Santana and Matchbox 20 singer Rob Thomas made one of the most accllaimed songs of all time. The collaboration is still electrifying, and shows a standing that many duets and collaborations from Beyonce & Shakira with Beautiful Liar, and acts like Justin Bieber haven't been able to honestly strike as a home run with universal music buyers. If you haven't honestly yet owned the song from the record Supernatural, than you might want to get it again as a addition to your MP3 library, and that is just simply smooth.

1975.

listen closely--its about being a musician.

Patsy is amazed by audience reactions because
the song is OLDER than them. It is one of PATSYs
favorites...its been cut over 300x.

was pitched to Waylon--recording day--Willie
happened to be there so...he joined in.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

LYRICS:

I'll be your dream
I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope I'll be your love
Be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do
I will be strong I will be faithful
'cause I'm counting on
A new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

I want to stand with you on
a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining
brightly in the velvet sky,
I'll make a wish send it to heaven
Then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the
pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the
comfort and protection of

The highest powers
In lonely hours
The tears devour you

Oh can you see it baby?
You don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right
before you
All that you need will surely come

I'll be your dream I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope I'll be your love
Be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do

I want to stand with you on a
mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to live like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me",

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00137MTF8,1,1,5,"""Smooth"" is a very fun and great pop/rock song done beautifully by Carlos Santana.  I remember being in my senior year in high school when I heard this song. When I saw the video to this song being played on one of the music channels there was something about it that drew me on(I just wish that I can remember if it was VH1 or MTV). Carlos made the right decision when he selected Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty to sing the vocals (Rob has a great singing voice). The reason why I say this is because I noticed that in the music video Rob Thomas really put his spirit and emotion in giving the musical ""Smooth"" a vibrant life of its own. ""Smooth"" is a gorgeous song about a man who is willing to change his life to accomodate the woman he loves, and he is asking the woman in his life to make up her mind about him. He makes this clear with the clever and catchy lyrics ""so give me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it). I love and enjoy listening to Rob Thomas's vocals in this song. In addition, I was imagining who this song was for, especially when Rob Thomas did a good job of using his voice of emphasizing the lyrics ""my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa"" When I found out later on that it was for his wife Marisol Thomas I was very moved and thought that was romantic and heartwarming. I say this because ""Smooth"" came out in 1999. It is posted online that they met in 1998 and married in 1999. At the time of this writing, they are still married (which I think is so beautiful by the way, may they enjoy more joyful and loving years together). I admit that part of the reason why I still find this song enjoyable to listen to is because I enjoy hearing Rob Thomas's singing (Rob's music and vocals first drew me in with the 1997 Matchbox 20 musical hit ""Push""). The best way to choose whether you are going to love this song is if you enjoy music by either Rob Thomas, Carlos Santana, and/or romantic alternative rock songs.",

A13AW7HQFCISU2,B00137O8ES,1,1,4,"I hear this song all the time when Im out and I always rush over to check whos singing it. I finally decided to write it down and go in search of the composer. Brooks and Dunn bring this little song to life, and as in so many country tunes, hit a high warballing note that makes me giggle. I cant listen to much of that hi note stuff, but this one is tolerable. I always sing along....it makes me smile",

It might make you cry because the music catches onto your soul and the lyrics take you to another dimension of REAL love and not all the love the media tries to convey.  This is the REAL thing.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137MPOI,1,1,5,"There is no question that when it has came down to music, Journey had been the most distinctive in Rock music ballads. But nevertheless, they have been known for so many great songs that are just as strong today as they were back in the 80's. Faithfully, when it came out originally from their record Frontiers in 1983, still is just a beautiful classic. It is simply one of those songs standing tall in simplicity that will never die. Just like Open Arms or Send Her My Love, it really is a excellent song that is a pleasure to listen too. It is definitely a great song worth checking out if you have not even heard a Journey song yet. While they haven't been able to thrive without Steve Perry at heart, Journey will always remain classic for the faithful.

Song: A-",

We all face moments of doubt and fear, but if we could learn to listen to the still small voice inside of us (The voice of Truth) we could have the peace of mind that only God can give us.  God did not give us the spirit of fear but He will help us defeat fear/doubt and any other harmful thought that may try to defeat us.

A2W73JAQ4AVCNJ,B00137OD52,1,1,5,"This review is for the single ""Me And Bobby McGee"" as sung by Janis Joplin, lyrics and by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster.

Kristofferson and Joplin had a close personal relationship and, while the song was not written explicitly for her, the tune fits Ms. Joplin's style very well.

Her voice is neither smooth nor melodic - it reminds me very much of Billie Holliday's voice.  And, like Lady Day, with Ms. Joplin it isn't about the tonality she brings to her work; it's the (to coin a too-oft used word) soul she expends when singing.

Many singers can bring feeling into a ballad; very few can make the listener want to weep in sympathy with the singer's obvious pain and loneliness.  Sinatra, most certainly; he spent over 60 years with his main theme being loneliness (or the brief intermission of a new love before loneliness returned).  Billie Holliday; her life was filled with pain both physical and emotional and she brought every ounce of it into her work.  And Janis Joplin, whose body of work is small in the number of recordings but huge in the personality she embedded in the canon.

""Me And Bobby McGee"" (recorded a few days before Ms. Joplin's death in 1970) is a fine example of her music.  While the writing may not be necessarily on a par with, for instance, Cole Porter's work one must consider the different genre that Messrs. Kristofferson and Foster worked in.

I highly recommend this recording - with the caveat that I have a personal emotional tie in to the record.  I was freshly back in the United States (just a few months) from the Vietnam war when Ms. Joplin passed away leaving this last piece with which to be remembered and her passing hit me with nearly the force of a physical blow. I had listened to her songs when I was with the U.S. Army and her loss at the age of 27 was hard to deal with - even though I had never met her in person.

Others who do not have direct experience of the 1960's may not bring the memories that those of us who lived through it to songs of that era - but I think that this particular song of Ms. Joplin's has stood the test of time and stands on it's own merit.

HTH

A3K9VLEPZW80JD,B00137OBNQ,1,1,5,"Theres always that album that will stay in your ears forever. And this is one of them I was around 7-10 years old in 2003, and I remember how soul siring the songs ""Voice of Truth"", ""We Are The Body"" and ""Who Am I"" appeared on the radio for the first time. That is such an overrated statement. These songs were more then soul stirring. They were convicting and pinned the nail right on the donkey. Even for such a kid like I was. I can't believe how raw this album is, looking back at it. The lyrics are phenomenal. But it doesn't stop there; the instruments, the key signatures, octaves, rhythms and melodies. They play a very key role in this album.

Carrie Underwood has been no acception with her big hit Before He Cheats from her debut album Some Hearts. The song is a very gritty and down to Earth song that really captures her voice well. Unlike Kelly Clarkson and Fantasia Burrino, Carrie has made a great impression with her standard. I like this song because it really captures the momentum of her soul, and the real country style of a great singer. Out of all the songs from any American Idol contender, this is definitely what I believe is the best one ever.

A deep, sexy but gritty dull roar she then sings ""Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink 'cause she can't shoot whiskey.  Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool stick showin' her how to shoot a combo.  But he don't know, I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up four wheel drive.  Carved my name into his leather seats.  Took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights.  Slashed a hole in all four tires. Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats."". Well darn. I would think too after hearing that!! The second I heard this song when I bought Carries cd, I knew it would make her a superstar! And I was correct. All in all, great track.",

You know the music, and like me, you love the music. ""Owww!"" You know once this starts playing, your feet will do more than tap; your body becomes an all out instrument, with your voice-over vocals that sound good when the music is loud and no one else is around! Hahaha! It's all good, because that's what Workin' Day and Night is supposed to do. And who else could wear glitter socks and highwaters without being teased? Only Mike.",

The song has grown on me - and I now enjoy listening to it.

It's not my usual 'cup of tea' (from an historical perspective) when it comes to music.  But it's alright - and I am now very capable of singing along with most of the lyrics whenever I am driving my vehicle and listening to it.

Good stuff!

Definitely worth the purchase price - Absolutely!",

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137QS2I,1,1,5,"When it came down to Toni Braxton back in 2000, she had to reinvent herself after a disheartened bankruptcy. But when it has came down to her ballads, they've been very seductive. That is definitely the case with the song Diane Warrne penned for her, Spanish Guitar. The song is absolutely very bold and brilliant from what the song captures through Toni's voice, and is honestly one of my favorites from Toni top to bottom. While people will always go back into Diane's other big one from Toni, Un-Break My Heart, this song is definitely worth a deep listen from the seductive soul. Tell you the truth, the song was originally written for Celine Dion, but a good thing she passed it up. While many people overshadowed Pulse, this pulse of a intimate guitar is the best from Toni's heat anyday.

Song: A 1/2-",
A2BWO2L2RDYBCY,B00137MM0K,1,1,5,Terrific.,
A1OBNCS1F55EVT,B00137MM0K,1,1,5,I think this is one of Ronnie Milsap's best recording.  Brings back a lot of memories and a 1950 Black Chevie!  I'm glad I found it for my Kindle which goes every where with me!,
A2AM3I2D8KG6L0,B00137MM0K,1,1,5,In the Still of the Night. Perhaps my favorite song that Ronnie Milsap has ever recorded. His version of the Five Satin's #1 hit of 1956 evokes the Doo-wop sound of that era and the magic of being with one's significant other while Mr. Milsap's version is playing it the background. Truly a masterpeice.,
A19LAY5P7D0D9V,B00137QMFG,1,1,5,Awesome song..,
A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00137QMFG,1,1,5,"""Your Love"" was the first single from The Outfield's Play Deep and is their signature song and biggest hit.  The song opens with lead singer Tony Lewis belting out he familar ""Josie's on a vacation far away"" line a capella before the music crashes in.  The vocal harmonies are seamless and the music perfect balances a rock edge with a smart pop sensability.  It's a classic 80's track for a reason, it still damn good.  The song made it all the way up to number 6 on the Hot 100.",

The words and music are so pretty you can't help but go back in time and remember when there really was an old lamplighter. Even if you never saw them in your life, with this song your imagination takes you to that era. And the harmony of the Browns is so magical you'll want to play it over and over again. Then before you know it,you're singing along with it. Wonderful song brings back happy times of years ago. Get your copy now!",
A2AKM2MPT7XHXH,B00137QMI8,1,1,5,This was an era I'd love to live in.  Wish we still had old lamplighters.  Those days seemed so innocent.  Love this song and the Browns did it so well.,

A3M3Q3OVHEZYCP,B00137QTS6,1,1,5,"Not only does this song by the O'Jays sound good but it also has interesting lyrics. It's a song about guys (friends) hanging around their girl wanting to take her away from him. What's so interesting is that the music, the sound, doesn't really sound like a song about backstabbing friends! Nevertheless, it is a smooth sounding song that I would recommend to anyone who likes soul music.",

Being a track from one of the really great ""arena rock"" bands - I don't care if that's not an official designation for Journey, to me they always have evoked the sense of a huge arena concert - this particular song is just so catchy and infectious.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137QW4M,-1,-1,2,"Last year's American Idol winner, Jordin Sparks, really hasn't hit the nail on the head with great songs on her debut. While her debut single Tattoo was a fair song, it just hasn't shown that she has stood out well to compete with greats like Alicia Keys or newcomer Chrisette Michele. Her second single from that album, No Air with rising Hip Hop star Chris Brown, doesn't work well either. While the song has a fairly nice beat, it just doesn't seem to be an everlasting song that stands out. On top of that, the duet doesn't actually show that there is complete chemistry like other classics. I just honestly think she has a good talent, but needs to find better footing for the long run. Her next single needs to do a much better job at sealing the deal.

They received several Grammy awards. Their most successful album was their fourth one, 'Toto IV', released in 1982. It went triple Platinum. It spawned several singles, 'Africa' being one of them. The musical style is best described as pop rock. The performance is impeccable. The vocal harmonies are next to flawless. The tune is peppy and uplifting, motivating in a sense. I have always liked it a lot, and I still do. The MP3 sound quality is very acceptable, about as good as a compressed music file can be.",

I am still going thru cancer (illness), chemo (medicine) Jesus (healing).  I don't use the ""c"" word.  It stinks.  And scares people.

I've listened to healing rain along with other Christian recordings including Blessings by Laura Story and Even if by kutless.  I believe these songs have helped me to focus on Jesus and His healing power.

I am not afraid.  Contact me if you want a list of other Christian music that I've listened to, books that I've read, Pslam 103, the healing Pslam.  Jesus will heal you, trust and believe.  No matter what the situation, it's never too much for Jesus to fix.  May take doctors, may take time, I'm not a patient person and I'm tire of docs, nurses, hosp, and loss of hair, I have enough hair that if I dyed it orange and did a mohawk, I'd look like a baby orangatang.

A16DHIHCNVXN6K,B00137R2IM,1,1,5,"Charlie Rich was a great country star popular in the 1970's that was also a successful crossover pop artist. I'm sure there were other crossover artists before Charlie Rich - Johnny Cash being one - but when this song was popular, it was played everywhere. Back then, I didn't really care for it, but now as I've mellowed, those beautiful melodies, the harmonies, and the smooth production sound great. Behind Closed Doors and the Most Beautiful Girl are great examples of this lost genre. I bought the MP3 for these songs, but I'm sure the entire album would be excellent.",

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00137QSKA,1,1,5,"Words can only partly describe the classic that this song is.  This musical track is a very energetic and dance/pop creation about someone imagining what it would be like to be the lover of someone that they really desire.  Sophie puts alot of soul and energy in this song in a very creative and intense way.  I love how she paints a good story in her songs such as when she mentions while singing that she had a dream that she was the hero of the one she very much wants. She also makes it fun by mentioning about making her fantasy lover ""feel much better"". What makes this musical track even more appealing is that Sophie sings really beautiful vocals to go along with the great lyrics to the song. ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover"" compares to two of the following other songs of Sophie B. Hawkins in a good way:
""As I Lay Me Down""- A great musical track about how she appreciates her lover and intends to always be happy.  This is such a beautiful song, and the video I saw to this on youtube is very good.
""Right Beside You""- This is also another song that showcases her gorgeous voice, and she sings with the same passion and great spirit as ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover.""

  If you happen to like ""As I Lay Me Down"" and/or ""Right Beside You"" then it is most likely that you are going to the fine musical melody that is ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover"".",

I still remember the 1st time I heard it in 1982 or 1983, on WQWK, State College's Classic Rock radio station.

That really was a head of the time

While hair metal bands were bragging about the rock and roll life style
Selling sex, drugs, and rock and roll
Martika took a different route  this song is polar opposites it's really dark and telling!
Talking about drug addiction but, cleverly hiding it inside a radio friendly  pop song

It's both honest and heartbreaking but, still a phenomenal song in every respect  10/10",

It was the first ballad I had ever heard from him and was only familiar with ""Lovey Dovey"" from about 4 years prior. It was after the famous Hurricane Bob that struck New England that this became one of my fave songs of that summer. You won't find many online covers of this and I would attribute this to the fact (i.e., ""Vision of Love"" by Mariah Carey) that no one would dare to compete with the vocal acrobatics that only the original can perform. Nothing else on his self-titled album compares to this great track. It held up well on slow jam formats such as BET's ""MIdnight Love""(sigh, I miss that stuff)",

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00137RAQ6,1,1,5,"""Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,"" written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown, is performed better than ever here by Dawn featuring Tony Orlando. Tony born (Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis) sings the lyrics to the song while Telma Hopkins, Joyce Vincent Wilson and her sister Pamela Vincent sing excellent backup vocals. The song is sung from the point of view of a man who spent three years in prison; and he wonders if his one True love will take him back now that he is free. It's all poignantly told in the lyrics of the song.

The melody is catchy, memorable and fairly upbeat even though the outcome doesn't come until the end of the song. It's amazing that such a great hit then still sounds excellent today. I highly recommend this tune.",

Well, we're still going to h**l & I still love this song. Buy it, it'll bring back memories, unless you were too stoned to remember it the first time.",
,B00137SQSW,1,1,5,Love it,
,B00137SQSW,1,1,5,Love stevie ray.  Digital music is so easy to obtain and the quality is spot on.  love it and thanks,
,B00137SQSW,1,1,5,I've downloaded several of Stevies songs. Love his soulful bluesy sound!!! His death was such a tragic loss to the music industry and to the listeners!!!,
,B00137SQSW,1,1,4,"It's a tipical Stevie Ray tune, and I like it! I have the Hits album, but this one isn't on it.",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,If you were around for the 60s you will remember this song. This is so mellow and groovey. Enjoy and peace.,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"This great song was made during the 60's when America was experiencing a counterculture movement.  America was also dealing with The Vietnam War, Civil Rights, Woodstock, The British Invasion and Space Travel.. The lyrics in this song express the need for peace and brotherhood.  It's a song that can be applied to today's times.  Just goes to show you that history DOES repeat itself!!!",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"A song with a message and a gentle pleasant beat, this probably my favorite song from that time period. Enjoy, and if you lived in the era, remember.",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,Good song from the 60's--i added it to my Ipod. love the 60's music.  have 50's thru todays music on my ipod,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,4,Classic oldie must have.,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,My favorite song from 1969,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,Just a reat classic tune.,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"If ever there was a song that best summed  up the mood of the civil rights and anti-war era of the 1960's ""Get Together"" could very well be that song. The only hit song for The Youngbloods it might be the consummate song of love and peace from that time with both thoughtful lyrics and message to it. And really this song is timeless. Even though recorded around 50 years ago the words to this music in a lot of ways still relevant today. A good one to add to your playlist.",
,B00137T3ES,1,1,5,"Yeah fantastic song Too bad nobody writes songs like this any more.  Today's songs have just some good beat, but terrible melodies.

In my opinion, this is the best song that Eurythmics' ever recorded.",
,B00137T3ES,1,1,5,This is one of the Eurythmics' first songs I ever heard and I love it still. Some things just never get old! Their music is great!,
,B00137T3ES,1,1,5,I just love it. 'Nuff said.....but it is also my all time favorite kareoke (I can't spell) song. Just wish I could do it the justice it deserves.,
,B00137T3ES,1,1,5,I just love listening to Annie Lennox. She has such an awesome voice and listening to this song with it blaring on the radio is great while driving to work.,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"This was the only major hit this band chalked up. It was first released in 1967, hit the charts, then coming back in 1969. I liked it a lot, right from the start, even though it brings back some questionable memories as this was during the escalation of the Vietnam War, when duded like me were sweating the draft lottery and whatever else went with it. If you were not living this, you would not understand. I still like the song a lot. The MP3 file sound is quite good.",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,Love love love it!,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"The music, the words, the beauty of this song is timeless.",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"They say if you remember the 60's you weren't there yet somehow I remember ""Get Together"" by The Youngbloods. It would do us all good to remember the youthful hope this song projects.",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"I grew up with this song, and it was one that my mom loved to play on the guitar around the campfires. I don't know why it took me so long to get it into my collection.",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,A classic for generations,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"Another blast from my past that I still enjoy, at 62 years old  !  ;)",

,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,LOVE IT!!!!! Somehow had forgotten it and am happy to have rediscovered it!!!!,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,I love the 60's music.,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,Good song,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,Came back from Vietnam to this.  Applies today even more so than it did in The 60's.  BIG statement in the lyrics.,
,B00137T4XS,1,1,4,"My youngest son introduced me to the German group Accept, and this song is one of their best. From the album Balls to the Wall released in 1984, this song still stands as a metal anthem today.",
,B00137T4XS,1,1,5,"Balls to the Wall is a classic. It has anger, great riff, and Udo's vocal fit right in. This bleeds hard rock and metal that is sorely missed in today's generic music.",
,B00137RGS8,1,1,4,"I haven't heard any of Metro Station's other songs, but I like this one.  I actually heard it first in a wedding proposal video posted on youtube and thought it was a great.",
,B00137RGS8,1,1,5,"Recently I decided to download this song on my zune player after being captivated by the sound and savoring it.  It turns out that the vocals are sung by Trace Cyrus (Miley Cyrus's older brother).  Although Trace is only 19 years old he really sings this song in a very self confident and mature way.  Admittedly this is a song that you may not want to expose to somebody that is under 13 because the song has sexual undertones to it.  The reason why I say this is because the song still has appropriate language to it but he sings about being on the bed with someone and their clothes on the floor (to his credit creatively).  He also suggests in the song how he will take someone home if he's not left at the front door.  However what makes the song great is that he sings the song creatively, self confidently, and narratively.  The reason why is say that he sings this narratively is because it sounds like he is telling a short story about charming someone he is interested in while making sure to combine the singing in seamlessly.  I agree with the others that say this is a good workout song too because the music is really  upbeat and sounds like something you can easily dance to in the club or a party.  It was also featured on one of the reality tv shows I was watching on mtv one night that features Lauren Conrad.  All in all if you are fine with songs that have a dance pop twist and you are curious to listen to how Trace Cyrus sounds then in my opinion you will like this song.",
,B00137RGS8,1,1,5,"I do like this song a lot! One of the songs I play a lot. Really catchy, nice rock/dance sound. The other song I like a lot right now if you click see my other reviews you can see my review on that song (The Warehouse Band). They are new on myspace, like em a lot.",
,B00137RGS8,-1,-1,2,"How annoying is this song? He says shake about 50x and it gets so damn repetitive.

2 stars.",
,B00137RGS8,1,1,4,"No, Beyonce or J.Lo. did not make this song, nor is it in yo face sexual. Nope, just good old fashioned fun and dance. And it's catchy, whether this is a good thing, since it got it from its over simplistic nature, is a different story.

This could be the surprise song of the year, in a year full of surprises, because let's admit it, did anybody see this song becoming a national hit? I think it says something about the state of dance music. I mean, any top 10 hit is given a BPM, and sent to the clubs, and sometimes your radio. These songs are cheap shots at great music, and I take them as an insult. I mean, I can't tell whether we're supposed to dance or laugh at these ""re-mixes.""

""Shake It"" is simple on the verses, which is typical of Metro Station, but they bring it on the chorus, and they bring it home in a big way. The chorus is catchy, fun, happy and it could start a new dance craze, if their was more of a dance to create.

So overall, the verses aren't that great, but the chorus is what makes the song. It might not be original, but it's fun. Here's to the continued success of ""Shake It"" and Metro Station. And remember, get your groove on and ""Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake It!""",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,Only took two years for this classic 1967-1969 soft rocker to make it.  Symbolizes everything about Woodstock. Great song!,

,B00137T3A2,1,1,4,"This was the big hit for The Youngbloods and a hippie theme, and the two will always be linked. The vocals are really good and the message of peace and love still works. My favorite song by The Youngbloods is definitely ""Darkness, Darkness,"" which sounds nothing like this song, but ""Get Together"" is their second best.",
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,Who doesn't like the trip down memory lane. Has good sound quality for my pc and ipod. Just buy it.,
,B00137T3A2,1,1,5,"Love this song, don't know why. The Youngbloods version is the absolute best. The words, the music, and the pace are fantastic. I've heard other versions, but they don't come close.",

,B00137T3ES,1,1,5,"Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) is probably their best known song. It is certainly appropriate that one of their ""Best of"" albums would be named as such.

Eurythmic's Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox have managed to do what few duos have ever done - stay strong. The cuts on this album attest to their staying power. With Lennox' awesome voice and Stewart's outstanding writing, these two keep churning them out and get better and better.",

,B00137TG3Q,1,1,5,"I found this song on Just Dance 3 and I liked it a lot! This is where Britney Spears'career began. She's asking the guy to kiss me, hug me, and hit me just one more time. Amazing!",

,B00137TG3Q,-1,-1,1,"this is not only a horrible song. it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the advent of recorded music. what a wretched piece of dung! i have about 274 different downloads on my special download wishlist on amazon, so there's about 274 things i could recommend you download before downloading this piece of crap song. i can't stand these record industry manufactured pop princess garbage. she doesn't even write her own songs for chrissakes! the pitbull song 'give me everything' probably comes close to this as far as 'worst song' but this is indisputably the worst",

,B00137TFZU,1,1,5,"This song says so much.  In my opinion, Mr. Dylan doesn't get hardly any credit for his great songs after his fiery and innovative offerings in the 60s.  The man can still write amazing songs without even blinking.  They just pour out of him like some cosmic flow.  Anyway, this song hit the spot with me when I first heard it watching ""Wonder Boys"" which also tells a great bunch of stories.  I even bought a t-shirt that says ""I USED TO CARE...but things have changed"" on it.",

,B00137T4WE,-1,-1,2,"early nineties pop cheese hasn't dated well b/c the arrangements and the production sounds like that overproduced, cold sounding late eighties early nineties sound that hasn't dated too well. Whitney was looking fine in the video though, back when everyone thought she was a wholesome role model type.",

If you are a Whitney fan, this song is a classic and I highly recommend it. This song is from her earlier hits and one of her very best in my opinion!",

,B00137T4WE,1,1,4,...but I didn't have many of them on my computer.  I downloaded a lot of her songs as a tribute after her unfortunate death.  She had an amazing voice.  She was very gifted...,
,B00137T4WE,1,1,5,"It is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary Whitney Houston, and you cannot commence how beautfiul and soulful her voice showcased to many boundaries. But with I Wanna Dance With Somebody, helping her sophmore album, Whitney, become the first by a female artist to debut at #1 on Billboard. The song is a beautiful anthem that still remains classy and True to her sound. Sadly, though with Whitney passing away on the 25th anniversary of Whitney debuting at #1 on Billboard, it is so hard to celebrate her right now, without grieveing for all of her fans and myself too. While Lady Gaga paid homage to Whitney with Fashion Of His Love for her album Born This Way, nothing will ever replace the smile, joy and love Whitney Houston had with that song, and Whitney will always want to dance with somebody. Now, she is dancing up there with her dad, John Houston whom died 9 years ago. One day, will we all want to dance together with Whitney.

Whitney Houston 1963-2012

Song: A",
,B00137T4WE,1,1,5,"Many of her ballads will come to mind when we replay the Whitney Houston soundtrack after her too-soon passing.

If you want to avoid the shortcut to tears: turn this up, and remember the energy from her early breakout into the popular music stratosphere, put this song from her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second-studio-album/dp/B000002VEB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second studio album</a>&nbsp;and turn it up.

If you're of a certain age, you'll be taken back to a summer of neon-colored clothes and a simpler world, free of constant connectivity, when the story of Whitney's music was one of promise and lightness, not the story of the struggles that would follow.

And if you're not that old:
this is proof that a popular tune doesn't have to be auto-tuned or cut from a template to work. Give it a listen",
,B00137SPH4,-1,-1,3,Its a okay song I have heard better but it is still a very good song with a very awsome guitar riff too it,
,B00137SPH4,1,1,5,"Everytime this song plays, it takes me back.... It's just one of those ""wow, I haven't heard that song in a while"" tunes.",
,B00137SPH4,1,1,5,When you want to get your grove on with some classic 80's music this is a must have.  One of the best of the 80's.,

,B00137TAC8,1,1,5,Love hezekiah work,
,B00137TAC8,1,1,5,"This song only consists of about eight sentences. But they are eight of some of the most powerful sentences to date. The time I heard, I broke down in tears. This is how I wanted to feel about others, even in the midst of pain they may have caused me. I listen to this song a lot. Especially during times of stress and anger.",

,B00137SPH4,1,1,5,I love the 80s,
,B00137THVC,-1,-1,3,This is an alternate version of the hit from the newly remastered CD. It's a bit longer version and the lyrical deliver is a little more subdued. The sound quality is a little too much in the treble for my tastes. I think I would have skipped purchasing it if I had known this was a different version though. Overall it's not bad. It's probably a really good choice for a completist though.,
,B00137SPH4,1,1,4,"I wasn't so hot on the song at first.  A female I like had mentioned to me that she, herself, enjoyed this song - so I went ahead and purchased it for myself to kind of 'assist,' perhaps, the 'I like you process.'  :-)

The song has grown on me - and I now enjoy listening to it.

It's not my usual 'cup of tea' (from an historical perspective) when it comes to music.  But it's alright - and I am now very capable of singing along with most of the lyrics whenever I am driving my vehicle and listening to it.

Good stuff!

Definitely worth the purchase price - Absolutely!",

,B00137SPH4,1,1,5,Great 80's tune,

,B00137SPH4,1,1,5,Awesome song..,
,B00137SPH4,1,1,5,"""Your Love"" was the first single from The Outfield's Play Deep and is their signature song and biggest hit.  The song opens with lead singer Tony Lewis belting out he familar ""Josie's on a vacation far away"" line a capella before the music crashes in.  The vocal harmonies are seamless and the music perfect balances a rock edge with a smart pop sensability.  It's a classic 80's track for a reason, it still damn good.  The song made it all the way up to number 6 on the Hot 100.",
,B00137SPH4,1,1,5,Awesome song from the 80s. A great addition to a collection,

I sing it in my car, I sing it at work & I sing it at home. I couldn't carry a tune even if it was nailed to the plate, but I sing anyway! Buy this song & you will, too!",
,B00137TMKI,1,1,4,"Up until last Friday, I've never heard of this song...I only knew about it because a couple of my older coworkers were talking about it and how the technology/events that were mentioned are slowly coming to pass.  So, I was on my 'Cloud Player' over the weekend and one of the recommendations for me was this very song. How weird was that?  I decided to buy it and listen to it in its entirety and I liked it.",

,B00137TMKI,1,1,4,"The original sounds better than I thought it would. Originally, as played over the Net, it sounded like a scratchy old 45. BUT, the MP3 download is crystal clear, and very high fidelity. I enjoyed throwing this into my stack.",

,B00137TMK8,1,1,5,"Hey, on the solo - unidentified voice captured at the beginning of Sun Goddess

Five HUGE Stars! This certified-gold Sun Goddess Ramsey Lewis album, with the distinctive Herb Breuer photo of golden girl Susan Leigh Scott, was a popular song that generated the song Sun Goddess on which his former Ramsey Lewis Trio drummer, Maurice White, returned with his group Earth, Wind, and Fire to play and sing those distinctive background vocals, probably led by ace singer Phillip Bailey and White himself. The album went to No 1 and the single went highest to No 5 on the Disco charts.

The song starts with the familiar modulating guitar riff, synthesizer intro, and Bailey & White lead the Falsetto vocal riff that recurrs throughout the song, which includes 2 lengthy keyboard solos by Lewis and a hot tenor sax solo by Don Myrick. Big blast from the past. My Highest Recommendation. Five LOVELY Stars! (1 MP3 track. Time-8:30)",
,B00137TMK8,1,1,5,Classic!  Never gets old,

,B00137TMK8,-1,-1,2,I bought this c.d. for the title track. I thought it was Earth Wind & Fire and found out it was Ramsey Lewis. If I had heard the album first I would have only downloaded the title track.,
,B00137TMK8,1,1,5,"I simply enjoy this timeless Jazz/R&B song. It's outstanding. You don't have to be a fan, to appreciate this work of musical art.",
,B00137TMK8,1,1,5,"This is a great Jazz meets R&B song that I downloaded a while ago. It showcases contrasting styles of music featuring the great Jazz pianist Ramsey Lewis and the great, legendary R&B band Earth, Wind & Fire. A brilliant, timeless instrumental :)",

,B00137TMKI,1,1,5,Good,
,B00137TMKI,1,1,5,"The  fact that songs such as this are still available confers a degree of merit, I suppose.  I purchased this along with about thirty others from the period because I was sitting around feeling nostalgic for my youth and the days I shared with some friends in a band in Detroit (EVERYone in Detroit in the sixties was in a band).  Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it. The only thing remarkable about this group and those like it is that the guys only had one hit in them.",
,B00137TMKI,1,1,5,"I have always loved this song.  It is one of those songs you just dont' forget.  The music is great and the lyrics are pretty interesting.  Really makes you think about the future as well as the present.  ""IN the year 2525, If man is still alive... survive...""  just keeps you holding on for the next line.  Its one of those songs that stays with you. Great song.",

,B00137TMKI,1,1,5,This is a very memorable song.  The tune is well done and tends to stick with you which can be annoying at times and others it is enjoyable.,
,B00137TMKI,1,1,5,The best of Early Rock and Roll. You just can't beat songs like these. The generation of today just can't see their Mom and Dad's crankin up the stereo and jammin to songs like this.,
,B00137TMKI,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs growing up. It has a catchy tune and the song writer put a lot of thought into the lyrics. If you like 1960's music this is definitely one you should have in your collection.,
,B00137TMKI,1,1,5,A one hit wonder that became a classic song. Brings back great memories.  Whats not to like and the price is great as well.,

,B00137URHA,1,1,5,Love her!!!,
,B00137URHA,1,1,4,Has some really good songs on this CD but also has some pop/rock that has too much band and overshadows the vocals.  I like the vocals to be able to be heard more clearly and not so much of the band and hard rocking out as some of the songs have.,
,B00137TMNA,1,1,5,"This is one of those great songs from R & B/soul music's heyday 40+ years-50+ years ago, from the early 1960s to the early 1970s.  Evokes nostalgia for those glory years of R & B/soul.",

It's a little bit country, a little bit rock n' roll, and even a little bit folky, the perfect mix of everything you could possibly musically need.

I mean, how can you go wrong when you're rhymin' ""you don't have to see,"" and ""olfactory?""

This is her, in her hey day -back when ""hair bands"" ruled MTV (and were wrongly called metal, I might add).  This is a great hard rock song, great vocals and if you've seen the video -whew!!!

,B00137USQ0,1,1,5,"During the ending years of Vietnam, this song came out and rallied the people to support our troops. Unfortunately the kids of the 60's thought they knew it all and treated the troops quite shamelessly. But this song is timeless in it's message of what it takes to make the grade and the fierce loyality it takes to serve even for idiots who will never be able to appreciate it. Awesome song!",

then the chorus comes in:

And oh/I'm into you/And girl no!/one else will do/Cause with every kiss and every hug/You make me fall in love

And now I/Know I can't be the only one/I bet it's hearts all over the world tonight/With a lover they like/Who feels/what I feel/When I'm with

With you/With you/with you/with you/with you

Not close to anything deep, but for a soon-to-be-19-year-old, in a pop world, I'll take it! :)

Final Grade: 4.5 stars.

End note: Slightly strained vocals, but the heart is there. Especially for a pop song. Has it touched on anything new or innovative? No. But for Chris Brown, this song's a straight up keeper!
No other song on his new CD touches this track. Down comes close but it's a lot more repetitive and is genuinely more fun than containing substance. However, it has this awesome pop-rockish thing going on with it. If you still haven't heard of this song, download it now. It's totally cute. :)

The only song that comes close to being better from him is Yo (Excuse Me Miss) (2005).",
,B00137V04O,1,1,5,It's good.,
,B00137V04O,1,1,5,ok,

,B00137UVUS,1,1,5,"I believe this is another one of those songs that deserves to be in everyone's '70s collection, also. The soaring vocal line: ""Are we in love or just friends/Is this my beginning or is this the end?"" is just magical and sticks in your forever :) Another great song I remember from '70s radio.",
,B00137UVUS,1,1,5,Sounds like an MP3 digital file.,
,B00137UVUS,1,1,5,Excellent song,
,B00137UVUS,1,1,5,"I see it as a great song that could have been cheesy but is entirely successful at avoiding that categorization.  Actually - and please don't take offense here - I bought this for a mix CD of fun songs that are fun in part because they're just on the right side of cheesy, and this one fits the bill except that IT'S SO MUCH BETTER!  It's a great upbeat but sweet song that will have your guests singing along, and if your friends are like mine, that's when things are going to get cheesy!",

,B00137V58A,1,1,5,"Like other oldies I have and will review I have my original 45 of this song and really played it to the point it's no longer a crisp recording.

,B00137V96S,1,1,4,Always have liked the sound of The Verve or The Verve Pipe...whatever you want to call them. This song came out not to long after my senior year in HS. It always reminds of the 90's and all the good music that came out then.,
,B00137V96S,1,1,5,Phenomenal song that is very touching in that it deals with suicide. Good song to listen to when you are in the mood for it.,
,B00137V96S,1,1,5,"I love this song from when it first came out, to now, I love it! It has a great beat!",
,B00137TPTG,1,1,5,"This is a song that I listen to to enter into the presence of God. I love it, I love it, I love it.",
,B00137TPTG,1,1,5,"What a fantastic song from Third Day.  When I hear and sing this song, I can feel the lord with all my heart and soul.",
,B00137VFH6,1,1,4,"This is a better version that does not have dialogue or applause in it.  If you just want the music without the clutter, this is the version that you want.",
,B00137VFH6,1,1,5,"Who doesn't love Ken Burns' films on PBS?  This 'Scottish-Irish' melody was written by Jay Ungar, who lives in New York.  Go figure. Beautiful, performed by the composers.",
,B00137V04Y,1,1,5,love it,
,B00137V04Y,1,1,5,It just doesn't get much better than this music especially this track.  Great addition to your music favorite music collection.,
,B00137V04Y,1,1,5,"If you aren't singing along or dancing to this one, check your pulse. If you are a rapper and think you can say it better, think again. The truly great songs can't be touched by the new guys, only honored. This is a great song.",
,B00137V04Y,1,1,5,"This is my favorite song from the O'Jays.  Of course, it's the only one that gets any play on the oldies station, so that helps.",
,B00137V04Y,1,1,5,"Great to listen to and good sounds and music.  Sounds come through very well, even on mps player and smartphone.",
,B00137V04Y,1,1,5,"Its what I listen to at the gym!! Brings back a lot of memories!!! Makes me work harder,makes it easier!!!",
,B00137V04Y,1,1,4,The chorus of this song is very fin to dance to and it has a very positive message of showing love to others and by doing so getting them to show love. It's great for a party or for background music for a video on a related topic.,
,B00137TNVG,1,1,5,"This also is another great rendition of Barber's Adagio.  I just love this piece\song.  It's also attached to Christ's passion on the cross.  That's what I think of whenever I hear this piece.  It is so heart wrenching and bittersweet.  Bernstein concucts this and the NY Philharmonic plays it so passionately.  Again this is an old rendition and I have this also on either vinyl or cassete tape, I forget which because I have those packed away and play CD's and mp3's now.  I'm so glad I found it in mp3 also.",
,B00137URS4,1,1,5,I choose this rating because I had no problems with it. I like it because this is what I mainly listen to. Thank you!,
,B00137URS4,1,1,4,"Great song, cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy. In the review for the song itself, allmusic.com wrote ""The lush power ballad ""The Flame"" was penned by two British songwriters, but the band made it their own with Robin Zander's sobbing vocal dramatics and the haunting tones of Rick Nielsen's mandocello chiming behind the guitar and keyboard backing. The lyrics, almost always an afterthought in romantic power ballads, often hint at the Police/""Every Breath You Take""'s school of disguising unhealthy obsession as sentimentality; the singer, unable to let go of his first love, which can be taken either as a scorned lover trying to see his failed romance as somehow cosmically ordained anyway, or as a vaguely disturbing intimation of stalking. It's more likely that the latter interpretation was completely unintentional, though, since the band's straight-ahead reading plays up the heartstring-tugging bombast. It was a perfect fit for the late-'80s' power ballad/happy pop radio, and it was much better crafted than many similar offerings from the same period (most of which were by bands who had been influenced, indirectly or otherwise, by Cheap Trick themselves). While it isn't the most inventive song the band ever recorded, ""The Flame"" is an undeniable part of their legacy, and a well-deserved, better-late-than-never, chart-topping popular success",
,B00137URS4,1,1,5,"Being one of my favorite bands, I did not have this song except on LP. Also, my spouse of 44 years really likes this song!! Cheap Trick is still touring and writing music, quite a feat where today's rock music for the most part has really lost its soul.
The exceptions are 3 Doors Down, Coldplay, and Alter Bridge but they are not the rule.",
,B00137VHME,1,1,5,"I grew up with the Partridge Family show, so their music bring great childhood memories, that I almost forgotten until my best friend got married and at the reception this song was in the background, and I knew I had to buy because of the lyrics and great memories.",
,B00137VE9A,1,1,5,"I am in love with this song. The various layers of it & melodies that it contains are powerful & perfect. I'm so happy to rediscover this song after a long time of not knowing what it was. It's just a great, classic song.",
,B00137VE9A,1,1,5,I used to listen to this song over and over again when I was a teenager. I loved Sly and the Family Stone.,
,B00137VE9A,1,1,5,"Love Sly and The Family Stone!!! Message is clear...""we got to live together""! Love this song and it goes right on the favs playlist!!!",
,B00137VE9A,1,1,4,this song reflect how i feel about people today and i liked it when i first heard it--okay. its a great song,
,B00137VE9A,1,1,4,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.,
,B00137VE9A,1,1,5,Excellent,
,B00137VE9A,1,1,5,Iconic song,
,B00137VE9A,1,1,5,I like the music,

,B00137VL98,1,1,5,"I love this song the quiality is great,adn I enjoy putting it on my own personailized cd. I would recomend this way of purchasing",
,B00137VL98,1,1,5,"While we are waiting what are WE doing? Just getting by? Just hanging around until our last day, hoping that we make it? Another great song by John Waller that makes us think about what we are doing and what we are SUPPOSE to be doing!!

I love the way this song is fitted for the movie Fireproof!

I'm waiting
I'm waiting on You, Lord
And I am hopeful
I'm waiting on You, Lord
Though it is painful
But patiently, I will wait

I will move ahead, bold and confident
Taking every step in obedience

While I'm waiting
I will serve You
While I'm waiting
I will worship
While I'm waiting
I will not faint
I'll be running the race
Even while I wait

I'm waiting
I'm waiting on You, Lord
And I am peaceful
I'm waiting on You, Lord
Though it's not easy
But faithfully, I will wait
Yes, I will wait

I will serve You while I'm waiting
I will worship while I'm waiting
I will serve You while I'm waiting
I will worship while I'm waiting
I will serve You while I'm waiting
I will worship while I'm waiting on You, Lord",
,B00137VPNK,1,1,5,"Recorded by many, none as well as Marty Robbins...he was a master. Voice like crystal...could listen to him all day.",
,B00137VPNK,1,1,5,Only the more mature will even remember this.  It means different things to different people.  My great uncle was reminded of looking out over Pearl Harbor from Hickham Field while the Japanese dropped their bombs.,
,B00137VPNK,1,1,5,"I just thought it might be fun to pick up some of the songs and voices I listened to and loved when I was a kid.  Marty is particularly good at the old ballads but who can forget things like ""White Sports Coat"" and others that weren't specifically ballads. Love it. Thanks",
,B00137V1IO,1,1,5,"Just another song needed to complete a small collection of songs I also wanted, but it was to hard to find.",
,B00137V1IO,1,1,5,"One of the best funk grooves ever produced,a melody that stays in your brain for hours after initial listening ,rock with me!!!",
,B00137VIKU,1,1,5,"He is a singer I grew up with.  I listened to rock and roll, but a voice like his can move you to a little country,",
,B00137VIKU,1,1,5,Make the World go Away is a beautiful song no matter who sings it but Eddy Arnold's vesion is probably one of the best,
,B00137VIKU,1,1,5,I have wonderful memories of this song being played by my parents. My Dad singing and dancing with my Mom!!,
,B00137VB5M,1,1,5,"Johm P kee is such a gifted singer and writer.  I love all his music and this song, Jesus is real is really a good song, it just expresses who Jesus is to me, he is REAL.",
,B00137VB5M,-1,-1,1,It downloaded twice.  I called for credit.  They told me they had issued the credit but when I went to use my account again I notice I had not been issued the credit for this item.,
,B00137VB5M,-1,-1,1,The song was beautiful but it disappeared after purchasing and listening for a couple days.  will not purchase another song like this,
,B00137VB5M,1,1,5,Love this song it is awesome and very True Jesus is real and and He loves us very much you will be blessed by this song and I recommend that everyone have this as a part of their music library.,
,B00137VIKU,1,1,5,Good ballad,
,B00137VIKU,1,1,5,I think there have been times when we would all like to make the world go away. A wonderful song.,
,B00137VIKU,1,1,5,great,
,B00137VIKU,1,1,5,"Oh, how my mother loved this song.",
,B00137VIKU,1,1,4,"MY mothers favorite singer, bought it to remember her!",
,B00137VIKU,1,1,5,"This is an old favorite of mine.  It is an older style of country, more like what I grew up on.",
,B00137VOKO,1,1,5,"A fan of the TV western, Rawhide, this theme song is an unmistakable classic.  A rousing song with clear vocals and fun lyrics, it is an easy one to sing along with.",
,B00137VPKI,1,1,5,Loved it. Which I could get a video of the performance for my collection.,
,B00137VOKO,1,1,5,"What a great reminder of childhood television shows!  Frankie Laine would introduce the show with his heartfelt rendition of ""Rawhide,"" after which Rowdy Yates and company would provide feats of cowboy prowess and logic.  It was so good that Belushi and Akroyd incorporated it into the original Blues Brothers fiilm!",
,B00137VOKO,1,1,5,"Brought back memories from the 1960's TV show.  Rowdy Yates,  Wishbone, & Gill Favor.  Great Song ! ! !  Roll On Rawhide !",
,B00137VOKO,1,1,5,I loved the show and still watch when I find the reruns.  I always enjoyed the song and was glad to add it to mt collection.,
,B00137VO5Y,1,1,5,It is best to go to the original. I was surprised that this remaster was so good. Good enough for a hot time in the city.,
,B00137VO5Y,1,1,5,"brings back alot of memories , its a classic song that will never die , sing along I dare ya , buy it already",
,B00137VO5Y,1,1,4,"Being over 60, I remember so many of these musical groups and I enjoy adding them to my IPod.  Great song.",
,B00137VO5Y,1,1,5,"I was walking south, down Broadway, heading toward the subway, singing this to myself, in July, 2010, when I suddenly stopped and realized it WAS hot town, summer in THE CITY! NYC, to be exact, and, realizing I was EXACTLY where I always thought the song to be about, immediately shouted 'YES!!!' Needless to say, I was pleased, as it was my first trip the New York, and I caught myself! FANtastic!!!",
,B00137V1SY,1,1,5,This modern tune uses repetition to bring out what is True about feelings for someone and how it helps sustain a relationship. Perfect voice for a lesson to be learned.,
,B00137V1SY,1,1,5,I really like this song.  Builds up very cute and playful and I like the bridge :)  Go Jordin :),
,B00137V1SY,-1,-1,2,"When I first heard this song, I was like, Wow! Her vocals were good, and then by the bridge, I was totally into the song. And just for a second, I thought she was better than Blake Lewis. Well, those thoughts quickly passed. Not only was Blake Lewis's debut flat-out amazing and underrated, but due to the meat grinder that is radio, this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road. Today, this song blends right into the radio wasteland.

While her vocals are still good, it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing. I mean really, I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality, but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is.

Overall, if you have been in a cave for the past six months, consider buying this song. But just remember, when you head back for the cave, this song won't be coming with you.",
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,Reminds up how far our sin is from us and God. Great song and reminder.,

,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,I've had this dvd for awhile and am happy that I can now take them anywhere with me.  They were the first Christian rock band that I actually bought. East to west is a very moving sing.  Lyrics do it for me all the time,
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,"GOD will forgive your sins as far as the east is from the west, because there is no end in ether direction. awesome!!!",
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,Love it,
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,I love this. It  shows the fact that God's limits have no bounds concerning those who love Him.,
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,GREAT SINGLE.,
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,"The beauty of this song is in the title. ""Jesus can you show me how far the East is from the West? From one scarred hand to the other."" The Lord's love is shown through his death on the cross and is signified by His outstretched arms and the scars from the nails in His hands. His love reaches the ends of the earth. Great song.",
,B00137VCQK,1,1,4,"Effective therapy for restlessness during spiritual battles; learn to forgive and let go of the past, while relaxing to the piano and electric guitar, contemplating the vital truths within this song.",
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,This song was great. They are simple but powerful. I think people should at least listen to a good Christian band,
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,Such a great CD and a wonderful Song.  I was so happy to download this song to my phone!  Love it!,
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,"This song I recommend to everyone, it is so awesome, to know how a song can help you to understand.",

,B00137VYM2,1,1,5,Love this song!,
,B00137VYM2,1,1,5,What an iconic tune,
,B00137VYM2,1,1,5,This is a classic Jazz song that has always been popular in older movies. I never knew which orchestra this was from until I was able to hear it on Xm radio. I highly recommend this piece to someone who is interested in popular jazz. This is one of Benny Goodman's best.,
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,"Love the lyrics, and they are scriptured based...so makes so much more enjoyable. Really adore this group. Highly recommend. Easy download to kindle.",
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,"This song is a wonderful reminder of how much Jesus loves his children. Would recommend it to everyone, especially those who don't feel loved.",

,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,"Another awe inspiring song.  I can never tire of hearing songs such as this, gives me that little lift I sometimes need in this worl today.",
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,"Excellantlly produced. Takes me to the cross and the great sacrifice Jesus made just for me, and His continual GRACE that has endured throughout my lifetime.",
,B00137VCQK,1,1,5,This is a beautiful reminder of the sacrifice that was made for all and a reminder that even the occasional doubt that we all feel can't change it.  Truly warms the heart and draws us back where we need to be.,
,B00137VYM2,1,1,5,This is 8 minutes and 43 seconds of foot-stomping joy if...You like swing jazz or had a heartbeat during the fifties.,
,B00137VYM2,1,1,5,"The most joyous of big band swing, with hooks, rhythms, and personality galore.  HOWEVER, it's the Live at Carnegie Hall version where Krupa bangs the heck out of those off-beats.  Sound level is a little low.",
,B00137VYM2,1,1,5,Love the beat and all of the instruments. It's my favorite Jazz song of all time next to Take Five by Dave Brubeck.,
,B00137VYM2,1,1,5,"I love music.  And while this was a bit before my time, I really love Benny Goodman.  He was really rockin' before ""rockin'"" became a thing.  This tune is fun and energetic.  You can't go wrong with Sing, Sing, Sing.  Even the chicken version (look it up - there really is one) is fun.",
,B00137VYM2,1,1,5,This is one of the best tunes which came out of WW II.  I drive young kids crazy by playing it as loud as I can where ever I am.,
,B00137VSMS,1,1,4,"Great songs from a band that wrote one of the best songs of the 80's. I am a big fan of the music from the 80's (not all of them were great, but a lot of them were) and this is one of those songs that I enjoy listening to this song after all these years.",
,B00137VR8I,1,1,5,"This is one of the many reasons I love his music. Great tune, good memories of the days gone by. This is feel good, rockin-down-the-highway tunes.",

,B00137VSMS,1,1,5,great 80's song for your 80's library if you are building one or are planning to build one,
,B00137VSMS,1,1,5,Brought back a lot of memories.,
,B00137VSMS,1,1,5,"I knew the words after hearing the first couple of times when it first came out, only I didn't know what ""kyrie"" was until I heard an interview on the radio what it meant. ""Kyrie elison""  means ""lord have mercy""",
,B00137VSMS,1,1,5,"I just purchased this song (""Kyrie"" by Mr. Mister) as a digital download, and I am very glad that I did. The Mp3 sounds very nice and I could not be more pleased with it.",

,B00137VSMS,1,1,5,"This is one of those songs you'll never understand the words to -- not that they're mumbled, it's just that some of the key words are not in English.  But the piece is beautifully arranged and sung.  One of those haunting classics that just sticks with you.",
,B00137VSMS,1,1,4,"Always like the song, reminds me of high school, grabbed it from Amazon as an .mp3 popped it into my play list and once in a while, I get a great flash back to the 80's.",
,B00137VSMS,1,1,5,I lost my original copy of this years ago and couldn't find it in stores but here it is. This was wonderful and brought back many memories.,
,B00137VQGG,1,1,5,Great Song,
,B00137VQGG,1,1,5,"I love the Lovin' Spoonful, whose music brings back a lot of memories from the late 1960s. This is one of my favorite of their songs.",
,B00137VQGG,-1,-1,1,I didn't want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase.,
,B00137VQGG,1,1,5,"History has tended to dismiss the Spoonful as ersatz Beatles, but let's not forget that these guys were ***Americans*** (well, maybe with a Canadian or two), and even a casual listen will reveal that they were hardly Beatle copyists. An apt description of their whole sound and feel would be ""sunny"". Great singing, great playing, great songs from John Sebastian. After their third album, they started to flounder a bit, and when original lead guitarist Zal Yanovsky left, it was really all over, but in their earliest phase this crew were definitely in the contender category, as illustrated by their handful of eternal radio hits such as this one.",
,B00137VQGG,1,1,5,Love my oldies!,
,B00137VQGG,1,1,5,"Always good to hear oldies! The sound is good and the memories the song brought about were sweet!  The download was smooth, too.",

,B00137VQGG,1,1,5,This is a good version of this classic. It sounded just like the original on the 45 in the ole days. I would recommend it.,
,B00137VGKC,1,1,5,This is a song i grew up with long ago and has a great beat and puts you in a better place.,
,B00137VGKC,1,1,4,"always loved this one, great memories! Its Tony Orlando and Dawn how can you go wrong?  I mean its great.",
,B00137VGKC,1,1,5,"I loved this song when it first came out, and I still love hearing it now.  I thought the group had such a beautiful sound, soul with a touch of a Latin flavor in their style.  Wonderful, just wonderful.",
,B00137VGKC,1,1,5,This is diffenitly a classic for me and fills out my music libary.  I love the sound of this group.  A little old but a classic.,

,B00137VC1A,1,1,5,I think Hezekiah Walker did a great job with this piece.,
,B00137VC1A,1,1,5,When played I realize just how grateful I really am,
,B00137VC1A,1,1,5,A wonderful song that will lead you into the Presence of the Lord.,

,B00137VC1A,1,1,5,Great Song. It is so amazing to me  that I was able to go to Amazon and find every song I needed in that one place.,
,B00137VC1A,1,1,5,"I miss the late 80s and 90s when a good, soul-stirring, annointed praise and worship song was always on the air. This song is in line with the greats. It's message is simple and so is the delivery. It's not overdone. It's powerful, and if you're really grateful then it will echo the thoughts of your heart and soul.

,B00137WTTO,1,1,5,This song is one of best examples of Mariah Carey's vocal range.  This is a song I can listen to over and over and has addicting rhythm.,
,B00137WTTO,1,1,5,"I knew this girl and song would be bigger than any singer ever was when I first heard it back in the 80's. I called kiss fm in
L.A and asked where I could buy the album, but it had not been released yet. Mariah is the mother of vocal runs. Best song ever",
,B00137VZC6,1,1,5,Remember when you where a kid and love Roy Rodgers and Jean Autry.  Maybe not but those that do remember hearing songs like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and of course Peter Cottontail.  What a laugh but so much fun to have the grand kids to listen to and see there expressions on such a silly song that we once loved as kids.  As a down load to you music devise is highly recommended.,

,B00137VS8W,1,1,5,"Brilliant and haunting, ""Seven Year Ache"" will resonate with anyone who's ever gone to a 10 year reunion and met an old lover. It suffers only from a low budget production and desperately needs to be re-mastered. One of her best.",
,B00137VS8W,1,1,5,When I first heard this song I had not been married long.  It's a catchy tune about that mythical 7 year ache/itch.,
,B00137VS8W,1,1,5,"Found this one by accident, it was cool. One I really like her voice, hear, not so flooding twingy as of today's country's music. Seems they all came from Texas, and have nasal problems. Why oh why!!! Just a good old country song. To bring back the feeling of how u felt growing up and liking boys.

,B00137WS2C,1,1,5,I was a fan of Bonnie Tyler and it was great to see her have some success in the US first with Total Eclipse of the Heart and then Holding Out for a Hero. She has a unique voice and her songs make me think of her as the female Meatloaf.,

,B00137X358,1,1,5,"Absolutely love this song,  Mary J. & Wyclef together...Yeah",
,B00137X358,1,1,5,"I was introduced to this artist by my girlfriend.  She told me that since I did not have anything new by Bob Marley, Wyclef was his ready replacement.  This is a teasing song that has the hint of Caribbean song style caught in a New York backdrop.  What that means.  Ever since he introduced Shakira to R&B hip hop Wyclef in my opinion is a can't miss artist.",
,B00137X358,1,1,5,Good quality recording of  an old favorite from the 90's. And it's cheap enough so I can replace my scratched CD.,
,B00137X358,1,1,5,"I always loved the video with wy and mary j.
It was good and intense.
This is good music when you have a long drive or a work out at the gym.

Love the beat",
,B00137WU98,1,1,5,Great praise song.  Very prayerful with a lot of feeling.  Not a heavy beat.  It is very worshipful and meaningful.,
,B00137WU98,1,1,5,I am a fan of MercyMe. This is by far my favorite song! It is a wonderful worship song. I highly recommend it!,
,B00137WU98,1,1,5,"Already down loaded another version of this classic song.  Word of God Speak, and make me be more patient and kind and loving to the people around me.",
,B00137WU98,1,1,5,I find I tend to be more open and receptive to the Holy Spirit and where God needs me to be when I play this song.,
,B00137WU98,1,1,5,"I love this song the quiality is great,adn I enjoy putting it on my own personailized cd. I would recomend this way of purchasing",
,B00137WU98,1,1,5,"This song touches my heart deeply whenever I hear it, and I find myself in tears whenever I listen to it.",
,B00137X5Q0,-1,-1,3,"I wonder, is there such a thing as TOO tight...as far as music goes?  Man,
I don't think I've ever heard such a mechanical sounding background to an otherwise decent song and excellent vocals.  Jordin has such a beautiful voice, and she sings this song so well, it's too bad that every other aspect of this song has no human element whatsoever.

The parts that have that electronic kick drum sound firing off in rapid succession really take the cake (and drive me up a wall).  Every part of the music is so 'perfect', I mean there's not one note even slightly out of place.

In her future recordings, I hope she strays away from these types of songs, even if they happen to be the 'in' thing right now, because she has too good of a voice to waste it on any thing other than beautiful, emotional, human music.",
,B00137X5Q0,1,1,5,"even though this is not my favorite song on the album (I just absolutely love the ballads), I think Jordin does it very well.  To me it is way up there with some of Michael Jackson's earlier songs.",
,B00137X5Q0,1,1,5,"This song has an easy to listen to sound that I like. It's an enjoyable song I find myself singing along with. What can I say - I like it, and I like her voice. Good job Jordin.",
,B00137X5Q0,-1,-1,3,"When it comes down to the hopeful winners from American Idol, they've all recently made songs that just don't feel like they are songs that are definitive, which is very sad. For Jordin Sparks, she really needs to show that she can be more than just a singer, rather than just a mixed bag. Her latest single, One Step At A Time, the third single from her self-titled debut album, really doesn't feel like it is all inspiration. It just feels like words that just don't completely carry heart, unlike other recent R&B songs, like Alicia Keys with her hit Superwoman. While One Step At A Time does have a nice beat, it isn't enough to show that you walking in rhythm to the song. I think there needs to be better songs for Jordin to record, but there not really there one note at a time.

Song: C",
,B00137VGXY,1,1,5,this song reminds me of my Dad he always took and stand and stuck with it. so I naturally will share that with my Son. no gray area in this song stand for it on solid ground.,

,B00137X5Q0,1,1,4,"This song is fun and loaded with energy! It can really help you be reminded too
slow down and remember to take only one step at a time, and don't stress out over
things you cannot control. :)",

,B00137X27M,1,1,5,"Such a talented artist/singer and whos lyrics send all the memories back of the first love in my life, not a crush (love). I guess we never forget that first love, I assume they don't go away even after 24 years. I just melted when I knew I loved him, it might have started out as a crush but I never said anything. We were more friends than anything. 1 day out of the blue it was more than a crush. Even after all these years and going seperate ways.... deep down that love is still there. If only I could Breathe Again. Beautiful Toni",

,B00137VDYG,1,1,5,"Lest we forget, Andy Williams was a major force in American popular music for nearly two decades. From 1956 through 1974, he placed over 40 singles on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles chart. Eight of these tunes made their way into the Billboard Top Ten. During those same years, Williams was a dominent force on the Album charts as well. He placed nearly 30 albums in the Top 100 and many of these albums remained on the charts for a year or more! Andy Williams was also the host of his own highly rated variety show on NBC for nearly a decade. You might be surprised to learn that ""Moon River"" was never released as a single. Rather it appeared on Williams' phenomenally successful 1962 album ""Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes"" which remained on the Billboard Album charts for an amazing 176 weeks. ""Moon River"" would become Andy William's signature tune. He sang the first few bars of the song each week to open his TV show and decades later would name his theater in Branson, MO after it. Here's to one of the greatest and most popular ""easy listening"" recordings of all-time!",

Aerosmith is one of the best bands around, but they have had a lot of practice. I do like more of there older music than new, especially with this song. This song is a must have for any Rock n Roll head. It is truly one of my favs., Steven Tyler ROX it.

,B00137VDYG,1,1,5,"This is a very good song, and Andy Williams strong performance of it, with his soothing voice, make it a joy to listen to.",
,B00137VDYG,1,1,5,"This is my all time favorite song, it takes me somewhere every time I hear it.  I have several versions of this song, but there is something about Andy Williams and how he sings it.",
,B00137X7BS,1,1,5,Heard this song on Spotify.  Love it and came to Amazon to buy it.  Great song,
,B00137X7BS,1,1,5,great singing,
,B00137X7BS,1,1,5,great old school jam,
,B00137X7BS,1,1,5,"This is such a beautiful, tender song about having found love in a most unexpected place when you felt as if there was no love.",
,B00137X6ZA,1,1,5,One of the best songs to come out of the 80's. I like the German version only slightly better than the English version. It's most definitely a fun song to dance to.,
,B00137X6ZA,1,1,4,"I have very few 80s favorites, and this is definitely one of them.  Maybe it's the German lyrics.",
,B00137X20E,1,1,4,"Even when they're up against the wall.""

I must admit that I dismissed this because I was tired of Brit. I was sick of seeing her everywhere and the life that she has led recently has been. Well you know about that!

But this is on the song. The product. To be fair.

It's catchy. And you wanna move. If you don't, you're thinking about it, or you're one of the few that it will have little to no effect on.

It's nothing deep but it's fun. And some people will indeed dance to it. The beat is memorable. But don't expect the old ""I'm not a girl/Hit me baby, one more time Britney...""

The sounds here are more synthesized.

I'm not afraid to say that if someone lent this to me (the album) I'd review it honestly.

I was one of those quick to hate it because it was her. But I'm glad she's trying to recover (in life).

3.9 stars.

end note: Her voice is essentially the same. BUT ON THE ALBUM, there are electronic workings so it doesn't sound like the Brit from her 2001 album, and prior. But the single is still damn catchy.",
,B00137X6ZA,1,1,5,Wish she would have released more in the U.S.,
,B00137X6ZA,1,1,5,I LOVE THIS SONG,
,B00137X6ZA,1,1,4,"Have found no problems,  though it does get old.",

,B00137X9O8,1,1,5,"Hard to believe that Whitney Houston would have been 50, but her legacy is just as immortal today, as it was when she first stepped onto the stage. All of her songs still ignite whether it is in the films, or when was on the stage. That is definitely the case with the music from The Preacher's Wife, and her rendition of I Believe In You & Me. Her cover of The Four Tops classic is still just as definitive today, as when it came out in the mid 90's. For her to follow up what she did with I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard was difficult, but the song is still a classic. I love her song from The Preacher's Wife, not just because it is classic Whitney, but still is just as soft as a newborn baby's smile. This is definitely a great download for any die hard Whitney Houston fan.

Whitney Houston 1963-2012: The Voice will always be loved.

Song: A-",

Listened to some previews of the other songs but this is the only one I really liked",
,B00137X70E,1,1,5,"Some people seem to have the idea that an workout song as to be driving...pounding.  But for me the best songs for working out/running are the ones that have the right cadence, the right rhythm.  ""Sunny Came Home"" has that for me.

My most comfortable running pace matches music that plays at 84 beats per minute.  Simply said, that's what this song has.  It's actually relaxing to me to have calm music in my running mixes.  After all, I'm not super competitive, and when I run I listen to my body, the road, and music.  ""Sunny Came Home"" is a great addition to my running mix.

5 stars",

I would recommend this album to anyone who is looking for Classic Rock Music from the 1970s/1980s!!!.",

I remember in 1989 when this song came out I thought the radio station I listened to would wear it out playing it all the time. The reason why I like this song is because it's not to hard rock or too pop, it's perfect. It has a great message and one you can play just about everywhere. I recommend this song too anybody even if your not a fan of Alice Cooper this song ROX. BTW another one of his I like is the song he did for Friday the 13th, Red Hot Summer, these two songs are is best.

,B00137Z4G4,1,1,5,"We called her ""Miss Champagne"" because her voice had the infectious quality and heady effects of a  bottle of Dom Perignon!!!!  Shame was her real claim to fame but she had other great songs as well.  If you only buy one record of hers, this 12"" version is not to be missed.  A song about a woman obsessed with a ""bad"" man whom her mother warns her about, but to no avail.  She is enthralled with him anyway, even though it's a ""shame"" the way he does her.  Buy this one or you will miss one of the True classics of the dance era, the late 1970's!!!!",

,B00137Z22A,1,1,5,"Sly and The Family Stone could be best described as an interracial psychedelic soul group from San Francisco. Before deciding to form his own group in 1966 Sylvester Sly Stone Stewart (lead singer, keyboards) had been producing records for other people including Bobby Freeman and the Beau Brummels. During the late 60s and early 70s the group would have 5 Top Ten hits three of which went all the way to #1. But my personal favorite was the breezy 1969 hit Hot Fun In The Summertime.

,B00137Z22A,-1,-1,1,It didn't download but I was sure charged for it! I've had that problem with other downloads on Amazon. I refuse to buy any more.,
,B00137Z22A,1,1,5,"I borrowed the title to this review from The Drive (WDRV and wdrv.com for Internet radio listeners) who recently did a Top Ten Summertime songs list and included this song. I've been thinking about adding this song to my collection of '60s and '70s songs for a while, so I'm glad I finally did. Great song with a happy, upbeat melody and message.",
,B00137Z22A,1,1,5,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.,
,B00137Y99W,1,1,5,"This is just a sentimental favorite and I love that he sings it less than perfect and that the lyrics are corney, but we sing them anyway and we want to dance in the dark in the kitchen instead of sitting down to supper.  Maybe it's just me, and something that was going on when the song came out.  Hell I'm not really a country fan, but this is an identifiable lyric  and fun becasue we all hope we have that little secret and it's still why you stop to dance as lovers in the kitchen/ and  the composition was well thought out, that piano is the hook, just enough honkytonk blues to get you to buy in...",
,B00137YP1E,1,1,5,"One of the best songs on this album
A beautiful love song, can stand toe to toe up to his new  XSCAPE love songs.",
,B00137YVA4,1,1,5,Best quick buy for my MP3!,

,B00137YP1E,1,1,5,i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio stations coming out of chicago. when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which as far as im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever,
,B00137YP1E,1,1,5,"While the ladies are no longer together, I will forever be grateful, as we all will be, for Natalie Stewart, a.k.a. The Floacist, and Marsha Ambrosius, a.k.a. The Songstress, for putting this in the more than capable hands of Michael Jackson. ""Butterflies."" He put it down on this one and forever and always, we will have the instrument to express ourselves to the special someone when we feel, ~Butterflies~ If you cannot get your nerves together, just press play & allow Mike to help you along. It is always a good thing when the teacher can show the student the right way to get it done. Just be willing to ask. ~K.I.S.S~",
,B00137YP1E,1,1,5,"There are so many MJ songs that I love, and this one right here, makes me stop and just think about life.",
,B00137YP1E,1,1,5,I love this song and played it all the time on my iPod.  I recommend it for anyone who loves music.,
,B00137YP1E,1,1,5,"This song truly defines what love is suppose to be about when you really and truly love someone. Michael Jackson is not here with us any longer,  But I just want to thank God for anointing him with the talent and abilities and that he blessed us for just a brief moment in time to have him in our lives.  Well done God's anointed son and you are resting safely in the arms of the Lord.",
,B00137YP1E,1,1,5,"the all time 1st song! Meaning this song should be played when you're meeting someone you like for the first time. I  just wish I could have the same scenario. When I meet someone I like for the first time, I may have butterflies but I could swear he looks like he has gas!",
,B00137Z0RW,1,1,5,This is another back in the day good song which still has meaning as of today and forever will. FANTASTIC.,
,B00137VWX8,1,1,4,"The Ultimate Sin is a bit tame for Ozzy and so is this song.  It has a good rhythm and is a relatively easily listening song, but it lacks the head banging thump that one may be accustomed to.  Ozzy is a brilliant artist who never ceases to create the best in Metal music, and this song is definitely worth listening to.",
,B00137VWX8,1,1,5,"Its Ozzy.  Does anything else need to be said?

not one of his harder songs, but its pretty freaking good...",
,B00137VWX8,1,1,5,"I have to say Ozzy has gotten better with age, not only did he chill out a lot but his music has become so much better. I starting liking him when he left Black Sabbath, that group was to rough for me. This song Shot in the Dark has it all a tough edge with great lyrics. After all these years this so from 86 has rolled with the times. It is such a great song to listen too, and the lyrics are amazing. If you have never heard of it just listen to the sample Amazon has, U will love it. This song is great not only to fans of rock but to everyone who loves great music.
THX,
Kris L. CocKayne",
,B00137ZGNU,1,1,5,"I like this song because it reminds me of when you're
alone or going through a rough patch in your life.
It's like the song is saying that no matter what
your True friends and family stand by your side.",
,B00137ZGNU,1,1,5,"A favorite tune from college. It still stands up today. This is the signature tune of a great ""southern rock"" artist.",
,B00137ZGNU,1,1,5,"Great song by JD Souther, who is better known for his writing ability with the Eagles.",
,B00137ZGNU,1,1,5,One of my favorite Souther tunes.  If you're a Souther fan this is a must have,
,B00137ZGNU,1,1,5,Great song; Souther hung with the Eagles some but never had their commercial success.,
,B00137ZGNU,1,1,5,Here is a good song by J D Souther. His voice sounds like Roy Orbison a little bit. He is a very good singer and this is a great song to slow dance to. it is mellow and an easy listening song. A great song to buy. Sandra K,
,B00137ZGT4,1,1,5,why you can't trust people. Even the ones you love. All the world should hear it. that's all I got.,
,B00137ZENW,1,1,5,"""RESTLESS HEART"" along with :POCO"" and many other Country/Rock bands of the 1970s/1980s seemed to influence quite a-few other bands such as ""THE ATLANTA RHYTHM SECTION"" and many others, to go ahead and bring their Country-Rock sound to the Music industry, which wound up working wonders for the music industry as such bands as "".38 SPECIAL"" were able to bring their Country-Rock sound to a wide population of fans, without the fear of being totally rejected by music fans!!!.",
,B00137ZENW,1,1,4,"When it came down Restless Heart, they've been onr of the deepest guilty pleasures in country music in the 80's and 90's. While the groups' career has dwindled in the past several years, it still can be just as intimate as when they came alive during that time. It has been 25 years since their debut single I'll Still Be Loving You from their first record, Wheels, which is a part of their 1998 greatest hits record. The song still sounds just as intimate and down to Earth, as it did back 25 years ago. It is a great have your MP3 library if you've been one all these years, or you're new to Restless Heart's music, and just very tired of the overplayed dance acts from Lady Gaga & Beyonce'.

Song: B+",
,B00137Z6XK,1,1,5,it sounds great and I love it.,
,B00137Z6XK,1,1,4,I remembered this song from back in the 90s and reached back to get it...love the lyrics.  I know this is like 1 of 2 hits from the artist but hope a come back is in the near future so we all can experience some good old fashion R&B slow jams.,
,B00137YV9A,1,1,5,"Good tune, but i've noticed most of Johnny Cash's songs are excellent, and it's so nice to hear him paired up with so much duet talent.....",
,B00137YV9A,1,1,5,This song was perfect in the movie and it's just a good listening at home.  In the theater I thought it was Dylan and Cash but it seemed such an improbable pairing that I wasn't sure.  When I later checked the date I was astounded.  Really beautiful.,
,B00137YV9A,1,1,4,give it 4 because I like this song!,
,B00137YV9A,1,1,5,A very cool song.,
,B00137YV9A,1,1,5,Great song/music that I had forgotten about until I saw the movie Silver Linings Playbook.  Both are great!,

,B00137ZGW6,1,1,5,"Well as Phil would say, ""HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY"" that pretty much sums it up for me !!! really great to have.",
,B00137ZGW6,1,1,4,This product is as advertised. Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed. Would recommend it to others.,
,B00137ZGW6,1,1,5,"I purchased this MP3 and downloaded the music into my computer and found that the quality of the sound was incredible and the price was within my budget. I gave this song a FIVE STAR rating! Thanks Amazon for the great service and ease of the transaction in whole.

,B00137ZGW6,1,1,5,"Sugary sweet 80s pop music never sounded so good. Funny, I never liked these types of songs back then, bu now they have a nostalgic place in my heart.",
,B00137ZGW6,1,1,5,This is diffenitly a classic for me and fills out my music libary.  I love the sound of this singer.  A little old but a classic.,

,B00137Z48C,1,1,5,Another classic,
,B00137Z48C,1,1,5,Great hit song,
,B00137Z48C,1,1,5,"This is in my opinion a classic song from when rock music was Great, Angry Eyes was released in 1972 a time (the mid 1960's to the mid 1970's) rock music was at its apex, a time of great experimentation and pushing the envelope.
Angry Eyes is (again) in my opinion Loggins and Messina best song. Loggins and Messina are best know for their (bubblegum) aka pop music such as ""Your Mama can't dance"" but here with Angry Eyes they take a turn to adult music and it shows they were more than capable of doing serious music.
I love this song it harkens back to my days as a Flower Child living in San Francisco. I miss those days and I miss the music.",
,B00137Z48C,1,1,5,"Back when a time for rock and roll was great.  This is one of my all time favorite classics.  The long version from the original album with the extra bass, sax, and flute brings back fond memories.",
,B00137Z48C,1,1,5,"The bass line and the sax is what makes this song great, the short version is just so-so, but the album version has soul.",

,B00137ZGW6,1,1,4,Very danceable.,
,B00137ZGW6,1,1,5,My wife loves this song,
,B00137ZGW6,1,1,5,"This delicious fast-dance love song evokes emotions from
friendly wedding receptions to disco nights when all you had on your mind was
dancing with your best partner. . It's the perfect lead-in to Donna Summer's
Last Dance, at the end of a night of jamming with friends. . You might want
to play it 5 percent slow, DJs. . Enjoy!!!",

My THX to Red-Wilder-Blue for telling me how they did echos on there songs ""WITHOUT"" electronics .- Sing a  beat late! It's a shame their CD never made it but check out Darkness, Darkness on You Tube by them!!!",
,B0013803HS,1,1,5,"I didn't research this song, but the lead singer sounds just like Rare Earth's drummer/singer (Peter Rivera), on the song ""I Just Want to Celebrate,"" which I have on my Amazon cloud player. I believe the guitarist who can do a spot-on imitation of Jimi Hendrix (Randy California) played in this group. A great song with a groovy, '60s sound and vibe :) *I know Randy California played the guitar in this group, but I was thinking of the guitarist Randy Hansen who does a spot-on impersonation of Jimi Hendrix. I was watching YouTube and stumbled upon a couple of videos of Randy playing Jimi Hendrix songs note for note.",

It's been nine years since my body failed me. And I've long since pushed away my friends years ago because I couldn't bear to have them see me so crippled and broken.

But I got a second chance. And now I'm taking back my life with every shred of me that's left.

Yeah. I know the words don't match up with my story. But the music and something in her voice seems to say it anyway.",
,B00137ZQ0I,1,1,5,"I am sure Christina has heard this before she  is beautiful both inside and out. I am  in my 50's but I love  all kinds  of  music

,B00137ZQ0I,1,1,5,I think this was a song full of emotion.  The range and movement of this song is what makes it so amazing.  Not too much but not too little...This song is perfect for the performer and the listener.,
,B00137ZQ0I,1,1,5,"--words by Linda Perry and sung here by Christina Aguilera

""Beautiful"" is one of the most exquisite, uplifting and moving songs I've ever heard. Christina Aguilera handles this song by Linda Perry wonderfully; she sings the lyrics with genuine passion and that's grand.

The musical arrangement, especially with that cello, fits in perfectly with Christina's vocals.

The message of the song is that anyone struggling with a lack of self-esteem should remember that inner beauty counts for quite a lot and that other people's criticism and lack of respect for someone should be ignored as long as they're a good person on the inside.

I highly recommend this song. It's one of Christina Aguilera's best songs ever; just one listen proves it!",

The song to, before the film Zodiac, was a cool, heavy rock song by Donovan because of the heavily distorted electric guitar, loud strumming on an acoustic guitar, and driving drums played by John Bonham and Jim Cattini.

,B001382L6O,1,1,5,"I wouldn't normally even try a Christian band, but this song is interesting, lively, and beautifully put together.  Not a traditional 'carol' but certainly about the Christmas story.  I really enjoyed it, and I'll to check out this band's other work.  Thanks!",
,B001382L6O,1,1,5,"I had never heard this song before.  It is refreshing to hear a completely new Christmas song.  Two vocalists trade off on this piece (female and male), accompanied by guitar, drum, strings orchestration, and clarinet here and there (I believe).  There's also an blues-style electric organ in the background.

The rhythm is good and pretty evenly paced throughout.  Interesting mix of classical strings, acoustic guitar, blues electric organ and a jazzy clarinet. Each providing a light touch of different genres. Who would have thought of putting this all together and that it would blend well. I like the voices, the male voice is baritone and has a slightly rough edge that is an interesting contrast to his female counterpart (and doesn't sound like all the other male voices I've heard). This could easily have been a non-Christmas piece.

If you like country, or blues and/or light rock, I think you would enjoy this a lot.",
,B001380NW8,1,1,5,"I like this song because it talks about repentance. One of the verses goes :

Let Thy goodness like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to thee.
Prone to wander Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love.
Here's my heart
Oh take and seal it.
Seal it for thy courts above.""

,B001386SW2,1,1,5,"There's something about David Essex's iconic single, ""Rock On."" Every time I hear it, I feel like I'm 19 years old again, fronting a killer rock and roll band. Even though we never performed the song, it's just the vibe, the attitude, the mood that it brings; I'm not sure if it's the bass line, the double tracked and echoed vocals, or the lyrics...

...oh, yeah. It's ALL of those things.

Rock on.",
,B001386SW2,1,1,4,I really purchased this for the title song but found others I enjoyed as well. A great addition to my hard drive in the car as well as a good aerobic workout.,
,B001386SW2,1,1,5,"I'm not a David Essex fan, but ""Rock On"" is amazing.

It sold one million copies. That's no surprise. From its bass line to lyrics that capture teenage life, ""Rock On"" is quintessential 1970s rock. Essex gets it done, though, with references to James Dean, blue suede shoes and other 1950s symbols.

Sing along.

""Hey kid, rock and roll
Rock on, ooh, my soul
Hey kid, boogey too, did ya.""

I fully recommend this song.

,B00138B1F6,1,1,5,"I am a new fan of Mercy Me. I originally heard I Can Only Imagine and fell in love with the lead singers voice. I heard God With Us on TBN and absolutely loved it. Emmanuel God With Us what an inspiring message. We often take for granted the presence of God in our life. With lyrics like ""Such a tiny offering compared to Calvary"" makes this song so relative. What a blessing to know that God is always with us. I would recommend this song to everyone. Great, great song.",

,B00138CSUS,1,1,5,Ozzy Osbourne is one of the best artists of all time. He has influenced many hard rock and metal bands today. This collection contains mainly his radio hits. I just got this collection to satisfy my desire for some Ozzy in my cd collection of over 300 cds. I like every single song in this collection. One thing I love about Ozzy is that he takes time to write every album. You really can not go wrong by buying this collection if you are a hard rock or metal fan. One thing to note isthis collection does not contain music from Black Sabbath. You get a live version of Paranoid which is very cool though.,
,B00138D2AI,1,1,5,"This is probably the definitive Jim Nabors best one. It the most common and a good solid collection for Jim's music. Including some of his biggest hits like the impossible that he made famous on a episode of Gomer Pyle. But it goes way beyond that to gather up some of his strongest performances. Time for Us, Love You with All of my Heart,  My Cup Runneth over, Sunrise Sunset. They are all classic performance and a strong collection if his Columbia records material. His voice is strong and powerful and this collects together a few of his religious songs. 16 most requested is a great collection. The packaging is basic but there are nice liner notes. All of the recordings are the original version and the sound quality is superb.",
,B00138D2AI,1,1,5,"Jim Nabors has a fantastic classic baritone voice. With this CD and with The Best of Jim Nabors, I think I have a True ""Best of"" collection. The only songs overlapping are The Impossible Dream, The Lord's Prayer, You'll Never Walk Alone, Try to Remember, My Cup Runneth Over, and Sunrise, Sunset and I don't mind hearing those four a couple of times.

The Impossible Dream is such a moving song and it is handled beautifully here. Somewhere, My Love is another floating song that with Jim Nabors singing the powerful waltz beat becomes less of a trite jangle.

Other favorites are Love Is Blue and Jean.

I think if you enjoy older songs and a strong male voice, you might like this CD. For people thinking about Jordan Smith fans and wondering what else they might like, this might be a good choice if they don't mind classic older songs.",

,B00138CX5S,1,1,5,"While this marks the second remastering and repackaging of Santana's debut, this two-disc set is worth the price of admission.  Originally released in August of 1969,the same month as their stunning performance at Woodstock, Santana released one of the strongest albums of their thirty-year-plus career. But while their debut was a wonderful collection of terrific songs--""Evil Ways, ""Jingo,"" ""Persuasion""--they were an even better live band.

The 1998 reissue featured three of their songs from Woodstock, including the 11:49 gem ""Soul Sacrifice.""  This 2004 Legacy edition includes their entire Woodstock set (with the exception of ""Evil Ways""), adding four more songs:  ""Waiting,"" ""You Just Don't Care, ""Jingo"" and ""Persuasion.""

Additional material on the bonus disc are studio sessions of songs like ""Soul Sacrifice"" and """"Persuasion"" that were recorded before drummer Michael Shrieve and percussionist Joe Areas were brought into the band, revealing compelling but alternate performances of these songs.

Even if you already own the 1998 remaster, this is the definitive release.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",
,B00138CX5S,1,1,5,"If you like the early first 3 albums by Santana, this is definitely the 2 CD set to get--the 1st album is remastered very clearly, the jam sessions are very clear, it shows you what the early band was like without Mike Shrieve as drummer just before it recorded the 1st album. You really can tell the difference--Mike Shrieve was and still is a supurb drummer and made Santana rock out.  The booklet included with this is great with alot of comments from Greg Rolie, the original keyboardist and singer.  The whole Woodstock concert is here--remastered perfectly and very clear with an added unknown song at the end of the set.  The practice sessions before the actual album recording were great-extended songs --sounds great!!!  I highly recommend this 2 CD set for any Santana fan or collector--it is definitely worth it.  Rock on with sixties rock--SF style!!!!!!!!",
,B00138CX5S,1,1,4,An early Santana with some of the best guitar instrumental and percussion that Santana is famous for.,

,B00138CX5S,1,1,5,"I read reviews in the Santana Woodstock column and reviewers said this is a better version. They where right. I have had all original versions of this iconic album LP, cassette, and CD. The sound quality in this 2004 CD is better then all my previous versions, of course my equipment is better also. The original album, liner notes, outtakes, Woodstock recordings are all great. Stereo (Right/Left-Sub) only.
Glad I have it and the value is great.",
,B00138CX5S,1,1,5,"Could be the greatest debut album ever from anyone.  Soul Sacrifice is among the greatest songs ever performed!  Persuasion, Shades of Time and You Just Don't Care are not that great (but very good), but all the rest is over-the-top awesome!!  This was revolutionary stuff at the time.  Get this, Abraxas and Santana (III) and you have some of the greatest music ever recorded!",
,B00138CX5S,1,1,5,"Santana's first album was released around the time the band was taking no prisoners at Woodstock in August 1969. The album, while not quite up to Abraxas (for me), is still great. The album includes many songs that would become classics for the band like Evil Ways, Jingo and Soul Sacrifice. The Legacy edition surpasses the sound quality on the original cd issue as well as including some cool studio outtakes. The album also includes almost all of the band's performance from Woodstock. As with all early Santana albums, this one features a wonderful mix of styles and is a must own.",
,B00138CX5S,1,1,5,I had this album long ago on vinyl - never got around to buying it on CD until the Deluxe / Expanded version came out.  This is a great album.  Certainly if you love the music from the late '60's you will both remember and enjoy this set.  The alternative tracks / demo's and live tracks are a nice addition.  Amazing music!,
,B00138D4YW,1,1,5,"No matter who backed him up,Miles always played in
his own way and one could always tell it was him. The trio of songs that begin the album-the tital cut,""Robot 415"" and
""Code M.D."" are pulsing electro-funk hip/hop numbers that stand as the beginnings of jazz-hop and are therefore a precurser to what Gang Starr and Digable planets would be doing a decade
later.""What Is It"" and ""That's What Happened"" are organic,white-
hot,live-in-the-studio jams where Miles blows like a siren. The
moody ""Freaky Deaky"" and ""That's Right"" add enough change of pace
to make this one of Mile's better 80's albums by far!",
,B00138D4YW,1,1,5,this for me is Miles Davis Last Funky all out ALbum.the grooves here work. Him&Bradford Marsalis is something special. Robert Irvings Synth&Programming work.they aren't over the top like alot of 80's style  of Material. What it is&Freaky Deaky really stand out. Aruguable the best  group he had on Record during the 80's.,
,B00138D1RC,1,1,4,"This is my introduction to Nina Simone.  I heard ""Do I Move You"" in the 4th season sound track of The L word.  I have heard of Nina Simone, but never really bothered to check her out, but I really liked ""Do I Move You, "" such a cool song, so I decided to buy this CD.  It is awesome. I think is it a perfect intro to a great singer.  Her voice is so distinct that it can never be copied, and her styling and phrasing is deep.  ""In the Dark"" & ""I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl,"" are absolute gems, but the CD overall is excellent.  My only complaint is the measly 38 minutes, I think there could have been more songs added, but other than that it's a good CD for starters.",
,B00138D1RC,1,1,5,Beautiful blues work.,
,B00138D1RC,1,1,4,"Nina Simone has always been difficult to classify although this album is pretty close to a straight ahead R&B / Soul outin with some vocal pop thrown in.  The only nod to jazz is the Porgy & Bess number ""My Man's Gone Now"".  Although Ms. Simone can tend to be self indulgent at times, she reins in that tendency here with a selection of songs (4 are self penned) that really fit the Blues theme which is very fitting to her style and persona.  The arrangements are also excellent with a tight band that supports but does not overwhelm the songs - no strings, no brass.
My favorite thing here is a rollicking barrelhouse version of ""House of the Rising Sun"", completely unlike the version made famous by The Animals.  While not everything works as well as that, there is never any doubt about NS's commitment to the material.",
,B00138D1RC,1,1,5,"Much as it was somewhat intimidating when first eyeballing the recorded catalogs of Stevie Wonder and Miles Davis when I was younger,a similar reaction occurred when eyeballing the breadth and scope of Nina Simone's music. At a time when the world of protest music was largely expressed through folk singers such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs,Nina Simone was one of the very few people to write and sing about the social concerns of the civil rights movement from an insiders perspective. Her distinctive musical style led the way for many generations of jazz and soul music,from the 70's funk era up to the socially aware end of the hip-hop/neo-soul scene today. Interestingly enough,she did all of this by being something of a creative non conformist. So this is the first Nina Simone album I ever put my hands on. And here's how I see it.

  Conceptually this album is quite literal as she explores the blues. This is a genre she might have been mildly embarrassed about. Yet she understood it's True purpose to such a strong degree that ""Do I Move You"",her own composition that starts out the album in a manner that she has a full command of the form and authenticity of it's message. On ""Day And Night"",her own ""I Want A Little Sugar In My Bowl"",""Buck"" and  the ballad ""Since I Feel For You"" she is throwing down some heavy soul with the likes of musicians Eric Gale and Bernard Purdie. Her lyrical and vocal expression reflect both personal and physical longing in almost equal measure. On ""Backlash Blues"" she's back to the 12 bar end of things. Co-written with Langston Hughes,this song realistically deals with the socio-economic inequities bought on from racism that,sadly we're still very much dealing with in the present day.

  While that is a personal favorite of mine here,another is her take of ""House Of The Rising Sun"",interpreted with the full gospel power of the sanctified church and not the typically folksy take on the song whatsoever. She ends the album with ""Blues For Mama"",her collaboration with Abbey Lincoln dealing with unfaithful and abusive men. Of the bonus tracks,the standout for me is the uptempo soul of ""Whatever I Am,You Made Me"". Much as with Miles Davis,the in your face assertiveness of Nina Simone pours out through your brash and sometimes howling vocal instrument and projects an attitude that may not be everyone's cup of tea. However for those who hunger for the soul laid bare,Nina Simone stands out among the Etta James and Aretha Franklin's of her era for her naked expressions of emotion and consciousness. An absolutely revelatory album and highly recommended to those just getting into Nina's music.",

,B00138DBCM,1,1,5,"I happened to hear this song on a friend's ipod, and  I remembered how much I like the lyrics and the upbeat tempo.  One can never make another happy; only a person can make himself/herself happy.  To expect otherwise is folly (my opinion); however, someone can be a catalyst for another's happiness (I know, you can't have it both ways).",
,B00138CZ1K,1,1,5,"Love this CD.  Nancy has always, ALWAYS been one of my favorites and this CD is just one more excuse to love her.  I first fell in love with her voice in the seventies.  She made quite a few albums that to me were way ahead of her time. Love, Life and Harmony being one of them.  (Wish they would release that on CD format and also This Mothers Daughter). As Nancy advances toward her September years her voice has mellowed, gotten richer and even more beautiful. Her newer CD RSVP is another fine example of her later talent.  On this CD, the song ""Love I Found You"" is the stunner on this set.  As I stated all the songs are first rate and she handles them as the pro she is but ""Love I Foud You"" will live inside of you long after the CD has been switched off. If you are new to Nancy this is a great CD to begin with and I can promise you this, once you have tasted of her talents, You will be back for more.",
,B00138CZ1K,1,1,5,"Nancy Wilson is like a fine wine, mellowing & perfecting with time.  I could listen to her forever.  Choose a song, any song.

This cd is full of sophisticated musical journeys.  From the opener, ""Love Dance"", you are on your way!  Sample that hot song ""Day Dream"".  Nancy makes it her own.  ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" is gorgeous, fine and fulfilling.  Nancy gives ""More Love"" depth and sincerity.  ""Love Won't Let Me Wait"" is a real sensual knock-out!  Nancy makes ""Magic Door"" a journey into a fantasy.  The finale is a magnificent gospel song called ""Your Arms Of Love"".

When Nancy Wilson sings a song, you feel as though she is singing it for only you.  That's how personal it gets.  The beauty of her voice is incomparable.  This is a must for any Nancy fan!",
,B00138CZ1K,1,1,5,"5 star rating...this CD deserves EVERY star..and possibly one extra!!  Caution: Kiddies, this is mature music sung by ""a woman who knows""...these songs are NOT for youngsters, NOT for people with immature ears and tastes and NOT for people who have never felt romantic LOVE.

Nancy sings of romantic love in all its' forms...sadness, excitement, hopeful, blissful, even sensual.  Every song is a ballad...and WHO sings modern love ballads better than Miss Nancy Wilson?...don't answer, it's a rhetorical question.  This CD is best played at night, by candlelight, and listened/enjoyed with that special someone...touch them/hold them/whisper to them/love them.  I played ""Love, I Found You"" a half dozen times when I first heard it (it's exquisite)....""More Love"", ""Love Dance"" and ""Loving You"" can bring joy tears to your eyes if you're not careful...and please, DON'T BE CAREFUL.

This is a special CD...with intimate music...Nancy, in her most expressive voice...the songs, new and romantic...arranged...what's the word?...LUSH?  Have YOU ever been in love?...Do you own a CD player?...It's a match made in heaven.  Oh yes...this is potent, erotic stuff...and it's not for kids...Trust me...put 'em to bed first...and then...",

I've always had a weakness for 80's Britpop-yes, a lot of them were one-hit wonders, but that doesn't make listening to them any less enjoyable. I've loved this song since the first time I heard it, even though I can't tell you who any of the band members are or what ever happened to them. Let's just say it allows me to return to a better time when my sons were still kids, my marriage hadn't broken up, and life was a whole lot less complicated.

What the heck is ""Dixie Lullaby"" doing on here? The song wasn't even a single. It's not even really all that good in my opinion. That was just a wasted space,for a better song that could have been on here. Overall,this CD is okay...but far from great. I recommend you just pick up his Greatest Hits 1 and 2 CDs instead of this.",
,B00138F364,1,1,5,"Clint Black arrived on the country charts in 1989, the same year Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, and Travis Tritt released debut albums.  Black's Killin' Time initially established him as the biggest of the new stars, with hits like ""A Better Man,"" ""Nobody's Home,"" and the title track.
 These songs showcased Black's clever wordplay amid fairly traditional honky tonk arrangements and a Haggardesque vocal style. While it wasn't long before Black was surpassed commercially by Brooks and Jackson, his music maintained a high standard during his RCA tenure that was highlighted by 29 top ten hits.
 Black's two Greatest Hits volumes were both frustrating affairs whose new material - aside from the haunting chart-topper ""Like The Rain"" - was subpar.  This chronologically arranged, 20-track collection concentrates on his biggest chart hits, including the lush ""Loving Blind"" and the heartbreaking ""Where Are You Now"" (number ones inexplicably left off those other sets).
 The only non-single found here is the jazzy Bruce Hornsby duet ""Dixie Lullaby.""  As it sounds a lot like the enclosed Steve Wariner pairing ""Been There"" (which it precedes), its selection is suspect.  Had the compilers included ""When I Said I Do"" - Black's award winning, # 1 collaboration with wife Lisa Hartman - instead, this retrospective might have merited its Ultimate title.",

,B00138F11Q,1,1,5,"As the title might imply, this is a very mellow album that might send you to sleep if you are in any way tired. But if you were to fall asleep while this CD is playing, you'd miss some great music. The book from which Shawn selected these carols and lullabies obviously contains many songs that are rarely heard these days, making this particularly interesting for those looking for something different, though there one song here that is famous all around the world - Silent night, which works as a lullaby as well as a carol.

The opening track, In the bleak midwinter, is a wonderful old English carol and it's great to hear this sung by an American - a rare occurrence. Rocking is another old English carol, one that is particularly suited to this album, being both a holiday song and a lullaby. All through the night is a carol I've heard before but recordings of it seem to be even rarer than Rocking and In the bleak midwinter.

Elsewhere, there are beautiful songs such as Windy nights (words by Robert Louis Stevenson), All the pretty li'l horses, Little road to Bethlehem and Love came down at Christmas. The final track is Close your eyes, so it seems that Shawn really does want you to fall asleep after that.

This is definitely not a typical Christmas album but very soothing - and very satisfying.",
,B00138F11Q,1,1,4,"This is indeed a beautiful album.  It opens with the traditional ""In the Bleak Midwinter"" and then goes directly into the classic ""Christmas Time Is Here"" from ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"".  Another traditional but seldom heard number is ""Rocking"", and then there's the haunting lullaby, ""All Through The Night"".  ""Silent Night"" is the one absolute Christmas standard here.  And ""Close Your Eyes"", Brahms Lullaby, is heard from time to time on Christmas CDs, though it isn't truly a Christmas song.  However, with Shawn's voice, all of these are good.
Regretfully, I can't put this album into the same category that I have put CDs by other female vocalists such as Judy Collins, Natalie Cole, Anne Murray, or Julie Andrews.  But this is a good folksy type classic record to own.",
,B00138F4IQ,1,1,5,"Having released live albums in 1968 (""At Folsom Prison"") and 1969 (""At San Quentin""), this previously unreleased 1969 live show from New York's Madison Square Garden still manages to illuminate another side of Cash's performance. Given the pressure of the prison shows, not to mention their tailor-made set lists, this recording finds Cash less on-edge, providing a more accurate rendering of his then-current stage show. Everyone but a very pregnant June Carter Cash is on-board, including the Tennessee Three (Marshall Grant, W.S. Holland and Bob Wooten), Carl Perkins, Tommy Cash, The Statler Brothers and The Carter Family (including Mother Maybelle, and daughters Helen and Anita).

The set list covers many of Cash's most beloved songs (including a quartet of prison tunes, and a barn-burning take of ""Wreck of the Old 97""), plus a generous helping of historical and folk classics, including Jane Bowers ""Remember the Alamo"" (recorded throughout the '50s and '60s by The Kingston Trio, Donovan, Willie Nelson and others). He provides contemporary commentary about the Vietnam War (""when you watch the helicopters bringing in the wounded, that might make you a dove with claws"") and sings Ed McCurdy's ""Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream"" (a standard of the '60s folk revival, sung by The Weavers, Chad Mitchell, and Simon & Garfunkel, among others).

The ease and confidence with which Cash presents himself on stage is astounding, and more in evidence than in the live prison recordings. Spoken introductions to songs like ""Five Feet High and Rising"" pull everything together into a seamless presentation. Similarly, Cash's generous revue staging allows his compatriots -- each headliners in their own right -- to shine brightly. Carl Perkin's blazes through ""Blue Suede Shoes,"" The Statler Brothers sing a lively version of their crossover hit ""Flowers on the Wall,"" and the Carter Family performs a beautiful pair of songs from A.P. Carter's catalog (""Wildwood Flower"" ""Worried Man Blues""). Cash's sister-in-law, Helen Carter, provides a wonderfully warm introduction to the Carter Family segment.

The closing medley provides each member of the troupe a chance to give their twist on a Cash landmark. Johnny and his brother Tommy sing ""Do What You Do, Do Well,"" The Carter Family sings ""I Walk the Line,"" The Statler Brothers take on ""Ring of Fire,"" and Carl Perkins finds the rockabilly heart of ""Folsom Prison Blues."" Cash closes out the show with a snippet of ""The Rebel - Johnny Yuma,"" and yet another reprise of ""Folsom Prison Blues."" The crowd's thunderous applause draws an encore of ""Suppertime.""

This is a beautiful (and generous: 77 minute!) stereo recording of a stage master at the peak of his powers, singing and speaking to an enthusiastic sell-out crowd. It is at once incredibly intimate and incredibly grand. The only improvement would have been to release it 33 years ago!",
,B00138F4IQ,1,1,5,"Cool!  An entire album of prevously unreleased live Johnny Cash goodies from his commercial heyday in 1969, repeating the success of his earlier concert albums, but here performing for the city slickers in the Big Apple.  Johnny is joined by the reconstituted Carter Family, brother Tommy Cash, the Statler Brothers (who he was a patron of...)  and fellow Sun Records veteran Carl Perkins (as we hear on a  track intro at the very end of the album, June Carter Cash wasn't able to attend as she was six months pregnant at the time...)  It's an efficient, professional  presentation, yet one that gives some nice glimpses into Cash's inner life, mostly through the spoken introductions that accompany many of the songs.  The most telling is the intro to ""Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream,"" in which Cash addresses the thorny issue of the Vietnam War.  Stumbling nervously, hoping not to offend anyone one way or the other, Cash recalls how he and his show went to entertain the troops overseas, declaring, ""I may not be a hawk... But maybe I'm a dove with claws...""  He also introduces a few songs with asides about his down-home background; back then, these monologes may have been a bit hokey, but they've added resonance as Cash has gotten older and his legend increased.  Also of interest is an angry, emotional reading of his Native American rights protest song, ""As Long As Grass Shall Grow,"" which is one of the most powerful performances of Cash's career.  There are also plenty of religious tunes, which he also puts his heart into.  There are some rushed moments, but on the whole, this is an album well worth checking out, and certainly a delight for longtime Cash fans who have never heard this material before.",

,B00138F3BO,1,1,5,"At this point in their life Mott acheived some success with Bowie's All The Young Dudes and went further than the glam-rock posturing of the album with this masterpiece. Ironing out the rough edges of All The Yound Dudes with this well produced sounding batch of songs Mott never strayed from their roots of hard melodic rock and folk ballads with strings that reach a crescendo of guitar fused power. Ian Hunter sneers like a British Dylan and the energy of rockers like Little Richard the temperment of the Velvet Underground,hippie leanings of folkies like Melanie never leaves their music.

Mott's songs remain winners to this day and takes the All The Young Dudes sound further by giving a polish to that rougher sounding diamond that was All The Young Dudes.

Both are essential with the followup The Hoople cd a great listen of great songs but lacks the cohesive feel of Mott and is somehow a paler imitation of Mott, nonetheless all 3 cd's are wonderful.",
,B00138F3BO,1,1,4,"Mott the Hoople was one of those great rock and roll bands that was unfortunately just a tad too quirky to ever be accepted by mainstream audiences.  Though it doesn't contain thier best known song (the David Bowie penned ""All the Young Dudes""), ""Mott"" still gets the nod as the band's best album.
The album features a healthy does of everything that made them great: unpredictable songwriting, fine guitar playing from Mick Ralphs (later of Bad Company), and the theatrical vocals of front man Ian Hunter.  The highlights include the catchy, horn laden ""All the Way from Memphis"" that kicks things off, the sequel to their David Bowie hit ""Hymn for the Dudes,"" the downcast autobiographical story song ""Ballad of Mott the Hoople"" and the goofy but sweet ballad ""I Wish I Was Your Mother"" that closes the record.  In between is a lot of typical Mott glam rock weirdness like ""I'm a Cadilac"" and ""Violence.""  Though it lacks liner notes, the CD booklet does feature a full lyrics sheet.
Overall, a terrific classic rock album from an underappreciated band.",
,B00138F3BO,1,1,5,"If Mott the Hopple didn't help invent punk, they certainly were the midwives that helped with the delivery. Mott was a unique band--with they were never less than soulful even on their weakest material. Ian Hunter's Sonny Bono/Bob Dylan delivery gave an impression of what the Pretty Things or Stones would have sounded like with either one of those singer/songwriters as their front man.
Mott is a nearly flawless album. Hunter came into his own as a songwriter. I Wish I was Your Mother, All the Way to Memphis and Ballad of Mott (co-written with all the band members) all manage to capture Hunter's gritty and blunt assessment of the world packaged in a melodic and colorful box.
Ralphs contributes a couple of strong tracks as well although his contributions are a bit more subdued than on All the Young Dudes. Clearly Hunter had taken Bowie's advice and stepped to the forefront as both frontman and songwriter. This managed to make the band better and also caused the original line up to splinter with Hunter the next casuality.
The problem with this great album is the sound quality. The CD sounds flat and muddy. When you compare the sound quality here to the remastered editions of both All the Young Dudes and The Hoople, it's clear that this album is in bad need of a facelift. If you're a fan of the band let Sony/Columbia know that this needs all the attention, remixing and remastering that was applied to both the selections from the box set and the other two MTH Columbia studio albums.
Oh, and pick up Hunter's Rant. He's in fine form again and it's evident he hasn't lost his edge.",
,B00138F3BO,1,1,5,"No longer obscure or in Bowie's shadow, Mott shone brightly on their first entirely self produced album. Ian Hunter had clearly taken control of the band authoring or co-authoring 8 of the 9 songs. This doesn't diminish Mick  Ralphs contributions--his guitar playing is terrific and his single solo  composition(He wrote three other tracks with Hunter) is a terrific song.
Along with Brain Capers, this is the band's finest hour. After this  Ralphs left the band leaving a gaping hole that, perhaps, only Mick Ronson  could have filled if he and Hunter had stayed with the band. I Wish I Was  Your Mother and Violence are two of the highlights from this terrific  album.
Now if only Columbia would remaster this as well as they did the  Import of All The Young Dudes, it would be a perfect album!",

,B00138H61Y,1,1,5,"The Fabulous Swing Collection is one of the better single CD compilations we have of great swing music that took the country by storm in the 1930s and 1940s. This music still sounds great today; and many people have fond memories of the times they danced to these tunes when they were often performed live in dance halls and nightclubs. The quality of the sound is really rather good and I like the artwork.

Benny Goodman & His Orchestra open things up with a great rendition of ""Don't Be That Way (Take 1)."" The horn works very well for this number and Benny's band never lets us down! They do this flawlessly; and it sounds great even today. Glenn Miller & His Orchestra follow with their smash hit entitled ""In the Mood."" ""In the Mood"" is a number people remember well; this got lots of air play and many people danced to it back in the day. Similarly, ""Opus One"" by Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra never disappoints; ""Opus One"" is a peppy little number that packs a huge, unforgettable punch and I always like hearing ""Opus One.""

Glen Gray & His Orchestra (with whom I'm less familiar) also make good with their hit, ""Casa Loma Stomp."" ""Casa Loma Stomp"" has a great beat and they never play a superfluous note! Great! Of course, we can't have a swing CD without the great Duke Ellington and his buddies doing their wonderful ""Take the `A' Train;"" ""Take the `A' Train"" hit the clubs big time and when you hear it you'll instantly know why. A personal favorite of mine is ""Minnie the Moocher"" by the incomparable Cab Calloway & His Cotton Club Orchestra; Cab Calloway could really swing and that Cotton Club was all the better off for it!

Listen also for ""Back Bay Shuffle"" by Artie Shaw & His Orchestra; Artie Shaw instinctively knew how to make great music and ""Back Bay Shuffle"" showcases his talents nicely. There's even a special number from Glenn Miller again when he and his buddies play ""A String Of Pearls."" ""A String Of Pearls"" sounds like pearls should sound--and that's quite all right by me. ""Swingin' Uptown"" by Jimmie Lunceford & His Orchestra is great; but they could have omitted ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" by Fletcher Henderson & His Orchestra. Oh, well--no CD is perfect.

The CD ends very nicely. We get two solid numbers, ""Flyin' Home"" performed by Charlie Barnet & His Orchestra and then ""Sing, Sing, Sing (With A Swing) (Parts 1 & 2)"" by Benny Goodman & His Orchestra. ""Sing, Sing, Sing (With A Swing) (Parts 1 & 2)"" is classic swing music at its very apex and I think you'll like it very much if you haven't heard this one before.

This album is a great starter CD for people just getting into swing music; and it makes an affordable single CD swing music compilation, too. If you like this you should consider other CDs of swing music available for sale on this website.",
,B00138H61Y,1,1,5,"When this first came out over a decade ago from RCA Victor/BMG it was an instant winner among those Big Band fans starving for some CD material presenting the music of that era in quality AAD sound. Unlike many releases at that time, it even has three paragraphs in the insert describing the usual reception for these renowned groups when their buses rolled into town, along with a re-listing of the generous (for the time) 19 tracks showing recording dates and locations.

With so much to choose from in terms of material, I have to agree with those who assigned 5 stars to the tracks presented here, each in its own way representative of the music so popular from 1933 to 1940 (the span covered here). And yes, even to the inclusion of Fletcher Henderson's Mary Had A Little Lamb, a 1936 recording featuring a brief vocal by Teddy Lewis, but some of the best instrumental solos ever put to disc. Really, the title and the lyrics are incidental.

The same reviewer who lamented that selection, also had disparaging remarks for the ""whitebread"" Casa Loma Stomp, only the first of 64 hits for Glen Gray & His Casa Loma Orchestra (named after a famed Toronto nightclub which the band called home for a spell) which hit # 15 in January 1931 (this is a 1933 re-recording), as well as Bunny Berigan's rendition of All God's Chillun Got Rhythm (with vocal by Ruth Bradley). Yes, trying to do that in today's society would go over like a lead balloon - but this was 1937 and that year both Duke Ellington (# 14 instrumental) and Artie Shaw (# 15 with vocal by Tony Pastor) had hits with it.

Their inclusion in this historical volume is just fine, thank you very much. As the blurb says on the reverse ""Foot-tappin' favorites & jumpin' jitterbugs from the Fabulous Swing Era! Over 64 minutes of the swingin'est singles ever!"" And at a pretty decent price I might add.",
,B00138H61Y,1,1,4,"RCA's ""Fabulous Swing Collection"" was released to exploit a national big band revival craze, led by groups like Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Brian Setzer's Orchestra and in full swing (pardon the pun) in 1998. That revival has cooled but this generous (19 songs, 65 minutes) set remains among the era's better one-disc compilations (all songs from RCA family labels)  for now third-generation fans.
It may not have been all the classics revivalists danced to; two swingin' Louises (Prima and Jordan) recorded their jump, jive and wailin' big band tunes for Capitol and Decca Records, respectively. But many of the era's signature tunes are represented, sounding surprisingly warm in analog sound: Glenn Miller's anthemic ""In The Mood,"" ""String of Pearls,"" and ""American Patrol,"" Benny Goodman's hard, wild swinging ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" (heard recently and famously in a cookie commercial but better in Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall concert), Cab Calloway's 1933 ""Minnie The Moocher,"" which he performed nearly a half-century later in the first ""Blues Brothers"" film and here does in full-throated youthful yodel.
You also get seminal sides from Charlie Barnet (""Cherokee""), Tommy Dorsey (""Marie,"" ""Opus One""), and Duke Ellington (""Take The 'A' Train,"" ""Cotton Tail""). While these songs swing sweeter than 1998's martini-and-cigar crowd might have liked, ""Fabulous"" may well be among the few big band CDs a new fan would need. Longtime fans have these classics on the artists' original LPs (or more studious sets like Columbia's ""16 Most Requested Big Band Themes"") and can probably swing past it.",

,B00138H8A8,1,1,5,"After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.

I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title ""The Essential Jim Reeves."" To please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had 80 Country hit singles between 1953 and 1984, 27 of which crossed over to the Hot 100, six to the Adult Contemporary charts (which didn't begin until 1961), and one to the R&B charts. Never mind the hundreds of equally-wonderful selections from his many EPs and LPs.

All in all, however, I'd say he did a fairly credible job, augmented by five pages of liner notes by Colin Escott and three more photos of Jim, including one with wife Mary at an Awards ceremony. A partial discography of the contents is also included, but without any chart details.

All but track 20 [recorded in 1958 and included on an early LP] were hits for Jim, 18 of them pop crossovers [only track 4 made only the Country list, going to # 2 early in 1959]. His version of the old standard, I Love You Because, was recorded in 1962 and was first released on the RCA Victor LP Gentleman Jim and, in 1976, became a # 54 Country hit as a single.

Note, too, that the version of Am I Losing You was the one cut in 1960 and released on RCA Victor 7800, going to # 8 Country/# 31 Hot 100 as the flipside of I Missed Me [# 3 Country/# 44 Hot 100 and not included here], The first version, done in 1957 [# 3 Country], remains a bit difficult to find.

The earliest hit represented here, and the one that leads off the disc, is Four Walls [# 1 Country for EIGHT weeks in 1957] which was his initial pop crossover [# 11]. However, this came after 13 Country hits beginning in 1953 with Mexican Joe [# 1 for NINE weeks credited to Jim Reeves And The Circle O Ranch Boys].

So I tend to agree with another reviewer who says that at least one of those should have been included in an ""essential"" CD. Not counting the first six, five of which were for the Abbott label and one, I Love You, a # 3 duet with Ginny Wright on the Fabor label, there were seven RCA cuts to choose from. The best of these included the afore-mentioned Am I Losing You, as well as Yonder Comes A Sucker and According To My Heart, both # 4s.

Still, it's hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum 5 stars.",

After his departure from the T-BIRDS, JIMMIE's highly anticipated solo debut STRANGE PLEASURE showcased a stunning set of solid originals including the chugging BOOM-BAPA-BOOM, upbeat instrumental TILT A WHIRL, and the stark, acoustic SIX STRINGS DOWN, a soul-stirring tribute to departed blues heroes like FREDDIE KING, MUDDY WATERS, GUITAR SLIM and of course SRV. VAUGHAN's multi-faceted six string runs and lean, purposeful vocals propel sublime slices of boss soul and roadhouse-honed RNB with nary a weak track within earshot; in a perfect world, HEY-YEAH, FLAMENCO DANCER, and JUST LIKE PUTTY might have been adult contemporary radio hits.

,B00138J5SQ,1,1,5,"One of the most consummate storytellers of the last 40+ years, James Taylor has also remained a dynamic and charismatic onstage performer. While he isn't as visually exciting or physically demanding as many of his piers, his shows have an intimacy that few performers are able to capture.

The two disc 1993 release offers an excellent sampling of Taylor's tour from that year. The song selections could not be more perfect, offering his biggest hit singles (""Fire and Rain,"" ""You've Got a Friend,"" ""How Sweet It Is,"" ""Handy Man""), beloved fan favorites (""Sweet Baby James,"" ""Something in the Way She Moves,"" ""Carolina in My Mind,"" ""Country Road""), obscure album cuts (""Traffic Jam,"" ""Secret O' Life,"" ""Millworker,"" ""That Lonesome Road""), and several cuts from his most recent efforts. His between song banter is charming, and his backing band is tight and performs the material with the respect it deserves.

""Live"" is a terrific document of Taylor as a live performer and a must for all fans.",
,B00138J5SQ,1,1,5,"The best studio albums have something to recommend about them: the artist and the mixers can make the recordings just as perfect as  possible - mixing the various tracks to blend perfectly, and editing and re-recording any mistakes.

Still - live shows always have an appeal that can't be recreated in a studio.  Something about performing live, especially in front of an appreciative audience,  inspires musicians to heights that are difficult to reach in the more sterile recording studio.

That being said, ""Live"" albums are notorious for not quite capturing the experience of actually being at the concert.  James Taylor (Live), recorded during his Fall Tour of 1992, masterfully dodges limitations that  plague many recordings.

First of all - the recordings are incredibly good, with the mix reflecting the notoriously talented and tight band that Mr. Taylor always has at his disposal.  A perfectionist universally respected in the biz, James Taylor is in a class all by himself among singer-songwriters: he can call upon enough talented musicians to flesh out TWO grammy-level bands, and while he gives everyone a place to shine within the structure of a concert, they all know that they are there to make James and his music sound as good as possible.

Second of all - this live concert, like an actual JT concert - is extremely generous in the amount of music available.  With two 15 song discs most of his best known songs (up to 1992) are splendidly represented.  Among the 30 tracks are one of my favorite renditions of ""Carolina in my Mind"", plus exceptional versions of ""Sweet Baby James"", ""Fire and Rain"", ""You've Got A Friend"", ""How Sweet It is"", ""Up On The Roof"", ""Something In The Way She Moves"" and many others.

He is also known for superb covers (thus his two recent projects consisting entirely of cover songs). It is an embarrassment of riches that perhaps the quintessential song writer blesses us with that velvety voice on other's songs as well.  In this project he gives an absolutely scintillating version of George Jones' classic ""She Thinks I Still Care"" and one of the best things about this live recording is listening to his introduction of the song - he says George Jones sings the song so well ""it makes you weep, makes your dog weep, and makes your roof leak.  It's pathetic!""  Then he unleashes a version so good it would make George Jones weep tears of joy.

If you don't have any James Taylor in your collection - why not?  And if you're only going to have ONE in your collection... this wouldn't be a bad one.",
,B00138J5SQ,1,1,5,"This is a two CD live album with a whopping 30 tracks that cover all facets of Taylor's career up to the early 90's.  Backed by a 9 piece band the album really showcases the versatility that a Taylor live show encompasses.  When one thinks of James Taylor it is usually the single guy with an acoustic guitar that you think of, but live Taylor really puts on an energetic show with a wide variety of music.  Taylor has always had an element of soul to some of his stuff, and with the backup band and especially backup singers this album injects a significant amount of soul influence into the several tracks.  All the big hits are here along with some of Taylor's better album cuts.  For me one of the highlights is the inclusion of the song ""Milworker"" which was written for a musical and not on any official Taylor album.  The song is one of the best he has ever written and for anyone who has ever worked in a factory environment pretty much nails what day to day life is like.  I don't have any of Taylor's studio albums so for me this collection is a great overview of the many facets of Taylor's output.",
,B00138J5SQ,1,1,4,"I really like James Taylor Live. His Material takes on another meaning for my ears. I truly enjoy His Versions of His Biggest Hits Live.""Your Smiling Face""""You've Got a Friend"",etc.. are truly showcased here to me. I enjoy Him&the Vibe His band plays with here.very Enjoyable.",
,B00138J5SQ,1,1,5,"There are those who are naturals for live albums and ones who aren't.  James Taylor has to be one of the naturals.
Of course, if you want perfection, you probably want to stick with the studio recordings.  But if you want to hear a truly electric performance, go with this live album.
From the first cut, ""Sweet Baby James"", you can sense the perfect rapport with the audience.  The live version of ""Mexico"" is quite enhanced by the life atmosphere, and by the time you get to ""Fire and Rain"", you can sense a flow between the singer and his audience.  The energy reaches its zenith on ""Shower The People"" and ""How Sweet It Is"".
Cut after cut is notable here.  The pure country sound of ""She Thinks I Still Care"" is a highlight.  ""You've Got A Friend"" and ""That Lonesome Road"" close a truly exciting experience.  If you prefer the best in the spontanaity of a live performance to the cool and perfect studio recording, or even if the two are equal in your mind, then you deserve to have this in your collection.",
,B00138J5SQ,1,1,5,"The best performances from 14 shows were chosen for this perfect,liveCD.JT sings his classic's like there brand new,and even better than the original. My favorite,""Your Smiling face,"" with different key changes and music ,should have been released as a single .Its amazing,along with all the other cuts,""HandyMan,How Sweet It is,"" and the song that welcomes us into the record,""Sweet Baby James,"" with just James and his guitar. The sound is unreal,like the concert is playing in your living room. Your going to love this CD.",
,B00138J5SQ,1,1,5,"Thid live CD was well worth the wait.  Styles galore are explored here ranging from the usual easy listening batch, to rock n roll to soul covers.  What about the gospel accapella number that closers this disc.  There's anotehr gospel tinged number earlier on this disc which just sounds great.  Then there is the George Jones Country number-track 7 on disc 2.  Besides the variety, the vocals from James are just great and his background vocalists are quite charming as well.  This is even a must purchse for casual fans.  Its on my holiday list so put it on yours.",
,B00138J5SQ,1,1,5,"I was lucky enough to first see James Taylor live in a small outdoor venue  called Avaloch in rural Lenox, Massachusetts in the summer of 1970, after  this first album recorded by the Beatles in London had been released and  just before the release of the fabulously successful ""Sweet Baby James""  album by Warner Brothers. He appeared alone on-stage with a full head of  long, long hair in a simple denim shirt and cut-up jeans with his four or  five acoustic guitars, and for two and a half hours proceeded to absolutely  enchant the sprawling lawn-full of hundreds of audience members with a  spellbinding performance of all of the work from both of those albums.  Although virtually unknown at the time, word of mouth had spread so quickly  in the Berkshires area (who still considers him one of their own) that many  of us went out to get this album to play before he appeared. The rest, as  they say, is history.
This is a fantastic retrospective collection of  his greatest hits recorded live, and as one would expect of the amazing Mr.  Taylor, it is a terrific summary of that work. Many of my favorites are  here, including ""Something In The Way She Moves"", ""Carolina In My Mind"",  and ""Rainy Day Man"". Of course, so is ""Fire And Rain"", ""You've Got A  Friend"", ""Steamroller Blues"", and a wonderful combination of ""Millworker""  and ""Country Road"", which are both among the best songs he has ever  written.  My all time favorite song from this album is ""Sweet Baby James"",  which is sung about the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts where I  grew up, so I have always considered this a special song.  His performance  on it is a brilliant illustration of just how incredibly talented an  interpretive artist Taylor really is. He always pleases with songs like  ""Copperline"", ""Mexico"", and ""Walking Man"", and this album is sure to please  even the most cautious music fan. It is certainly a terrific showcase for  how well Taylor can deliver on a variety of original works and covers of  traditional folk songs. Enjoy",

,B00138J7EI,1,1,5,"The best of what redeemed the eighties from MTV crap. This was and still is a dense cacophony of beauty and your classic 80s angst and cynicism with moments of tentative redemption. Everyone's got their favorite 80s icons- they're probably mine because I got to see them in a small venue at the height of their powers, just after this had come out. Nothing burns into your teenage brain permanently like a great rock group when they're on top of their game, before they're just paying the bills and trying not to punch each other out in the process.

""She is Mine"" is a standout; Butler's seething rasp can have its oddly tender moments. (I still think he's one of the all-time sexiest vocalists- and I just die when he talk-sings ""Ha Ha Ha"". Classic Butler-ism.). While ""Pretty In Pink"" tends to give me the Mollyringwalds and it seems a bit sexist, I still love it for what it reminds me of: that great p-furs signature intro.

""Into you like a train"" is just full-speed searing beauty, guitars sweeping around you. And ""No Tears"" perfectly captures 80s wariness of political activism and the ensuing apathy /antagonism with the problematic radicals of the day (""There's demonstrations, and demonstrations.... you don't have a point of view. You don't have to say you do"".

While occasionally Butler has his Dylan-ish moments of lyrical nonsense, they do work in their 80s way, like a collage of imagery and emotional impressions, not literal straightforward meanings in lyrics.

It has a  melodic, yet driving, layered noise. I could never go full atonal - the No Wave thing, so this has that kind of energy, in a sense, yet is tight and has a sense of tune you can remember, as opposed to just tuneless screeching. The layers & textures never get in the way of the lyrical/melodic line- it always sounds like it's just short of all parts crashing together, yet it's sort of a controlled chaos that sweeps past you and around you. Also, this album has density without all the twinkly, trebly production that ""Forever Now"" has to make it more radio-friendly.

Plus this just brings out the adolescent clove-smoker in me, when all this stuff seemed so romantic! ""So run Down"" is another great track- reminds me of that teenage time when even a bad hangover seemed like a new adventure!

Between the Furs & the Bunnymen, it was all shades and trenchcoats here on out...and that wasn't such as a bad thing at a tender age.",

In my own punk heydey, this was killer choice stuff -- even though it's not really punk at all -- and came at a time when doctrinal rigidity to crud like hardcore or straightcore or whatever didn't mean diddly. Talk Talk Talk came out at a time before radio had completed its terrible march to niche segregation, and exciting music was coming at kids from all corners. Punk and new wave stuff led the blast. The Furs were among the best and most disposable at the same time. One quibble with the Amazon reviewer: He takes a crack at what followed this from the Furs, but Forever Now is a very good record that, with the devastating Brechtian nightmare of ""Easy Street"" and sweet metalic joy of ""Yes I Do"" and when they went all mushy on us (""Heaven,"" ""The Ghost In You"") it was still irresistable.

Though it leans heavily on the album entitled Melrose, there is a flow to the numbers that brings a new focus to this period of the band's lengthy career.

,B00138JAD6,-1,-1,3,"Slow Train Coming is Bob Dylan's religious album, or rather, the beginning of a religious-based period of albums that progressed into the early 80's.  If THIS is what I can expect for the rest of this particular period, well... I probably won't even bother.  This is disappointing enough.

""Gotta Serve Somebody"" has lyrics that explain no matter WHO you are, you're gonna have to serve *somebody*.  The slow-paced disco beats and the straight forward lyrics leave a lot to be desired, however.  The disco connection unfortunately sets the pace for the rest of the experience which, judging by the numerous positive reviews here on amazon, might make this the most overrated album in Dylan's discography.  ""Precious Angel"" is generic mid-tempo plodding nonsense from beginning to end.  This is by FAR the worst Dylan album up to this point.  Self Portrait had variety at least.  Slow Train Coming, musically, is a product of the times- the dreaded days of the disco movement.  Yuck.  The ""Shine your light on me"" chorus is almost sickeningly uncharacteristic of Dylan.  You can tell he's forcing himself to sing such a line, and I swear I can almost sense that he's about ready to break out laughing during the chorus.  The only compliment I can give is that the Jerry Garcia-inspired guitar playing is decent.

""I Believe In You"" includes a melody so soft that it's basically a lullaby with terribly bland, simplistic and lovey dovey lyrics.  Anyone who believes Dylan can't write vocal melodies would have a good point here.  Normally I'd disagree with those people but not in this case.  ""Slow Train"" has a somewhat groovy rhythm, okay lyrics about a woman down in Alabama and figuring out and establishing your principles.  The guitar solo is actually really good.  Best song so far.  ""Gonna Change My Way of Thinking"" is a MAJOR low point.  Unsatisfying and disappointing Joe Walsh style mid-tempo hard rock with a VERY lackluster heavy guitar riff chugging along for the entire duration.  I'm mystified how so many Dylan fans can easily forgive such a failed experiment.

""Do Right To Me Baby (Do Unto Others)"" is where the religious lyrics are beginning to overstay their welcome as they're now becoming excessively irritating.  The bigger problem however is that there's *still* very little in the way of exciting musical ideas taking place here.  The songwriting is definitely uninteresting to me.  Just because Dylan finally revealed his feelings on religious matters doesn't automatically mean these songs are a pleasure to hear.  ""When You Gonna Wake Up"" is lyrically quite tedious and straight forward despite Dylan telling it like it is.  I'm sorry but this song sounds WAY too similar to Dire Strait's ""In the Gallery"" released a year before.  Same vocal mannerisms and punchy rhythm.  I *do* like how the tempo picks up during the chorus at least.  Yes and I'm aware that members of Dire Straits participated on this album so Mark Knopfler's style was bound to be noticeable either way but eh... I also have mixed feelings when the Band joined Dylan.  When you combine two artists with a distinctive style the result is that it usually limits the potential of *both* artists, or rather, encourages them both to hold back their full scope of creativity which is the case here with Dylan and Knopfler.

""Man Gave Name to All the Animals"" is a reggae style tune with a strong appearance of female vocals.  Dylan's voice is exceptionally hoarse but both the verse AND the chorus are oddly melodic and appealing to me.  This song almost sounds cute!  Definitely the most unusual song on the album.  It avoids resembling generic disco beats at least.  ""When He Returns"" is a piano ballad but... this is no ordinary piano playing!  It's VERY spiritual, uplifting, and emotionally a highlight.  Maybe even the best song on the album both lyrically and musically.  Great way to end the album.

Man, I don't know guys.  Songs such as ""Gotta Serve Somebody"", ""Precious Angel"", ""I Believe In You"" and ESPECIALLY ""Gonna Change My Way of Thinking"" are REALLY unappealing to me.  I suppose the rest of the material is passable but come on, Dylan's first religious-themed album is hardly flawless.  Look beyond the lyrics and notice the mediocre songwriting covering up most of the album.  On a final note just let me mention that I have no problem whatsoever with the lyrics.  Dylan covers religion exceptionally well and his conversion to Christianity is commendable, but I wouldn't expect any less from the master of creative wordplay.  Besides, every Christian I've ever known has always been super polite and supportive towards me and my decisions.  The problem I have with the album is that the music doesn't match the lyrics.  Not many (if any) artists entered the dreaded, horribly dated days of the disco movement and came out with flying colors.  It's just impossible for me to look beyond the generic music and focus on the lyrics.",
,B00138JAD6,1,1,4,"Slow Train Coming-Bob Dylan ****

Who saw it coming certainly not me. Bob Dylan a born and raised Jewish man who his entire career had songs dealing with his faith suddenly converted to Christianity. In 1978 Bob Dylan officialy converted to the Christian faith and has been devout ever since. In the process of embracing Jesus Christ as his lord and saviour he managed to write an entire album about it and a hit one at that. Slow Train coming would be the last hit Bob Dylan album for almost thirty years and it would also give him his last hit single of his career. Who knew that singing about the most contraversial subject ever could be turned into a massive success, only Dylan could make it happen.

After Slow Train Coming Dylan would go into a finger pointing faze preeching instead of spreading the word of his lord, but doing so with the threat of hellfire and brimstone and consequently losing a lot of his fan base in the process not that he cared. Slow Train Coming was a rare album and a rare moment in the history of Bob Dylan because we never saw him this happy, voulnerable, or inspired again in his career

With the exception of 'When You Gonna Wake Up' the album is mostly happy and up beat in praise and very possitive. The song 'When You Gonna Wake Up' was a sign of things to come in a negative way, becaus earound the corner was nothing but judgement from Dylan. Really it was nothing but albums of judgement. But being as this record was recorded with legendary hardcore Jewish producer Jerry Wexler (Ray Charles, Motown), I don't think the man would have stood for finger pointing. 'Gotta Serve Somebody' became Dylans last hit single of the 1970's as well as his last hit single of his career. It's got a very loose feel and is full of Jamacan influence and lots of heavy organ, it is easy to see why this became such a big hit. Throughout the album someone other then Bob Dylans musical abilities shine, and that is of Mark Knopfler of Dire Straights, yes the legandary axe slinger plays through out the album and is an asset to the team on tracks like 'Precious Angel' and 'Slow Train.' The former is amazing and would have fit well on Dire Straights debut. The later 'Slow Train' is quite simply one of the best songs that Bob Dylan has ever recorded in his life period.

Dylans lyrics have always been known for beig nothing short of brilliant, but on this album they seem and feel more inspired then usuall. That may be do to his new found faith. The imagery dipicted in his words are amazing and you feel like your there whitnessing Dylan speak to his lord right in front of you. 'Man Gave Names To All The Animals' does seem like nothing more then a childhood neursery rhyme but it does at nice texture to the album and lighten the mood a little as it is a nod to Noah and his ark.

Slow Train Coming is a must have for all fans of Dlyans work. It is his last essentail album for almost thirty years. After this Dylans albums were all hit or miss and even the decent ones are not essential and sound very dated. It wasn't until the late 1990's that Dylan did anything worth while. Since then he has released three albums that are among his best, Time Out Of Mind, Love And Theft, and Modern Times. Make Slow Train Coming apart of your Dylan collection.",
,B00138JAD6,1,1,5,"""Shine your light, Shine your light on me""

On November 17, 1978, Bob Dylan picked up a silver cross that was tossed on stage by a fan at a concert in San Diego, California, that was nearly marking the end of a year-long tour. He then had a vision of Christ while in a Tuscon, Arizona, hotel room, and - at the final tour date in Miami, Florida - debuted a new song, Do Right to Me Baby (Do Unto Others), which began the merging of Dylan's new personal faith as a born-again Christian with his music to produce his greatest studio effort ever.

Released in August 1979, Dylan's trek into Christian teachings and philosophy are heard in the nine songs, that clock in at about 47 minutes, with the album reaching number three on the U.S. and number two on the U.K. album charts.

""I just can't make it by myself""

Though most of the instrumental focus is rightfully on the Muscle Shoals Horns and Mark Knopfler (g) & Pick Withers (d) of Dire Straits, the powerful background vocals of Carolyn Dennis, Helena Springs and Regina Havis place exclamation points on the powerful gospel numbers.

Gotta Serve Somebody does not skirt the stark consequences when a person willfully elects to pursue the avenues of evil. Precious Angel has an utterly beautiful melody and you will not hear as powerful a sermon from any pulpit as found in Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking. The guitar solos by Knopfler on Slow Train compliments the classic Dylan lyrics and America 2007 is found in When You Gonna Wake Up, as provocative a protest song - written for 1970s America - ever penned by Dylan.

""I'm a little too blind to see""

But the song, I Believe in You, which concerns being cast out due to unpopular religious beliefs, seemingly set the stage for a six-month tour - starting on November 1, 1979 - to promote the album. Dylan would not play older compositions - radio ads and other media material informed fans of the tour structure - and he oftentimes spent portions of the concerts lecturing hecklers who yelled out song requests or derided him for his Christian beliefs.

But what was lost in much of the critical noise then is Dylan's powerful messages of protest/patriotism, fellowship, friendship and love - themes that he had written about in the past - were given additional meaning when a rainbow of promise & hope appeared in his life. That he wanted to share his faith with others made his personal mission to spread the gospel even more wondrous.",
,B00138JAD6,1,1,5,"What a great musically sounding album..great musicians and production,great guitar playing from Dire Straits Mark Knopfler, On keyboards, Barry Beckett even the great Muscle Shoals Horns.
Well, what started as an odyssey on Street Legal became a need for consolation and this temporary abode stretched into 3 albums..This one being the best.
Whereas Saved and Shot Of Love have their good raw passionate wild moments,this first of this trilogy was the mature observant Dylan, not exactly Modern Orthodox as some character out of ""Jewtopia"" the theatre show, but a somewhat ""when you ain't got nothing,you got nothing to loose"" Dylan groping for meaning..
Well Muddy Waters had a song ""You Can't Lose What You Never Had"" (later covered by The Allman Brothers) I think Dylan found that out...his humanism never left nor his traditional Jewish roots, these things can never be lost.
Like a monkey on a tether, no matter how far the monkey strays out,the rope is never cut,he will get yanked back..
The songs speak for themselves,the music is stellar.",
,B00138JAD6,1,1,4,"Slow Train Comming is one of Bob Dylan's 3 Christian/Gospel era recordings.  Even though I am not of Christian faith, I can truly appreciate Dylan's soul searching lyrics.  I Believe In You, Serve Somebody, When You Gonna Wake Up, and most of the others are quite touching especially with Dylan's delivery.  As a matter Dylans vocal performance is near the best of his career.

Slow Train Comming stands strong as compared to Saved in its diverse musical arrangements.  Some songs are fast paced and others slow.  Some are more keyboard driven and others feature Mark Knophler's fine guitar playing.

Overall this is recording is a True winner.",
,B00138JAD6,1,1,4,"Dylan's career epitomizes change. He has buffeted and tossed fans around on a wild sea of change and reinvention since 1965 (when he picked up an electric guitar in defiance of the folk community's unwritten rules). The year 1979 saw his most shocking transition. One that challenged and threatened Dylan's career like no other. Dylan began espousing Christianity and throwing around the term ""born again"". Jerry Wexler, who produced ""Slow Train Coming"", told Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin that ""I had no idea he was on this born-again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me."" Wexler diplomatically told Dylan to back off, but he produced the album anyway. So in the heyday of punk the performer many people associated, fairly or unfairly, with 1960s ""radicalism"" turned explicitly Christian. Not only that, 1978's ""Street Legal"" met with an extremely icy reception. For many fans Dylan's new ""phase"" was too much.

Dylan's ""Christian phase"" (though arguably not a phase) now looks somewhat innocuous from a historical perspective. After two (some say one, some say three) more ""Christian"" albums, Dylan's lyrics morphed once again. Would his career have survived had he plunged permanently into Christian music? Hard to say. Many thought he was through in 1965. He may have simply found a different audience (though in the 1970s that audience would probably have been a small one). Regardless, the 1980s were probably the low point of Dylan's career from many perspectives.

""Slow Train Coming"" is a Christian album. It makes no apologies for this. Though far less preachy than its successor, ""Saved"", the theme of the album remains unmistakable. ""When He Returns"", the album's passionate closer, more than demonstrates this with lines such as ""He's got plans of his own to set up His throne when He returns"".

Whether or not listeners accept this album most likely depends on their attitude towards the lyrics. Because there's nothing wrong with the music on ""Slow Train Coming"". ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" grooves in a way that Dylan had never really grooved previously. ""Precious Angel"" features Mark Knoplfer's distinctive guitar style and probably one of the best Dylan drawls ever recorded: ""Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself. I'm a little too blind to seeeEEEeeeeee."" ""Slow Train"" contains an ominous groove. ""When you Gonna Wake Up"" lashes out at society's failings. Whether one agrees with the religious perspective or not, the criticism here seems valid and constructive. Only ""Man Gave Names To All The Animals"" sounds a little trite. Everything else on ""Slow Train Coming"" receives passion and conviction. Again, whether or not one agrees with the overall message, Dylan's performance is outstanding on this album (it even bagged him a Grammy for ""Best Rock Vocal"" - something his detractors, especially those who find his distinctive voice grating, must have cringed at).

""Slow Train Coming"" just adds proof to the argument that Bob Dylan remains one of the most provocative, controversial, and intruiguing artists of the 20th century. Apart from the music, he's given his fans plenty of challenges, and given future generations an almost insurmountable amount of material to ponder and debate about.",
,B00138JAD6,1,1,5,"All controversy about Dylan's faith aside....

This album is considered to be the best of Bob's gospel albums (with Saved and Shot of Love). The songs here are more varied in style than Saved, and the Christian message is more subtle. It is more of a rock album with Christian lyrics, rather than a Christian rock album. This does not make it any better or worse than Saved or Shot of Love.

From the medium grind of Gotta Serve Somebody to the reggae of Man Gave Names To All the Animals to the simple beauty of I Believe In You, Bob runs a gamut of styles and it all works. The back-up musicians mostly stay out of the way, which sometimes works for Bob and sometimes it doesn't. Here it does. These are beautifully written songs by a man who had found a new passion in his soul.",

,B00138JAD6,1,1,4,"This album was a great shock, understandably, to many people when it came out - almost as much as Self-Portrait was. For that reason, and for Dylan's subsequent backing off from his Born Again phase - which has since received a certain ""cornpone"" status in his mythology - this album is often overlooked by many people. Let me be honest: if it wasn't Bob Dylan who made this album, I probably never would've listened to it, much less bought it. I am not a religous person, and Gospel and Gospel-inflected music are not among my favorites. I held off on buying this and made it one of my last Dylan purchases. However, let me be the first to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised! Odd as it may seem, this album is actually a return for Dylan in many ways. Ever since Blood On The Tracks, Dylan had been dipping his toe into more and more complex musical visions - the international vibe of the Desire album, the Rolling Thunder Revue, the big band-addled Street Legal, and his subequent ""Vegas"" tour - and this album goes back to the stripped-down rock band arrangements that he had long been known for. Whether or not you like it as much as his previous two albums - I don't, personally - it's easy to see that it's more focused, more concise, and that Bob was way more into it. Here we see him, perhaps for the first time ever, trying his hardest to make his music as smooth, polished, and presentable as possible. Clearly, Dylan was trying to reach as many as people as possible with this album, something he had never cared about before. The production by Barry Beckett and Jerry Wexler on this album is immaculate, and still sounds great today. It sounds better than anything he has recorded and released since (with the exception of the re-mastered songs on Biograph.) It's a sad fact that Columbia has neglected the Bob Dylan catalog - without argument, their most important artist - with only one of his albums, Street Legal, being remastered; and this is one of his few albums that still sounds great today. Furthermore, Dylan took even greater steps: hiring the then-in vogue (and terrific) group Dire Straits to be his backing band, and going down to Alabama to record the album with the Muscle Shoals Horns and a full gospel choir. Although the music on this album is not his best, and certainly not his most original, it is a very tight, focused effort. Mark Knopfler has gotten props several times for his playing on this album, and it's easy to see why. The rest of the players, as well as the production, are top-notch as well. The album is not necessarily what you might expect lyrically, either. Certainly, it's steeped highly in Christian imagery and Biblical allusion, particularly that of the book of Revelation. But, Dylan had been weaving Biblical allusions into his lyrics for his entire caree - from early tracks like When The Ship Comes In to practically the entire album John Wesley Harding, to the deeply spiritual-leaning Street Legal. Of course, he had never approached it the way he does on here. They are not merely enrichening the songs, they ARE the songs. The lyrics can be a bit dogmatic at times - and, of course, self-righteous - but you can enjoy, and like, them regardless of your own personal set of beliefs. Even if you don't agree with the opinions expressed within, you can still appreciate them as art. They do often have a very arrogant ring to them - Bob is practically breathing fire and brimstone on some of the tracks! No less a figure than Nick Cave has gone on record as saying that this is his all-time favorite album, citing its ""anger and nastiness... certainly not like the thing you find on most Christian albums."" We get bitter, impassioned performances from Dylan on such songs as Gotta Serve Somebody and Slow Train. He hadn't been this focused and into his material since... well, quite a long time. You can tell he's really into it, and truly pouring his heart out into his vocals and his performances. Standout tracks include the Gotta Serve Somebody, a ""list"" song with some truly biting vocals from Dylan (it's just unbelievably cool to hear him stretch out that word ""somebody""), for which he won a greatly deserved vocal performance Grammy. Precious Angel is nothing less than a love song - a moving ode to the woman who turned him on to Christianity. Slow Train is an absolutely ferocious song that attacks corrupt politics - one of the album's sub-themes - while weaving in much distressing imagery from Revelation. I Believe In You is an absolutely beautiful song about unwavering faith (Dylan as JOB.) To be sure, not all the songs are of this quality, and some even border on embarrassing, now. Still, this is quite a good album, and an essential one for any Dylan fan. Whatever one might say about Dylan's conversion, one thing is certain: it re-invigorated him artistically, and got him interested in his work again and he turned out his most focused and concise album since Blood On The Tracks.",
,B00138JAD6,1,1,4,"Of Dylan's three Christian albums, ascetically this is the best.  SAVED is flat and has too clich to have any True impact for the listener.  SHOT OF LOVE, while having some brilliant moments (although, unfortunately, most of the brilliant moments were left OFF that particular album), never really fully gelled to the vision Dylan seemed to want to take it.  SHOT OF LOVE filled like it was supposed to be a Christian pop album, merging the best of both art forms into a cohesive whole.  When it worked, it really worked (""Every Grain of Sand."")  When it didn't, SHOT OF LOVE just sinks.
And what of SLOW TRAIN COMING?  Well, like SHOT OF LOVE, only half of this record truly gels into truly great material.  The first four songs on Side 1 start the album really strong.  Judging from the momentum these songs have, SLOW TRAIN COMING should have a really strong finish, and would have been one of his best albums.  Sadly, Dylan stalls halfway through the album and as a result SLOW TRAIN COMING is greatly weakened.  The rest of the album becomes craftsmanship instead of art.
That, perhaps, is the best identifier for SLOW TRAIN COMING.  Dylan's obviously focused on these tracks, and you can tell he wants the album to have a contemporary sound (hence Knopler and his gang).  The first four tracks show's Dylan's brilliance in a Christian context.  The remaining five show Dylan in a focused, workman-like determination to come up with a collection of songs that reflect his new found faith.  While there's nothing particularly wrong with these tracks, there's nothing particularly right with them either.
Instead of placing the highlights throughout the album, as he did with STREET-LEGAL and SHOT OF LOVE, Dylan chose to put all the good stuff at the beginning.  Perhaps the reason for this is to win sympathy for the album and to carry the record through to the end, but for this listener I just want to push stop and eject after the first four tracks have gone by.  The listening frustration is more intense on SLOW TRAIN COMING because of this fact.  When Dylan strikes gold, he really hits it big time.  The rest just appear as songs that anyone could have written, and sometimes the dogma makes for rather odd songs (""Man Gave Names To All The Animals"").  ""Man"" is the most interesting track off the second side and that is because it's so strange and musically it's reggae.  Other than that, while Dylan's commitment to his faith and his desire to channel this faith into his art is indeed an admirable cause, in the end there's only about a side here worth really looking at.  The rest are good, just a long way from the brilliance of the first four cuts.
As the first album in the Christian Trilogy, it is the best.  The contrast between the brilliant tracks and the just so tracks becomes much more apparent in SHOT OF LOVE than SLOW TRAIN COMING.  The worst material on here still stands as serviceable tracks, just not brilliant tracks.  SHOT OF LOVE, however, is cluttered with material that just barely makes the cut ascetically, yet the brilliant stuff of that album is even better than the first four songs here, so the extremes are more fully realised on SHOT OF LOVE than on SLOW TRAIN COMING.  As for ""Every Grain of Sand,"" nothing here matches that, but that is only one song and one song cannot make an album (listen to ""In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida"" for proof).  We won't even talk about SAVED.
 In relation to STREET-LEGAL, this album seemed to be a natural progression.  Dylan is always one for trying something different and new.  Lyrically, there are cuts on STREET-LEGAL is on rival with the best of his 1960s material.  The last cut (""Where are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat)"") shows Dylan struggling to find something in his life worth caring about.  Here is the answer to that question.
Bottom line:  Dylan getting religion, while spiritually the most important thing a person can do, only results in fair material with some brilliant moments.  Of his three Christian albums, this is the one to get.  Just like his three longer albums (BLONDE ON BLONDE, SELF-PORTRAIT, and TIME OUT OF MIND), the middle one in this trilogy is an absolute disaster area.  Get SLOW TRAIN COMING, then SHOT OF LOVE, and if you really feel you need to own SAVED, well, go ahead.  Don't say I didn't warn you though.

P. S.  They should have included the outtake ""Ye Shall Be Changed,"" a very good song that would have helped this release out.  It's on THE BOOTLEG SERES VOL 1-3.",
,B00138JAD6,1,1,5,"Fans who have long preferred Dylan's rebellious, folksy lyrics won't be disappointed. In a market which often pushes Christianity to the gospel music genre, Dylan steps up and gives us his best music in years.
""I  Believe in You,"" is the story of a person who is rejected because of  his faith but doesn't flinch. Dylan hits on a theme universal to anyone who  has believed in something intangible. Autobiographical, he sings about the  public's reaction... they wanted him to sing terribly politically incorrect  lyrics like ""just like a woman..."" when he wanted to sing about  his new found faith in Christ, equally politically incorrect.
""Gotta  Serve Somebody"" is witty and insightful, and has a great urban  old-school gospel flavor to it.
""Man Gave Names to All the  Animals"" is a funny look at what Adam's first job was in Eden.
I  fully recommend it.

,B00138JD1U,1,1,5,"This is trio Phillips, Craig, & Dean's third worship CD.  I love their first two, and was quite eager to get this one.  I wasn't disappointed.

Unlike the first two, this one only had two songs I was familiar with.  The ""In Christ Alone"" medley takes the recent praise chorus and combines it with the chorus to the song of the same name made famous by Michael English.  I was surprised to learn that Shawn Craig had written the song before the group formed.  The other song is ""Wonderful Merciful Savior.""  I've recently learned this great chorus, and their version of it is outstanding.

As with previous projects, the guys contribute a couple songs of their own.  ""Because I'm Forgiven"" focuses on the reason we praise God.  ""Be the Praise of My Heart"" recognizes that True worship comes from every action of our lives and not just the songs we sing.  ""Awake My Soul"" is a prayer to be surrendered to God and become more like Him.  Finally, ""Mighty is the Power of the Cross"" reflects on what was done for us on the cross.

The rest of the songs are great as well.  The CD opens with ""Friend of God,"" a joyful song about the mind-blowing idea that the God of the universe calls us friend.  I actually heard ""You are God Alone"" on the radio before I got the CD and couldn't wait to get my own copy.

Every song on this CD focuses praise on God for all He's done for us and who He is.  Music doesn't get much better then this.",

TO GET TO YOU contains 5 new songs, with 12 of her hits. The new tracks are pretty good, especially the ballads. Lorrie sounds just like Tammy Wynette when she sings her song ""Another Lonely Song"", great song. The title track is a great ballad about love and devotion, same with ""If I Cry"". Her rendition of ""Angel"" (from a concert) is chilling. ""Whoop-de-do"" is not the best but it's a fun piece of fluff. There's some big hits here too, including ""Good As I Was To You"", ""Go Away"", ""One of Those Nights Tonight"", ""Standing Tall"", ""We Both Walk"", ""Half Enough"", ""By My Side"", ""He Talks To Me"", ""Something In Red"", and more. Overall a pretty solid compilation, and the best one out there right now for Lorrie.",
,B00138KJI6,1,1,5,"There have been several compilations of Lorrie's music featuring various hits, but none of them are definitive, though this is the best yet. Among the hits included here are We both walk, Half enough, Good as I was to you, I guess you had to be there, Train wreck of emotion, Standing tall and Something in red.
Apart from the hits, this collection contains five new recordings. These include a live cover of Angel (a Sarah McLachlan song) and an excellent cover of Another lonely night, one of Tammy Wynette's less heralded classic songs. There is nobody better suited to singing Tammy's classics, as Lorrie has been divorced almost as often as Tammy. The other three new tracks are To get to you, If I cry and Whoop-de-do.
Lorrie, like me, has very eclectic musical tastes and it shows in her choice of material. Unfortunately, many people these days prefer singers to choose a particular style and stick to it. Because of that, Lorrie's determination to record a variety of material has limited her success. Unquestionably blessed with one of the finest voices in contemporary country music, Lorrie should be a bigger star than she actually is.
If you only want one collection of Lorrie's music, this is the one to choose. Many of the missing hits can be found on her CD in the RCA country legends series. I've already reviewed that and recommend it if you enjoy this and want to explore further.",
,B00138KJI6,1,1,4,"Lorrie released another Greatest Hits collection in 2000 called TO GET TO YOU. It marked the end of her relationship with RCA/BNA. Not long before, in 1995 she released GREATEST HITS, but this offers a more comprehensive collection of her songs, from that album, and from the hits that came after that. As well there are 5 new songs worth raving about. Starting with the tongue-in-cheek ""Whoop-de-do"", a song with plenty of attitude, its a fun song and nice to see this side of Lorrie. Then there is the beautiful, love and devotion ballad ""To Get To You"" which Lorrie just masters with her impecable vocals. ""If I Cry"" is another power ballad, and could have been a big hit if given a chance. She also covers the Sarah McLaughlan song ""Angel"", and gives her own magic to this touching song. Perhaps one of the most talked about tracks is the Tammy Wynette cover of ""Another Lonely Song"", which Lorrie does justice to very well! Also includes her hits such as ""Good As I Was To You"", ""One Of Those Nights Tonight"", ""Go Away"", ""Something In Red"", ""Maybe Not Tonight"" With Sammy Kershaw, and plenty of others.

The 5 new songs are fantastic, and will leave you begging for a new album from Lorrie. ""To Get To You"" is a beautiful power ballad, where you can feel the emotion and passion that Lorrie puts into every note. Definately my favorite of the new songs. Lorrie does a remake of ""Another Lonely Song""  which shows off Lorrie's traditional country voice, a tribute to Tammy Wynette, as only Lorrie could cover a song by the late country diva. ""If I Cry"" is another emotional ballad that will leave you breathless, she sings with so much passion and emotion. ""Whoop-De-Do"" is an upbeat song, a bit of a departure from her usual music, but its fun and you can tell she enjoyed doing it. ""Angel"" is Lorrie's cover of the Sarah McLaughlin hit, she does it just as well, this one is a live track that will make you want to cry.
The hits on this album are We Both Walk, Half Enough, By My Side (with Jon Randall), Good As I Was To You, Go Away, One Of Those Nights Tonight, Maybe Not Tonight (with Sammy Kershaw), I Guess I Had to Be There, Trainwreck of Emotion, Standing Tall, He Talks to Me and the classic Something in Red.

,B00138KIVE,1,1,5,"Bad news first: ""You Don't Love Me"" is a disappointment, and a big one at that. I understand you can't expect a bunch of guys who are a combined twenty billion hundred million thousand whatever years old at that point to, in the immortal words of either Franz Kafka or George Clinton (not sure which one), ""tear the roof off the sucker"" like they used to do back in ""the day"" (no, not that day, the other day), but it's still kind of stoic and boring. Now, the good news: everything else is far better. Especially when the group just jams - ""Back Where It All Begins"", for instance, might even be better than the studio version. And you know how they always slightly vary ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"" when they play it live? Well, here's it's all acoustic! And it's sweet! Especially when it comes to the soloing. Now, here's a proposal for a bill that should be signed into federal law: all bands must record and release at least one song with an acoustic guitar solo. Hey, I'd vote for it. Oh, and there's a bass solo! I mean, how cool is that? And ""The Same Thing"" has some fantastic heavy blues licks - it's about the heaviest the group has ever gotten, in fact. Their Bo Diddley tribute ""Nobody to Run with"" (one of the four songs from Where It All Begins, along with ""Back Where It All Begins"", ""Soulshine"" and ""Sailin' 'Cross the Devil's Sea"" - all three are awesome) is good fun, as it was on the studio version. And they save (arguably) the best for last with ""Jessica"", with some slight shifts in tempo that give it an epic feel, as well as the usual great guitars that this incarnation of the band has in spades. It won a Grammy, and I understand why. It might even be better than the classic original. But that's a tough call. Oh, and look for the ""There Is a Mountain"" quote. Think they were feeling nostalgic? This is by far the best of the two ""Evening With"" sets, though both are fantastic - it easily ranks up there with the classic live albums of yore.",
,B00138KIVE,1,1,5,"An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band 2nd Set (1995) was recorded in 1994 at shows in Raleigh, NC and New Jersey's Garden State Arts Center. This was during the Back Where It All Begins period, and there are four songs from that album included here.

The opening song, Sailin' Cross The Devil's Sea sounds great, a lot like the studio version, and features Gregg Allman's legendary blues growl. Gregg and Warren Haynes both shine on this inspired version of Warren's Soulshine. Dickey Betts' Latin-flavored and breezy Back Where It All Begins features a long guitar jam, where he and Warren trade interesting and enthusiastic solos. They also do a great job on No One To Run With.

They dip into the At Fillmore East catalog with a very good version of You Don't Love Me, and while not as ambitious as the 20+ minute Fillmore East version, it is very good, and Dickey even flashes back to the earlier version by quoting his guitar solo from it. It's really an amusing and touching moment, and it sounds good, too. They also do a nice cover of another old blues song, The Same Thing.

This recording of Jessica won the Allmans their first and only Grammy Award, and what a wonderful version of Jessica this is! With dual guitar harmonies and more bongo drums and percussion than the studio version, the song sounds almost completely different from the original, and stretches out over sixteen minutes.

Even with all this, the real highlight on the album is the breathtaking unplugged version of In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! The newbies who think Dickey Betts is no more than a mediocre guitarist should listen to this, and then reconsider. Warren Haynes stays right up there with him. The two guitarist show what they can really do on acoustic guitars, and bassist Allen Woody shines, too. This is priceless, a real gem that no ABB fan would want to miss.

Like the First Set, the 2nd Set was produced by music legend (and At Fillmore East producer), Tom Dowd, and the sound is exquisitely crisp and crystal clear. The clever packaging on both sets is almost identical, with the same cover photo, except the First Set is blue, the 2nd Set is red, and the photos inside and liner notes are different (the layout is the same).

This was a good place in time for The Allman Brothers Band and their fans, and it really shows on An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band, First Set and 2nd Set. Don't miss out on em'!",
,B00138KIVE,1,1,4,"The title of this CD is misleading.  It is not the 2nd set from the earlier ""An Evening With the Allman Brothers-First Set"".
In 1989, the Allman Brothers reformed, adding Warren Haynes on guitar and Allen Woody on bass.  They recorded the studio albums ""Seven Turns"" and ""Shades of Two Worlds"".  Next came ""An Evening With the Allman Brothers"", which was recorded in 1991.  On the cover in little print, was written ""First Set"".  They then recorded the studio album ""Where It All Belongs"".  In 1994 they went on tour again, and released a CD from the tour called ""2nd Set"".
This CD is very good, but not quite as good as the ""First Set"".  The old songs are played in new and exciting ways.  The acoustic version of ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"", is very interesting (but not stunning).  The new songs are all very good.  The real show piece is ""Back To Where We Belong"".  It ends with a 15 minute version of ""Jessica"" that doesn't sound very much like ""Jessica"".  There is alot of jamming and playing around with bits of ""Mountain Jam"" thrown in.  There are no bad spots in the CD, but it doesn't have the continous intensity of the ""First Set"".
Note that ""First Set"", ""2nd Set"" and ""Seven Turns"" can be bought together as low priced packaged set.
After this CD, Haynes and Woody left the group to concentrate on their side project Gov't Mule.  Woody died last year and Haynes is now playing with Phil Lesh and Friends.  The Allman Brothers reformed once more, with Butch Trucks' nephew on guitar.  Dickie Betts has been temporarily kicked out of the band.",

But, this album opened up a whole new world of music to me .. now THIS is how a soprano sax should sound. It is beautiful. Sidney Bechet is (or was) a True genius, the way he made the horn almost operatic in sound, with the wonderful throbbing vibratos. No wonder he was sometimes billed as ""The Talking Saxophone"".

Since that song faded out on the airwaves, it's been a pretty low-profile for the band. Well, here we are in 2006, the band has ditched their turntablist/backing vocalist and have emerged with a new album, ""Falling Away"" that promises more and more radio-play, with each and every song seemingly tailor-made for mainstream rock stations.

Does anything live up to the catchiness and effect of their one big hit? Well, like their debut, the answer is pretty much ""no."" There are a few songs that show True growth and improvement, such as ""Breathing Slowly"" ""Never Coming Home"" and ""Washing The World Away."" Songs like ""Invincible"" and ""Someday,"" however, come across as feeble attempts to recapture that magic. For those who dug the rap-rock vibes of the first CD, you'll be disappointed to find that element is missing (thanks to a missing member, I presume). Personally, I think they're the better for it, but if ""Death Trend Setta"" was your thing, you'll probably hate this album.

I'm not gonna say this album is all bad. The three tracks I mentioned are definitely worth looking into this album for, and catchy rock-filler like ""Anchor"" and ""Falling Away"" help make it a more appealing listen. It's a better album than the first one, but still a far cry from greatness. The sad fact is that Crossfade's sound is nothing overly original or inspiring. Just simple modern-rock for the masses -- not that there's anything wrong with that...",

COMMENTS: Judging by the lack of reviews here on Amazon, Crossfade's popularity is waning. Outside of the occasional ""Cold"" from their 2004 debut, and a quick run of ""Invincible"" from this album when it was first released in August '06... I'm not hearing Crossfade on the radio. The problem here is... the songs are down-right average. The players are competent, but the melodies just aren't memorable. The other issue is there are too many bands putting out the same style of music... but, with better tunes (out of the group listed above, Breaking Benjamin is probably the best). With that being said, there are some decent songs here - the opener ""Washing The World Away"", the semi-hit ""Invincible"", the moderate rocker ""Breathing Slowly"", and the piano ballad closer ""Never Coming Home"". Crossfade's debut was better, but not by much (at least it had one full fledged hit). ""Falling Away"" is a tamer group of songs - an average album that meets and occasionally exceeds expectations (2.5 stars).",

,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,"Having finished with Blood, Sweat & Tears and their debut album ""Child Is Father To The Man"" in 1968  AL KOOPER found himself the in-house Producer at Columbia Records in need of a project. So he calls up ex Electric Flag and Paul Butterfield Blues band ace guitarist MIKE BLOOMFIELD and together they determine to make a 'quickie'  a Blues and Soul jam album they'll pump out in one manic session. They get down enough material for one whole side of an LP (a couple of covers and some originals) - but Kooper needs the remainder. With Bloomfield flown the coup (chasing things other than the blues)  Kooper called in ex Buffalo Springfield guitar/songwriting whizz Stephen Stills to record the rest. And out of these most unlikely of 'sessions'  history was born. Columbia CS 9701 (Stereo) peaked on the LP chart at an impressive 12 and started a run of superstar jam sessions - all trying to capture the same lighting in a bottle (common consensus agrees that few got near it).

Al Kooper's liner notes explain that he's gone back with Engineer ALLAN TUCKER to the original master tapes and 24-bit remastered the album to CD. And in keeping with fan-requests over the decades  he's taken off the 'horn' overdubs put on the long jam sessions so devotees of this iconic and cool 60ts album can finally hear Bloomfield workouts like ""Albert's Shuffle"" and ""Season Of The Witch"" 'sans horns' (see bonus tracks 10 and 11). They are magnificent and arguably up there with the best Bonus Tracks ever issued. All in all - you have to say that given what they had to work with  Kooper and Tucker have done a bang-up job. Here is the 'Man's Temptation'...

The 12-page booklet has an opening 'Producers Note' from All Kooper not just explaining the recordings but the CD reissue and his 'without horns' 2002 remixes. BRUCE DICKINSON was Executive Producer for the re-release and both the Michael Thomas original LP liner notes and the David Fricke Rolling Stone Review are reproduced (four-stars from Robert who spends much of his time raving about Bloomfield when Kooper's contribution was just as big if not more in my books). There are some black and white session photos and not much else. ALLAN TUCKER did the Mastering at Foothill Digital Studios in New York and the Audio is fantastic  full of power and presence and that sense of immediacy the recordings had anyway (the Bonus Cuts are beautifully transferred too).

It opens with a Bloomfield/Kooper Instrumental called ""Albert's Shuffle""  nearly nine-minutes of Shuggie Otis type Blues with Bloomfield shouting as he solos  Kooper letting loose on the keys (an organ sound most would kill to get). Next up is the uber-cool ""Stop""  an instrumental cover of a Howard Tate soul tune on Verve Records from December 1967 (Verve VK 10573). Ive loved this slinky little ditty for decades now and it still has that 60ts chug about it that utterly sends me. Next up is the first vocal by Al Kooper on their version of Curtis Mayfield's ""Man's Temptation""  a song about a temptress who wants to ""...ruin my happy home with man's temptation... But then we get the magnificent band really cooking on another Bloomfield/Kooper creation ""His Holy Modal Majesty""  a 9:19 minute Organ/Guitar battle that feels like Santana gone Prog by way of the Blues (and I still don't know what the title means). Side 1 ends on the Traditional Slow Blues vibe of ""Really""  5:26 minutes of Bloomfield letting rip on the frets while Kooper puts in huge chords on the Organ (very tasty mama).

Side 2 has always been problematic for me. It opens with A Stephen Stills take on Dylan's ""It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry"" and to me it immediately sounds like the album has gone off the rails. The tune is OK  but thematically it comes over like poor mans Monkees instead of the fresh Bluesy workouts we were getting on Side 1. Things are brought back from the brink big time by the stunning 11:08 minutes of ""Season Of the Witch"" (a Donovan cover they did on the Side 1 all-day session). Columbia and CBS edited both it and ""Albert's Shuffle"" down to fit on the A&B-sides of a 45 in October 1968 (CBS 3770 in the UK, Columbia 44657 in the USA)  but it did little business despite the success of the album (it's a no-show here due to time constraints). Back to weird with the Hendrix flange cover of a Willie Cobbs tune called ""You Don't Love Me"" which again is good  but still feels wildly out of kilter with the rest of the record. Then we enter mellow Jazz Soul territory with the saxophone-led ""Harvey's Tune""  another out of step instrumental that sounds like it should be in a Blaxploitation film instead of on this album. But then you're hit with four corkers...

While the album has its incongruous moments  the bonus tracks act as an impossibly brilliant counterpoint  the first three sounding like the powerhouse Blues Session that should have been released. Why ""Blues For Nothing"" was left off the album and mediocrity like ""Harvey's Tune"" left on is a total mystery (4:15 minutes) and the two album cuts minus-the-horns actually seem to free the songs and focus you completely on the dynamic duo  Al Kooper on Organ and Mike Bloomfield on Guitar. ""Season Of The Witch"" is the prize here and stretches to its full 11:08 minutes - stripped and raw - it has a renewed power that's thrilling. As if this is not satisfying enough  the live Instrumental Blues of ""Fat Grey Cloud"" is fantastic  Bloomfield joking first about 'tuning' then letting rip  wild one second  Soulful Bluesy the next  with Kooper following after - pumping out an Organ Sound that is huge (4:39 minutes).

In truth the original album is probably more four-stars than five - but this genius CD reissue with those stunning bonus tracks bumps it up again.

""...You've got to pick up every stitch...""  Kooper sings in their funky cover of Donovan's Sixties-sinister ""Season Of The Witch"". And it seems that anything from that incredible 'super session' was indeed worth picking up...",
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,excellent,
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,Classic Blues Disc redone in Digital.,
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,great,
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,"Great album, can't go wrong. Must have as I have listened to it from when it came out. I personally like the Stephen Stills songs better. Sound quality is great.",
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,I have this album on the old vinyl but while I still listen to it on the turntable I decided to get a cd and perhaps save the vinyl for the future.,
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,"Not much that I can add to the other reviews except concur that this is indeed a classic album. I've been listening to --- and buying --- music for 40 years, but only recently heard this album in its entirety about buying the CD. Wow, and double wow! This is definitely worthy of the hype and the glowing reviews and the legendary status its received over the years. Few albums that I've heard have so successfully merged rock with blues and jazz, and throw in some soul and country and few psychedelic flourishes while you're at it. And this musical stew sounds amazingly natural and effortless. Brilliant musicians on fire, as you would expect, but there are some great songs on here too, not just a bunch of guys jamming. Most impressive stuff.",
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,"Super Sessions is a pretty unique album.  First of all I went into the album having very little experience with Mike Bloomfield despite numerous reviews convincing me of the genius and spectacular beauty of Bloomfield's guitar style.  Well guess what?  I DO love the mans style!  It takes a while to warm up to it however, and this is mainly because he plays at such an intense speed that there's hardly any time to catch your breath!  You need to hear it several times in a row to absorb and understand it!

Now when I first heard ""Albert's Shuffle"" a thought occured to me... ""MOVE over Eric Clapton!"" because it sounds almost identical to some of Clapton's heavy blues stuff such as the live version of ""Have You Ever Loved a Woman?"" from his EC Was Here live album.  It definitely falls under the same category of emotionally resonant blues, but regardless who influenced who (though I think Clapton beat him to the punch but I could be wrong, hehe) this song is downright amazing.  Amazing how the guitar solos build through several layers of emotions and THEN to add more excitement, a keyboard solo makes an appearance around the halfway point, and it's a highly melodic keyboard solo at that.  It's an interesting change of pace going from emotional guitar solos to melodic keyboard work.  Perhaps the light touch of jazz after the keyboard solo is a bit much, but then again, this IS 1968 and considering this is what I believe the beginning of the classic years of rock, it's quite a performance.  There's definitely nothing lacking or incomplete about this album overall, that's for sure.  ""Really"" falls under the same category- emotional guitar playing, melodic keyboard solos, jazzy tendencies, etc.  Another high point.

I absolutely LOVE ""His Holy Modal Majesty"".  In fact I actually first heard this song a few years ago on XM radio.  What caught my attention is the bass groove that can be heard during the first couple minutes, and... I had to do a google search to find THIS out, but the musical instrument jamming with the groove is something called an ondioline.  Don't even ASK me how to pronounce that, haha.  It's a high pitched instrument that's somewhere in between an early synthesizer and a keyboard.  Well whatever it is, it would probably irritate the pants off of me if it were to linger a few minutes longer BUT for just a couple minutes?  I can tolerate a couple minutes of a weird instrument!  Heck I can tolerate extreme pain for 2 minutes!  Well then again I've never been tortured.  Don't get any ideas!  :)

Anyway, that bass groove is... WOW!  It makes ""His Holy Modal Majesty"" the best song on the album for me.  It reminds me of something kinky or rather, an Egyptian girl being kinky, hehe.  The rest of the song is occupied with fast-paced blues solos that are pretty melodic for the most part.

""Season of the Witch"" is the highlight for many people since it's the most familiar song here.  Well truth be told I never thought it was *that* great of a song- a slow-chugging, slightly ominous vocal melody that actually reminds me of Neil Young's ""Down By The River"" for some reason, and the jazziness we eventually experience is... eh, a bit much.  Not a bad song by any means, and this is by FAR the best version of it too.  11 minutes is just too much for my limited attention span I'm afraid!  Though it IS really melodic so at least it has that going for it.  ""Stop"" is based around really cool, melodic blues guitar and keyboard soloing.  Once again, the keyboard work strikes me as immediatley melodic whereas the guitar solos are a bit on the complex side so it takes time to search for the melodic lines.  It's awesome though.  ""Harvey's Tune"" is an atmospheric jazz instrumental.  I love it.

""Man's Temptation"" is a soulful tune with really beautiful and memorable vocals.  I love the creative inclusion of horns as well.  Yes there's hundreds of 60's songs that closely resemble this one in terms of atmosphere, arrangements and vocals but I don't care- I'll take them ALL!  ""You Don't Love Me"" is dominated with the ULTRA cool phase shifter effect.  You'll know what I mean when you hear it.  It sounds like you're in a spaceship and headed for Saturn!  I wonder if todays technology can recreate this particular sound?  I haven't heard this effect used in any music after the mid 70's.  It must have went out of style.  Anyway this is a blues/hard rock song similar to Robin Trower's early work, and it's awesome.  ""It Takes a Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train To Cry"" reminds me of the mid 60's Byrds with a fast-paced, psychedelic part-country style.  Those feel good vibes are in high quantity here as well.

Overall, it's super duper Super Sessions!  Pick it up for a solid taste of Mike Bloomfield, Stephen Stills and Al Kooper (though for me Bloomfield CLEARLY steals the spotlight).",
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,"Back in 1968, rock was in clubs, not areans. After the bands had finished their sets, late night jams were routine labratories. Hendrix, Jefforson Airplane, all the bands now in the pantheon hanging out and playing.

This album is gives you a good idea of what this sounded like. Super Session is Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield and Stephan Stills, backed by one of  the most underrated bassists of the era, Electric Flag's Harvey Brooks. (Bloomfield was in the same band.)

On the bill are blues jams, a few Kooper tunes, and a  fantastic jam on ""Season Of The Which"" by Donovan. These are the best players, and the jams have the craft of most studio albums.

Bloomfield and Stills have very dfferent approaches to the guitar, and listening to the differences are one of the many perks to this album.",
,B00138KN0A,1,1,4,"I can't give this album a full 5 stars, but it's close, and certainly a classic of its type.  Not many artists could pull off a rather loose ""jam"" session and have it hold up as well as this has.  It just shows how much class and talent Al Kooper has.  Tough enough, but how about when Mike Bloomfield fails to show on the 2nd day of the sessions, and Al has to recruit Steve Stills at literally the last minute.  All things considered, it's amazing that this album even saw the light of day, much less that it is considered a sort of classic of its type.

But let's explore that.  Among jazz musicians, jam sessions are quite normal, but it's usually a bit different for rock musicians.  In this case, Al was as much of a jazz afficiando as he was blues, soul and rock, so he probably relished the idea to get Bloomfield and a good rhythm section, a couple of tunes he and Mike wanted to cover, and see what would happen.  They did exactly that (at least for one day) and the results are pretty impressive.  There are a few miscues: The phasing on ""You Don't Love Me"" is very dated and gets annoying quickly.

But still, if you can overlook the quirks and the obvious holes that are inevitably going to be there, there is a great spirit to this set.  Sometimes living dangerously brings out what playing it safe could never get you, and I think that's what happens here.  The adventure outweighs the lack of preparation, and the results are a truly unique listening experience.",
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,"In 1968 ""Super Session"" helped take rock & roll to a whole new level. It pushed the envelope passed the 2 and 3 minute danceable pop songs, creating a longer more progressive rock pallet, paying more attention to technical and subtle aspects of the music. The three musicians that created the super group, Al Kooper (piano/organ/ondioline/vocals/guitars - Blood Sweat & Tears), Mike Bloomfield (guitar - Bob Dylan's ""Highway 61 Revisited"", Electric Flag), and Stephen Stills (guitar - Crosby, Stills Nash [& Young], Buffalo Springfield), were all ""on hiatus"" from their most recent engagements. The three of them never actually played ""together"", instead it was split into sets of Kooper/Bloomfield and the other by Kooper/Stills. The band was backed by a powerful rhythm section as well, Harvey Brooks (bass - Miles Davis, Bob Dylan's ""Highway 61 Revisited"") and Eddie Hoh (drums - The Monkees) as well as Barry Goldberg (electric piano - Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, Electric Flag).

The heavy Electric Chicago blues works beautifully on the Kooper/Bloomfield originals, ""Albert's Shuffle"", ""Stop"", and ""Man's Temptation"". The arrangements are precise, fluid and melodic. Kooper's organ solos provide a groovy melodic edge to the music. ""Man's Temptation"" is a very soulful number, reminiscent of Blood, Sweat & Tears. The 9 minute trippy waltz of ""His Holy Modal Majesty"" features the longest jam on the Kooper/Bloomfield side. The track also features Koopers electric keyboard-manipulated ondioline, sounding kind of like a tenor sax, although very unique.

Due to health issues, Bloomfield was unable to finish the recording of ""Super Session"". This is where Steven Stills came in. He's first heard on a rendition of Bob Dylan's ""It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry"". Still's biggest highlight on the album and a personal favorite of mine is ""Season of the Witch"". This 11 minute epic song displays the boiling chemistry Kooper and Stills have working together, offering inspired interaction between the two. ""You Don't Love Me"" allows Stills to play some heavy amplified distorted lead guitar, sounding a bit like Jimi Hendrix.

This is one of those albums that age very well. Upon my first listen roughly a year ago, I was blown away at how fresh it sounded after all these years. It is unlike anything I've ever heard, offering influence in a big way to the Electric Chicago blues and rock and roll movement. I am very pleased to say that the remastered version of this album, done by Al Kooper himself, sounds awesome, loud and clear. That's something that fans of the original vinyl release will be anxious to snatch up.",
,B00138KN0A,1,1,5,"This is one of the finest blues records of all time with the tastiest blues guitar you'll every hear from masters Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield and Steve Stills--how could you miss?.  It also has 4 real decent bonus tracks with the Albert's Shuffle remix being absolutely PHAT.  You will love this disc and be totally inspired by it.  Buy it!",
,B00138KN0A,1,1,4,"This CD shows two things, one the brilliance of Bloomfield's playing and two, just how far he had fallen as a result of his Heroin addiction.  After nine hours of recording, Bloomfield and Kooper completed Bloomfield's ""Albert's Shuffle"", ""His Holy Modal Majesty"" and ""Really"", Howard Tate's ""Stop"", and Curtis Mayfield's ""Man's Temptation"". At the completion of these first five tunes, Bloomfield packed up his things and abruptly left the studio. Kooper wanted to complete the recording so he picked up the phone and called Stephen Stills.  Still's agreed to finish the sessions.  As such you get two very different sounding recordings here.  The first half--Kooper and Bloomfield which contains some very nice blues and classic Bloomfield guitar. The last half features Kooper and Stills complete with jangly guitar and Buffalo Springfield like vocals.  The disc is rounded out with some added bonus material featuring remix versions of ""Albert's Shuffle"" and ""Season of the Witch"" without the horns and two others. An added bonus is ""Fat Grey Clound"" which is a masterpiece in itself. On the other hand, while this disc has some good tunes on it the addition of Stills and absence of Bloomfield leaves the recording with a hodgepodge quality.  As an alternative or in addition to this disc, check out the ""Lost Concert Tapes"".",
,B00138KN0A,-1,-1,2,"So do we really need to hear this? I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on.
Give credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard. Caveat emptor (that's let the buyer beware for all of you from LI).",

,B0013AGEP6,1,1,5,One of the greatest hits from Modest Mouse and still good to this day.,
,B0013AGEP6,1,1,5,I play this song everywhere I go.  I love it.,
,B0013AGEP6,1,1,5,"When Modest Mouse hit the scene with this song a few years ago, it took awhile for the modern rock crowd to accept originality and great riffs in their music. In fact, it probably wouldn't have hit #1 if it hadn't been for Nickelback being in the studio with their best-seller. But when they finally came around to the song, they saw it for what it was, an original rock piece that would go down as a rock classic from the 2000's, and a riff that would go down in history as the bumper-music for many a radio program.

Right off the bat, you get those classic rock riffs that just scream awesome with every note. They're memorable, rockin', and most importantly, original. The verses continue the trend with the catchiness and the trademark Modest Mouse style. It might not make the most sense at first, but it all blends in one amazing song. And even though those trademark Modest Mouse vocals are incredibly hard to work-around usually, in this song they're perfect. Nope, original songs require original vocals. No Nickelback notes are allowed here.

Overall, this is going to be one of those songs that goes down in those Rolling Stone best of music books. It's original in every manner, and it has great riffs and chords to keep you rockin' through the night. Modest Mouse's best by a mile, and it's nice to know there's still classic rock ruling the radio waves.",

,B0013AUH36,1,1,5,"GOOD VOICE LIKE THIS VERSION REALLY WELL EXECUTED, I WILL RECOMMEND THIS SONG TO MY FRIENDS LOVE IT MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU ALL",
,B0013AUH36,1,1,5,My Wife loves this song because our Niece sang it in church at a Christmas program. It has lots of good memories attached to it.,
,B0013AUH36,1,1,5,This song makes me cry almost every time I hear it. It definitely touches my heart. The words are very moving. I would recommend this song very much so!!!,
,B0013AUEMU,-1,-1,3,The music is much better suited as background for the excellent DVD of the series.  The music by itself is monotonous and doesn't have the same impact as it does in the DVD.  Your money would be better spent on the DVD series!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
,B0013AUH36,1,1,5,I have never heard any one sing this song as good as he can. This song was buteifull the way that he sings it.,
,B0013AUH36,1,1,5,Someone recommended this recording to me so I purchased it and I am very pleased with the song.  I listen at Christmas time.,
,B0013AUH36,1,1,5,"Clay Aiken sings this song beautifully. It's one of my favorite songs for Christmas. It is so touching when you listen to the words. Can't imagine how Mary must've felt when she looked at her Son, knowing who He was!",
,B0013AUH36,1,1,5,Beautiful praise music to relax and enjoy!  Wonderful purchase for anyone wanting to offer prayer through music.  A must buy.,
,B0013AUH36,1,1,4,Very passionate and moving. I can't get it out of my head. I'll probably still be singing it in July.,
,B0013AUH36,1,1,5,"I love this song.  I have heard it many times from many different artists, but Clay's rendition is by far my favorite.  Hope you do too.",
,B0013AUEMU,1,1,5,"WOW!! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!! and I was so glad they made a soundtrack for it, I hope they make DVD's and videos of the shows!! THIS CD IS FILLED WITH GREAT MUSIC...GET IT!!
QAF every sunday at 10:00!!",
,B0013AU94I,1,1,5,"A gret song and singer, I got this to download otoa cd so I could have all my favorites on sveral cds, I would recomend and yes will get more in the future",
,B0013AU94I,1,1,4,"I am a fan and love this type of singing but i also like metalica, miley cyrus, and kid rock, so go figure.",
,B0013AV1K4,1,1,5,"I'm not a special fan of Temirkanov. I find most of his readings ""average""
whether not boring. But this Scherezade have been a real revelation. It is
a wonderful, thrilling and exciting reading, a special version where every
important feature finds its place. Perhaps there's a lack of a final punch
to reach the levels of legendary versions such as Reiner, Beecham or Igor
Markevitch's. However, this is one of the most succesful recordings from
digital era, with special mention to the wonderfully taken sound. A safe
recommendation.",
,B0013AV1K4,1,1,5,"As far as sound quality of classical cds go, you really have to pay attention to the fine print and here it's DDD.  That makes all the difference as this recording is one of the best-sounding classical recordings I have ever heard and is currently the best classical cd, sound quality-wise, that I own.  I'm sure the fact that this recording was made in the early 90s must have also helped but as far as this being a worthy cover of Rimsky-Korsakov's brilliant masterpiece is concerned, fear not as Yuri Temirkanov and the New York Philharmonic have done an excellent job here.  Great sound quality and wonderful performances of a brilliant work of music make this very highly recommended indeed.",
,B0013AV1K4,1,1,5,"Not only is the recording quality first-class, but this is an excellent performance of Scheherazade (and I've heard quite a few!).
Very dynamic recording... does NOT sound ""compressed"".  Crank it up and demonstrate your stereo system!",
,B0013AUYUW,1,1,5,"I had the great pleasure of recently hearing Emanuel Ax in recital playing Chopin and Schumann. He has the combination of superb virtuoso technique, great tonal beauty, and strong intellect. I never find his playing boring or unexciting. The audience in Chicago always adores him and I hope we will contiue to see him frequently. These two discs are available at an incredible low price. If you enjoy Ax in Chopin please check out his Brahms concertos and late Brahms solo piano Opus 117-119. He has recorded a lot of chamber music with Ma. I would start with the Chopin disc which has the cello sonata and also includes the early trio with Frank on the violin. The Beethoven cello sonatas with Ma are also worth exploring.",
,B0013AUYUW,1,1,5,"I think Emanuel Ax has settled into routine playing as he's aged, but these are premiere Chopin interpretations from two decades ago. Now that Sony and BMG have merged their classical divisions, it's possible to issue Ax's excellent 1985 reading of the four Ballades--the best ever done by an American--with a 1988 recital of Mazurkas and the four Scherzi. The first recital was originally on RCA, the second on Sony. But just to confuse things a bit more, the readings here of Scherzos #2 and #4 are dropped in from an even earlier RCA recording.

The provenance won't matter that much to the general listener, who will be happy with the budget price for probably the best Chopin two-fer on the market. Begin listening with the four Ballades, where Ax is at his most impassioned and inspired. Even three years later, when he got to Scherzos #1 and #3, he had become more refined and relaxed, less a romantic risk-taker. He's remained that way ever since, but here at least we can hear Ax in his glory.  Faithful as I am to Pollini and Kisin in this repertoire, this collection often rises to their heights.

P.S. 2011 - I returned to this CD recently, wondering if the rather uninspired music-making of Ax in later years indicated that I was mistaken about him early on. But I must say that his set of Ballades holds up next to the greatest I've ever heard. they are the definition of charismatic.",
,B0013ASBCU,1,1,5,THis song has mass cross generation resilence. A slice of relationship tension mixed with a love yearning and relationship mystery with a great melody and classic Cars sound.,
,B0013ASBCU,1,1,5,"I was sorry to hear Benjamin Orr died. I loved his work with The Cars and really loved this song as well. I heard it years ago on the radio but had no idea who sang it. When I saw it listed on Amazon, I bought the MP3 version, then bought the CD. I've never listened to the entire CD because I only wanted this one song.",
,B0013ASBCU,1,1,5,It's a great song from a great musician and vocalist. So tragic that we lossed him so soon. Recommended listening.,
,B0013ASBCU,-1,-1,2,this song its the best worst song and the cars where better it had a better way of showing the 1960s off though,
,B0013ASBCU,1,1,4,"It is so distinctively sad to know that it has been 10 years since Benjamin Orr, the haunting lead vocalist of The Cars lost his battle with pancreatic cancer at 53 years old. While so many people have honestly turned to his hits with Rick and his former Cars bandmates, he had not been able to drive past his biggest hits. But only one solo song still remains as haunting today as it was nearly 25 years ago. Stay The Night, his one-hit wonder work from The Lace is driven today, as it was back in 1986. The song is still strong to listen to, and the drive from the synth. today, that is just dynamite. It really is too bad that people don't listen to this song, as much as Just What I Needed or Drive. This song should still drive Cars fans home, and something to say I wanna stay the night with this song.

Song: B+",
,B0013ASBCU,1,1,4,"""Stay the Night"" by Benjamin Orr of the Cars is his most notable solo hit. It has a cool soothing vibe that was most popular during the eighties. For some reason, I can always picture this song being blasted out of numerous car stereos during the 1980's on those moonlit Friday and Saturday night dates. It's definitely slower and a bit more poppy than much of the other Cars stuff that he's known for...I'm not sure if that was by design or trying to fit into the cornucopia of music that comprised the 1980's. The more I listen to the song, I realize that there's something dark and slightly creepy about this song maybe its' the sound like crickets chirping in the background or the low hum in the background that sounds like human breathing. It really doesn't matter though because it's so eighties and I love it.",
,B0013ASQA2,1,1,5,I REMBERED THIS SONG WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES WHEN A GUY ALWAYS ACT UP YOU WILL SING YOU GONNA MAKE ME LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE.,
,B0013ASQA2,1,1,4,"Been there on the other side, beautiful song and it is a True song it is strange how things happen.
Mr. Bobby Que Hendricks",
,B0013ASQA2,1,1,4,"This recording reminds me of the days when things were simplier, and not so running wild! Great times in the 70's. No problems or crazy worries.",
,B0013AUUWE,1,1,5,Xmas w/ great music,
,B0013AUUWE,1,1,5,I bought this for fun.  It turned out to be a great Christmas CD.,
,B0013AUUWE,1,1,5,"This is an excellent collection of Christmas songs, all sung by the cast of the Partridge Family.  A little lower key than a standard Christmas crooning set, but this really is a surprisingly good set of songs.",
,B0013AUUWE,1,1,5,"A Partridge Family Christmas Card is a nice Christmas Cd. David Cassidy was doing well in show business, and with this sold even more records. Particular favorite songs are Winter Wonderland, and Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree. David Cassidy fans will appreciate it the most.",
,B0013AUUWE,1,1,5,I rate this Christmas Cd highly and one of the reason's is it's not just David cassidy singing lead on most of the traditional tunes but Shirley Jones also doing the leads. Shirley has such a voacl range as she has shown early in her career as when she was young in movies like Oklahoma. It also has that partridge family 1970's feeling so if you were a fan back in those bell bottomed pants and big hair-do days buy this cd. It's a Christmas cd and it makes you feel good around the holidays even if you are finished Christmas shopping you can always buy it now and open it up as a christmas gift to yourself next Christmas.,
,B0013AUUWE,1,1,5,"Someone may look at this and wonder why I'd be giving this cd 5 stars.  Well if you grew up with the Partridge Family music as I did then you know the happy memories and just pure fun the music provides.  I was in my early teens at the time of the Partridge Family, owned all the albums then and have them all on cd now.  But it is the holiday season when taking out this cd just makes all the great memories rush back and luckily I have those with me who love to share it and together we can make new memories.

Granted it was only Shirley Jones and David Cassidy who really sang.  The rest were studio musicians and singers.  But call it bubble gum or pop, the chemistry worked.  This Christmas cd is pure hearfelt performances that bring the pleasures the holidays should.  From the original peppy opening MY CHRISTMAS CARD TO YOU and other feel good tracks like SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN, JINGLE BELLS, ROCKIN ROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE and SLEIGH RIDE to the slower WHITE CHRISTMAS, BLUE CHRISTMAS and HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS we get the perfect blend of David Cassidy's always great and reliable vocals mixed with the great Partridge sound.  There is no sound in music like the backup voices on a Partridge song and it is great fun.  And of course Shirley Jones get her solo turn on THE CHRISTMAS SONG.

If you grew up with the Partridges and their music you owe it to yourself to add this cd to your music collection.  It will bring such fun and joy to these special holidays.",
,B0013AUUWE,1,1,5,"If you were or still are a fan of the PARTRIDGE FAMILY's vocal harmonies then I strongly suggest you purchase this CD.
The CD contains several memorable holiday songs (WALKING IN A WINTER WONDERLAND) having received TOP~40 airplay during the polyester decade.
You'll appreciate the original holiday-theme songs (MY CHRISTMAS CARD TO YOU). Having viewed several times their holiday episode  located in a ghost town, I relieved childhood memories when I place this CD on my home entertainment system.
The innocent musical approach of this CD almost makes one remember what it was like to believe in Santa Claus!",
,B0013AWVDK,1,1,5,I love this product,
,B0013AWVDK,1,1,5,great cd,
,B0013AWVDK,1,1,5,Love this album. I t is another one that I play over and over. It never gets boring. Now I can annoy my grandchildren like I did my own children when they were growing up.,
,B0013AWVDK,1,1,5,"Apart from The shelter (a song about Jesus's birth), Silent night Christmas blue (a sad ballad to close the album) and an instrumental version of White Christmas, the rest of this album rocks, but in a country style.

The stand-out track is Santa Claus Is comin' in a boogie woogie choo choo train, which occasionally appears on multi-artist compilations, but there are plenty of other great songs here. Jingle my bell, though possibly inspired by Jingle bells, is a completely different song from the famous standard. Santa looked a lot liked Daddy (a cover of a Buck Owens song) should be familiar to country music fans, because several country singers and bands have recorded it, while Buck's original is also easy to find.

This is a Christmas album filled mostly with fun songs, although there are some more sober tracks as noted earlier; they add a nice contrast to the fun tracks.",
,B0013AWVDK,1,1,5,"Whether it's Christmas or not this is just a must! If you like Country

Rock, Country Blues, Honky Tonk, genuine Rock 'n Roll and mix all this

together with a few ballads, you'll have this CD to experience some

incredible music. OK, it's dedicated to Christmas and the lyrics do

include these seasonal holidays but that's all. The first two songs

are absolutely a knock-out and the rest is pure pleasure as well.

It's comparable to their firts CD, by far the best, called ""The Tractors""

from 1994. Not one minor song out of the 12 presented here. Even the

sole piano version of White Christmas is a ""different"" approach to this

mostly recorded Xmas song ever. This CD can be played and listened to

all year long especially when you need to ""rock up"" your humour and

soul!",
,B0013AWXT2,-1,-1,2,"After ""Getz/Gilberto"" the second best selling Jazz album of all time behind ""Kind of Blue"", the record companies were anxious for another golden egg.

However this is one of the worst periods in Stan Getz life, the 70's. Personal problems, and he was locked in the the bitterest divorce case in history, went to the Supreme Court! Things added to his orange juice...

Joao Gilberto also has a good reason to have a grudge against Getz but it doesn't show here, he is as mellow as usual. A trooper. His singing and guitar & Heloise hold the day, while Getz pretty much phones it in. What's good on this album comes from him.

For better Getz, pick any other decade or his life. For some reason all of the Getz Columia recordings are really bass thin and harsh. This one is less so, but no exception.

See my list for many better Getz recordings.",
,B0013AVGTU,1,1,5,This song makes my husband and I laugh every time we listen to it!! I use this for his ringtone!,
,B0013AZMXQ,1,1,4,"Bock and Harnick followed the wild success of Fiddler On The Roof ( and minor success of The Apple Tree) with this minor history of the European banking dynasty, and it contains many gems. In My Own Lifetime is a beautiful ballad, performed brilliantly by Hal Linden who won a Tony. This show propelled him to stardom and the leading role in Barney Miller on television, the show also introduced Jill Clayburgh to Broadway, and eventually Hollywood.
A terrific addition to any Broadway collection.",
,B0013AZNNK,1,1,5,"When you think of female jazz vocalists, what names come to mind?  Often, you hear Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holliday, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. Well, add another name to the list--Cleo Laine.  This beautiful, British songbird is phenomenally talented and I am surprised that we haven't heard more of her, and that her name isn't more well-recognized.  Her lower register is flawless, sexy and carries the grace and the depth of the songs, featured here, with minimal accompaniment (just subtle chords from her pianist).  Some of the best songs (in my opinion) include ""That Old Feeling"" and ""Ain't Misbehavin'"".  The rest of the songs don't fail to disappoint either!  Just beautiful.",
,B0013AZMIQ,1,1,5,"As a huge Mahavishnu Orchestra fan, I was pretty excited when I stumbled across this 1975 album, which has been nicely remastered by Columbia.  This album features Jan playing all of the instruments including acoustic piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, moog synthesizer, Oberheim synthesizer and digital sequencer, Freeman string synthesizer, and mellotron along with a full drum kit.  As it turns out, he is a pretty good drummer.  Steve Kindler provides some violin work here and there, while David Earle Johnson provides percussion on The Animals and Sixth Day People.

The music on The First Seven Days is a far cry from the full-out rave ups on Mahavishnu albums like Inner Mounting Flame (1971) and Birds of Fire (1973).  Rather, this is a very prog rock sounding album, with loads of synthesizers, European classical influences, rock influences, and with very little in the way of jazz.  In general, the pieces range from quiet piano interludes to heavier tracks that feature the drums (the title track for example).  In general though, all of the tracks are very atmospheric and synth-heavy.

For those of you that are curious, this album is not an exercise in mere ""blowing"".  Although Jan does flex some Mahavishnu-like muscle from time to time, the pieces are generally carefully composed and arranged, and exhibit a great deal of restraint for somebody with such tremendous ""chops"".

All in all this album is very highly recommended to prog fans, exploratory Mahavishnu Orchestra fans, and possibly even electronica fans.",
,B0013AZMIQ,1,1,5,"Jan Hammer muses that the first seven days of creation may have in fact spanned a century of our time. If that's True then

the music on this album makes perfect sense. Basically this is

a record of instrumental keyboard interpretations of the first

cycles of life on Earth,all the way to ""The Seventh Day"",a warm

piano driven tune. One thing that must be considered though is that these songs have no bottom-everything lies on top and each

composition takes time to develope,but once numbers like

""Darkness/Earth in Search Of A Sun"" and ""Light/Sun"" really get

going Jan's minimoog kicks in and things get REALLY busy as they did on later Jan Hammer Group albums like 'Oh Yeah?'.

  ""The Animals"" actually has a very tropical funk sound and is the closest thing the record ever has to a tempo.

But from beginning to end 'The First Seven Days' never remotely

approches being a funky record,or poppy at all! Jazz plays a part in it but so do elements of world and modern electronic

music. Jan Hammer mentions in the liner notes the expansive

nature of music during the mid 1970's and this does seem to be

made with the intention to form a whole new type of music,just as bands like Blood,Sweat & Tears tried to do eight years earlier. Even if that seems like padding this has to be one of

the most challanging and rewarding fusion recordings ever made

and because of it's relentless minimalism it's aged alot better then much of it's genre!",
,B0013AZMDQ,-1,-1,3,"In 1963, Miles Davis took his new quintet-- tenor saxophonist George Coleman, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams on the road.  No less than three live albums-- ""Miles Davis in Europe"", ""My Funny Valentine"", and ""Four and More"" were drawn from these shows.  ""Miles Davis in Europe"" is the weakest of these.

The set consists of a handful of originals and standards Davis had been associated with for several years and Victor Feldman's ""Joshua"", recorded in this studio the previous month.  The performances are decent enough, but it seems to lack something.  Part of the problem is that Davis is at times detached-- his performance on ""Autumn Leaves"" for example finds him pretty really not digging in at all (curiously enough, Coleman digs deep and produces a real gem of a performance).  Much of the rest of the set shows that this was a very new band-- ""Milestones"" and ""Joshua"" both find Davis running full bore and soloing explosively (particularly the latter, where Tony Williams pushes him on and on), but when Davis' solo ends and Coleman takes over, the intensity drops way down, particularly on ""Milestones"" where Coleman seems to run out of steam.

For all these gripes, there are still quite a bit of brilliant performances-- ""Walkin'"" is probably worth the price of the disc alone-- Davis comes skidding in and whirls through his solo before turning over to Coleman, whose angular solo is unceasingly inventive.  And Davis really digs in deep on ""I Thought About You"", opening in a ballad form and really cutting loose into a deep blues feel.

Still, all in all, there are other recordings by this band that are significantly better-- start with the studio effort or the other two live albums (recorded some time later), come back to this one if you need more.",
,B0013AZMDQ,1,1,5,"Five CLASSIC Stars? No, easily a SIX! A one word Review? SPECTACULAR! An Essential Recording for any serious jazz collection. The big difference here is intensity and Tony Williams. The addition of the teenage drumming genius Tony Williams was a brilliant acquistion by Miles and it revitalized the quintet with his youthful freshness and orchestral cunning. And Davis formed one of the greatest rhythm sections in jazz history, along with the amazing pianism of Herbie Hancock on piano and the redoubtable Ron Carter on bass. Future ""NEA Jazz Master"" George Coleman, who synthesized Coltrane and Rollins into a personal style, was also a great 'get' for the quintet (beating out Frank Strozier, I'm told). And they play like dervishes on this CD, finally released at a sensible price for such a classic recording.

All performances are the ""Pieces D'Resistance"" of this disc. ""Autumn Leaves"" is FANTASTIC, both individually and collectively. Mile's muted solo is so fresh, relaxed, and inventive. Coleman's solo, composed of packets of notes, packs a powerful punch leading to a crescendo, opening the door for Hancock's relentlessly brilliant, rhythmically varied solo with some great block chording. Note the fascinating musical conversation between Hancock and Williams at the beginning of the piano solo, before it surges back into 4/4. Carter's arco bass solo is equally brilliant. But Williams is operating on a level of jazz drumming on a par with the greatest drum masters, driving and inspiring the musicians to new heights during their solos. WOW!! I've listened to this song for decades and it still amazes me. But this was just the beginning...enter ""Milestones"".

We've heard ""Milestones"" a million times but Miles has concocted a new version for this occasion. It begins at a breathtaking pace, with a unison head that is not the usual toss-away head that Miles was sometimes fond of. ""Get it over with and let's get to the solos."" Not this time. The quintet is on top of 'all things unison'. Mile's fiery solo is one of his best up-tempo solos ever, Coleman's ribbon of sound solo is fascinating, leading to Hancock's truly spectacular solo. All pushed along by the brilliant rhythm trio, especially future DownBeat Hall of Fame member Williams. A fabulous performance.

""Joshua"" is in a similar vein as ""Milestones"", but Miles had a plan. ""Joshua"" is distinct and invigorating with choppy rhythmic breaks delineated by Williams' rim shots. Note how Miles stops in mid-solo, almost as a challenge (""What cha' gonna' do now, guys?""), and Carter and Hancock rush to fill in the pause before Miles surges back to finish an AWESOME solo. And Hancock's solo is 'too much'. After you listen to it, go back and key in on Tony Williams' performance, he is formidable!!

 I could go on describing each excellent individual track. Later, Miles was so impressed that he made coast to coast telephone calls to Ralph Gleason to play and rave about certain parts of the recording, especially what Tony Williams was doing on the drums. For one known to be so self-critical, Miles was blown away by this quintet's live performance! So am I and I have been listening to this recording for decades! This is a CLASSIC recording, jazz fans,  A Real Keeper. Six SIZZLING Stars !!!",

,B0013CROJY,-1,-1,2,"When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z. They have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted Deja Vu, and the recent Drunk In Love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart, and Bonnie & Clyde '03. It isn't a good song, because it has been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband. Still, there needs to be better in voice and being crazy in love.

,B0013CUNUQ,1,1,5,I downloaded this song so that it could be the ringtone for a friend who lives near Miami. I miss Will Smith's music!!,
,B0013CUNUQ,-1,-1,3,"Just got back from Miami and it is not at all like the song.  First of all, the parties didn't continue on the beach still the break of dawn, not a single latino woman said ""Aye Papi"" to me, and I didn't see a single hundred-thousand-dollar car.  What I did notice was that if you're at a traffic light and you don't gun it as soon as the light turns green, everyone behind you honks.  And there's no where to park.  Anywhere.  So, this is the last time I follow Will Smith's travel advice.",

,B0013CWA98,1,1,5,such an awesome song! Can't get it out of my head! One of Kirk Franklin's finest  re-makes of a well-known tune.,
,B0013CWA98,1,1,5,Kirk can really get you in the groove to feel the spirit!!!! His music is so passionate yet you know it's all about GOD!!!!,
,B0013CWA98,1,1,5,I enjoy most of Kirk Francklin's music been listening to him since I was in high school his music is sometimes contemporary and then he has worship he does a great mixture of gospel music,

,B0013CYK2S,1,1,5,"This song is permanently ingrained in my memory because it's another one of those singles that my family played a lot when it was a hot single. The bass sound *Sly Stone (*I just read Bass Player magazine and found out Sly played the bass line for this song, not the great bassist in the band, Larry Graham) got from his bass guitar is unique and still sounds great today. Another great song that showcases how Sly could change his vocal style to make his songs sound unique and memorable.",

,B0013D6KZC,1,1,5,Had to get this one. It brought back memories. His voice was unique. They don't make music like this anymore.,

,B0013D6QM4,1,1,5,Two great singers on the same song.  What more could you ask for!,
,B0013D6QM4,1,1,5,Love Michael Everything he does is a 5 star,
,B0013D6QM4,1,1,5,i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio stations coming out of chicago. when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which as far as im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever,
,B0013D6QM4,1,1,5,"I mean...two of the biggest figures in pop music at the time and a song that catches the listener right from the start. It's ""fluff,"" yes, but it's just so enjoyably listenable. And it can be listened to repeatedly.",
,B0013D6QM4,1,1,4,"""The Girl Is Mine"" was the first single off the Thriller album and was a duet with Paul McCartney. It was released in October 1982, a month and half before the album itself.  The song is a light, fluffy piece of pop music that didn't really set a good tone of what to expect from the album, but it is an infectious piece of ear candy.  Mr. Jackson has said that the song's recording was one his favorite moments in the studio and you can hear the good times reflected in the song.  The playful banter and vocals between the two megastars transmits through the music.",
,B0013D6QM4,1,1,5,"I always enjoyed Michael, he is truly missed.  No matter what he did, I found very entertaining.  I try to get all his music and I loved his videos, no one danced like Michael",
,B0013D6QM4,1,1,5,It sounds nice. I like the rhyme and lyric. For the money it sells it's a perfect piece of music.,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,Good song,

,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"It's a classic, what more can I say?",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"What can you say, it's a classic for a reason.",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,Just as expected.,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,4,"Sure he was odd, But this is a good song.",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,4,used for my daughters halloween cheer routine it was fun,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"Great Song, Good Quality",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,You can't go wrong with Michael Jackson's Thriller song for Halloween! This has always been a hit at every Halloween party I've thrown over the past 20 years.,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,Miss you MJ,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,nice song,

,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,Old but good,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,4,"I love billy Jean even without dancing.  I don't think Michael Jackson is not the world best singer, but Billy Jean is an exception.
(This comment was supposed to be left for Billy Jean, and the one I left for Billy Jean is supposed to be here.)",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,4,"Hard to believe that it has been over 4 years since Michael Jackson sadly passed away the way he died. It is still one of the most surreal deaths of all time, and shows the heartbreak he had to go through in death, and how his music has reminded so many people we've dealt with the demise of a legend. His biggest album and musical moment will always be the acclaimed Thriller. The title track shows how the music scene was changed dramatically in the 80's and over 30 years later it still is a thrill to the moment hearing the rhythmic track with Vincent Price over the song well. It is a haunting song that still captures for any die hard Michael Jackson fan. It is a great song to listen to and a must download for your music library.

Song: B+",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,This was a great addition for our party and dance music. Fun to listen to and great to dance to.,
,B0013D7TW0,1,1,5,Took a trip down memory lane for this bad boy.  No shame in that.  Great Beat.  Great song.  Great artist.  R.I.P. Notorious BIG!!!,
,B0013D7TW0,1,1,5,"This is one of those tunes you put on when you are running on your treadmill or doing yard work, or even cleaning the house. Even though it has been years since it came out, it is just a great feel good up beat tune.",
,B0013D7TW0,1,1,5,This tune is still a catchy party tune that will make jump up and dance to.  one of those that you can play over and over.,
,B0013D7TW0,1,1,5,The Notorious B.I.G was a great artist - he died an untimely death (unless he is hanging out with Tupac) :-) This is one of his best beats - check it out!,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,Good workout music and I always liked the King Of Pop Michael J. the beat energizes me on my walks.,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,Really happy the be able to play on my Kindle!  I can enjoy great music while playing a game or reading a book,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,4,this was always a cool song from the time it came out along with the video . it was innovative for the time period .,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"Hi,

I played it for my Father a few times and told him it was great to get down loaded so fast thank you.
Candy",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"I love this song. I would consider the music video the best one ever made...period!  I love Vincent Price, so I love that his voice narrates.  It would be a shame to pass up on this one!",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"Michael Jackson still lives, a great entertainer.  This particular song is still vey popular and I'd like to purchase others.",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,4,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"Its Music, It's Good
I Play it all the time, I love it.
I would recommend it to a friend.",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,I purchased this MP3 and downloaded the music into my computer and found that the quality of the sound was incredible and the price was within my budget. I gave this song a FIVE STAR rating! Thank Amazon for the great service and ease of the transaction in whole.,
,B0013D7TW0,1,1,5,Great song.,
,B0013D7TW0,1,1,5,Great sound and will be a classic song.,
,B0013D7TW0,-1,-1,3,"I like this song... and I don't like the cursing, so I purchased the clean version. But the clean version has all this weird editing style to take the curse words out that actually take from the song...",
,B0013D7TW0,1,1,5,"This was one of his better songs.

Some might say it was the greatest.
Action speaks louder than words and
he was a  star that was gone to soon.

I think he has a son who will take
his place one day. Keep watching!",
,B0013D6O6M,1,1,5,"Simple Plan continues to make awesome music with this gold mine here. Every song is very listenable and worth the attention.  Anyone who thinks I'm wrong might need to read this review, and listen to it once more to see if it will actually change their mind:

Another time, every single song is a 5/5. WOW!!! I must really enjoy reviewing excellent albums.",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,The product was exactly as advertised. We will buy again next time we need it. Thanks for the quick shipment.,
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"This has been always been one of my favorite songs! I even had the making of Thriller on VHS and always used to watch it every night during the summer as a kid (I was in love with MJ back then, this was back in the mid 90's).

I heard the orignal demo for this song called ""Starlight""...all I can say is thank goodness he changed it to ""Thriller"" or else he wouldn't have had the same success lol...",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"While Beat It was Michael Jackson's signature song, Thriller seems like it's a close second. Despite the fact that it wasn't written by the singer, It still felt True to Michael Jackson's style.

This song is so cool, that its album became the best-selling album OF ALL TIME. And that is saying something.

What seems really odd (To me) about Thriller is that there are zombies involved within the environment of the song. Fortunately, the scenery was able to fit in.",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"I just had to weigh In. This Is undoubtedly one of the greatest songs AND videos of all time.
And I am a Rock fan. The top 10 now would torture me. Yet his song and CD Thriller still sound fresh.
It's a slam 5 stars for sure. If not tell me what your using to measure? He helped set the bar!",
,B0013D6QP6,1,1,5,"Still one of the best songs ever.  This is a timeless classic that never gets old.  A song that stands alone.  A song that should be in everyone's music collection.

This song mixes a dance type sound with the halloween type sound that has been beautifully created.  When you listen to it you think about what it would have been like to create this sound with the voice of MJ and how it all came together.",
,B0013D6O6M,-1,-1,1,"If you liked simple plan's last two records, prepare to be disappointed. There are only two songs here that sound anything like what the band has done in the past, and one of them is a JP bonus track. So really, there's only one good song on the whole 12 track effort! Pop-punk is supposed to be fun, and simple plan used to do it as well if not better than everyone else, but there's nothing fun about waiting three plus years for such a terrible record.",
,B0013D6O6M,-1,-1,3,"Average at best, some good songs, doesn't compare to other albums. I tried giving this a chance, it's really not that good. Their other albums are a lot better.",
,B0013D6O6M,-1,-1,1,"Evidently the title ""Simple Plan"" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, ""Time To Say Goodbye."" It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not ""punk."" And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls ""unchartered musical territory."" Perhaps ""UnCHARTED"" musical territory is more like it. This one is headed to a bargain bin near you, right next to all those old LFO albums.",
,B0013D6O6M,1,1,5,"This is an AWESOME album. I've always liked a Simple Plan, but they really mature on this album in a BIG BIG way. If you're looking 4 more WHINING vocals from the lead singer you can forget it. He has finally reached P*berty and no longer sounds like Eminem. The lyrics to me just seem so much more mature and the group has collaborated so well with each other to create such an amazing piece of ART. I've noticed the roaster contains some big name producers and that is probably what everyone is experiencing on the shift in sound. But it's a very small semi change. The change actually seems like it's for the better. ""I Can Wait Forever"" has got to be one of my favorite songs on this album. It's a stand out track and is also an amazing ROCK BALLAD. Almost every song on this album is a 5 star track and the leads singer's voice really sounds so soothing and beautiful this time around. The hooks to the CHORUS lines are beyond ADDICTIVE. Great to see this band mature and I'm looking forward to see where this group lands next. Don't pass on this album because it's a total GEM.",
,B0013D6O6M,1,1,4,"Believe me, I am not a big fan of the electronic blips and blats that are littered throughout Simple Plan's third full length album. And I also might add that there are no less than 4 ballads on the album (one of which is a transparent re-write of Green Day's ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" and the other sounds way too much like the Backstreet Boys' ""More Than That""). However, there IS a spectacular ballad on the disc, the piano-laden ""I Can Wait Forever."" Simple Plan is always at its best, though, when it attacks a straightforward rocker, such as ""Time To Say Goodbye"" and the hook-laden ""Take My Hand."" The boys don't always hit the mark, but they deserve props for not putting out the same album three times in a row....or like so many bands do, soften out completely (like Relient K). There is a good bit of guitar rock here, and far more hooks than other bands in this genre crank out every few years. I give it four stars because at times the sound is intriguing, and other times it is annoying (like on the disasterously embarrasing track ""Generation'), and although the band goes to great lengths to sound different or unique, in some form or another, you have heard all of these songs before.

Here's a run-through of a few selected tracks:

When I'm Gone - First single off the album, big hook & chorus, but  kind of slow-paced.
Take My Hand - The beat sounds exactly like The Bravery's ""Honest Mistake"" but the hook is very catchy.
Generation - Wretched synth intro, worse than Europe's ""Final Countdown."" This track is embarrassing.
Time To Say Goodbye - Their trademark pop-punk sound.
I Can Wait Forever - No, this is not a cover of the song by Air Supply. This is actually a great track and the best the band has ever done. Hope you enjoy.",

,B0013D8BK4,1,1,5,I actually never cared for this song until I saw the movie Easy A staring Emma Stone. In the movie she goes from saying it is the worst song ever to using it as a ring tone for her phone simply because she was bored and started listening to it. It has a great beat so you can dance to it if you want to and the tune itself is addictive. The one draw back is that it is one song that can and does get stuck in your head!,
,B0013D8BK4,1,1,5,this song always makes me happy my hips just seem to start to wiggle and shake and excellent song a must have,
,B0013D8BK4,1,1,4,Great song. This was a freebie that I got with a pepsi code- can't complain all that much Good buy. :),
,B0013D8BK4,1,1,5,"Joy filled, positive uplifting music. WHO DOESN'T LIKE THIS SONG! This tune should make any person smile. I could listen every day and not tire of it.",
,B0013D8BK4,1,1,5,"I love this song, she sings it like a cry from the heart. You have to be in the right mood for it though.",
,B0013D8BK4,1,1,5,I love this song.  It has such an upbeat tune and the lyrics are really enjoyable as well.  Great song to listen to halfway through a rough shift at work.,
,B0013D8BK4,1,1,5,"I do like this song a lot! One of the songs I play a lot. Catchy! The other song I like a lot right now if you click see my other reviews you can see my review on that song (Warehouse Band, also hillsong relation). They are new on myspace, like em a lot.",
,B0013D8BK4,1,1,5,"I recently downloaded this song on my zune player and I must say that this song is very beautiful and uplifting.  I love the message in the song where she basically communicates that she will be strong and happy regardless of external circumstances.  One of the high notes of the song is where she raises her voice methodically when she says ""take me away"" and I love how the vocals blend together in ""I got a love that's mine"" and the creative use of the ending lyrics ""I know I'll be alright"".  This is definitely I song to listen to when you crave something that is energetic, upbeat, and will cheer you up.  You can even listen to the song when you are already cheerful.",
,B0013D8BK4,-1,-1,3,"Natasha Bedingfield really knew what she was doing when she recorded a few years ago, These Words, and Unwritten. For her latest song though, it shows that can try to make a good song stand out, but it feels like it is flavor of the moment. Pocketful Of Sunshine, the title track and second single from her sophmore album feels a little more upbeat than the collaboration with Sean King on Love Like This, but it just doesn't unfortunately really feel like it has stood out to being definitive from Natasha and her unique lyrical style. I like the beat of the song, but I was hoping from a bit more soul into the lyrics. Hopefully, when she comes out with her next single, it will sound much better tahn just a pocketful of the moment.

Song: C+",

If it is still free, definately try it. If you have to pay for it, make sure it meets your tastes in music first.",
,B0013D8DM0,1,1,4,This is a great song.  I highly recommend this song song as well as going after others by this artist.,
,B0013D86YA,1,1,4,good song,
,B0013D86YA,1,1,5,Brings back such great memories of times dancing and just enjoying life as a teenager. Today still makes me want to move when I hear it.,
,B0013D86YA,1,1,5,"I remember being little, maybe 6 or 7ish when this song came out on the radio in the early 80s (the band was formed in 1981). I also remember hearing it for the first time at my older friends birthday party on the new boom box that he had just received as a gift. I still remember this moment as one of the coolest experiences and moments in my life. I mean in the early 80s run dmc was IT!! I love all of their stuff especially the super iconic ""walk this way"" with the band Aerosmith. If history and memory serve me, I believe that this was the first collaborative project between a quintessentially rock n roll band and a hip-hop, rap group. I never knew back then that I would be making music history for now. I feel honored and privileged that God let me be there and experience it first hand. as for run DMC, it was made up of three influential rappers, performers from Hollis Queens, NY. these members were Joseph ""Run"" Simmons, (yes, younger brother of the famous promoter, business mogul, Russell Simmons), Darryl ""D.M.C."" McDaniels and Jason ""Jam Master Jay"" Mizell (who is now deceased). little did they know growing up in Hollis that they would be hip-hop and music pioneers. they were the first hip-hop group to do many things that previous groups, hip-hop or not, were not privileged enough to do. they were the first to have videos on MTV, the first hip-hop group to be on the cover of rolling stone magazine, the first to have a hip-hop album go gold and the first to be nominated for a music grammy award and the list goes on and on. my favorite was their appearance on the show ""american bandstand"" hosted by the legendary dick clark. I know because i never missed an episode:) lastly, their tremendous influence on music and pop culture was cemented in 2009 when they were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. (the only other rap group to do so was Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.) personally, i can't give enough accolades to the group. I just know that they surely don't make music groups like this anymore. with ""its tricky"" I was able to enjoy the ""fresh"" ride back to the early 80s when rap was new and genuine- no fakes here!! it was nothing but good memories, I say!! I wish I could bring them all back! purchase a sample of music history and enjoy!!!",
,B0013D8DM0,1,1,5,"At Christmas, after having heard ""Mary Did You Know"", I must say that ""Joseph's Lullaby"" was very timely and very beautiful.  Yes! to MercyMe",
,B0013D8DM0,1,1,5,I love music especially good Christmas music. I think any music lover would enjoy this album.  What more is there to say.,
,B0013D8C94,1,1,5,This song was awesome back in the day!! If you are a Outkast fan then I suggest this album for your collection!!,
,B0013D8C94,1,1,4,I was in high school when this song came out. Good song to listen to and it reminds me of my high school days.,

,B0013D89TW,1,1,5,"THE BALLAD OF MOTT: A RETROSPECTIVE is the best collection of Mott The Hoople available. It contains ample portions of their finest studio albums ALL THE YOUNG DUDES, MOTT, and THE HOOPLE, plus select cuts from the pre-David Bowie years and some unreleased songs. This collection is, aside from the three aforementioned albums, all the Mott you really need.",
,B0013D89TW,1,1,5,"It seems that I've spent years convincing people of the greatness of Mott the Hoople.  The review below from the fan in Chicago sums up this superb introduction to Mott.  The Greatest Hits CD is a nifty sampler, but for a  few bucks more you get great liner notes and a deeper song selection.  Mott's place in the music history books is not always recognized.  Critics  loved them, so you can't call them underrated.  So,  I call them the most  overlooked band of the 70's.  This 2 CD set is a chance for you to catch  up.  Then go and buy their other catalog items.",
,B0013D8CZS,1,1,5,"This album is great for those of you with a twisted sense of humor who want something different to ring in the Christmas season.  This album should've included several more songs--e.g., the Santa & Jesus duet/medley, Poo-choo Train (several more).  Still, a great album, though.",
,B0013D6RWS,1,1,5,"Now behold the Lamb, the Precious Lamb of GOD. These first words says it all. GOD loves us so much he sent himself Jesus to gives us a way to be saved. This is a great song .",
,B0013D8CZS,1,1,5,"What better way to get into the holiday spirits than with a piece of poo? Mr. Hankey and friends deliver 45 minutes worth of foul-mouthed & high spirited Christmas tunes. Some are originals and some are just completely butchered reworkings. If you've seen the South Park episode of the same name, you are familiar with only half the content of this CD. The rest of it is just as much of a treasure. Sure, everyone's heard ""Christmas Time In Hell"" and ""Merry F'ing Christmas,"" but the best songs are the ones that slip under the radar. ""The Most Offensive Song Ever"", a duet between Mr. Hankey and Kenny proves to be just that, focusing on Virgin Mary. Cartman's ""Swiss Colony Beeflog"" comes as a favorite to me. Little Eric reaches Bruce Springsteen type singing when yearning for that one thing that truly makes Christmas special. ""Hark The Herald Angels Sing"" is done very hilariously and sloppily by the South Park Children's Choir and Stan's sister Shelly lisps her way through ""I Shaw Shree Ships"" ... I mean ""I Saw Three Ships."" Heck, the album cover alone is incentive enough for you to purchase this CD. Since the time I've had it, I have enjoyed Christmas 100% more. Overall, a very amusing and ""crappy"" CD.",
,B0013D8CZS,1,1,4,"This is the South Park Christmas album.  If you are a fan of South Park, you will love it.  If you are not a fan of South Park, you probably will hate it.  Personally, I think it's funny.  But it's definitely not for the easily offended.  There are a few things that I am wondering about, though.  Who is the special celebrity guest on ""The Lonely Jew on Christmas""?  And what is Kenny saying in ""The Most Offensive Song Ever""?  Anyway, I recommend this CD to South Park fans.",
,B0013D6RWS,1,1,5,such a good blessing to me,
,B0013D6RWS,1,1,5,Awesome and I truly loved this product!!!,
,B0013D6RWS,1,1,5,"This an awesome song and it is not just a Christmas song.  It brings me to worship and thank the Lamb of God.  A group of college age people at church did a sign language routine to this song and I cried almost every time they did it.  While I was trying to find this song, I went to a website that had lyrics to songs.  There are actually songs that blaspheme the Lamb of God.  Thank you Kirk Franklin and The Family for glorifying our Lord and Savior.",
,B0013D6RWS,1,1,5,Exactly what I expected from one of my favorite artists.  I play this song almost everyday.,

,B0013D6RWS,1,1,5,I heard this song a few years ago and never forgot it although I didn't know its name. I started searching for it and low and behold I found it on Amazon and promptly bought it. This is a group of singers that sing together so well they leave one hungry for more. I love Christian music and this song is truly one of its best.,

,B0013D8CDK,1,1,4,"It had been some years by this point since Stanley Clarke had done a studio album under his own name. Looking to embrace the flavors of both his fusion years and modern smooth jazz Stanley,for the most finds a good balance between the two. After a lot of smooth jazz does need a stronger musical element to keep it from sounding muzaky. Interesting enough there is a concentration here,both literally and figuratively on Stanley's soundtrack work as the excellent slow jazz-funk groove of ""Justice's Groove"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poetic-Justice/dp/0767821955/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poetic Justice</a>&nbsp;and the mellow ""Theme From Boyz N The Hood"". It's Stanley's bass by the way that keeps the song from becomming boring after a time. ""Fantasy Love"" tries to do a Howard Hewett duet-type song again in the spirit of ""Heaven Sent You"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Time-Exposure/dp/B0000025V9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Time Exposure</a>&nbsp;a decade earlier but,in my opinion doesn't suceed quite as well because there's little to no groove to the song really and it does tend to be somewhat over produced. Much better are ""Zabadoobeede? (Yabadoobeeda!)"" and ""I'm Home Africa"" which create a potent,dancable mix of jazz-funk and the percussive sounds of the motherland;holding True to an afrocentric element that,while well explored during Stanley's musical peak he had somehow neglected to fully embrace at that time. Well better late than never and it all works very well. The title cut is a good song with a decent groove to it but it brings to mind another unfortunate element of this album,one that is present on the movie themes as well. The sax solos by George Howard and Gerald Albright are very weak,even for smooth jazz quality and that is the reason I deduct one star from this otherwise really fine quality album. ""Christmas In Rio"" is actually really nice and breezy considering how much deep bass playing there is on it with a nice ""heavy on easy"" quality. ""What If I Forget The Champagne"" and ""Never Lose Your Heart/There Lies The Passion"" are instrumentals that focus and as with ""Christmas In Rio"" there is some fine solos from guests Andy Summers,Jean Luck Ponty and Kenny Kirkland. There is a Sting element to these songs and,considering his recent work with Stewart Copeland in Animal Logic that was actually very appropriate. On ""Illegal"" and ""Lord Of The Low Frequencies"" Stanley gets a chance to focus on what he does best-bass playing and delivers some of his finest work in that arena on these stripped down,somewhat afro-funk type jams. George Duke shows up for the foot stomping flat out funk closer ""Funk Is It's Own Reward"";for the 70's funk fan this will likely be one of the more appealing. With the exception of the afformentioned weak sax playing on a couple of the tracks this album was actually one of Stanley's better comeback recordings and comes highly recommended.",

,B0013D8C2Q,1,1,4,"Though somewhat controversial, Outkast is a talented group of people with an interesting set of political opinions.  Their music is more respectful to women than other rappers of their era.  The cover of the album is ambiguous, so I will leave it open for interpretation.",
,B0013DACX8,1,1,4,"This is a very good Christmas album done ""Western Swing"" style.  It's a lot of fun.  All the songs here are good, but my favorite is probably ""Merry Texas Christmas, You All"", which is a cover of an old Gene Autry song.  If you enjoy country music that is more ""traditional"" sounding than most contemporary country music, you should get this album.",
,B0013DACX8,1,1,5,"This is not one of those deadly-serious Christmas albums (which I also enjoy but in a different way) - it is obviously intended as a party album and makes ideal background music for Christmas.
Many of the songs will be familiar, but some are given new treatments, like Swingin' drummer boy and Swingin' silent night.
The set opens with a great version of Feliz Navidad, on which Ray Benson is joined by Tish Hinojosa (a brilliant but vastly under-rated singer) continuing with an amusing look at Christmas in jail and maintaining a light-hearted approach throughout. Fellow Texan Willie Nelson is featured on a couple of duets.
I always think that this type of album must be the hardest to record - it would be very easy to end up with something mediocre, but Ray and the boys have shown, once again, that it's possible to record an album of high quality which is also FUN.",

Artist: Michael Jackson

This is probably my favorite by Michael Jackson, and certainly one of his best songs on his best album.  With Michael it is hard to choose a favorite.  I know I love all his music.  I was saddened beyond words by his death. I truly believe he had many more years of songwriting and singing to offer.  It was obvious that is what he loved to do, and he tried to give to us all through his magic with music and dance.  You are sorely missed Michael.

,B0013DDLTK,1,1,5,"COOL SONG, CLASSIC",
,B0013DDLTK,1,1,5,"We have all heard Michael Jackson sing absolutely wonderfully as a child, young adult and into the man that forever challenged and changed just what good versus Absolutely Great music can be and ultimately should be. On the Destiny album, we hear Michael break it down ever so softly on Push Me Away: ""Don't you know, these dreams I wish could be, the real you & me. I come running back to you, you push me away, you push, you push me away."" Off The Wall gave us She's Out of My Life and the real tears at the end of the song. I am not sure if it has ever been revealed as to whom the 'she' is that he is referring to, Then, then there came Thriller and MAN!, it is STILL thrilling us! The flow from beginning to end has perfect placement and when we arrive at its conclusion, ""There'll be no darkness tonight, Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night), Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time), Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me, A treasure time won't steal away~So listen to my heart, Lay your body close to mine, Let me fill you with my dreams, I can make you feel alright, And baby through the years gonna love you more each day, So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life."" And some people had the nerve to call this dude gay, and I do not mean happy. Another Rod Temperton classic that just shows the boundless ability of his genius, and once Mike was added to the mix, what else can you say? Out of ALL the crooners; Luther, Johnny Gill, El DeBarge, Freddie Jackson, Teddy P., name 'em & I won't blame ya, they all made great music, but Mike made the GREATEST. Vocal range with the dance moves, funny how so many became so critical of him when he was being accused of lies, but even with that, who in their right mind would not want to produce the moves and music he has? Go on, I'll wait. Tick tock, tick tock. You have chosen wisely, grasshopper. Just because he was not alerting society as to whom he was hittin', no matter what colloquialisms you want to use to describe the act and its giver and receiver, (and ladies, please do not try & tell a man what has been defined as the greatest motivational speaker EVER!, how it operates because we have no business trying to tell you what a menstrual is like--maybe a nosebleed--heck, no, surely not!), the best we can do is to take a woman to the fair or a theme park. Mike had a theme park in his BACKYARD!!!!! In Michael's voice, ""Yeah, and after we get off the ferris wheel, I'll sing a few songs for you, and uh, you know, I always wanted a girl just like you, such a P.Y.T. Ooh."" We can play his music, only he can seduce with it. ~K.I.S.S~",
,B0013DDLTK,1,1,5,"You gotta love the king of rock. Because he has made songs for all types of people. It is highly unlikely that Michael Jackson has ever made a song that didn't touch someone.

,B0013DC9TS,1,1,5,"""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" kicks off Michael Jackson's monumental Thriller album with a funky slice of dance music.  The Ma Ma Se, Ma Ma Sa, Ma Ma Coo Sa vibing at the end of the song practically begs you to get up and shake your booty on the dance floor.  The lyrics are non-sensical mishmash about being a vegetable, stuck in the middle and pain being thunder.  They are besides the point as it is the hyperactive dance groove that makes this song a standout.",

,B0013DDKZK,1,1,5,I can't get enough of this worship song. Good fast beat and makes you feel good. Joy joy.,
,B0013DCB82,-1,-1,3,"The interesting thing about this version is that it really takes you from soft beginning to crescendo and then back down again.  There is definitely some ""country"" aspects to this, but (esp. somewhere around the middle) it is dominated by the slightly distorted electric rock guitar sound and drums that come in gradually then take it over, then return to a soft landing.  I enjoyed the singing voice, but honestly, the entire piece just got too loud for me and took me right out of the mood that it started with.  However, there are a good many of you that like just that kind of ride.  It is a matter of taste, I suppose.

If you are a little bit of a hard rocker, especially with a country edge, this will work well for you.",
,B0013DCCS6,1,1,5,"All my life I've gone back and forth regarding which band I loved the most - Basie for his swinging blues or Ellington for his sophisticated compositions. This album only confuses me all the more, but also delights me.

The selections are superb, but the arrangements on this album tend to underscore Ellington's bands strengths. At least to my ears it sounds that way. But I am not complaining because the musicianship is mind boggling.

I am reviewing the CD version of this album, which contains the original eight tracks. The product page for the CD - at the time of this review - does not have sound samples. For those I recommend that you go to the page for the MP3 version of the album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Time-The-Count-Meets-The-Duke/dp/B0013DCCS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Time! The Count Meets The Duke</a>, which not only contains representative sound samples for the original eight tracks, but an additional seven bonus tracks that were released with the reissue of this album. Those sound samples will convey more information in a few seconds of sound snippets than I can possibly describe in words. Since reviews are crosslinked between both formats you may already be on the MP3 version's page.

Although I will not attempt to describe the music, I will point out some of the reasons I love this album. First is the piano duets that feature both the Duke and the Count. Their styles are so radically different that hearing them together is a study in contrasts that perfectly complement one another. If ever there was a musician definition of Yin and Yan this is it.

As a drummer I enjoyed picking out the contrasts between Sam Woodyard whose style made innovative use of pitch as well as rhythm, and Sonny Payne who knew how to set up each phrase in a composition and swing the band like crazy. However, as a musician, the melodic and harmonic complexities of each arrangement and the solos were a joy and a learning experience.

Here is who marched into Columbia's 30th Street Studio in NYC on July 6, 1961 and made this all possible:

BRASS SECTION
Trumpet:  Cat Anderson, Willie Cook, Eddie Mullens, Ray Nance, Sonny Cohn, Lennie Johnson, Thad Jones and Snooky Young.

Trombone: Juan Tizol, Louis Blackburn, Lawrence Brown, Henry Coker, Quentin Jackson and Benny Powell.

REEDS AND WIND SECTION (some personnel double on instruments and will be repeated  under more than one category)

Clarinet: Jimmy Hamilton, Russell Procope and Marshall Royal
Alto Sax: Johnny Hodges, Russell Procope, Marshall Royal and Frank Wess
Tenor Sax: Jimmy Hamilton, Frank Wess, Paul Gonsalves, Frank Foster and Budd Johnson
Baritone Sax: Harry Carney and Charlie Fowlkes
Flute: Frank Wess

RHYTHM SECTION
Piano: Duke Ellington and Count Basie
Guitar: Freddie Green
Bass: Aaron Bell and Eddie Jones
Drums: Sam Woodyard and Sonny Payne

If you love Ellington, Basie or both this is an album to own. I recommend the MP3 version because of the seven bonus tracks, but either way this is a slice of history that we can all be thankful that it happened.",
,B0013DCCS6,1,1,5,"The first track, Battle Royal, says it all. Incredible excitement jumps from the grooves as two of the finest musical ensembles ever assembled play together for the first and last time. You can absolutely feel the love and respect from the bands for each other and the music, and boy oh boy the peaks are breath-taking. I tend to crack up in laughter at moments throughout this recording, the intensity is so overwhelming. These are some of the best jazz players the genre has produced, veterans of four decades of swing at this point in 1961, and this one-off meeting never disappoints.

  Having each band in one channel makes this surreal on good headphones. Nice production too, solid remaster with the brass register rarely shrill.

Along with Cannonball Adderley's Know What I Mean?, this is one of the sweetest semi-unknown jazz recordings. If you know someone who says jazz doesn't rock, just throw on cut one, crank it loud and proud, and step back with a smile.

  Are there any musicians of this calibre still alive? I can't seem to find them...",
,B0013DCCS6,1,1,5,"I didn't get hooked on this CD at once; probably because I expected a battle (well, the first song has a combative title), but this is a coherent band, using the heritage of both bands up until the moment this recording is made, with Duke and Count giving their respective best personal and organizational contributions.

It is intriguing to listen to the two pianists collaborate with such a great deal of mutual respect and understanding (with the additional attraction of Billy Strayhorn as Ellington's second pair of hands on ""Take the A Train"", a great Strayhorn's composition). Frank Wess' flute seems to blend naturally with Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet; it is a great fun to hear Cat Anderson and Thad Jones working together and to root for Basie's tenorist Frank Foster as he tries to chase Paul Gonsalves (Ellington's tenor sax road runner) across the highway of ""Jumpin at the Woodside""...

""To You"", ""Wild Man"", ""BDB"" and other tunes offer many surprises (although not all the moments are equally impressive), with Quentin Jackson (tb) giving great contributions regardless of the fact that, on this album, he comes from Basie's band, instead of his more natural place with Ellington trombone section...

Ray Nance is also here, as well as Johnny Hodges, Lawrence Brown, Willie Cook and many others (including the rhythm guitar of Freddie Green), contributing to this great band that uses some very interesting arrangements for this occasion. Not an Ellington record, or a Basie record, this is a great big band album, although novices to swing music should probably start with somewhat more conventional and less extrovert material...",
,B0013DCCS6,1,1,5,"This is an emblematic and historical document for hard fans and jazz lovers; the successful encounter of the most pyramidal jazz artist ever born; ""The Duke"" joining his creative moods with another giant of the genre: Count Bassie.

A collection album.",
,B0013DCCS6,1,1,5,"I don't have the enhanced version of this disc but it still sounds very good to me so I can only imagine what an ""enhanced"" version would sound like but I can truly say that I enjoyed this disc a great deal.  A couple of great bands combining for just one occasion and this was the result.  Highly enjoyable and definitely a keeper!  If you are a swing fan and don't have this yet in your collection, what are you waiting for? : )",
,B0013DCCS6,1,1,5,"The collaboration of these 2 giants of their trade shine even on the mix of the CD that has Duke's orchestra playing on the right channel with the Count's on the left..what a great re release with bonus tracks and 36 page illustrated booklet...total pleasure from Basie, now with his idol,Duke, playing as his ""guest"" on this Ellington release..
We have Basie's bluesy voluptuous sound fusing well with Duke's elegant style on mostly numbers spanning popular band selections from both of these musical giants.
These two great orchestras, weaving amazingly smooth and irreconcilable at times works on standouts from both men.
Jamming together in New York in the summer of 1961
this was billed as a historic one time meeting now laid down for posterity.
Phil Schapp the reissue producer did a great job on adding outtakes, different takes.. under his guidance this becomes one great long CD and one that can turn heads in initiating people to music of greatness from these 2 men and their orchestras that is now overlooked some 50 years later.",
,B0013DCCS6,1,1,5,"Basie's best players come to Duke's place, the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in 1961 and face Ellington's finest. Not a battle, but not quite a merger, either, since the Count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel. There's more than an hour of good music on here, laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras. Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible. This is one of those rare CD's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music. This one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session, one of Ellington's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague. Also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. Basie hated Columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition, and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. The end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name. The cover finally chosen says ""The Count Meets the Duke"" but in larger letters it declares ""FIRST TIME!"" and then adds ""2 Great Orchestras"" and finally states ""Duke Ellington and Count Basie."" The label Columbia/Sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says ""Duke Ellington MEETS Count Basie"" which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's. If you already like both orchestras, you'll want to own this late career session. If you want an introduction to each group in its waning years,  the CD serves nicely for that, too. This disc really jives, so don't be expecting any ballads here.",
,B0013DCCS6,1,1,5,"In the 60's, the record companies came to a realization that they had better record the Duke with many of the greatest Jazz men around such as Satchmo, The Count and Coltrane, to name but a few. The differences between those later collaborations (after the Count, like the one with Coltrane) is that the producers took away The Duke from his Big Band. The Coltrane album is just the two of them. That's great, but Duke made his claim to fame with his big band, and this album with Count allows two of the greatest big band leaders of all time to go at it. The results are just splendid. What makes this release even more exciting is all the outtakes. You can hear what goes on behind the scenes, then you can marvel at the amazing fact that this recording was made with no rehersals!!!! Yes, buy it and be amazed!",

,B0013EM6T0,1,1,5,"Justin Timberlake's talents are unavoidable. He is everywhere, and he is extremely talented. I had heard of him from his N'Sync during commercials, ads, etc. Then I saw him on tabloids as I waited in grocery stores' register counters (it had something to do with a girl named Britney.) Then I saw him in a movie I really liked, the Social Network. I actually thought he had stolen that show. Then I saw him dance and sing with Jimmy Fallon (both were great, by the way.) Then I saw him in last night's Saturday Night Live, where his performance was without question Emmy-worthy. His vocals for Jazz in his SNL performance reiterates the brilliance of this MP3 here. I think he should host next year's Oscars.",
,B0013EM6T0,-1,-1,1,"First off, what is the point of this ""duet?"" Because from my viewpoint it is at best a vehicle for Beyonce, and a god-awful one at that. How bad is this song? In the original version, where the song was treated like art, not a marketing tool, Justin Timberlake gave his best vocal performance yet with a 5-star croon. Here, with the shoving of Timberlake, and the addition of Beyonce, she sounds more like the cat whose tail has just been stepped on. To put it mildly, Beyonce is a horrible singer here, and she ruins a perfectly good song. Also, it's not a ""duet,"" but rather, insert Beyonce over the original track, nothing more, nothing less.

Overall, please don't buy this pathetic excuse for a song. It's one of the flat-out worst quality of song in 2007, Period.",
,B0013EM6T0,-1,-1,2,"I'll admit I am Beyonce fan and somewhat of a Justin fan but this remix, yes REMIX is terrible. Now, While Beyonce's Vocals are great and on point, Justin's remain the same as his original which for me, throws me off since they called it a ""Duet"". My opinion : if it was really a duet, Justin's vocals would be new, also. So, it's more of a remix than a duet. I Think if Justin had new vocals for the song, it would be more enjoyable.

This would have been a lot better, in my opinion had it contained new vocals from JT",

,B0013F0E02,1,1,5,Wonderful song. Purchased it to play in my daughters wedding and it was the perfect song! They really loved it.,
,B0013EVQ5U,1,1,4,Been around a while and finally just re-connected with it. Great rhythm & blues song. A must for any collection.,

,B0013EZ1PQ,1,1,5,"Lionel Richie is the Best. Clasic Music will shop again.  Best Price for Relaxing enjoyment .I will buy again , happy to have found Amazons Music",
,B0013EZ1PQ,1,1,4,"There is no doubt about Lionel Richie, as he has been one of the most universal and down to Earth singer/songwriters for the past 4 decades on his own and with The Commodores. But for his latest album Tuskegee, it has worked very well with his fans and new Country music fans all over. His latest single Stuck On You, teaming up with Darius Rucker from Hootie & The Blowfish fame, and solo Country music fame works very well. The song is just as down to Earth as when Lionel originally made it nearly 30 years ago. I like the intimate style of the song, and Darius lends his vocals well on the classic. I have honestly recommended Tuskegee very well, and this is a great download to your music library.

Song: B 1/2+",
,B0013F245K,1,1,5,Great classic song from an outstanding voice.,
,B0013F245K,-1,-1,3,"The title track from Lionel Richie's Dancing On The Ceiling was the album's first single.  It tried to recapture the fun, party mood of ""All Night Long"" but pales in comparison.  It has a decent groove, but it's lyrics are so silly and meaningless, they detract from the fun mood, knocking the song down a few pegs.  That didn't stop the song from storming up the charts all the way to number 2 in late 1986.",
,B0013F245K,1,1,5,Love the Song.,
,B0013F245K,1,1,5,"It doesn't matter if thus song is played as the original or country, I dance on the ceiling every time I hear it. The music video just pops into my mind...",

,B0013F245K,1,1,4,This song is an oldie from Lionel Richie that's worth playing again and again. I recommend it for anyone's library.,
,B0013F245K,1,1,5,Lionel Richie makes you feel like dancing on the ceiling.  If you are looking for an upbeat song.  This is it.,

,B0013EVQ5U,1,1,5,Good,
,B0013EVQ5U,1,1,5,Would I Lie To You by Charles & Eddie is a delightful pop/R&B song that I remember first hearing as a teenager either through television and/or local radio.  This tune appears to be a meaningful song where one person is making it clear that the love of their life means so much to them. The music collaboration between this duo via the online video also adds to the positivity of this song.,
,B0013EVQ5U,1,1,5,Love it!,

,B0013F0DR6,1,1,5,"This is one of JM's classic hits from the '80's.  If you like R.O.C.K. in the USA, Cherry Bomb, Jack and Diane or any of his other hits from that time frame, you will enjoy this song.",

,B0013F0DR6,1,1,4,Listening to songs by John Mellencamp brings back memories of my late teens and early twenties and makes me nostalgic for those days of hope and discovery when my whole life lay ahead of me and my story was yet to be written.,
,B0013F0DR6,1,1,5,Such a sweet and tender song.  I have always loved this song!  One of my all time faves.  Scarecrow is his best album but this song is his very best song.,

,B0013F0E16,1,1,4,"Another one of those singles that I am not sure I would like if introduced to today.  On the other hand this song is so steeped in memories, heartaches and triumphs from my youth that it is part of my life anthem.  With that said how can you not buy this single even if you don't touch the rest of Lionel Richie's catalog.",
,B0013F232O,1,1,5,"Mellow type of melodies. Great lyrics. A soothing, calming, and encouraging tune with a little bit of bounce to it.",
,B0013F232O,1,1,5,Great song by Lionel Richie that I had not heard in years.  Heard it on the radio early one morning and was glad to be able to find it on Amazon.,

,B0013F0E16,1,1,5,Lionel Richie is one of my best singers.  I lke all of his songs.  This one is a very old one but it is still good to hear.,

,B0013F0E16,1,1,5,"It is hard to write a review for a MP3 download.  It is a song that you have heard and liked.  If so, you would not have downloaded it.  I liked this song, downloaded it, the price was right.  Good review.",
,B0013F0E16,1,1,5,Classic from my early teens. Excellent album with this song being my favorite. I always think of the clay sculpture when I hear this.,
,B0013F27O8,1,1,5,"Two of my favorite artists anyway collaborating on a great song, what could be better. I could listen to this song all day!",
,B0013F27O8,1,1,5,"I always liked Lionel & Shania. Liked it when he sang it with Diana Ross and now, I love this rendition of this old clasic tune.",
,B0013F27O8,1,1,5,"I like it even better than the one with Diana Ross.  Shania Twain's voice is amazing.
They make a great duet.",
,B0013F27O8,1,1,5,"Yes I am a huge Shania Twain fan and I do enjoy Richie's music to an extent, but when I heard last year they were going to redo ""Endless Love"" my thought was, ""Are you guys crazy? That song belongs to Diana Ross and Lionel Richie so why tamper with a classic?""

 To me the original version is still by far the best, but I have to give kudos to Shania Twain for giving one of her best vocal performances in her entire career. As anyone knows who has ever sung ""Endless Love"" it is one of the hardest tracks to nail as most of the song is sung on a high pitch, but Shania delivers and more. This was no small feat for her as she had not sung in several years and was having voice problems up until the day of the recording.

 Sadly the song bombed on country radio, but many have said (myself included) that it is one of the best singles on Richie's album ""Tuskegee"".",
,B0013F27O8,1,1,4,"It has been awhile since we've heard anything brilliant from Shania Twain and Lionel Richie for quite awhile. With what they've both had to deal with, Shania losing her husband, Mutt Lange and finding out he had cheated and abused her, and with Lionel losing his friends like Michael Jackson and Don Cornelius to name a few. But for Lionel reworking on his classics for his album Tuskegee, he went back to the basics and a country twist on his classics. Lionel and Shania teaming up for Endless Love, actually feels fresh and new to a whole new era of fans. The song sounds pretty good from beginning to end, and a nice new start for Shania Twain. While Lionel showcased bits from himself, to the classic he had made with Diana Ross, there still is a lot of chemistry between the two of them in song and heart. It is a pretty nice download for your music library for a country fan, or a huge Lionel Richie fan.

Song: B 1/2-",

,B0013F48EA,1,1,5,Very nice,
,B0013F48EA,1,1,5,"Lionel Richie has been amptly blessed by the Lord with song as a writer and performer.  Each song he writes captures the ache of a heart; the longing for a beloved or just partying like there is no tomorrow (All Night Long, Dancing on the Ceiling etc.)  Here's hoping Lionel will continue to give the world beautiful and needed music that will last for generations to come.",
,B0013F48EA,1,1,5,"I just love the commodores. Listen to their music in the late 70's. This is one I already had, but wanted the long version of it.",
,B0013F48EA,1,1,5,This song was the class song when I was in high school back in the 70's...loved this song then and still love this song now.,

,B0013F470A,1,1,5,"A classic that will live on.  When Lionel says to ""Come on and sing along!"", he doesn't have to tell me twice.  Fiesta!  Forever!",
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,I enjoy music a whole lot. it's good to find the old school music today. Most of the new Music today is missing what the old school music have. clean lyrics with a story to tell. I think this is one of the best song among others that he sang by himself or with the group,
,B0013F0LD2,1,1,5,"After the unprecedented success of ""Hanging By A Moment,"" Lifehouse took the genre they inevitably bore and ran with it. The result is a follow-up forever foreshadowed by the success of its predecessor, but arguably tops it. Taking a heavy-dose from the grunge genre, Lifehouse all but nixes any acoustic or poppy elements from their sound, as it all takes a very raw, rough, but rockin' turn instead. I personally love every moment of it, as it's on the edge, and it's almost one long consistent jam session that the band really ran and had fun with.

Standout tracks include ""Spin,"" ""Sky Is Falling,"" ""Stanley Climbfall,"" and the highlight/album-definer ""Take Me Away.""

Overall, on a recent list I made of the top 15 albums in Christian music, I placed this particular work at #9, saying ""If 'No Name Face' bore modern rock as we know it, then ""Stanley Climbfall"" perfected it. It's still one of the most consistent records I've ever heard."" Well, that pretty much sums it up. It's highly controversial, especially since this album has been largely forgotten, but it is a True masterpiece in the genre of modern rock. Sure, 'No Name Face' has the moving work of ""Everything,"" but 'Stanley Climbfall' has the consistency and the driving ""Take Me Away."" I still am however confused about the title. 'Stanley Climbfall.' What does that even mean?",
,B0013F0KS8,1,1,5,I put this in a retrospective for Donna.  What a part of music's history.  Always perfect for the dance floor.,
,B0013F0KS8,1,1,5,% star rating too go out to Donna Summer  I remeber it very well in 1985  when the Music video was out  5 Star for all those women that work hard for their money,
,B0013F0KS8,1,1,5,"Great song and great singer of our time in my life,Donna Summer. Miss Her so much. 5 Stars Hit song "" She Works Hard For Money. Love It.",
,B0013F0KS8,1,1,5,"I was dared to sing it so I'm practicing, but the song is really funny and popish to me.  It leaves plenty to the imagination.

It's a fun song.",
,B0013F0LD2,1,1,4,"In late 2003, the pop rockers Lifehouse, returned to the music scene with their second album STANLEY CLIMBFALL. Their new product was by far some of the rock band's best work. Vocals were incredibly melodic, the rhythm section wasn't over powering, and the entire album just had amazing musical traits. STANLEY CLIMBFALL opens with a good rock dance tune, and soon becomes a collection of powerful rock ballads. The progressions to the songs are not much more than the standard I-IV-V, but there is a reason why that progression is so popular and it works perfectly with the pieces of this album. The band is built from the drums keeping perfect time and the bass as the melodic foundation so the guitars and vocalist can lay out their amazing performance. Everything played by these instruments are so independent from each other but the counterpoint is crafted so well, that the pieces are just outstanding. Dynmaics are a major key to these songs as they should be for any piece, but Lifehouse performs this musical aspect perfectly. STANLEY CLIMBFALL is a great piece of work and one to add to any music collection.

Stand out tracks include:

""Spin""

""Wash""

""Sky Is Falling""

""Stanley Climbfall""

""Take Me Away""",

,B0013F0LD2,1,1,5,"After having heard the first album by Lifehouse.  I knew that i was really diggin everything this band put out.  From the first song ""Spin"" to the last one.  I didn't skip a track on this cd.  The majority of times even on a very good cd.  I will do this at least once.  But that's not the case with ""Stanley Climbfall"" and its also a cool name for the title of the CD as well.

I'm looking forward to Lifehouse's next CD due out in March.  I'm sure that i will enjoy it if not more than i did the previous two.  There's a new Lifehouse fan in here and that's the end of it.",

,B0013F470A,1,1,5,Lionel is class and his music classic. A must have for anyone who has ever been in love.,
,B0013F0LD2,1,1,4,"Lifehouse went a totally different direction on this album, away from the pop oriented sound on their debut album, and onto a more mature, dynamic sound.  My first few listens were judgmental, and I didn't give the album a fair chance to shine, because I was expecting more poppy hooks and rhythms.  After I let that out of my head, I listened to some pretty excellent music.
Without a doubt, the two best songs on the album are ""How Long"" and ""The Beginning"", two of the last songs on the album.  They show maturity as a band, and there is a Pink Floyd kind of feel to them, as the songs make you drift off and you feel like everything will be OK upon listening, and shortly thereafter.
""Just Another Name"", ""Anchor"", and ""Am I ever Gonna Find out"" are other stand out tracks, and sort of have a pop sound to them, with catchy hooks.
Jason Wade is a brilliant writer, and has a unique voice.  I look forward to Lifehouse's future work, as they are on the verge of putting out a masterpiece with their current evolution.",

Keep your church politics. Listen to his heart speaking those marvelous words, ABOUT Jesus!",

,B0013F29FK,1,1,4,"I'm not a huge fan of JCM because his gravelly, breathy voice never did anything for me, personally.  But he can't do anything about that - it's his voice.  When you have a feature that unique, some people just aren't going to like it.  However, that doesn't detract from his song writing ability, a talent he clearly possesses.  Hurt's So Good is a song with catchy guitar riffs, excellent production, and an 80's era rock sound that is unmistakable.  This is a great song everyone should have in their library.",

,B0013F0LD2,1,1,5,"Much like their excellent breakthrough album No Name Face, Stanley Climbfall after many rotations has revealed itself to be another stunning effort. In Jason Wade, Lifehouse appear to have a genuinely first-rate frontman and a fine writer of melodic, literate rock songs and who at a young age seems to have mastered all the combinations of chord changes that have direct access to the heart. The sounds Lifehouse's music immerses itself with have been used so frequently in the name of such mediocrity in the post-grunge era - that perhaps the hardest thing about listening to an album like Stanley CLimbfall is finding the conviction to believe in it's greatness. Lifehouse are truly a cut above. This is an album that by turns embraces terrific monster-hooks (Wash, Am I Ever Going To Find Out, and the title track) and subtle yet glorious melodies which reward repeated listenings (The Beginning, and the wonderful bonus track How Long) which, incredibly, is actually a real bonus - not just a cast-off. This is one band that deserves all the success they can muster and I highly recommend that we contribute to bands that consistently offer quality, depth and a reaon to keep coming back for more.",
,B0013F0LD2,-1,-1,2,"I love the two singles, Spin and Out of Breath, so I thought I'd download this first and give it a try.  As much as I hate to give an album with meaningful lyrics such a low rating, I have no other choice.  Sorry to all you hardcore fans, but this didn't cut it!  I tried to like this album and I still couldn't get into a lot of these songs!  There's too many slow, sleep  inducing tracks!  I can get the same thing from my relaxation CD!!  Not even the bonus track How Long is worth the extra money!  I gave this two stars for the five songs I like:  Spin, Sky Is Falling, Am I Ever Gonna Find Out, Out Of Breath, and Take Me Away.  My advice:  Go ahead, if you're a hardcore fan!  If you're just a casual fan like me, just download it or borrow it from a friend!  And while you're at it, try No Name Face instead!  So far, I've only heard sound clips, but it still seems like a better album than this!",
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,"I love this song and I believe that Mr. Richie was inspired to record it.  I know that he recorded it many years ago but  today it is still True and will never lose its message,  Jesus is Love!",

,B0013F470A,-1,-1,3,"This is different from the studio version/MTV video because there are a few noticeable differences. This song is slightly longer, for one, and the intro is slightly different. Two, after the ""Ooooohhh yeah, we're gonna have a party, yeah"" the whole rest of the song is different than the version I remembered. It's close enough, I suppose.",
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,All I can say is that this song is a classic. I love it!!! Lionel Richard lead this song with so much heart and love for God.,
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,"I love this song it was one of my favorite gospel songs.  I had an old CD copy of the Commodores album with this song on it and of course, it got damaged.  So thank you Amazon for having the best music.",
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,That is what He is Love I love the Commodores This song reminds me of the summer I went to Atlanta my cousin got married she use this song in her wedding and going to a night club there and met The Commodores which later on I got  a change to talk with them at the airport in Detroit it was not like it was in the club all those people around. We had a great chat in Detroit Metro Airport. Thanks Lionel Richie and the Commodores.,
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,Lionel really does justice to this song. I love him as an R & B but it is good to hear him sing some gospel.,
,B0013F0LD2,-1,-1,3,"I can just feel the unhelpful votes coming because I gave Lifehouse three stars, but I have to be honest. Before I came onto this site, I didn't even know anyone knew this album was out. And I know the guys have skills, but they have weird ways of using them on here.
""Out Of Breath"" is a good song, but it sounds just like ""Hanging By A Moment""; and when you stop to think about it, so does ""Spin"" (but not as much). ""Anchor"" is really overproduced, while the chorus to ""Wash"" could stand to be rewritten. And while I'm talking about the lyrics, Jason tends to say ""All I want is you"" repeatedly in a lot of the songs.
None of the songs are bad per se (well, maybe they could've left ""My Precious"" behind), but the songs sound so much like their previous work that it makes you wonder where originality factors in. (By the way, whoever wrote the lyrics in the liner notes needs to pay more attention because a lot of them are wrong.)",
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,"This is an inspirational song that will lift your heart, mind, and soul in praise.  Why not listen daily for great motivation?",
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,The song was exactly what I remembered.  The quality was terrific and the mp3 download was instant and very easy.,
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,This song is one of if not the greatest song that Lionel Ritchie has ever been involved with. JESUS IS LOVE!!!,
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,"I believe in listening to songs that have meaning.  It is good to listen to the beat in a song but when it comes down to spiritual food, than the lyrics has got to be there.  This songs takes me back and reminds me of the simple times when life was good.  It makes my heart happy because I know that Jesus is love...He won't let you down.  It also reminds me to stop letting Him down and be about ""My Father's business""!!!  Can I get an ""AMEN""!!!",
,B0013F2AL8,1,1,5,"This is the song that everybody's heard 100 times before however most people seem to think that it's a religious type of song but it's only religious in that they say the word hallelujah. Is more about him comparing making love to a woman and that being such a ""religious"" experience because of the power that it holds... (I was asked to use this for a funeral but once I explained to them what the lyrics said and what the song is about. They change their mindL:-)

the Song is still great song  but just know what this song is about before you buy don't just buy it because it says hallelujah, read the lyrics",
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,I did not have an idea this was on Amazon for downloading.  Heard it in the car a couple of days ago and thought I will check to see if it is available for downloading and here we are...  Life don't get no better than this.,

,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,I will recommend it to all my friends and will also do more business as well over all great job thanks.,
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,I love this song. It touches me deep down in my soul. Makes me feel like shouting. Like to play this loud.,
,B0013F48FY,1,1,5,"This one needs no comment the Title Speaks for it self this song touches my Heart and Soul, Mind every being in me.",
,B0013F0LD2,-1,-1,3,"It was surprising to me that I saw this album in my local music store without hearing a song on the radio, or hearing one word mentioned about its release.  I wondered how that could be, when I considered ""No Name Face"" one of the best 25 albums of all-time.
Anyway, this album is good.  It's no ""No Name Face"", but it's good.  I wish I could say it was great, but I can't.  There's too many holes in the album, and too many weak songs.  But there are a good number of quality songs, and a few very good ones, including ""Spin"", ""Wash"", ""Am I Ever Gonna Find Out"", and ""Just Another Name"".
The only major problem I have with this album is track number 7, called ""Out of Breath"".  This song sounds identical to ""Hanging by a Moment"" in every way.  The music is almost karaoke.  I can't understand why Lifehouse would make a song sound identical to their only smash hit song.
All in all, a good effort from Lifehouse, but something was missing here.  It's like a jigsaw puzzle with a few pieces missing.  It just isn't complete.",
,B0013F5N62,1,1,5,Listening to music on my Kindle Fire is one of my favorite pass times.  I can do other things while listening to music.  I can have a variety of music.,
,B0013F5N62,1,1,5,good,
,B0013F5N62,1,1,5,John Cougar Mellencamp at his best. Jack & Diane has been a classic anthem to a simpler time filled with hope for decades. The lyrics allude to love and thrills without the need for explicit words or phrases. The music itself is catchy and definitely roadtrip sing along worthy.,
,B0013F5N62,1,1,5,Great Music,
,B0013F5N62,1,1,5,"I listen to a wide range of music, and often I don't realize that a particular song I enjoy isn't a modern release until I look up more information about it online.  I frequently heard John ""Cougar"" Mellencamp's ""Jack and Diane"" on a ""lite"" radio station in the 2000s, but always thought it was a recent release -- it wasn't until recently that I learned it actually came out in the early '80s.  This doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the song, however -- I enjoy older music more than most modern music, and '80s music especially.  And this particular song is a fun and thoughtful one, upbeat but with lyrics that anyone can appreciate.

A mellower rock song with electric and acoustic guitars as the main instruments (the drums are more subdued up until the bridge), this song showcases the titular teens as the main characters -- two kids growing up in a small town in America's heartland, entertaining dreams of the future and enjoying each other's company.  Even as they make big plans for the future, the chorus and the bridge counsel them to hang onto their youth as long as they can, because everyone grows up eventually, and there's no returning to the days of your youth.  After all ""life goes on, long after the thrill of living is done.""

Whether or not you agree with that sentiment (there's still the old adages of ""age is only a number"" and ""growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional,"" after all), this is still a powerful song, sort of a grown-up version of Kenny Loggins' ""Return to Pooh Corner.""  While the singer of the former longs for a return to the days of childhood, John Mellencamp seems content to reminisce on the teenage years, and accepts that they won't come back and it's best to enjoy them as long as you can.

A very enjoyable rock number, one that transcends its era and is timely even to modern audiences.",

Every Ipod should have it on it if you are 30 and up",
,B0013F0LD2,1,1,5,"For most bands your second album is supposed to be something respectable to follow up the cd that got your name out there.  For Lifehouse the sophomore release Stanley Climbfall establishes the group as one of the most prolific of this age.  Coming off a multi platinum cde and the most played single so far this millenium, you might expect a let down.  But Lifehouse has taken things to a new level, a place that doesn't settle for the shallowness and mediocrity of modern music. Every song 1 - 14 is as good as a song can get. A feat so amazing its hard to believe its the second straight album in which it has been accomplished by the same artist.  With as good as No name Face was it is hard to believe the marked improvement that lifehouse has shown. The instrumentation on this cd is far superior to that of the first release, And Jason Wade has established himself as one of the most profound songwriters in the world.  If you do not buy this cd you would being doing yourself and everyone else a disservice. Tracks like Take me away, Sky is falling, and Anchor are sure to please any ear. It's official, the bar has been raised, the standard is set and it's name is Stanley.",

,B0013F4FWK,1,1,4,"Willie Nelson's colorful album The Great Divide (2002) is a mostly collaborative effort where Willie sings duets with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Kid Rock, Brian McKnight, Rob Thomas, and others. Actually, the best songs are the ones Willie does solo. The theme here seems to be centered around the challenges of getting older, and surviving the changes life brings us as we age. In the song This Face, Willie sings:

And this old heart's been beaten up
And my ragged soul's had things rough
And this face is all I have
...worn and lived in

The Great Divide is ambitiously produced (that's a good thing here) with lots of varied instrumentation and musical textures, and it sounds kind of like a pop album with a touch of country. The Willie solo songs Won't Catch Me Crying, The Great Divide, and This Face are all deep, thoughtful and quietly contemplative, and the music fits them perfectly. The best of the duets continue this mood, and they include the somber You Remain (w/ Bonnie Raitt), the Bernie Taupin penned Mendocino County Line (w/ Lee Ann Womack), and the very, very enjoyable Don't Fade Away (w/ Brian McKnight), which is an inspiration to anyone carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders:

Don't fade away
Nothing is what it seems
You're lost and in between
But you'll find yourself again

These songs are all very good in a world-weary, but resilient and hopeful way. Be There For You (w/ Sheryl Crow) and Maria (Shut Up And Kiss Me; w/ Rob Thomas) are pretty good, too, but Last Stand In Open Country (w/ Kid Rock) is a good song that could have been better if Willie would have found someone else to sing it with. Nothing against Kid Rock, but as a singer he's a little out of his league here. Willie also does a great solo cover of Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time that works very well. Recollection Phoenix (written by Rob Thomas) is also a very good and thoughtful song that Willie does solo.

The Great Divide isn't really a classic, but it's a very good country/pop music album that has some great songs on it, especially if you're a survivor and in the mood for reflective and autumnal themes, and hearing Willie get a little help from his friends.",
,B0013F4FWK,1,1,4,"I have never been a fan of Nelson...his voice is so thin, but I am a fan of this album. It's Willie's attempt at mimicking the success of Santana's Supernatural (it even has three Rob Thomas songs!) and that's why it works for me. Other guests are Lee Ann Womack, Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt & the one goof...Brian McKnight. He also covers Cindi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" & The First Edition's ""Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In"" It's a pretty safe bet that this will be the only Willie Nelson CD I will ever own, because it's not really Willie...only sorta Willie.",
,B0013F4FWK,1,1,5,"In country music, one name stands above all others: Willie Nelson.  While not a huge Willie fan, I've always admired the man, for he has such a talent for bringing a song to life.  And ""The Great Divide"" is no exception.
I won't waste time telling you which songs were my favorites, for you are not me.  I will tell you, however, that you are in for a treat.  Rob Thomas, Sheryl Crow, and Bonnie Rait show themselves for harmony duets, blending their voices well with Willie's.  Lee Ann Womack, Kid Rock, and Brian McKnight go for the full-fledged thing--bringing to life tales of gunslingers, lost loves, and hope.  Willie redoes the old Kenny Rogers rock'n'roll song ""Just Dropped In..."" and goes entirely country on the title track and ""This Face,"" a wonderful ballad about aging.  ""Maria,"" ""Last Stand,"" ""Be There For You,"" and ""Time After Time"" keep the album's upbeat going, while ""Mendocino County Line"", ""Won't Catch Me Crying,"" ""Don't Fade Away,"" ""Recollection Phoenix"", and ""You Remain"" provide a gentler, quieter side.
With all the talent on this CD (with Willie, of course, being the most prominent) this is one divide you should not step across.  Take the time to pick it up and listen to it...who knows, you just may have a good time, Heaven forbid!",
,B0013F4FWK,1,1,4,"The great divide- a track off the album- but how appropriate a name of this cd which includes duets with members of the rock, and r&b world. My favorite is Mendicino county line which is also a country- 2 country duet.

Obviously, her vocal talent is quite impressive, though her bold statement is even more impressive.  This song has somewhat of a ""rock"" feel to it, and I like that it isn't too ""pop""-sounding.  Mostly, I am impressed that Natalie is someone who cares about human rights--such as ending human trafficking--and being expressive about her Christian faith.  Plus, she can sing.",

,B0013G0KRS,1,1,5,"I've enjoyed Heather Headley's voice from the first time I heard her, but with IN MY MIND she was able to not only tell a story of love, loss and moving on but how difficult it can be to let go. When you are really in love---and I mean REALLY in love---it's not something that just ends when you say ""It's over."" The video especially illustrates how a part of that individual lingers around you like your favorite fragrance and you can't seem to shut it out, even though it might eventually fade.

Heather's delivery of this song is so powerful even years after it was initially released because it speaks the truth that so many of us deny but know to be the case for us at one time or another. You can move on, but it doesn't mean you have to forget.",
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,4,"This is really the biggest surprise of the year thus far. I mean, this girl comes off the American Idol of England, comes to the states, and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to #1. What's the secret? Apparently America just loves those female R&B Love Song vibes.

Leona Lewis herself has a rather good voice, and carries herself pretty well throughout the song. The song itself is pretty darn standard in the R&B Love Song genre, so it could be sung by Mariah, or any artist in that mold for that matter. No ground is broken, but it is a nice listen, and so far, it has not annoyed me to death, so that's always a positive.

So overall, nothing brilliant, nothing new, but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial. And, even though this might be saying much, this song might be better than most of Mariah's work, since her stuff is so overly done, it's pathetic. It's also a nice change of pace that Leona isn't practically begging her lover to touch her body like another certain artist has done. ;)",
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,4,"It is just so sad that there really haven't been any credible newcomers who've made it in the industry. After the degrading appeal of the contenders from American Idol and poor record sales, it has been very difficult for good singers to come out from the heart. For newcomer Leona Lewis, she has a difficult road to travel but she is doing it all in stride. Bleeding Love, the first single from her debut album Spirit, is definitely one of the best songs I've heard so far this year. She has a very strong voice that withstands better than those wannabe divas like Britney Spears or Jordin Sparks who just feel like they are more about the hype than heart. She has a really strong voice with this song, and I'm really eager to hear her album Spirit. If it is as good as the song Bleeding Love, than I know she will go far.

,B0013G0PG4,1,1,5,Love this song!,
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,5,Classic pop ballad.  This girl has a tremendous voice.  Another talent discovered on a tv talent show.  It is impressive how many incredible current artists have been discovered this way in recent years.  Is the music industry asleep at the wheel?,
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,4,Very seldom do you find an artist that sounds as good as she looks!  She can make my love bleed anytime!,
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,5,"British beauty and chanteuse Leona Lewis captured our hearts with her amazing ""Bleeding Love"", which makes many of us proclaim that it's brilliance is comparable to the multi-award-winning vocalist of Mariah Carey. I will say yes but Lewis is equally impressive and holds her own style. It just mirrors Mariah Carey but she doesn't mimic her, and Lewis delivers such a brilliant performance with this song and teaches millions of listeners and music lovers like me that ""Bleeding Love"" may be truly necessary.",
,B0013G0PG4,-1,-1,1,hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge diarreah attack. except it creates same effect on the ears. good looking girl though...,
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,4,"There s no question that when a winner is crowned from American Idol, or the show X Factor, most of the time they haven't had the real smash success that has remained everlasting, with exceptions like Kelly Clarkson ad Jennifer Hudson who've had the real drive in music, but for Leona Lewis who won the X Factor overseas in 2007, many fans really had a interesting time trying to know her by her voice. Bleeding Love, her breakthrough single is definitely a great song to download, and shows her voice brilliantly at heart. The song which was released in 2008 is still a beautiful song to listen to from start to finish. It definitely shows that she really has followed in the footsteps of her influenced divas like Celine Dion and the legendary Whitney Houston. I love this song, and if you have never heard Leona before, you'll really want to hear this song.

,B0013G0PG4,1,1,5,I love this song and can relate to her pain I never thought a song like this would ever be out but I was wrong but her words are what you need to listen to,
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,5,Just the song I was looking for. I don't know what else they expect you to write.. its a music download.,
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,4,I purchased this to add to my IPOD collections so I can listen while napping before a long day at work.,
,B0013G0PG4,-1,-1,1,But after awhile her whining just gets on your nerves. I bought it listened to it for a week or two and then deleted it out of my library and I'm happier without this song.,

,B0013G0PG4,1,1,4,"Nice lyrics, pretty girl and a nice vocal range shown. ^_^b

4 stars.",
,B0013G0PG4,1,1,4,"This is really the biggest surprise of the year thus far. I mean, this girl comes off the American Idol of England, comes to the states, and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to #1. What's the secret? Apparently America just loves those female R&B Love Song vibes.

Leona Lewis herself has a rather good voice, and carries herself pretty well throughout the song. The song itself is pretty darn standard in the R&B Love Song genre, so it could be sung by Mariah, or any artist in that mold for that matter. No ground is broken, but it is a nice listen, and so far, it has not annoyed me to death, so that's always a positive.

So overall, nothing brilliant, nothing new, but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial. And, even though this might be saying much, this song might be better than most of Mariah's work, since her stuff is so overly done, it's pathetic. It's also a nice change of pace that Leona isn't practically begging her lover to touch her body like another certain artist has done. ;)",
,B0013G0N3E,1,1,5,Kelli gives this christmas favorite a cute kick!! Kelli Pickler is too cute and she gives this song that extra something.,
,B0013G20PS,-1,-1,3,This was an okay arrangement of a fabulous classic song that just seems kind of tired and endless to me after listening a few times.,
,B0013G2SFK,1,1,5,"The first time I heard this song it was when a friend played it as a joke, it being my name. But that wasn't why I bought it. Amy's voice is something special. On this song she's mixed ""a great beat you can dance to"" as they used to say on American Bandstand (RIP Dick Clark!) and words that are easy to sing. So dancing, driving or just running the vacuum, this song is fun.",
,B0013G20IK,1,1,5,Christmas songs will always have me felt with warmth and joy inside. Especially when its coming from Christian artists. I will always love them.,
,B0013G20IK,1,1,5,Love this song about our Savior Jesus Christ. The female artist does a nice job. She sings about the wonder of the Christ Child and His mission.,
,B0013G20IK,1,1,5,"I can't sing this one, but I love the song. It has such a beautiful melody and wonderful lyrics. I would highly recommend it.",
,B0013G2SFK,1,1,5,Miss her! Always puts me in a good mood when I listen to this song.,

Marilyn is one of those few artists like Dionne warwick and connie francis who can make any song her own...Buy this Cd",
,B0013G42XG,1,1,4,"Truth is, I didn't buy this CD; I could hire Marilyn and Billy to perform it for me these days for what it costs.  I DO have the original LP in great condition though.  I play it perhaps twice a year.  I've always wondered why the title song, a bit more sentimental than the follow-up, ""You Don't Have to Be a Star"" wasn't a bigger hit.  Apparently it did leave the public hungry for more since ""You Don't Have to Be a Star"" gets regular play on oldies stations.  At a reasonable price, those two songs would make this a good buy and the rest would be gravy.  If money means nothing to you, by all means, lay your money down and enjoy.  The album is most pleasant.",

,B0013G63QK,1,1,4,Awesome song.,
,B0013G2UCG,1,1,5,"Jeff Buckley chose to play this song with the capo on the 5th fret which gave the song a higher-pitched and softer melodic feel. He also chose finger-picking, which added to the delightful sound. HIs extraordinary voice made the song almost hypnotizing.",
,B0013G2UCG,1,1,4,I like any version of Hallelujah and this is a good one. Top favorite is Leonard Cohan and Susan Boyle but this is also very nice.,
,B0013G2UCG,1,1,5,I was already very familiar with these two artists doing this song. The record is in pristine condition as well as the record sleeve. Nicely packaged for utmost protection. Shipping was extremely fast!,
,B0013G2U4O,1,1,5,"Back in the day, or just a few years ago, the Foo crafted the best rock anthems out there on the pop/rock side of the equation. And while it wasn't exactly revolutionary, it rocked like nothing else. ""Learn To Fly"" is probably the best of their rock anthems, which go great in any arena, stadium, or any venue with tons of people to rock along with.

The lyrics are truly a Grohl original, who knows how to craft a song like this like nobody else. The verses do their job, and produce some great lines, but everybody knows they're just the stuff in-between the chorus. And the chorus is in True rock anthem style, keeping the riffs soaring, the vocals soaring and the song flying high.

Overall, very pleasant and rockin' Foo Fighter modern rock with arena anthem roots, it keeps itself together in places it could have gone wrong, and again, that chorus is just so awesome. A True Foo great, and surly a fan favorite, the Foo today is good, but we'll never forget the old Foo.",

,B0013G43U8,1,1,5,"This collection really shows off Amy's stuff.  She's got the chops and is a pleasure to listen to.  She's got a musical sensitivity missing in so many of today's contemporary artists that makes listening to Amy feel like a breath of fresh air.

I'm glad these B-Sides were released in this format and not buried.  Fans of Ms. Winehouse will appreciate this.",
,B0013G43U8,1,1,5,"I was so glad to find this online--I finally got to hear Valerie, which I heard about but never got to hear her sing.  And on the other songs that were included, she sounded so wonderful.  I'm one fan who truly misses her.",
,B0013G43U8,1,1,5,"I was wow by Amy singing, she was so good and bad,but so good again. Love R&B and soul here on Back To Black B-Sides. Angel voice. 5 stars. I'am going to miss her so much. All the music is more than great sound that move you so, ""Back To Black B-Sides.",
,B0013G43U8,1,1,5,"This collection of B-Sides is truly necessary to get a completist mindset of the talents and versatility of Amy Winehouse.  Tha album BACK TO BLACK was definitely a concept album about love and relationships and these cuts didn't blend in well or truly fit the concept of what did make the album.  But it in no way means these songs aren't superb and worthy.  Most importantly we have VALERIE which was a huge hit in the UK.  Producer Mark Ronson asked Amy to collaborate with him on it and it appears on his cd but no other Winehouse cd.  A True find.  CUPID is a great soulful version of a classic song.  With MONKEY MAN and HEY LITTLE RICH GIRL Amy has great fun with her band and backup singers to great results.  They are fun, uptempo tracks.  The Cuban styled YOU'RE WONDERING NOW shows yet another side of the versatility Amy possessed.

The True standouts are the final 2 tracks.  Her rendering of TO KNOW HIM IS TO LOVE HIM will break your heart with its honesty.  And the final demo acoustic version of LOVE IS A LOSING GAME shows Amy's raw and strong talent without the production of a studio.  Instead you get her vocal talent, emotive ability and are left with a strong message of the True talent she possessed.  All these songs are in no way tracks left off for being sub-par but rather songs that just didn't quite fit.  Any Amy Winehouse fan will find them a definite necessity.  Highly recommend.",

,B0013HYLT0,1,1,5,"I was given ""Mary Poppins: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack"" when I was four, in 1970. I still hum most of the songs. You will too. Though it was released several decades before, it is a classic, entertaining and completely delightful CD.
These songs are silly, deliciously without any message. ""A Spoonful Sugar"" (helps the medicine go dow-own!) is as meaningless as it is catchy. Don't be embarrassed after a few listens, that you, an adult, are caught up in public whistling ""Chim Chim Cher-ee.""
The music seems a million miles away from the canned pop tunes Disney cranks out now. Don't get me wrong, I love ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" but there is a point at which today's Disney seems to be written to meet a market need than for the pure love of music.
Among my prouder moments in grade school was being able to spell 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,' and that I could say it without stumbling over each syllable.
I fully recommend ""Mary Poppins: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack.""

,B0013IMW0E,1,1,5,"Although this song is thirty years old, it sounds every bit as good today as it always did. It took four amazing songwriters to put together this oscar award winning masterpiece: Christopher Cross, Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager, and Peter Allen, and you can hear their brillance all the way through. Not only is it a great song on it's own but you can't hear it without nostalgically remembering the film, Arthur, for which it was composed, which is also a timeless classic.

Listening to it makes me nostalgic for days long past.

The version of the song which I bought was from the ""Arthur - The Album [Original Soundtrack]"" and the mp3 file sounds really nice.. so I am very satisfied with it! I like some other tracks from this album so it is quite possible I might get more of them eventually.

,B0013JWOZG,1,1,5,"It's an mp3 download - product is exactly what was advertised.  Not much more to say about it, you either like him or you don't.",
,B0013JWOZG,1,1,5,I first heard this song when I watched the series and felI in love with this song! It is excellent,
,B0013JWOZG,1,1,5,"Can't go wrong with Everlast perfect soundscape for Saving Grace.
Everlast is my favorite male vocalist by far. Two more words needed.",
,B0013JWRBW,1,1,5,This song takes me back to the days of 70's radio airplay. I especially love the extended mix with the additional percussion performance at the beginning and end,
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,5,Always a classic,
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,5,love this song,
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,5,Excellent song,
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,5,This will take you right back to the 70's,
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,5,"So one night my girlfriend mentions this song and tries to sing a bit of it and asks if I remember it.  Now, I don't profess to know every song that's ever been released, but I like to think I'm pretty knowledgeable about most rock and roll from 1970's to 2000's anyway.  Well, I had this dumb look on my face and said I didn't recognize it.  So we looked it up on YouTube and found the ""video"" they did for this song in the mid 70's (possibly the most hilariously creepy video I have ever seen, worth the look up if you have the time. lol.) and I said without a doubt that I had NEVER heard this song.  So of course I had to have it!!  It's on my playlist now and we get a kick out of it whenever it comes on!",
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,5,"I love singing to this song. The lyrics came with it; I was so happy they did. I think about how the song words go and they are so fun. And for the price that the song is, it is such a good way to buy a song and put it on my Kindle. Thank you for having this song.",
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,5,"From their first album Mixed Emotions, this sexy song became the #1 single in the US on 1978 Billboard Hot 100.",
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,5,"70's classic rock doesn't die, They just find old people like me to play them on occasion to remind them of the old radio daze....",
,B0013JWR6W,1,1,4,"I heard this song the other day and wondered who the artist was. This is the only song I know from this group and it is a big it. It is an 80's tune and it is a cross between Country/Pop. When you first hear it you will know it, it was very popular in the later 80's. For anyone who loves the music that defined a decade, this is for you.

,B0013JYP6W,-1,-1,2,"Alright, Daughtry is definitely not as good as I thought he was. In fact, he might be the most unoriginal guy in modern rock to come around in quite awhile, and that's saying something. However, this time he doesn't sound like another artist, he sounds like his bad self, or more specifically, ""Over You"" which was his previous single. Anybody else see something wrong with this picture? And yet, he rules rock radio.

The verses are mediocre at best, and the chorus on its short run on radio is already annoying the heck out of me. It just doesn't seem real, like it's a half-hearted effort or something; something to please the record labels. Chris's vocals are stellar as always, but contrary to popular belief, the song itself makes for most of its success, and this one is made, but it's in pieces taped together in a quick effort to please a record executive.

So overall, on if, if not Daughtry's worse in a rather short career so far. Hopefully he'll come out his sophomore album rather soon, so the rest of the musical skeletons in his compact disc closet will stay where they belong: hidden.",
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,Made into ringtone for when someone from home is calling... quite perfect and I know I need to pick up the phone ASAP!,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,love it,

,B0013JWPPU,1,1,4,GREAT SONG!!,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,Awesome,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,Love Daughtry!!,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,4,I remember seeing Chris Daughtry on American Idol. I wanted him to win so bad and when he didn't I was so disappointed. That was the first and only full season of American Idol that I ever watched so I am partial towards the people from that season. I just love his voice so much.,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,i love this man.,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,"They have used this song when doing the video's when the men and women are coming home from war and other place out of the USA and it always has seem to be the right fit.
God Bless Daughtry for coming up with the whole album being the BOMB.!!!!",
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,4,"An American idol which come through for all, exceptional music to enjoy, sons you can relate to. must hear the album to relate to the location of sons.",
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,"I say that because for me that means I listen to lyrics.  I don't know if he wrote it, but it has a strong rock feel with a country kind of lyric.",
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,Great song that brings you to tears. When I first heard this song I fell in love. Helps me study and keep calm.,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,4,"I've really liked this song since first hearing it on American Idol. Now it feels comfortable and familiar, it's nice being able to play it whenever I'm in the mood for it.",
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,What a great tune. Daugherty has proven again and again he was worthy his success. Definitely as great one. 5 stars!!!,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,4,This song is a good way to introduce yourself to Daughtry.  It really shows what kind of music they make.  Very good song over all.,
,B0013JWPPU,1,1,5,"Written before Daughtry left for American Idol semi-superstardom, this song was also used for the actual show, and made for the best goodbye song yet. Although the song has lost a little of its luster after going through the ugly radio cycle, the song still remains as good as ever with its touching lyrics, perfect vocals, great structure, and its build-up during the course of the song. In fact, the only thing that could top this song, is its acoustic version, which I believe was distributed by Wal-Mart. It perfects the song in amazing ways, and makes the song a real stunner with new depths of emotion. That version was quickly added to my long list of best songs of all time.

So overall, Daughtry's best song, and it deserves all its praise. Try to get the acoustic version if you can, but either way, its a great song that'll always be remembered for American Idol.",
,B0013K0RYA,1,1,5,Love it!,
,B0013K0RYA,1,1,5,"This song has gotten many a new truck/jeep buried up in a field.
Not necessarily a ""bad thing"" if you bring along the girlfriend.",
,B0013K0RYA,1,1,5,"I purchased and rated it because it is a great song, I highly recommend it to those who like Country.",
,B0013K0RYA,1,1,5,"I think that songs are hard to review, because you either like them or you don't.  That being said, I think Brad Paisley has a great voice, and 'Mud on the Tires' is one of my favorites that he sings.  All in all, it's just a great song about enjoying the simple things of living out in the country!",
,B0013K2STM,1,1,4,Not one of his best but it is still a very strong song.  You feel it most when he belts out the chorus.,
,B0013K2STM,1,1,4,"I wouldn't say this is a song for every occasion, but when you're feeling down, it helps with relieving some frustration blasting it in the car. The song has such a melancholic message.",
,B0013K2STM,1,1,5,This CD is awesome.  I really love it.,
,B0013K2STM,1,1,4,I love this song.,
,B0013K2STM,1,1,5,This is one of my favorite songs by Daughtry... That moment when LIghtning strikes your brain and you think this is only temporary but this is not the way this is going to end! There has to be a blow out ending.. maybe not a permanent one but a definite blow out closure!,
,B0013K2STM,1,1,5,Really has a lot of meaning in this song and hit nail on head with my wife and I starting a new year together. It's our 34th year together. Love her to the max. My soul mate.,
,B0013K2STM,1,1,5,"Hard rocking and defiant and taking a stand for all the right reasons. He may not have won American Idol, but he hasthe talents and the chops to be here for a long, long time.",

,B0013K0RZ4,1,1,4,It is music I like what is with this required number of words non sense - if I did not like it I wouldn't have bought it,
,B0013K0RZ4,1,1,5,Although a very sad song...it shows the great love that two people have for each other and that they can't live without one another.,
,B0013K0RZ4,1,1,5,Brad Paisley's voice is a dramatic counter to Alison's soft voice as they tell the story of alcoholism and death. There's no time you don't feel the ache. I had to buy my favorite songs from the CD I already owned.,
,B0013K0RZ4,1,1,5,As I'd said in another review....what's not to like about Brad Paisley? I bought this for my personal collection. Satisfied with purchase.,
,B0013K0RZ4,1,1,5,"The story line,,, the music,,, the harmony.  It's all wonderful!  You won't be able to get the song out of your head, and you'll want to memorize it.",

,B0013KX0HG,1,1,5,I absolutely love this song. It's one of the most beautiful Christmas songs I have heard in a long time.,
,B0013KX0HG,1,1,5,"Not a great fan of the song in previous recordings, but the studio musicians and the front vocals are Rolls Royce quality! Stereo mix is enveloping and rich. Good thing: this is one seriously sappy piece of music. This recording conveys a sense of awe others don't. Glad to own it.",
,B0013KX0HG,1,1,5,I loved this song the first time I heard it.  It is a touching song that adds to the True meaning of Christmas.,
,B0013KX0HG,1,1,5,"I saw him in concert earlier this month. He was so sweet, kind and acted with the audience in a way most performers dont. Still has the voice. This along with over another 100 Kenny Rogers songs is my favorite.",
,B0013KX0HG,1,1,4,The duo of Kenny Rogers & Wynonna Judd is one for the books.  The two of them singing together is truly a treasure and quite a song to be added to your Christmas Classics list.,
,B0013KX0HG,1,1,4,"This is a very meloncholy song, has a sadness to it that sets a mood. i feel it's a very good version of this song.",

My family has a challenging experience right now. I am going on another journey in my life and hoping it is a better one. Time to say goodbye to my past and see what is in my future. Rascal Flatts, your music is very inspiring to listen to, a comfort to endure and without it there would not be music to feel of how my life has been.
 To my 3 daughters: May you search for what you want out of life, follow your heart and you will achieve it. Keep your dreams high and make it the best journey you will endure. Hope I have taught you something about life and if you can only remember 1 thing may it be....I love you.
 I have been through everything and cant imagine it any worse that what it has been. Keep on singing and Im movin on.",
,B0013L8WQO,1,1,5,great song. Thank you!!,

,B0013L702G,1,1,5,"I am so glad to get this as a single. For quite some time, my late husband played this song for me each morning to wake me up. Mixed emotions when I hear it now, but I still think it is a beautiful song.",

,B0013L91LE,1,1,5,He is a very talented and funny person. I never get tired of listening to these songs and I still laugh every time I listen.,
,B0013L91LE,-1,-1,2,"I had to buy this giant album to get a few songs that weren't available on other albums. Some of the songs are worth it, but most are just repetitive and annoying.",
,B0013OXELY,1,1,5,"Each one of these tracks on disc two have their own unique, quality that make them essential for Zevon fans BUT a couple are actually superior in their own way to the final versions. For example the plain demo and vocal version of ""The French Inhaler"" packs a wallop as does the solo piano version of ""Mohammed's Radio"". As with the ""Elton John"" two disc release that had demos on the second disc, this is one of those few albums that was great to begin with but has been improved by including these terrific alternate takes and solo demos. The band version of ""Carmelita"" captures the live vibe of how this sounded with a full band and I actually prefer it to the more somber reading on the original album (although both are exceptional). ""Frank and Jesse James"" is SO intimiate you can hear the helicopter that passes over Warren's home briefly at around the 3 minute mark.

Warren Zevon considered this his debut but it was really his second solo album (""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" was his first an album he really disliked). The cream of L.A. musicians appear on this terrific album. Zevon's vision focuses on the dark side of L.A. and America. ""Hasten Down the Wind"", ""Poor Poor Pitiful Me"" and ""Carmelita"" were all tackled by Linda Ronstandt on various albums and as great as her versions are they lack the bittersweet quality Zevon infuses in his versions. The original album sounds good--not great in this remaster. It's louder, more compressed than the original but fans will really be picking this up for the second disc out outtakes and alternate versions of the songs on disc one.

The track listing below represents what is on the second disc.

1. Frank And Jesse James(Solo Piano Demo)
2. The French Inhaler(Solo Piano Demo)
3. Hasten Down The Wind(Band Demo)
4. Carmelita(1974 Demo)
5. Mohammed's Radio(Solo Piano Demo)
6. Backs Turned Looking Down The Path(Alternate take)
7. Join Me In L.A.(Alternate take)
8. Poor Poor Pitiful Me(Alternate take)
9. Frank And Jesse James(Alternate take)
10. Mohammed's Radio(Alternate take)
11. The French Inhaler(Alternate take)
12. Carmelita(Alternate Version)
13. Desperados Under The Eaves(alternate take)
14. Mama Couldn't Be Persuaded(Live)
15. I'll Sleep When I'm Dead(Alternate Version)

Highly recommended for fans of Zevon. The remaster sounds solid although it doesn't have quite the dynamic range of the original CD. While it is louder the mastering by Gavin Lurssun isn't bad just not ideal.",
,B0013OXELY,1,1,5,Just a perfect record by a guy who wasn't trying to sound like anyone else and had more wit and talent than most of the competition put together.,
,B0013OXELY,1,1,5,"Let's head to Echo Park, and pick up some Pioneer Chicken. We'll raise a glass to Mr. Zevon, who was there when The Eagles, Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and so many others made the music that mattered. He stood out, not as a hit maker, but as chronicler of what he saw and lived, and like Joni Mitchell, was unafraid to be very personal about his life and the people around him. Like Randy Newman, he was a songwriter's songwriter, and you either came to his party or missed out. This collection is a great way to introduce yourself to him, and I suggest you sit back back, put down the Smith and Wesson, and enjoy some chicken and Jim Beam. It's Nighttime In The Switching Yard.",
,B0013OXELY,1,1,4,"This is a double disk set of Warren's first album.  The main disk has been remastered nicely, and it contains a bonus disk of out takes and alternate takes, you do get some repeats on the second disk, Mohammed's Radio is done twice, and while interesting one of them could have been left off.

If you are a Warren Zevon fan this is a great set, if not this is a nice place to start a great journey with a great artist.",

,B0013V2PEE,1,1,5,"Bob Baldwin is one of the hardest working jazz musicians in the business. In addition to his musical creations, he's also has a hand in organizing a music festival in Westchester County (NY). He's also had some bad luck in regards to record labels. The last CD he released with his previous label, A440 Music Group was a critical success. However, the company suffered from a  cash flow problem to promote his and other artists CD's and declared bankruptcy last year. Baldwin has since signed on with 215 Records out of Philadelphia for his latest release, ""All in a Day's Work"".  For those who are not familiar with Baldwin, just think of Alex Bugnon with soul.  His style is smooth, very hip.  His music sounds very much like New York.  it has an urban style that is sophisticated and classy.  I thought that sound was clear with the title track as well as the song, ""Steamy"".  They were clearly the best tracks on the CD.  I was very thrilled by his release.  He'll be in our play list for sometime.  It's an outstanding piece of work.",
,B0013WUF9A,1,1,5,MADNESS was one of those bands with the fun SKA-like sound. I turned up my radio any time Our House came on. It always lightened my mood.,
,B0013WUF9A,1,1,5,One of the funniest songs of New Wave paying homage to Frat Houses and silliness which is Great Fun at its best. I highly recommend it.,

,B0013WUF9A,1,1,4,"""Our House"" by Madness is one of those pop 80s songs that almost everyone's heard before. This song was semi-sampled by Jason Mraz in his song ""Zero Percent"" (an excellent song that almost nobody's heard of unless you're a True Jason Mraz fan). Listen and you'll be addicted!",
,B0013WUF9A,1,1,5,These types of songs remind me of great times and bring back wonderful memories. I am so glad that these type of songs are still available.,

,B0013XOEX2,1,1,5,Great song!,
,B0013XP6S4,1,1,5,"This CD includes samples from many of Mozart's best-known and most popular wrorks--sonatas, operas, etc. It's a good starting point for those new to Mozart or the casual classical listener. Buy it for a friend, get them hooked on Music's genius.
p.s. I know some people may turn their noses up at me for calling Mozart the greatest, but he was better than Beethoven because of his operas, and he was better than Bach because although Bach is more complex, intricate and elaborate in his instrumentation and harmony, Mozart is more perfect. That is the bottom line.
David Rehak
author of ""A Young Girl's Crimes""",
,B0013XP6S4,1,1,5,"This is a great sampler of the world's greatest composer (well, Bach and Beethoven are contenders)!  Rather than deciding where to begin -- operas? symphonies? concertos? sonatas? -- you can begin everywhere at once.  The performances are not second-rate, they are excerpts from world-class recordings.

You can use this set as the basis for further listening adventures, or you can use it as an end in itself.  As such, it is surely a contender for Best CD In The World.  If you bought complete recordings of every composition excerpted on this disc, you might have to file for bankruptcy, so don't let purism stand in the way of enjoying Mozart.

I used this set as my introduction (it was previously packaged as THE GREATEST MOZART SHOW ON EARTH) when I first ventured into classical music a couple of years ago, and so far I've expanded into operas, piano concertos, violin concertos, and string quintets.

The genius revealed over the range of forms led to love at first listening!",
,B0013XP6S4,1,1,5,Love the mixture of music from Mozart. It definitely qualifies as SOME of his greatest hits!,
,B0013XP6S4,1,1,5,"I bow to the genius of Mozart. It has been held for more than one century, and his music still resonates in the thousands souls and changes the world. It is known that during the life Mozart eked out a miserable existence.  Contemporaries did not appreciate his unique talent. It will happen later. It is possible that so it was necessary for the story. Especially, justice has been done and now the whole world admires the music of Mozart. This disc contains his most outstanding pieces of music. This is Golden collection of World Classics.",

,B001416OXG,1,1,5,love it,
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,I love this artist and his sound. I enjoy this CD every day. I'm so glad I bought it and you will be too.,
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,Love Gavin DeGraw! This CD is great and love that it came with a stripped CD. Follow Through is one of the songs on our wedding DVD so hearing it brings back many fond memories!,
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,"I have to admit I didn't know what to expect from this CD but was very pleasantly surprised. I had heard ""I Don't Want To Be"" on the radio and loved it. On a whim, I bought the CD when I was out shopping, and didn't expect the rest of the album to be so consistently good, but it is. While ""I Don't Want To Be"" remains my favorite track on the CD, there are numerous other standouts as well including the popular ""Chariot"" and ""Over-Rated,"" another of my favorites.

The beauty of the album is the eclectic amalgamation of styles from pop (obviously,) rock, and blues, with a weird alternative undercurrent. DeGraw undoubtedly has a powerful singing style (though he occasionally flirts with giving an overwrought performance,) and has clear command of the material and the needed vocal range to pull off these songs. For those of you who doubt this, give a listen to the bonus disc, ""Stripped,"" and his interpretation of the Sam Cooke classic ""Change Is Gonna Come."" ""Stripped"" was one of the big reasons I bought the CD versus just downloading a few choice tracks: I love hearing alternate, unenhanced versions of music (e.g. ""Unplugged,"") and while not simply DeGraw and a guitar or piano (there are rhythm and drum parts) I really enjoyed ""Stripped."" In fact my initial inclination was to give the album four stars due to some homogeneity in the songs as originally presented, but ""Stripped"" changed my mind, and made the five star rating the only logical choice. On balance I still prefer listening to ""Chariot"" in its original form, but ""Stripped"" provides a refreshing alternative approach to the material and the bonus of ""Change Is Gonna Come."" You might not think a young guy like DeGraw could pull off the Cooke civil rights watershed, but he does so convincingly and respectfully.

I am surprised I liked this CD as much as I did as I am not generally a fan of the genre, but DeGraw is clearly a talented performer and has genre-defying dynamism: ""Chariot"" is a really good effort, and will provide hours of listening pleasure.",
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,"Well it sucks that Amazon doesn't sell the digital copy of Chariot (Stripped) b/c it is the greatest thing ever. Seriously. His cover of Change Gonna Come... I've listened to it about 1000 times and get chills every time he hits that note.... you'll know what Im talking about when you hear it. So yea... get this record, but I would actually suggest going out to best buy and getting the physical copy with stripped in it b/c it will change your life.",
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,"Uplifting is the demeanor you get to see when listening to this CD. It was a blur before but now....well. Let's just start here:

When I first listened to this CD, I was like, OK. It's OK. But besides the single, a lot of the songs just came and went.

Good thing I didn't sell this or give it away because deep inside the lyrics, the melodies and the piano arrangements, is a pleasant gift from Gavin to you. He's very, very smart and in tune with how he feels which is great to hear these days.

Not that other men don't do this, because it's rampantly-common these days. But Gavin just has a way of doing it so, so, so well! So give this CD a chance! I know it took me a while to love it!

I already rated the normal album with the second Stripped version and now I'm gonna do this. So you'll obviously notice that I like the songs much more now.

Follow Through - 4.5 stars. I love this song. It's so innocent.

Chariot - 4.5 stars. We've all heard this one a million times. Inspirational and features great piano and a nice arrangement.

Just Friends - 5.25 stars. What I thought about this song initially has changed. It's a great, honest tale of a lying cheat. Gavin's still willing to forgive if they just put the thought in the past and they admit that they really do love each other.
I'm with him, but hopefully will only be stepped on once and then they're off!

(Nice to Meet You) Anyway - 5 stars. xoxoxox

Chemical Party - 4.3 stars. This is a good song. It speaks about a girl who has fun at a party and enjoys everyone but Gavin. He's drunk and she is high...too high to realize him. ""I think I like you but you like this whole room. You sexy machine!""

Belief - 6 stars. This song is kind of weird, lyrically, at first. But give it time.
""When you came to my defense with a knife in the shape of your mouth in the form of your body"" didn't make too much sense to me then. But I've always liked the ending, continue to like it, and I totally understand what he means and is talking about now; love, trust, understanding, affection and sex. My favorite by him so far. Can't wait till the next album comes next month.
Mariah Carey is actually my favorite singer ever, and I'm looking forward to this release more so than her next!!

Crush - 5 stars. Thank you, Gavin. You delivered another strong track. I love the composition of this song. Once again, good job!

I Don't Want to Be - 4.75 stars. Gavin's first single. It's a great one at that. Gives off a good message. Tells the world that Gavin isn't afraid to be his own self. In fact when people expect him to be different, he totally blows it off and finds the power inside to stand out as him and no one else.

Meaning - 5.5 stars. This song didn't really do much for me before...but now it's so not skip-able! In fact it's my second favorite song here. I just love the lyrics. And the Falsetto notes he hits a few times. You will LOVE this one. It's a favorite.

More Than Anyone -  4.25 stars. Cute, but even though it's better than what it was the first listen through, it's just not a standout.

Over-rated - 4.3 stars. I really like the lyrics here.

53.35  11 = 4.85 stars.

End note: As you saw, none of these songs gets lower than a 4-star rating this time around. I really am in love with this CD. And I must say, although I've said great things about many CDs, this is definitely in my favorite 20 CDs I've ever heard. For real, for real!

Big ups to Gavin Degraw for this MASTERPIECE. It's pop music without being overly poppy. It's catchy without being too catchy and it might not be raw but it's real. Believe that.",
,B001416PEY,1,1,5,Like this song alot because every time I here it makes me love my wife more.,
,B001416PEY,1,1,5,"If a man sung this song to me, I would be saying I do so fast, lol. Such a sexy and romantic song. I love it!",
,B001416PEY,1,1,5,Heard this song on Youtube and had to have it.  Love the music!  Raheem DeVaughn is so underrated.  His musicianship is awesome.,
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,"Pick this up not knowing it was a two disc special,  just wanted to see what it was all about.  Fell in love instantly.  Gavin DeGraw is the new Van Morisson! . . sensitive, passionate, lyrical.  He doesn't possess the typical pop idol voice or much less a crooner's voice, what he has is a lot more.  Every emotion, every nuances of each lyric is riding on his unabashingly strong vocals, raw with feelings worn on his sleeve.  Makes a girl weak in the knees!  Chariot/Stripped is his defining album wether he becames more famous or just a one CD wonder. The second CD is like icing because it showed the process of coming up with the finished product.  It was a nice bonus, highly recommend you listen to this one also.  Each song so masterfully crafted, so poetically written, most are about longings, falling in and out of love but my favorite is ""Over rated.""  about how after meeting that special someone, everything else seems so ordinary.  So for all of you who are in  love, pre-falling in love, post break-up, or in the process of breaking up, this one's for you, come on, it's okay to be sensitive, it's okay to sing along, just make sure you're in your car, alone, commuting from work, with the windows closed.",
,B001416OXG,1,1,4,"Follow Through - 4.25 stars. I love this song. It's so innocent.

Chariot - 4.5 stars. We've all heard this one a million times. I think it's a stronger song than Follow Through but they're both good.

Just Friends - 3.5 stars. This song is weaker than the 2 previous tracks. It has alright lyrics though.

(Nice to Meet You) Anyway - 3.75 stars. Stronger than Just Friends, weaker than Follow Through. It makes for a decent song though.

Chemical Party - 3.5 stars. This is a good song. It speaks about a girl who has fun at a party and enjoys everyone but Gavin. He's drunk and she is high...too high to realize him.

Belief - 5 stars. This song is kind of weird. I don't really know much about it besides some person defended and captured Gavin's heart...But the lyrics: ""When you came to my defense/With a knife/In the shape of your mouth/In the form of your body..."" doesn't make too much sense to me. I do like the ending though.

Crush - 4 stars. Thank you, Gavin. You delivered another strong track. I love the composition of this song. Once again, good job!

I Don't Want to Be - 4.25 stars. Gavin's first single. It's a great one at that. Gives off a good message.

Meaning - 3 stars. This song doesn't really do much for me...it's skip-able.

More Than Anyone - 3.25 stars. This song is a step up from Meaning but that's not saying much. It really drags on...

Over-rated - 4 stars. This song gets a higher score than some because I really like the lyrics.

The average is 4.20454545454545.

4.2/5

Final Grade: 4.2 stars.

P.S. didn't really liked the actual stripped CD with the bonus remake track because the arrangements changed, and became less memorable. I haven't listened to it since.

February 27, 2008: Much better (the main CD) these days. None are skip-able, Meaning and Belief are now in my top 3 favorite songs by this talent... (:

4.7(+) stars..",
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,The world of pop music really needed this one: a singer/songwriter with great passion and talent along with a keen sense of how to best connect with his growing audience. The lyrics are heartfelt and wonderfully witty. The voice and piano playing are top notch. It's really in his amazing energy that he sets himself apart from all the others. For such a young life to have felt deep emotion and emerged with a sense of humor - and mystic grandeur - is a real accomplishment. Looking forward to future output from this prodigy.,
,B001416OXG,1,1,4,"This c.d. really is infectous.  There is something about Gavin DeGraws voice and his lyrics that really gets you into the song.  He sings the hell out his music and I love that.  Chariot and I Don't Wanna Be, are the standouts on this c.d. but all of the selection is strong.  I saw him perform I Don't Wanna Be, last night on some awards show and he tore it up, the guy has total confidence and real stage presence, he must be great live, but until then I'll just enjoy listening to this top notch c.d.  I highly recommend it.",
,B001416OXG,1,1,4,"It's kind of funny how in many respects this is so much like Destiny's Child's album ""Destiny Fulfilled"". Why you ask? Because it seems like for much of the album he just bangs away at his piano. The songs sound quite alike and at times he seems too sorry for himself, this isn't saying the album is bad. Hopefully on his next album he will learn from some of the mistakes he made on this album. Some parts of the album are perfect, it's just not all of it is. Some of the lyrics seem a bit out of proportion for this album and don't seem to fit. Like the lyrics on ""Belief"" are a bit sexually driven and are quite stupid and lame. The whole album doesn't have a very sexually driven attitude at all, anyway that song is the only one that appears a bit out of the ordinary. ""Chariot"" has a very mature and overall wholesome feel to it. DeGraw seems to have real talent, writing all the songs himself in all, yet the comparisons I can make to Destiny's Child is unforgivable. Some of the songs are really amazing though, such songs as ""Follow Through"" and ""Chariot"".

So, I do recommend this album as you may find it different to how I found it. But this is my opinion and you know what I think I'll stick to that for the time being!",
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,"Let me tell you how I first learned of Gavin Degraw. First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Maroon 5. I saw them at the House Of Blues in Las Vegas... and Gavin Degraw opened for them. I had never heard of him, and I didn't even know that he was the singer of the ""One Tree Hill Song"" as everyone calls it.

Let Me Tell You.. THIS GUY CAN ROCK! It was one of the best LIVE performances I had ever seen. He can play Piano, Jam on the Guitar..and wail like Elton John when he was a young pup. THIS KID IS TALENTED!!!

My only dissapointment with the ALBUM 'CHARIOT' was that it was no-where as energetic as teh LIVE performance was, but it's really no dissapointment at all becuase I love the album.

My Wish: Let them release a live recording of one of his shows. SO GOOD!",
,B001416OXG,-1,-1,3,"Most of the reviews for this album are five stars, so I'm expecting some people to click the ""NO"" button by looking at my rating alone. But anyway, the first time I ever heard of Gavin DeGraw was when I saw him on Last Call with Carson Daly (don't ask me why I was watching that). And his song ""Follow Through"" is pretty good, so I decided to see what his album, Chariot, was like.
There are some other good songs on here, like the title track and the song he has out now, ""I Don't Want to Be"". And when I looked at the lyrics to ""Meaning"", I said, ""Oh boy, not another we-are-the-world song."" But that song actually works pretty well. My favorite song on the album, though, would have to be the smooth ""More Than Anyone"".
As far as the rest of the songs go, they leave something to be desired, especially the filler track ""(Nice to Meet You) Anyway"". ""Chemical Party"" and ""Belief"" have rather stupid lyrics, and ""Just Friends"" is fine until Gavin says something about that her body fits him like a glove.
I don't really Chariot is worth ALL the hype, but it's still a nice album to play to pass the time.
Anthony Rupert",
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,"I'm wondering to myself why i've never heard of this artist before. I've def. been missing out, and really regret it. DeGraw is a very very talented artist that makes beautiful and classic music. I first heard him, while searching online and listening to music samples, and as soon as the oppurtunity arose to pick up his CD i jumped to it. His melodic voice and beautiful harmonies are those that make you love singer-songwriters for what they are worth. I def. recommend this CD to anyone who wants great music to fill their atmosphere. You won't be disappointed.",
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,"""This is the start of something good, don't you agree?"" croons 26-year-old Gavin Degraw at the start of ""Follow Through"", the opening track of his debut album, CHARIOT, which has thus far peaked at #8 on Billboard's Heatseeker chart.  While a modest success saleswise as of yet, a thorough listen to the album proves the undeniable fact that this artist and album are destined for bigger, better places.
Degraw has been at this for quite some time, despite having recently released his debut album.  A native of Manhattan, he has been an integral part of New York's music scene for a while now.  His music being unique yet comfortably familiar, hometown fans have come in droves to see his local shows.
His individuality shines throughout CHARIOT.  While at first glance one might think they could lump him with other successful male singer/songwriters of lately who shouldn't even be being generalized in the first place such as Jason Mraz, John Mayer, Jack Johnson and, most recently, Josh Kelley, Degraw separates himself immediately from them with his smorgasbord of veering song structures, uniquely quirky lyrics and signature voice.  It also helps that his album isn't produced by John Alagia and that his name does not begin with J.
In the oddball ""Chemical Party"" he gives you a bird's eye view of what it is to be ""too high to see the point"", while the lead single ""Follow Through"" is a catchy tale of mutual sincerity in what could be the start of a rewarding relationship. ""I Don't Have to Be"", the set's easy highlight, is an ode to individuality.
""All I have to do/Is think of me and I have peace in mind/I'm tired of lookin' round rooms/Wondering what I've got to do/Or who I'm supposed to be/I don't want to be anything other than me.""
One song with particular hit potential is the endearing ""(Nice To Meet You) Anyway"", which could be considered an optimistic follow-up to the situation presented earlier in ""Follow Through"", which did not work out in the scheme of things, resulting in his finding a more nurturing, special relationship.  Also, in ""Over-Rated"", the uplifting finish to CHARIOT, Gavin tells his companion that, because of her, he now sees the stuff of life to be materialistic and, as it turns out, not so important.
Other definite highlights include ""Belief"", a stream-of-conscious tune that features Degraw's soaring vocals at its conclusion, and the album's title track, which is delightful to the ears and cannot help but bring a smile or even perhaps a chuckle to the listener.
""Your favorite fruit is chocolate-covered cherries/And seedless watermelon/Nothing from the ground is good enough/Body Rise/Look what's over me/Oh chariot/Your golden waves/Are walking down/Upon this face/Oh chariot/I'm singing out loud"".
Hopefully Gavin will break into mainstream success similar to Jason Mraz, who did so quite a while after his debut album was released.  With an excellent album, a strong local fan base and constant self-promotion, all the right things seem in place for fate to its course. One thing is for sure: This is definitely the start of something good.",
,B001416OXG,1,1,5,"This CD is fresh, sharp and packs a massive punch.
Clearly, GAVIN is going to become a household name very soon. The lyrical content in his songs is far above the current bubblegum standards of TOP40. The ""clean / no reverb"" quality of the vocal production is clever and a blessing.
GAVIN could be the perfect musical ambassador to securely nail the coffin closed on the BOY BANDS, POP IDOLS and TEEN DIVAS !
If this product does proove to sell, will BMG finally focus their efforts on MUSICAL CONTENT and not simply IMAGE? Maybe at that point, the music industry will start to grow once more !",
,B001416OXG,1,1,4,"Pop records bore me to death.  The truth is that hook-laden songs have no substance.  There is nothing to enjoy after the 3rd or 4th listen.  I only got Gavin's new CD because I really didn't know that it was a pop record.  I read his article in the July issue of Keyboard magazine and convinced myself he might be worth listening to.  He talked about artists like Jeff Beck and Van Morrison.  He talked about making inspiring records like his influences had.  Keyboard's staff writer declared that this kid was a supreme songwriter who was devoted to his craft.  Although  ""Chariot"" was a shot in the dark I'd say my expectations were right on the mark.  I immediately drew a comparison to the immortal Jeff Buckley.  Gavin can sing, and his voice Truely saved this album from being another pop record.  But as for being a great songwriter I think I would have liked a little more instrumental integrity and variety; his straight forward rock riffs won't get him very far with music fans like me.",

,B00141YQ7W,-1,-1,3,"At least Yung Berg makes it interesting though. Ray J's part is catchy, and very hummable but it's easy for someone to get tired of it before the end of the song.

On the video front I think this has to be said: Yung Berg is definitely there, feeling ladies' arms and such but I bet 10 to 1 that he's into his own kind too. I think it just sucks because they're afraid to have diversity as far as sexuality goes in the mainstream rap world. That altogether shows how the rap scene tolerates difference.

I mean if a black male is undercover, so what? Why does everyone feel like that's such a big deal? It's only human nature to have different types of people all over.

But anyway, decent song. Not totally garbage, but like I said Ray J's part is repetitive and Yung Berg as well as the fun beat keeps the song afloat.

It was a soft acoustic love song, as sweet and innocent as they came. But Landon really made the song along with the arrangement, with his soft vocals that weren't sappy, and weren't out of place. In fact, his vocals seem to fit the song perfectly.

Overall, an underrated love song sure to win the hearts of one and all. A well-crafted, well-written song with perfect vocals, and just the right mood.

,B00146B9LI,1,1,5,"In 1977, Peabo Bryson signed with Capitol Records and these two fine albums let the world know that he was one of the best new balladeers and that he would have an eventful career as a solo artist ahead of him. At a time when Disco and hard Funk ruled the radio airwaves, Peabo recorded these two ballad-filled albums and ended up a real winner with two best-selling (both were certified Gold!) albums to his credit. Classic hits like ""I'm So Into You"", ""Feel The Fire"", ""Reaching For The Sky"" and ""She's A Woman"" all became staples of Quiet Storm radio shows and sound just as ageless today as they did back in 1978. Amazingly, this is the first time ever that these albums are made available on CD anywhere in the world and we must thank David Nathan and Soulmusic.com Records for reissuing them. If you are a fan of classic, emotive and soul-stirring vocals, you should waste no time in getting this 2-CD set. Enjoy!",

The music is the very definition of modern rock, and the lyrics and here and there and he's angry at his girlfriend or something and... well I just can't keep track. But he does throw in a profanity or two just to get that rock street cred, because let's face it, what kind of modern rocker are you if you don't cuss every once in a while.

Radio-friendly to the core, if you love modern rock, or even just like it, you'll have your hands all over this song. It never aspires to be more than it is, and naturally success is following.",

The lyrics are really good and the vocals are nicely done matching the atmosphere of the songs back drop.

,B0014HVZX4,1,1,5,"Directions To See A Ghost with it's menacing, staggering, stumbling, Jim Morrison over tones, drenched in hypnotic intoxicating drones of heavy acid trip visuals, primal drumming, and garage guitar, all blend to create a bleary eyed fantasy of mind meets soul meets eye, and washes oceans of sound through your ears.  As persuasive as The Black Angels are on record, they are even more so live, and not to be missed on any account.  The Black Angels are a psychological rhythmic reason for stepping into the moonlight, downing a handful of psychedelics, and watching the pageant unfold before your very eyes.  Even the gated album and disc jackets are heavily embossed to visually and texturally trip you out.

There's a dynamic chemistry found here, created from low end vibrations, Jimmy Page hooks, and Middle Eastern influences that don't so much build in momentum ... rather they steadily carry you forward with an intoxicating obsession.  As dark and lustrious as this album is, it feels very warm, nuturing, inviting, and impressive ... at times startling, fuzzed out, and breathtaking.  But you see, I'm trying to describe an acid trip, or a head full of mushrooms, and that's just about impossible ... you're either on board and know exactly what I'm talking about, or you're at the station, ticket in hand, waiting on sixty tons of locomotive to pull up, drop the steps, punch your ticket, and take you for the ride of a lifetime.

Interesting Note:  The Black Angels, like many others, have been heavily influenced by The Velvet Underground, copping their band name from The Velvet's track ""Black Angel's Death Song.""  And as if that weren't enough, they drew the connection even tighter by naming their publishing company Death Song, thus completing the song title in full.

Review by Jenell Kesler",
,B0014HVZX4,1,1,5,"Do you ever have those moments when you put something on and are just KNOCKED OUT, totally blown away, shocked, stunned at the greatness you're experiencing? It happens here. I loaded this onto my player without hearing anything from them before. Within moments I was instantly HOOKED. That's the feeling you get when you listen to this. It's the drone, the psychedelic dirge, and attention to details that will mesmerize you to the core. I have since listened to this album hundreds of times and am amazed to discover new things to appreciate, be it the arrangements, the vocals, everything. This is a rare band whose every recording, every performance I want to hear. It is truly like taking a hit of ecstasy - this is one of my favorite albums of all-time.",
,B0014HVZX4,1,1,5,"The Black Angels' debut ""Passover"" was an exciting surge back to 60s psychedelia, full of mind-bending drones, trippy guitars and a truly inspired vocalist in Alex Maas. ""Direction To See A Ghost"" continues things in the same vein. Granted there isn't much new to TBA's sound, but this doesn't bother me. They have such a distinguished sound already that varying it too much after just two releases was never necessary.

As with the debut, the songs tend to flow and groove endlessly. The `drone machine' saturates everything, the drums are powerful and locked, the guitar tone is perfectly fuzzy and Maas' piercing, nasally delivery is wonderfully fitting. Some songs have the tendency to drift on, but there are some real gems here. The one-two punch of ""You On The Run"" and ""Doves"" is a grand opening, with the former setting up a brooding, melancholy Velvet Underground atmosphere, only for the latter to cut through with some feel-good, sunshine pop psychedelia. Other highlights include the sombre ""18 Years"" and the sitar-laden ""Deer-Ree-Shee"". Generally, there isn't a bad song to be found here. ""Directions"" is another great album from The Black Angels that firmly cements them at the forefront of modern psychedelic rock.",
,B0014HVZX4,1,1,4,"Let me state upfront that I wasn't aware of the Black Angels until a friend of mine, who knows my musical tastes quite well, directed me to them with this, their second album. I would not be not disappointed. (I confess that I have not heard the band's first album, 2006's ""Passover"", yet at this time, but I will seek that out shortly.)

""Directions to See a Ghost"" (11 tracks; 71 min.) starts off with a blast, ""You On The Run"", which at first reminds me immediately of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, but then the song evolves. ""Doves"" kicks off with thundering drums, only to be joined by even more thundering guitars, awash in reverb, just great. ""Science Killer"" starts with a great bass line, and eventually works into a frenzy, just great. ""Mission District"" reminded me of early Pink Floyd (Syd Barret-era). The energy throughout the album is fantasic, shoe-glazing psychedelic-influenced music at its best (and it's not a coincidence that the Black Angels are now on the same label as Brian Jonestown Massacre). Other highlights for me include the hard-charging ""Vikings"" and the closer, a 16 min. epic ""Snake In the Grass"" which goes on forever, but you never want it to end anyway, fabulous. In all, this album is just great, and sure to make my ""best of the year"" list.

Please note that simultaneously with the album, the band released an EP ""Black Angel Exit"" (4 tracks; 24 min.), which you could get by pre-ordering the album, or now at the band's shows (which is where I got it). It is a great companion to (and in the same vein as) the album, with the 9+ min. title track as the highlight. I had the good fortune to catch the Black Angels in concert here in Cincinnati recently in support of the new album, and they were nothing short of fantastic, a delight for any fan of live music. Meanwhile, ""Directions to See a Ghost"" is HIGHLY recommended!",

,B0014JAM04,1,1,4,"First of all, Secondhand Serenade isn't a rock band, it's a solo act (John Vesely) who made his own success the old-fashioned way...playing live and selling his music independently.  John is a perfectionist at what he does and it shows in his work.  ""Fall For You"" isn't just another ballad written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell.  It looks like one reviewer forgot to do his homework before doing his writing.  What ""Fall For You"" IS?...another shining example of his excellent craftsmanship and ability to express emotions everyone feels through his gift of beautiful music.  On this album, ""A Twist In My Story"", he chose to record with a full band...when he plays live, he mixes things up and uses different musicians to keep things original.
ALL of his songs are intimate, from the heart tunes, simple but effective in sending chills down the spine of the listener.  John has an incredible vocal range with a special unique characteristic in his vocal tone.
""Fall For You"" has a great melody, and when you hear it once, it makes you want to hear it over and over again.",
,B0014JAM04,-1,-1,2,"It seems to be a staple for rock groups to do a ballad, and even show off their softer side. Sometimes it comes off touching and sweet, sometimes darker and more haunting, and sometimes just plain amazing. See Hawk Nelson's brilliantly haunting ""Fourteen"" for case and point. But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's ""Fall For You.""

This piano ballad is about as boring as it is emotionless and unoriginal, and believe me, this will cause you to fall asleep at the wheel. It may please any AC fan, or any fan of this type of song, but from a guy whose pretty much heard it all, I've heard this one before, and done a whole lot better. However, I may be a sucker for the piano, but the musical work here is pretty good.

So overall, from the vocals to the lyrics, A-Z, 1, 2, 3, this song doesn't do anything for me, except put me to sleep. The whole song was probably written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell, which isn't bad, except when you put no work into it. Unoriginal and Boring are not desirable qualities I like in my music, so if you're into that, this is for you. I'll just keep my distance.",

Of the 6 group albums of there's I have, this is near the bottom, but they have plenty of good albums and plus this is on Bad Boy so it don't have the funk that Mo Suave Productions provided and it has a few radio friendly joints on it.  Of the 14 songs on here, 5 are ok and 9 are good, no real great or bad song on here.  Guests rap on 3 of the songs and do hooks on 5.  Production is decent, Shondrae does 3 songs, Yogi & Vanex each do 2, and Nasheim Myrick, Wonda Twinz, Gorilla Tak, Lil Jon, Red Spyda, D-Dot, Cool & Dre all do 1 song.  A good album for their fans but not their best.

EIGHTBALL -- Primro Smith -- b. around 1971 -- Memphis, TN

MJG -- Marlon Jermaine Goodwin -- b. 1/9/72 -- Memphis, TN

check all my reviews",
,B0014JIVWA,-1,-1,3,"I mentioned in my Ludacris review that I was wondering where 8Ball and MJG have been lately. Well, my question was answered after hearing their Bad Boy debut, Living Legends. I just finished listening to the album, and it's like this: if you're a hardcore fan of Ball and G, then you won't hesitate to pick this up. As for the rest of us...

Lyrically, Ball and G are still impressive for the most part. But since this a Bad Boy record, you can't really expect this to be like their other albums. You have to be ready for one or two radio-friendly joints. But sometimes songs like that are just blatant. This is especially evidenced by the song featuring Bun-B, which rides an obvious made-for-radio beat, yet is called ""The Streets"". And then there are some questionable songs for the ladies, ""Forever"" featuring Lloyd (note to those that still don't know: Lloyd and Lloyd Banks are NOT the same person) and ""Trying to Get At You"" featuring 112. Love-oriented rap songs featuring 112 usually aren't more than filler; ask Mobb Deep.

Another filler track is the obligatory song about cars, ""Look At the Grillz"" (featuring T.I. and Twista). It's hard to enjoy the first verse especially, because whoever is rapping (T.I. or MJG) is doing it so low that I can barely hear him. And as far the interludes go, note to Diddy: ""Mad Rapper"" still isn't funny. And does anyone have any idea what the guy in ""Get a Kit"" is talking about?

Like I said before, 8Ball and MJG still have it lyrically, except for maybe some of the choruses (""Don't Make"", anyone?). But questionable production, dry subject matter, and lame guest stars damper the party. Other reviewers see it debatable as to whether they should be calling themselves living legends (but I don't agree with the person that said Onyx is a living legend), but as far as I'M concerned, it's like this: judging from this album, if one person says to another person, ""Man, 8Ball and MJG are living legends!"" the response wouldn't be, ""And they're still making great music!"" It would be more like, ""O...K...Nice to know it.""

Anthony Rupert",
,B0014JIVWA,-1,-1,2,"I'M A BIG 8BALL & MJG FAN. BUT THIS ALBUM DIDN'T REALLY IMPRESS ME THAT MUCH. THE ONLY SONGS THAT I REALLY LIKED WERE ''YOU DON'T WANT DRAMA'', ''FOREVER'', ''MEMPHIS CITY BLUES'', AND ''TRYING TO GET AT YOU''. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS MEDIOCRE. I REALLY THINK THESE GUYS SHOULDN'VE WENT TO BAD BOY. CAUSE AFTER ALL, THESE GUYS DON'T FIT IN AT BAD BOY! THEY SHOULD'VE STAYED WITH SUAVE HOUSE. HIP HOP SEEMS TO BE HAVING ANOTHER MEDIOCRE YEAR. RAP HAS BEEN TOTALLY F***ED UP SINCE 2002, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ANY BETTER.",
,B0014JIVWA,1,1,5,"Although I had known about their CDs like ""On The Outside Looking In"", ""Coming Out Hard"", and ""On Top Of The World"", I never had bought an 8Ball & MJG CD.  In 1998, I was heavy into No Limit Records and I heard a track on the ""I Got The Hook Up"" soundtrack called ""Let's Ride"" that was pretty tight.  Then once I heard ""Pure Uncut"" which was a track with 8Ball, Master P, Mystikal, Silkk The Shocker and Psycho Drama, I was sold on finally purchasing their CDs.  I bought 8Ball's ""Lost"" CD which included my favorite song ""Coffee Shoppe"" with 8Ball & Redman, MJG's solo CD ""No More Glory"" and eventually once they were relased, ""In My Lifetime Volume 1"" and ""Space Age 4 Eva"".  Two of my favorite 8Ball collaborations are ""Where I'm From"" w/Mobb Deep on their ""Murda Muzik"" CD and ""Ride(Down South)"" w/Foxy Brown, Juvenile and Too Short from her ""Chyna Doll"" CD.  You also can't forget about the 8Ball & MJG collaboration from Mase's 1st CD, ""The Player Way"".
When I first learned that 8Ball & MJG signed with Bad Boy I was a little skeptical at first.  I know that Bad Boy does well as far as marketing their artists but I was worried that P Diddy might try to water them down a little bit.  However, I was wrong.  I happened to be watching Rap City one day and the video for ""You Don't Want Drama"" came on I was nearly speechless.  I just remembered turning the volume on the TV real high and nodding to the beat of the track. When I heard the CD, ""Living Legends"" was coming out on May 11th, I knew I would buy this CD the day that it was released.
""Living Legends"" definitely will reclaim 8Ball & MJG's spot in the Dirty South game, not that they ever lost their spot, but it had been a minute since they had the beats to back up their potent lyrics.  The first single, ""You Don't Want Drama"" is clearly the best song on this CD.  Shondrae definitely deserves props for this head nodding beat.  Shondrae strikes twice on ""Don't Make"".  In the video for ""You Don't Want Drama"", the video leaves from the club and then moves to the street, so I am thinking that they are still rapping the same song, come to find out that they had switched to ""Don't Make"".  If you are a fan of any 8Ball & MJG singles, then you definitely need to get ""Living Legends"" for these two songs alone.  However, they have more bangers for you as well.  ""We Do It"" is produced by Nasheim Myrick, who has been making beats for Bad Boy artist for years.  This song is as grimy as ""Don't Make"" as you are able to tell the chemistry that 8Ball & MJG have since they have been rapping together for so long.  ""The Streets"" is another banger that features Bun B from UGK as he is tring to carry the UGK name on his shoulders while Pimp C is in jail.  This is another song that can contend as best song on this CD.  ""Shot Off"" features Ludacris as 8Ball & MJG join Luda for a lyrical free for all as all 3 rappers hold their lyrical weight throughout the song.  ""When It's On"" features a nice beat by Yogi as you hear the beat and they have a nice piano drop throughout the song.  ""Look At The Grillz"" features TI and Twista and is produced by Lil Jon.  Lil Jon actually makes a beat where he's not screaming Yeah! and OK! throughout the whole track.  This song should be the next single in my opinion, as TI and Twista are 2 of the folks that are holding the rap game down in their region right now.  8Ball & MJG are allowed to speak about their ""Memphis City Blues"" as well and to tell some personal ""Confessions"".  The beat for ""Memphis City Blues"" has an old school feel to it as 8Ball & MJG speak a few lines about the town they represent.
Overall, if you are a fan of 8Ball & MJG's earlier CDs, you can't afford to pass up on ""Living Legends"".  Being with P Diddy and Bad Boy has not watered them down at all and as a matter of fact they might be better than ever before.  If you are a fan of the New South which would include Ludacris, David Banner, Lil Flip, Lil Jon & The Eastside Boyz, TI and others then their is nothing wrong with going back to your Down South roots by picking up ""Living Legends"".  Believe me, it will be worth your time.

,B0014JIVWA,1,1,5,"Eightball & MJG have long been staples in the Southern hip hop scene, flying just under the radar of national acclaim with every release.  Even with a handful of singles and guest appearances and years of making classics and hits they still haven't 'blown up'.  Now seems to be the time for them as they have the marketing talent of P. Diddy and Bad Boy South this time out.  And this time there's no excuses.
Right out the gate Eightball & MJG show that these are the same ol boys from Memphis with 'You Don't Want Drama', a menacing club track with aggressiveness we haven't heard from them since 'Lay It Down'.  Now THIS is a comeback track, letting people know that can hang in today's industry.  They get down with Bun B on 'The Streets', which is arguably the best song on the album.  Eightball delivers the tightest verse and the beat is beyond greatness.  Shot Off feat. Ludacris is also a 5 star track with another magnificent beat and gangsta flows from everybody.  Look At The Grillz has Twista, TI, and Eightball & MJG completely ripping it up; especially Twista.  They spit over a thumping Lil John beat (no adlibs).  THis is destined to be a classic down south.  Forever feat. Lloyd is insanely tight.  When I first saw this collaboration, I thought it would be sappy because Lloyd is kind of a new school Ralph 'Sensitivity' Tresvant.  Not that that is bad, I love some Ralph Tresvant, but it didn't seem like it would work for the album.  But it does...perfectly.
Every friggin song is off the chain.  Just check the gangstaness of When It's On, or the crunkness of 'Don't Make', or the flyness of Trying To Get At You, or the introspectiveness of Confessions.  Whatever these boys touch on the album is pure gold.  This album ranks as one of Ball & G's best, right up there with On Top Of The World & In Our Lifetime Vol. 1; it's that good.  The only problem I have is the interludes and the fact that they didn't rap over the 'Get A Kit' beat, that would have been a vintage, classic Ball & G ridin track.  What were they thinking?  But Anyway, this album is easily a must have for 2004 and beyond.  One of the year's best! 5 stars.",

There have been numerous stories by the songwriter's themselves over whther the number and Jenny are real or just imagine, but in either case the song is as catchy as it gets and the numbers will forever be lodged in your head.",
,B0014KA26M,-1,-1,3,"I think the reviewer who calls this Brahms Fourth a dud is overstating the case. Szell never falls below the high standard of execution that made the Cleveland Orch. world class, so ensemble and balances are perfect. But for some reason he seems dispirited. The opening movement, whose first theme sounds disjointed here, doesn't soar: it's just one note after the other. This literalness is even more apparent in the slow movement, which seems to be sleepwalking.

I was shocked, given that Szell generally followed Toscanini's model in Brahms, which is swift and tense. The Scherzo catches a spark or two, but the phrasing remains foursquare rather than flowing or exciting. When the finale arrived and I heard the opening bars played with every chord at the same volume, with no attempt to express the shape of Brahms's great passacaglia, I gave up. From college I remember Szell's Academic Festival Over. being one of the best, and it has more sprightly energy than the symphony by a long shot; recording and inner detail are marvelous also. But you'd never guess that Brahms had written a celebratory piece. Likewise, the Tragic Over., which is the best thing on this budget CD, is forceful and well recorded but short on real tragedy.

In all, this is the least successful installment in Szell's Brahms cycle, which includes a riveting First and Third.",

,B0014LPY2S,1,1,5,"Poor Cyndi, she'll always be remembered for that song where girls want to have fun, and she didn't even write it. Sad? Not really, she still rakes in the big bucks. But this little song was her crowning jewel, and showed that she just might be a real artist after all... those thoughts quickly faded though. And even though that song is considered underrated, it's been covered this way and that way, from Spoken to Rob Thomas, to a plethora of other artists. However, while all great, none of them take it to this level. Nope, Quietdrive hit gold here. What sad is the fact that this is their biggest song, and they didn't even write it. Ironic, no?

The first thing that grabs me is the modern feel they add to the song, more pop/punk ballad, just more updatedness. Then the lyrics will grab you, with those appropriate vocals that don't over do it, but don't under do it either. It's just perfect here. Then the chorus really takes off into a total emotional experience, making the song the band's own, and taking it to new heights.

The picture I get in my mind when I think of this song, is two lovers holding hands, trying to hang on while on a spinning carousel. Pretty cool image, but that's what this song conveys. The joy and wonderfulness of love a such a great emotional level.

Then the part right after the 2nd chorus just comes to an emotional climax, and if that couldn't get any better, it unleashes it all in the 3rd round of choruses. Pretty awesome and well-done to say the least. Although it probably ends too fast. They could have gone about 30-seconds longer.

So overall, Quietdrive really puts their heart into this underrated pop/punk ballad that works in amazing ways to say the least. I just loved hearing it on its few short months on radio. And I'll probably never forget it. It's a wonderful song, and if you loved the original, you should probably check this out.",

,B00150S5HY,1,1,5,"I definitely agree as well that this song is an instant classic. This song is basically about someone wanting to have sex with you in a very passionate and aggressive way. Like many others, I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager. I honestly found the music video very eccentric (in a positive way), but creative at the same time, and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more.  I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video. The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it, and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song (there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative:( Through every forest, above the trees Within my stomach, scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive). Obviously, many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means. I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting. Obviously, this is also a good song to add to a collection of makeout session/you know what session songs.",

,B001523DZG,1,1,5,"Tangerine Dream through all of its iterations and personnel changes remains my favorite instrumental, synthesizer-based band out there.  This album is no letdown -- it delivers catchy riffs, as well as, mellow tunes.  Though termed a Tangerine Dream effort, Booster (2008) is a solo production by the multi-skilled Edgar Froese, and he manages to pull off the stunt exceptionally well with full-sounding, multi-instrument tracks.  Hats off to Edgar Froese for continuing his pioneering efforts!

In my opinion, Booster is one of the best Tangerine Dream albums in my large collection of their stuff over the years.  And, to make Booster even more enticing, it's a double-CD available for the cost of the average single CD.",
,B001523DZG,1,1,4,"Touted as a return to the band's early, analog-driven improvisations, circa Phaedra and Rubycon, this 2-disc set promises a lot.  Originally known for stretching the capabilities of early synthesizers, the '70s Tangerine Dream, led by keyboardist / guitarist Edgar Froese, constructed a trademark sound of free-form washes of audio smears, frantically beeping sequences, symphonic electronics, and subterranean motor rhythms.  Subsequent decades found the band stuffing its catalog with blander, poppier, Yanni baloney.  So does Booster really redeem the band?  Maybe.  Several tracks, such as the Floydish ""The Greek Mirror"" or the 14-minute episodic ""Hyper Sphinx,"" do recall the throbbing oscillations that made Phaedra a theme song, to this day, of WXPN's long-running space-music show Stars' End.  But several tracks trip over their drum machine laces and major-key feet, falling into sun-drenched flowerbeds rather than an orbit around the dark side of Neptune.  Phaedra *****, Rubycon ****, and Ricochet **** remain the untouched trio of Dream classics, supplemented by Froese's first two solo discs, Aqua **** and the rare Epsilon in Malaysian Pale *****.  Booster is a rooster for the rest.",
,B001523DZG,1,1,4,"I should say upfront that I am a Tangerine Dream of the old days, the Virgin releases era really (1973-1983), and I lost interest in the band pretty much in the late 1980s. Couldn't stand the band's eventual drift into new age, mixes, and whatever else. But when I read about this album, I was intrigued, and so on a whim really, sound unheard, I purchased this from Amazon recently. I must add that I'm into another phase of being into electronic music from watching the excellent ""Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution"" DVD, which explores the German music scene in the 70s, including of course Kraftwerk, but also Klaus Schulze, Cluster, Harmonia, and Tangerine Dream, among others.

""Booster"" (2 CDs, 16 tracks, 114 min.) is a curious mix. I was immediately skeptical when I read the liner notes, which tell us ""Some titles have been exclusively compiled 2007 from various Tangerine Dream releases"", and then that only a couple of tracks (3 in fact) are unreleased. After a tentative opener ""One Night In Space"" though, I am very charmed by the 14+ min. ""Hyper Sphinx"", which reminds me of latter 80s Tangerine Dream, nicely done. The re-recording of classic tracks ""Logos"" and ""Tangram"" are worthless, as they only want to make you want to listen to the original tracks. But there are several other highlights, none better than the 14+ min set closer ""Bells of Acra"", which I really like.

It is surely not a coincidence that I liked the 2 longest tracks on here by far. That said, this is not the return of the Tangerine Dream of old, but it surely is the best new music I've heard from Edgar Froese in, well, forever. Is it 'essential' to have? no, but it's decent enough.",

,B00153ZQ2S,-1,-1,2,"I swear, the beat is Irreplaceable Pt. 2, with the extra, ""Hey's"" thrown in there. We just can't be original anymore. It's like we'd rather bite someone else's style, and saying it's our own!!

The voice saves the song though. Nothing else. The lyrics are stale, ""I'll always have you."" Whatever, Jordin. Can we have a little depth, please?!!!!

The music industry is wrong in so many ways.

This is one of them!!

,B00154RIIC,1,1,4,"Michael Parks was a sort-of James Dean substitute in a one-season wonder on NBC in 1969. He leaves his news reporter job in San Francisco (how appropriate!) after a colleague kills himself. Riding his Harley, he rides in and out of other peoples' lives and seems to be a catalyst for resolving their issues, instead of his own. The closing theme to the show became the title song for this album, and both Parks and the music are better than they have a right to be. Parks has a quiet and rough quality to his voice-rather like his character-and it serves this collection of less-known and well-known standards, as well as the originals, well. He even tackles 'Melancholy Baby' and pulls it off. It doesn't hurt to have James Burton backing him up, along with other fine musicians. The arrangements and overall sound are dated, but entirely appropriate for the time in which this was recorded. If you recall that series-or if you just want something gently nostalgic, this album, along with the others Mr. Parks released, will satisfy.",
,B001551ASA,1,1,4,"The Company Band is like an OCD experiment. Often brilliant, but not always. In this case, it works well as a rockin romp through a quick, 4 song jam. Neil Fallon features prominently on this album, so you might feel like you are listening to a Clutch album (not a bad thing). The music is less Space Rock and more straightforward rock with an almost Kings X sensibility to it. Not the greatest album or EP in the world, but i doubt you will turn it off either. Really good driving music, and the songs would work well on an Action Movie soundtrack as well. For $4, you might as well add this one to your collection. You will be happy to have it.",

,B00158SHD8,1,1,5,"I would have to call this a soundtrack album. If my memory serves me right this is strictly an instrumental album. Well maybe there is one song with some lyrics but that is it. I usually listen to this album while playing a racing game or something. This album will really help you get lost and concentrate on a video game, it has worked for me like that. Each song is well crafted by Reznor and co. Sound quality on this CD set is amazing. All of NIN's studio albums have always sounded the best that they possibly can. If you listen to this on a near high end stereo system or good pair of headphones you will hear what i am talking about. You will feel like you are right in the studio with the guys as they play. Some tracks are guitar and synth driven while others are acoustic or have mandolin in it. All i can say is if you are into ambient or electronic instrumental albums new or old fan of NIN alike  pick this one up.",
,B00158SHD8,-1,-1,3,"Only if you want a bunch of vague background Reznor stuff should you buy this album.  It never attains the heights, or even the foothills, of some of Reznor's aggressive tunes elsewhere.  What it really sounds like is a very high quality album of ""Music for trick or treating.""  Which is fine; just be forewarned before you get it: it's not going to be like the best NIN.",

,B00158SHD8,1,1,5,"In my neverending quest to expand my musical horizons, Nine Inch Nails' ""Ghosts 1-4"" is a big helper. 36 instrumental tracks, all alternating between some form of ambient, electronica, techno-inspired, whatever you desire to call it. The sound is unique, hypnotic, beautiful, mysterious and flawless. This field of music is not the easiest to write in, if the songwriter wants to make songs that are as attention-grabbing as non-ambient songs and genres. But guess what? Nine Inch Nails creates a soundtrack for laying yourself down on your bed, staring at the ceiling, and getting those big smiles on your face every now and then when you think of some funny memory. Amazing instrumental music with a variety of different styles, while maintaining the same overall sound, and very highly recommended for those that want something both excellent and different. Thanks for the time, and peace.",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,5,"Ghosts I-IV is absolutely amazing, their best since The Fragile. It's instrumental but it's still amazing, you just have to use your imagination with every track. It's more powerful than a lot of bands with lyrics. It shows that the lyrics and vocals aren't the most important part and you don't need them. Trent Reznor shows his musical talent more. Some songs are more industrial and faster similar to other NIN songs. Some of them are also slower, more unique and atmospheric. Trent Reznor makes every album original and they all sound different, some more than others. Ghosts and Broken are almost 100% different. I don't understand why somone would give this a 1 star review. It kept my interest and I was amazed by it.",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"This collection isn't for the typical NIN fan (what, NO LYRICS?). It's also not for those who think instrumentals mean lame background music. Listening to this sounds like a bastard child of Aphex Twins, David Byrne & Brian Eno. The typical Trent Reznor use of distorted pianos and guitar used to link his songs in The Fragile are here, but with the shortness of each track, he challenges himself to come up with 40 different themes. It's like his own audio museum where you move from painting to painting. You recognize the brush strokes and the technique while the subject and colors are in constant transition. Like a painting, especially contemporary ones, they often require focus and concentration to get the most out of it. And like artists will do, occasionally a work fails to impress or the message gets lost in noise and distortion. But for the most part, Ghosts succeeds in staying fresh, suspenseful,  inventive, and imaginative. No you won't be humming these during your drive home or your morning workout. Trent wants to haunt your head, not to scare you. And in that regards, it works.",
,B00158SHD8,-1,-1,2,"Highly indulgent release of ambient industrial instrumentals prove that not everyone should be completely free from label restraints. Reznor completely plays into the fanbase with this one, rarely constructing a track out of 36 that rises above mere NIN production exercise.",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"I'm really surprised at the quality of this album.  Nine Inch Nails really experiments in a way I've never heard them, or other similar sounding artists, attempt before.  You have ambient sounds mixed with hard rock.  The band members must have had a desire to try something different, and I'm really happy the results work.  I'm not exactly ""in"" as far as new music is concerned, but if there's more music like this out there, it might be worth digging deeper into certain bands catalogs.",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"So Trent Reznor has been making music for a long time now and ever since ""With Teeth"", he has been in one of his most prolific periods.

Also, even since ""With Teeth"", it seems like he has been getting more and more minimalistic with his work.  Do not get me wrong, it is still good and this album as well as his newest one, The Slip, are both awesome.  This is an instrumental work that covers a broad range of musical styles and moods, but as I was saying, it is more and more minimalistic.

If you are a NIN fan, you must own this.  If you are a fan of electronic music, this might suit you, but you are a fan of only the poppy NIN stuff or the radio hits, this is not the album for you, but on that same note, the entire cd is only 5 bucks, so you might as well check it out and if you do not like it, you are only out a couple of bucks in the end.",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"...but a very entertaining effort nonetheless. I like that Trent Reznor had the courage to try an all-instrumental album. And you sure can't argue with the price! A must-have for NIN fans, but probably not something a casual listener would like a whole lot.",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,5,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghosts-I-IV/dp/B0015FQZ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghosts I - IV</a>&nbsp;is a great work of music that I think is going to appeal to more than just the hardcore NIN fan.

It's hard to imagine being shocked by anything Nine Inch Nails puts out, but I would have to say I was at least surprised by this new album from Trent Reznor's brainchild.  NIN has always been somewhat of an experimental outlet for Trent.  Yet even as minimal of a change it is in theory to go instrumental, it's the actual material here that I find so different and so interesting.

For starters, there is much more of a progression from song to song than on other NIN albums.  Even as an instrumental work this seems more like a concept album than anything else he's ever done.  There's a full range of songs and tones here, almost like an opera or a symphony.  This is truly mesmerizing.

I also enjoyed the fact that so much of this album is more ""mellow"" than what NIN usually does.  It produces something that I feel is almost more accessible than most previous albums.  Anybody who is into Jazz and even people who are into newer classical music could probably get into this.

And that's the other thing, the pricing for this is awesome!  Not only is there an MP3 download for only $5 but you can get the whole set on disk for $10.  When you consider what's been going on in the record industry lately this is a breath of fresh air.  Part of that might be because of the specialty nature of this recording.  But I think most people who heard individual tracks wouldn't even know it was NIN.  If anything the appeal is broader for this instrumental set.

You can download other stuff including a pdf document from the NIN website.  This is a great set that I plan on listening to and studying for a while.

Hope you like it as much as I did.

Enjoy!",
,B00158SHD8,-1,-1,2,"I have been loyal to Trent Reznor and his NIN projects, but this is by far a big dissapointment.  Thank goodness it was reasonably priced. I just don't find this groundbreaking at all. More canned music.  If your strapped for cash, skip this album.  Get a good one like the downward spital, or broken",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"Finally free from record companies, contracts, and the like; Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor has unleashed ""Ghosts I-IV"", an entire album of instrumental work.  As a longtime NIN fan, I personally was a little apprehensive when I first approached ""Ghosts"", but thankfully, I ended up being pretty satisfied.  Tracks 22, 24, and 28 in particular are the most memorable moments to be heard here, as there are some great uses of the piano (!) to be heard that are peppered throughout the album.  Although at times ""Ghosts"" borderlines on self-indulgence, as a whole, the album is a real treat, and is a welcome departure from Nine Inch Nails' usual brand of discontent.  Clocking in at under two hours in length, ""Ghosts"" moves along without ever really feeling that long at all.  All in all, ""Ghosts I-IV"" is a more than welcome cry of freedom from Trent Reznor and co., and with more ""Ghosts"" promised to be appearing in the future, here's hoping that Nine Inch Nails continue to climb new heights of creativity.",
,B00158SHD8,-1,-1,3,"The downward spiral away from music with any semblance of song structure continues. The God of Anger Pop, who once created the singularly perfect musical moment that was Pretty Hate Machine, must have reached his seventh day of creation: for he is clearly resting on Ghosts. This is Reznor on a lazy day, bored with nothing better to do.

Ghosts I-IV is an organized chaos of happy (and angry and sad) accidents. I imagine a herd (or pod?) of Macs and samplers, pots and pans; left to their own devices, could produce something akin to Ghosts if they tried real hard. And I suspect Trent made exactly what he intended to make.

I admit that I'm still a pathetic hold-out waiting for Pretty Hate Machine II - The Revenge. Thus, nothing less will ever truly satisfy. Ghosts is neither fixed nor broken. It's really not that bad, but it's just not that good. And for a small fistful of dollars, I shouldn't complain.

I certainly like the progressive and revolutionary distribution (a la Radiohead's Rainbows) where the evil middle-man record company is kept out of the artist's and fans' relationship. I have to give kudos to NIN for fighting the good fight. So at worst, Ghosts I-IV will take up some precious space on your iPod. At best, it's harmless background noise. NIN Ghosts is a little haunting but definitely not scary.",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"Nine Inch Nails has returned, unannounced this time, with a new album.  This one is a 36-track collection of short, instrumental pieces that have no order, no agenda and no direction.  But this is not a bad thing!  It's vintage NIN.  It's abstract art, coming from the mind of one of this era's greatest musicians.

I LOVED how Trent released this album.  I wish I could've gotten the $300 version.  The presentation of this album is nothing short of immaculate.  Even if you only got the mp3 album, the presentation is a cut above your average internet purchase.  Each of the 36 songs has a different picture attached to it.  On my iPod, instead of the album cover, it shows one of these for every song.  It's little things such as this that make Trent's music so invigorating.

Obviously it goes without saying that this is not an album for the mainstream.  You can't just pop this in and listen to it like you would any other NIN release.  This one requires a certain degree of active listening for you to pick out the subtle nuances that Trent put into these songs.  As background noise, you won't hear much and no songs really stand out.  This is why the best way to listen to it is through headphones, while allowing your mind to fully take in the music.

This is one of the most unique releases ever.  Not for everyone, but still a masterpiece.",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,5,I'm a huge NIN fan and I always liked their instrumental tracks (great example: A Warm Place) which I like to play on my headphones while I'm working (sometimes traditional songs with singing and clashing make it more difficult to concentrate). It was great to see this offered...it's amazing stuff. There are so many different sounds and moods. I love the concept and I love all of the tracks!,
,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, infamous for long delays between albums, sure has been productive lately. 2007 saw Reznor release the critically acclaimed ""Year Zero"" and its' follow-up ""Year Zero Remixed."" In addition, last year Reznor produced Saul Williams' ""The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust."" Now, out of nowhere, with no advance notice, Reznor is back with NIN's sixth album, the instrumental ""Ghosts I-IV.""

""A soundtrack for daydreams,"" is how Reznor sums up the new album...and that, I feel, is the best way to appreciate the new NIN. Rather than listening to this album as background music while driving or doing housework, ""Ghosts I-IV"" is best appreciated with relaxed, yet concentrated listening. Lie in bed or on the sofa, relaxed, and immerse yourself with this CD. Just sort of daydream--meditate, think about whatever...and let ""Ghosts I-IV"" be the soundtrack...

And as the mood of the album changes, allow your mood to flow with the album...try to get lost in the music.

Some have commented that ""Ghosts I-IV"" sounds similar in style to the instrumental music from ""The Fragile,"" (1999) but I don't know if it's all that accurate to say that. While the instrumental music from ""the Fragile"" sort of held the vocal compositions from that CD together like glue, ""Ghosts I-IV"" is a little more ""out there."" It can, therefore, be seen as a mosaic--of several different styles--piano compositions, industrial beats, the avant-garde--all mixed together, with no real dominant flavor overpowering the rest.

,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"Reznor's ""Ghosts I-IV"" is good.  That much I am sure of, and while I'm not completely sure what I think about it yet, whatever the final verdict is, he had an interesting idea that was worth exploring.

""Ghosts"" is odd not because of its large number of tracks or because it is purely instrumental, but because it is so thematic.  Despite the wide spectrum of possibilities he could have explored making an instrumental album, and his proven ability to conjure up some truly bizarre ambience (like in a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Downward-Spiral/dp/B000001Y5Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Downward Spiral</a>), he focused almost solely on loop driven, rhythmic pieces in which most of the sound comes from guitar or piano.  For better or for worse, ""Ghosts"" is nowhere near as diverse as the instrumental work from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fragile/dp/B00001P4TH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fragile</a>.

Although others have said they find each volume of the 4 contained in ""Ghosts I-IV"" to be thematically different, I find the entire thing to be a consistent mood piece... spacious and reminiscent of a desert landscape, with forays into cool caves and shaded spaces, but always with that incredibly dry aesthetic.  The volumes only differ in the sounds added or subtracted from their palettes (for example, III has a lot more Aphex Twin-esque synth basslines).

Initially many of the guitar riffs and piano arrangements seem signature Reznor, almost to the point of self parody.  However, the strength of ""Ghosts"" really lies in the careful organization and panning of sounds, the gradual swell of every track into a usually abrupt cut-off.  Despite lacking the free-form organization of True ambient music, these songs really are sound environments.  The lack of development in each track matters little when each song is a trip back to a different area of the same imaginary land...

""Ghosts I-IV"" may lack some of the intensity of previous NIN because the way it's put together prevents any kind of tension from building, but it's still full of great ideas.  I also give ""Ghosts I-IV"" a lot of credit for being a double album that I almost always listen to in one sitting, a rare thing (I don't even usually do that with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fragile/dp/B00001P4TH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fragile</a>).  It flows very well and is very listenable, and it feels much shorter than it is.

So for $5, how could you go wrong?",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,4,"What an interesting collection.  Certainly visual music, with no words, that easily gets me distracted while I'm driving or talking.

Not as hard as one might expect for NIN at times.  Certainly as complex, rhythmic, industrial at points as expected.  I can forsee this music being used in movies, if allowed.

Very lurky, mechanistic, sometimes erie. Menacing. Lots of simplicity leading to confusion & chaos.

A feel in a spot or two of Pink Floyd type Dark Side of Something.

I should not have to tell you to get this album: the price tag should make the purchase decision very easy. But even if it were $20 or $30 I would say the same thing: this is the best NIN album ever!",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,5,"I love NIN and have always been one to be open minded to an artist's growth and embrace what results of it (AFI would also be a good example of this). I love the hardcore rock anthems NIN has produced, but sometimes I HAVE to listen to some of their softer and/or mostly instrumental tracks (for example: A Warm Place from The Downward Spiral). I'm a person that works with a computer all day, so many times these tracks are much more conducive to working than distracting harder/louder tracks...so when I seen this was out, I was over the moon about it!

I have not been disappointed. I love the resulting sounds, moods, and concept. I'm sure a lot of this stuff is going to be used in soundtracks for movies and other media very soon. I'm a fan of the abstract and artsy stuff (one of the reasons I'm a NIN fan in the first place) so I really dig what has been done...and I love HOW it's been done. We've all known of Trent's resentment and battles with the record industry - but the way he's selling/distributing this work is Grade A. There are lots of options and the consumers and artists are all happy - not just the record company. $5 is an insanely great price for this, there is no excuse out there not to pick it up (and I'm really excited that so many people have embraced this distribution method AND the music). I encourage people to even pick up the physical CD too (I was lucky enough to pick up one of the Ultra Deluxe packages before they sold out).",
,B00158SHD8,1,1,5,"Trent Reznor has laid the groundwork for music distribution. Trent Reznor is God. Well, maybe he had lots of help and a few Talking Heads fans to back him up, but he has done it, RIGHT! Fork over 5 dollars on the NIN site and you get 320kb download with a large free collection of above average landscape photography, PDF, and the whole thing is carried off but with hardly any pretense minus that of being a premier musician and all around artist trying to expand their box, a prison that Trent Reznor has finally busted I might add. NIN have taken things to a new level that has actually set precedent for the paradigm. And to boot, if you want bigger and better CD/Vinyl sets he says 10 dollars to 300 dollars, depending how rabid you are over his sexual presence on this earth, of course with various trinkets and the obligatory signature signed with His own blood.

Ghosts 19 I stole because it TOTALLY sounded like superior Skinny Puppy 1990. You figure the terrible ninties. GET that. HAHA. NiNties. Uh........ Ghosts 6 I come back to because it reminds me of the good ol' days with SAW Vol. 2. How it so could fit on there, perfectly, and yet it sounds as if TRez had these sound in him his whole life, which, he has, only he was forced into making texture pop with voice, (damn that voice) decrepit and decayed as his pop may be. 31 Ghosts is amazing for the wailing banshee guitar, courtesy of Adrian Belew?, and it is welcome that one of my favorite King Crimson guitarists is given more due NIN time than usual, as he appears on many tracks. Reverse that and 13 is a beautiful piano driven peace ode to death, breathing courtesy of Trent? What a great track, though, I really dig the Fragile leftover Ghosts 34: a compliment that was, because the sound is reminiscent of certain tracks that were Tony Tiger GREAT back in 1999, I even hear them using some of the same equipment I think. Ghosts 28 is tonal and tribal, a stark representation of landscape maybe, gently rolling along the hills, the sound invading every crack and crevice, raw and harsh.

Another track I truly enjoyed was Ghosts 24 from III that does what Prodigy should have been doing after Fat of the Land NO ******* kidding. Ghosts 5, to take a stark detour, is mostly Sergio Leone leftover depression.... Oh.... yeah... most people don't have this type of depression.... 21 is like a mishmash of Into the Void and every trick Trent has learned from two decades of experience in layering his music.

All the material is excellent, in my opinion, and if you are familiar with Still, than you know where this collection is going, just above and beyond the pretty and sombre lamentations found there.

Ghosts I-IV looks very promising, and the entire package is worth any music lover's time, and that it will for all this to sink in. Just Being a NIN fan of The Fragile and TDS in particular, this new work is complex as those and even more stunning in many other respects, just as Still was a nice complement to And All That.... Ghosts is the complementary side of Year Zero, evoking everything from Debussy's La Mer to Autechre's Confield to Aphex Twin Druqks; even the buzz saw guitars and streaming bass lines of punk and new wave era Cure come through with ZING on Ghosts 4. I honestly don't know what to say about the preceding track because it alone is worth the price of admission to download this whole album. Ghosts 3 is amazing. Very Richard like but then again it is wholly the creation of Trent. I love the sickly tangy guitar instrument at 2:00, with the overlaying distortions, voices, synths, etc. and of course the bassline! Can't forget that NIN bass line, morphing into guitar, swooning around beats and loops and Lalalalalal yeah the point is that many of the tracks are evocative mind trips that serve headphones, amps, and darkness well.

TDS is almost universally admired if not for songwriting then production and arrangement. The Fragile was a masterpiece in its own space and mind, forging ahead the new digital era with samples and tracks galore, incisors bared solemnly with nary a hint of hope to be redeemed; Left disc ended on The Great Below, one of the most poignant and interesting odes to love and death that NIN has ever written. THAT was followed by something we previously hadn't heard from NIN. The Right disc was amazing and fresh, including a rap, a shoutout, and complex instrumentals that further divided NIN from the LAME industrial landscape. The gigantic transducer eating beats surely convinced the bassheads of the blatant talent, too.

I began to get the feeling that The Fragile was something special, broken and marred, but put together and soothing in the way that suffering, knowing suffering, leads eventually to change, slow as it might happen.

So after that whole experience in my late teens, five years later With Teeth was slightly disappointing, and a bit weak in the lyrical department. I kept wanting to hear the vicious instrumentals from before, or even unsubtle rage of Somewhat Damaged; instead, it was all chorus and pomp, and the raw emotion was definitely missing, though, some songs were inevitably quite provoking. Year Zero was definitely the Rockstar side revived, I enjoyed it because of the abrasive beats and the creativity of the song lyrics; the choruses seemed more appropriate and less in your face and that helps when you tire of a songs pop structure with repeated listening.

But this, this record I do not hold, Ghosts I-IV, is the Miles Davis spectre of an unconventional time working through world wide conflicts that affect individuals, as we may reflect in our art as the Jazz Master did with his bands for decades: the poets, painters, directors, etc. all do this is different ways. We who love to learn and share want something better than what currently is, and we are working on all levels to adjust our realities to what is happening, the tragedies that we know should not be taking place in our human world, the idea that things changed on an invisible level lead to change beyond, and if that thin line of inspiration comes from these little pieces of plastic and paper then YAY, the world is getting better right?

Are you full of BULLSH**, crank? Are all artists full of this stuff you call Bullsh**?

Well, I don't know, but the record is supremely satisfying; an aura exudes from this album that is the perfect representation of NIN's instrumental vision. They are pioneering not quite radical but comprehensive postmodern sound. Good things can only come from this, along with other artist's to follow, even novelist's and poet's should take notice, the internet is the Argus, you are a part of us, taking this music industry beyond what it is now, taking the entertainment industry and edging one notch for the artist alone, as  a man or woman, only 400 more blows till we kill the uncouth blubbery PIG that never wanted to share its profits.

I, Disciple 16, rarely buy in stores anymore; actually I don't at all, though, BMG online has enabled me to collect dozens of double sets, remasters that I could not get any other way. I don't think, if you look hard enough, the industry is dead, it was just waiting for the intro to a new AGE. As a consumer, you had to be wary, and if you weren't, BubblePop METAL would and will be sold to you with dumptrucks, peddled on the radio because you haven't the time to choose.

Oh well whatever nevermind crank get on with it OKAY this isn't going to change everything, but at this stage corporate rock has killed the radio and we all know it. Radio aversely affects what is popular and 'they' want to sell us everything we don't need to hear, nothing daring, all angst and facades, veils of illusion. This distribution model shows us that ART carried off with great taste can survive by the consumer alone. The late 60's period this is not. We have to start choosing what we want, and now we have a line that has been crossed, successfully.

So beyond the advertisement for this album, Ghosts exists in the senses that imply change, reflection, and the will to follow through these harsh times. I can recall instrumentals like Just Like You Imagined, Complication, and A Warm Place that changed my mind on who Trent was becoming. Indeed, like the reformation of classical music in the 1900's, but fully modernized with an even larger palette, this album tries to do what pioneering artists like Schoenberg, Cage, and Eno were doing then, not aversely changing everything, but doing things in slightly esoteric ways. After the press reviews and eventual release, people will start changing their minds about NIN again. And that is because all great artists are dynamic, and those who pigeon hole people like Trent deserve to get that slap in the face, though, they can still hate and fill their life with super indie SH**, this is the record that set the benchmark. I feel that the music is alive in the artist here, and very well recorded, mixed, and mastered. There is no way a site like Pitchfork should be giving this anything below a 9, and we shall see about that soon......... and we have a 5.0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes! the reviewer is obviously a syntactical genius who obviously knows NIN by heart, just read the review folkie, there need be NO CONvincing.

I fully award this work five stars for the 1 free side alone. Terrific setup and expert presentation for all the various packages laid out perfectly on NIN's website. A great surprise. A better foundation.

P.S. I will now actually go listen to the album. Trent, Trent, can I leave now? (weeping)",

This was one of those albumns that was talked about for years. It had fun catchy songs with some of the raunchiest lyrics ever made in its day. Me So Horny was the song that made this group a naughty sensation. Of course today we hear songs that are just as bad but no one bats an eye. But in the late 80's early 90's this group was before its time! They sang of the naughty girls and their desires not the masks of the prudes we see in every day life,

,B0015Q383O,-1,-1,2,"Believe it or not, this was my first time purchasing a Trina album. It's not that I haven't liked any of her songs in the past, because I have. I guess she was just never one of my top priority artists. I immediately took notice of her, though, with her 2000 (or maybe 1999) debut single, ""Da Baddest Chick."" I actually liked the song initially--although it sounds a bit dated today--and the video, which showed her smashing all kinds of things with a baseball bat, was pretty amusing, too. The next single was the summer-anthem, ""Pull Over,"" which had my head bobbing for quite awhile. I pretty much enjoyed most of her singles, including ""Told Y'All,"" the song she did with Tweet and Missy Elliott, and of course ""Single Again."" I've thought about buying her past three albums when each came out, but I became uneasy about them after listening to samples. They just didn't affect me the way her singles did and the production sounded a bit sub-par. However, the samples for this album sounded much better, and with her initial success with this album--debuting at her highest Billboard chart position ever--I decided to finally give one of Trina's album a try.

The album opens with a terribly stupid and useless intro, which is just here to take up an extra minute. The smarter choice would've been to just begin the album with the first full-length track, ""Still Da Baddest."" The superb production is upbeat and dramatically triumphant, a perfect canvas for Trina's confident and boastful lines about her survival and success in the music business. (Believe it or not, this female emcee has been in the rap game for one or two years shy of a decade). The first single, ""Single Again,"" is also one of the best tracks from this set; it has a catchy chorus and is a bonafide ladies' anthem. I really can't understand why the song wasn't very successful. ""Look Back At Me"" should definitely be a future single, with its simplistic, dirty South production mixed with chopped and screwed vocals. ""I Got A Bottle,"" which features a guest appearance from Missy Elliott, is a fun and playful club song. On ""Clear It Out,"" Trina gives us a piece of her mind, stating how she is fed up with haters, critics, and aspiring female rappers who think the life is easy. And ""Hot Commodity"" is a great closing track; it's just as upbeat and proud as the opening song. Unfortunately, those were the only tracks that I was really pleased with. The rest are pretty unexciting. ""I Got A Thang For You"" and ""Wish I Never Met You"" both desparately try to replicate her most successful single to date, ""Here We Go Again."" (Which I didn't think was that great in the first place). The production isn't great, and Trina's rhymes are way too laid-back and lazy. ""Killing You..."" is bland and very repetitve and ""Phone"" is simply here for shock value, nothing more. Last, ""Stop Traffic"" suffers from subpar production and a really lame hook. (Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know green means ""go"" and red means ""stop."" That's not clever!)

The bottom line: So... I've finally bought a Trina album. While it's a bit better than I was expectting, Still Da Baddest is far from flawless. It has several excellent tracks that I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is no medium on here. It's either really good, or really bad, and there are just as many bad songs as there are good. Most of the time Trina's rhymes are okay and even sometimes great (except for the somewhat pitiful deliveries on the two ballads). What really causes this album to suffer is the lack of quality in production, hooks, or song ideas. If you're a Trina fan, buy it. If not, I wouldn't really recommend it. Sure there are some good tracks here, but they are barely worth it for me.

Key tracks: Single Again, Look Back At Me, Still Da Baddest, Hot Commodity.",
,B0015Q383O,1,1,4,"What a great CD! In my opinion, it is the best Trina release to date.
Along with her tight raps; there is great melodic hooks and hot beats.

The first single, ""Single Again"", is so catchy and makes you want to dance. You will be singing along in no time. She gets raw and raunchy on ""Look Back At Me"", a song you will be listening to over and over again. There are a few songs that I skip over but, for the most part, every song is a standout and worth every penny for the purchase.
I feel Trina is on top of her game on this CD with great producers and her hottest rhymes to dat. A must have for any rap or Trina fan.",
,B0015Q383O,1,1,4,"Trina released a very enjoyable album for April Fool's Day 2008!  I thought her debut was decent, but not at all groundbreaking, so I thought this album would be along the lines of her debut, but oh no!  It's a lot better.  ""Still Da Baddest"" is definitely a solid album.  Trina is still talking about sex, how pretty she is (and she is pretty), how great her sex is, and she reminds us that she's still ""da baddest b****.""  Ironically, though, when I read her interviews, she does not come off as b****y at all.  She seems to be a very kind, gentle and mature woman.  I know there is another side, but it's nice to know that she is a sweetheart beneath the sassiness.

 Up-beat tunes and good lyrics fill this album.  Trina's delivery is as energetic and confident as ever, and trust me, you will be dancing and/or snapping at some point when listening to this album.  Sure, this album is on the experimental side and Trina's voice serves as an annoyance because it is unusually high-pitched  sometimes, but, as a unit, rap fans should be entertained by this LP.  ""Single Again"" was the album's first release.  The catchy hook will really help you get into this song, particularly its melody. Also, this is one of Trina's best songs lyrically.  She apparently sat down and thought this song out before penning it.  Nice beat, too.  Trina is a product of Miami and it was a nice touch for her to speak with a southern drawl on ""Killing You H***.""  In this song, Trina informs her listener that she is hot and these other women aren't on her level nor are they doing anything for her.  Again, the beat is nice and the hook is alright as well.  Pitbull lends his talents on ""Stop Traffic.""  His voice is so easy to listen to and he adds flavor to the song.  Every song on this album is at least decent, therefore, you can press play and listen to it from track one to track twelve.

 Trina is definitely improving as a rapper.  This is a really nice LP and is recommended by me.  Continue progressing, Trina.  You have a supporter in me.

Mikeisha's Top 5

1. ""Still da Baddest""
2. ""I Got a Bottle""
3. ""Hot Commodity""
4. ""Look Back at Me""
5. ""Single Again""",
,B0015Q383O,-1,-1,3,"Trina's 'Still Da Baddest' may be part of the rap genre but the music on this release isn't as hardcore and 'rap' as one would expect, which I actually think is part of this release's strength. My main criticism that makes this average is that even after a few listens, a lot of the songs blend in together and fail to stand out. The sound, production and lyrics are rather bland and aren't exciting. A positive thing about these songs is that, to me, it's more of a blend of pop and rap than straight forward rapping. Even with the 'explicit' label, there's only one or two songs that are from start to finish explicit as we'd come to expect from Trina. She does manage to dabble with a rap-ballad in 'I Got a Thang For You' and full-blown pop in 'Single Again.' The title track 'Still Da Baddest' is another rather pop-sound with Trina proclaiming and listing reasons why she's at the top of her game. Other stand-out tracks are 'Killing You Hoes' and 'Hot Commodity'.

As a whole, 'Still Da Baddest' is just average. It's good, but I wish there was more variety and that the songs stood out more from one another. She's at her best when she's trying out new sounds and genres like on songs 'Single Again' and 'I Got A Thang For You' but falls flat when she's intentionally trying to shock the audience with something dirty and explicit, like on 'Look Back at Me'. I also wish she had dug deeper lyrically because on many tracks she's simply rapping about her body and how she's better than others out there; it's good on one song but sounds tired after two or three. A decent release though with some really good tracks and the some that could have been left off due to a lack of creativity and production.",
,B0015PXF8S,1,1,5,"Released in 1983, Duck Rock has passed the test of time with flying colors. It's pure genius, a brilliant fusion of world and roots music, scratch and sampling techniques, dance beats, pop hooks and rock riffs. The mostly instrumental Obatala opens the album on a moody mid-tempo note; based on a drumming style from the Dominican Republic, the languid track has snippets of a female vocal far in the background.

,B0015R8AK4,1,1,4,"If the gang on ""Scooby-Doo"" met Karen O and decided to form a punk band, it would probably sound a lot like Be Your Own Pet. Part Saturday morning cartoon, part suburban punk, Be Your Own Pet pack relentlessly raucous rhythms and frenzied attitude into twelve songs that rush by like a Japanese Bullet Train. It takes less than thirty minutes to play all of `Get Awkward,' but that's enough to leave a permanent mark.
 Most of the bandmembers have reached their golden (post-teen) years since their debut album was released two tears ago, but thankfully, they haven't quite yet settled into maturity. There's still plenty of songs about feeling awkward (see the title?) such as ""The Beast Within,"" and goofy youth fantasy tunes like ""Zombie Graveyard Party,"" but most of the album revolves around experiences that have befallen them since their rise to recognition (or are they already `famous'?), combining lots of attitude with a generous dose of humor. ""Bitches Leave"" is a funny and poignant rant about girls who bring their attitude backstage. ""You're a Waste"" summarizes a blown relationship with an idiot ex, with these lines; ""Go ahead and tell your sob story, all I have to say about it is `Blow Me'. As sung by female vocalist Jemina Pearl, the line cuts to the bone while it makes you laugh.
 Perhaps the best thing about Be Your Own Pet is their ability to communicate beyond their own peer group. Anybody who listened to early Blondie or the Buzzcocks will appreciate the intelligent songcraft of this band's songwriting. If you have to grow up, you may as well enjoy it, but on ""Get Awkward,"" Be Your Own Pet make it clear that they are too busy enjoying themselves to be bothered. Since they can make music as infectious as this, why should they?  B+ Tom Ryan",
,B0015R8AK4,1,1,5,"After a very promising and loud debut album, I had lost touch with what was going on with this group and I almost thought they had disbanded, when suddenly they have come back into my radar. And the wait was really worth it. Again, this is loud, young, snotty punk-influenced rock. They really have an incredible punch. Really the best of their kind.",
,B0015RBGSM,1,1,5,"Apart from a couple of reviews from way back around the turn of the century, whose authors hear flaws in this recording that I do not, nearly everyone concurs that ever since their recording fifty years ago, these performances have remained unequalled and unassailable. Of course there are are other excellent recordings of all three pieces (Giulini's ""Pictures"" with the Chicago SO and his ""La mer"" with the Philharmonia, for example) but as a collection this is a testament to both the sonority of the Berlin Philharmonic at its peak under Karajan and to that conductor's chameleon ability to empathise with and elucidate music from outside the late German Romantic tradition in which he excelled. His brief dalliance with the Orchestre de Paris confirms his attachment to French music and his ability to pace and colour both the Debussy and the Ravel emerges as a thing of wonder.

There is of course a neat link in the programming here between the Mussorgsky and ""Bolro"" as the composer of the latter orchestrated the ""Pictures"" brilliantly; originally these recordings, made between 1964 and 1966 in the warm ambiance of the Jesus-Christus-Kirche, were issued on two separate LPs, one of French music by Debussy and Ravel and the other with just the Mussorgsky and ""Bolro"". Any attempt at musical criticism of such seminal recordings would be superfluous after such a long time; it is sufficient to note that the delicacy and nuance of Karajan's evocation of the sea remain extraordinary, and the peroration of the ""Pictures"" in ""The Great Gate of Kiev"" remains one of the greatest expositions of the symphony orchestra in full flight ever committed to disc.",
,B0015RBGSM,1,1,5,"While Herbert Von Karajan was known mostly as a conductor whose bent was the Austro-German repertoire, I've always thought that Karajan was as good (and sometimes better) in the French and Russian repertoire.

While there are many outstanding renditions of Debussy's ""La Mer"" by the likes of Charles Munch, Arturo Toscanini, Pierre Boulez and others; Karajan certainly seems to hold his own, in a fine and very well polished reading that falls just a little bit short in terms of not fully capturing the essence of Debussy's dream-like quality.  Likewise, while a shiny and well-formed ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" seems to be good enough, there are other recordings of ""Pictures"" (i.e. Bernstein/NYPO) that seem to shine brighter and probe deeper.

As for Karajan's recording of Ravel's ""Bolero""; it is excellent; perhaps even better than Karajan himself intended it to be. Something must have been right on the day that this recording of ""Bolero"" was made where the Berlin Philharmonic happened to put together a wonderful recording that fully captures a very raw feeling of intensity despite the fact that the music is all polished and waxed in typical Karajan fashion. It is indeed an irony that while Karajan worked hard to perfect his Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky, with as many as four or five recordings of the same pieces throughout his lengthy career, that he was able to pull off an ideal ""Bolero"" in one shot.

All-in-all, four stars each for ""La Mer"" and ""Pictures""; five for ""Bolero"".",

,B00161QRPE,1,1,5,"This brilliant showpiece CD brings together two separate LPs, the Pines and Fountains of Rome from 1978, the Ancient airs and Dances, along with the Albinoni and Boccherini form 1973. The Albinoni Adagio foretells the immense success of the Karajan Adagio series, which have earned DG millions of dollars. But these fillers are simply lush show-offs for the famous Berlin string sound.

the main attraction is Karajan's sumptuous yet refined way with the Pines and Fountains. Frankly, Respighi survives largely because of Toscanini's advocacy, and it would be hard to beat his electrifying accounts of both works, despsite outdated mono sound. The Berlin Phil. is incomparably more viruosic than the NBC Sym., and Karajan's sophisticated way with this second-rate, splashy music may not please everyone. He's out to civilize it, and for many that's exactly the wrong approach. Without its vulgar energy, Respighi's music has little else to offer. (Collectors of the Pines also complain that the nightingale recording used here is too drab. Okay.)

For me, owning one version of the Pines and Fountains is more than enough, and I nominate Reiner's famous version in Living Stereo on RCA, an all-out blockbuster. But Karajan's worldly approach is certainly worth a listen for its power and musicality.",

Such songs as Inside and Prodigal Son take charge and show how they have been on every album,then all other songs start slow and have like this interlude of sorts that pretty much stink the album and even adding Tremonti and Kennedy from Alter Bridge can't help either,hopefully they put this album behind them,they are much better than what this album made out to be.",
,B0016679I8,1,1,4,this is an amazing new album from one of the best metal bands out their totally recommend this album for any Sevendust fan or rock and roll fan.,
,B0016679I8,1,1,4,"I'm one of the rare Sevendust fans who doesn't buy the Cubs/White Sox-like dichotomy that you can only like Sonny Mayo's or Clint Lowery's guitarwork. This is Sonny's final album with Sevendust, and it is for the most part excellent.

That said, too much attention goes to the Sonny/Clint thing. John Connolly is an excellent guitarist by any standard, and Vinnie Hornsby on bass is utterly insane in the best bassist kind of way.  While Morgan Rose's powerful drumming and backing vocals and Lajon Witherspoon's sometimes-raging sometimes-gentle vocals often take center stage, John and Vinnie together form the solid sinews of each song, whether with Sonny, Clint or any of their guest instrumentalists. That kind of flexibility for a rhythm duo should not be passed up.

To the album itself:
""Chapter VII"" is the most brooding and mood-changing album since ""Animosity"". It reflects the band's maturity and that they are consummate artists - something that may not be appreciated by fans who stopped listening after the viciously good ""Home"" or who didn't tune in until the mainstream-friendly but deliciously experimental ""Seasons"".

Where ""Alpha"" was pure aggression (listening to the title song is like kickboxing on four shots of espresso), ""Chapter VII"" remains agitated but is consciously brooding and sometimes defiant.

""Inside"" is an awesome opening track (though I would have put ""Enough"" later in the album, since it shares the same energy and made me wonder whether they were two movements on the same theme). I can picture the lights slowly coming up as Morgan's drumming agitates further to the driving guitar crescendos, followed by Lajon's terse argument and his more melodic self-rebuttal as John, Vinnie and Sonny blend into a tempo change that at once foretells and anticipates the complex harmony at the core of the song.

""Hope"" is, ironically, the darkest song on the album, though Mark Tremonti's guitar work adds a stunning narrative that makes me wonder if the band will tap him if Lowery takes on another project. There's something in the pacing of ""Scapegoat"" that doesn't seem to mesh as well with other tracks; ""Prodigal Son"" is the opposite - strongly driven by Lajon's own vocal rhythm. ""Lifeless"" and ""Walk Away"" are both masterful and let each member of the band shine - blends of minor and power chords, alternatingly intense and soulful drumming, shifting bass lines that both lead and drive the melody, and Lajon's incredibly expressive range.

In short, ""Chapter VII"" is an excellent album that, while not as singles-friendly as ""Animosity"" or ""Next"", holds together in a cohesion that good albums should and rare albums do.",
,B0016679I8,1,1,4,"The seventh studio effort continues the hard rocking trek of Sevendust. From beginning to end...just straight in your face rock. Enough,Scapegoat,The Past,Prodigal Sun & Contradiction highlight this solid rock effort!!!Mark Tremonti and Myles Kennedy from Alter Bridge appear along with Chris Daughtry. Co-writing,etc..If you are a fan of Sevendust and have purchased most of their efforts,if not all,what are you waiting for. Go get this one...A solid 4.5 for in your face hard rock!!!!!Long live The Dust!!!!",
,B0016679I8,1,1,4,"Right now this is one of my two favorite new cd's.  The other being In Flames ""A sense of Purpose.""I'd say with a little more time this album could have been that much better, but like all Sevendust albums it's still quite good.  They throw in quite a bit of variety which I love.  There are also more guitar solos than any other Sevendust album, as far as I remember.  On a scale of of 1-10 I'd give this a solid 7 maybe 8.  I'm enjoying this one more and more every time I hear it.

Inside - this one has an intro that goes on a little too long for my taste, but when the song gets going it's one of my favorites on the album.  It's a kind of alpha-esque song with a solid riff and good drum beat.  Probably the heaviest song on the album.  I wish they had expanded on the bridge a little and maybe put an instrumental break, but still it's a great song.  9/10

Enough - This one's a decent enough rocker.  I don't have a whole lot to say about it except that it's an enjoyable song.  7/10

Hope - This is probably my favorite song, either this or inside.  Musically I think it's the most diverse on the album.  I like the main riff and the solo.  The stringed instruments during the solo were cool as well.  10/10

Scapegoat - This one has kind of quieter verses with some electronics and a heavy very catchy chorus.  Some of the lyrics in this one for me are a bit... but I'm a sucker for a catchy chorus and it is still a good song.  8/10

Fear - Another good song.  This one like Enough I don't have a whole lot to talk about.  It's kind of a mid-tempo rocker with some cool musical pieces thrown in  7/10

The Past - My least favorite song on the album, not because of the writting.  The song is well written.  It's an acoustic song.  I just can't get into Daughtry's voice.  It reminds me too much of the guy from Shinedown.  Still it's not a bad song and right now I'm not minding hearing it.  6/10

Prodigal Son - A mid-tempo rocker that I really like.  There's just something about the vocals in this one that I really like.  Something about them just sound different from what Lajon has done in the past, but I can't put my finger on it.  There's also a short, but decent solo.  8/10

Lifeless - This one's a little faster than a mid-tempos song.  It's a rocker with a quieter chorus.  There's also another decent guitar solo.  I hope they keep using solos from now on.  8/10

Sorrow - This one's another slower one with the lead singer from Alter Bridge.  Yesterday at work I had this one going through my head.  I like the main riff.  They use a cool effect, I think it's either a chorus or flange, but it's been a long time since I've played with guitar effects so I can't remember.  Kennedy's voice sounds different than I remember on any Alter bridge album.  I hope for their next one he uses this style for a song or two.  8/10

Contradiction - This is another of my favorites.  This is another rocker.  I like the chorus it's kind of different from a typical Sevendust chorus.  9/10

Walk Away - This is another solid track and a good album closer.  There's more screaming in this one than any other song except maybe for Inside.  9/10

I'd review the bonus tracks as well, but I don't feel like it.  I'll just say that they're pretty solid as well.  You've got Lucky One and Disgust which are heavier and Heart in your hands which is slower.  Still they're enjoyable.

This may not be my favorite Sevendust Album, but it's certainly not a bad one.

I think most Sevendust fans will find this one a good addition to their collection.",
,B0016679I8,-1,-1,3,"It is with both hope and sorrow that we welcome Sevendust's seventh studio album. Sorrow, for the band has parted ways with guitarist Sonny Mayo not even a week prior to the album's release. Hope, however, that with original guitarist Clint Lowery back in the fold, that the band will stop rushing out albums so quickly and take their time to put out a stunning chapter eight.

Truth is, listening to Sevendust is like getting together with old friends. There's a certain sense of comfort, of knowing what to expect. More or less, Sevendust haven't drastically altered their sound over the years. Each album has been marked with a significant growth, but not enough to turn off the fanbase. It should come as no surprise, then, that ""Chapter VII: Hope & Sorrow"" -- rushed out 13 months after ""Alpha"" -- has the band going through the motions. Usually, with two years between albums, any band can come up with something that is both satisfying and refreshing. Being the first time Sevendust have released two albums so closely together, it is also the first time they have fallen short of expectations.

That's not to say that their seventh effort is a bad one. It's a totally listenable album, especially for the faithful fan, but there is nothing here that hasn't been done already on the previous six efforts. It's got a strong start with the intense ""Inside"" -- which would make a perfect set opener for their upcoming tour -- and songs like ""Hope"" and the groovy first single, ""Prodigal Son,"" stray from the ""Alpha"" formula, turning out to be the most interesting tracks. In fact, the main problem with this album is that it's basically ""Alpha"" redux. Had they taken more time to tour with that album and record this material, we might have something a little more interesting to listen to. Then again, if they had waited, Sonny wouldn't have gotten his part in this, his closing chapter with the band. But I digress.

In an attempt to up the ante (and perhaps have a bid at rock radio success) the help of American Idol's Chris Daughtry and Alter Bridge's Miles Kennedy and Mark Tremonti is enlisted. Tremonti's contribution to ""Hope"" is definitely a highlight, but Miles and Daughtry both seem to have trouble meshing with Lajon's vocal style. These collaborations have nothing on the likes of Skin, Chino Moreno or even Aaron Lewis, and each respective singer tends to overpower their song. Definitely a downer. Overall, the album isn't terrible, nor does it have vultures circling above the band's head. It's just a slight mis-step is all. Hopefully with the original line-up intact, the next chapter in the band's story will be a more exciting one.",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,5,"Contrary to what you might hear, the remastering is excellent.  I'm far from an audiophile, but I'm hearing instruments that I've never heard.  This has always been one of my favorite Stones albums, so I've heard it a million times.  By far and away, the best that Black & Blue has ever sounded!  And yes Virginia, even better than vinyl...",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,5,"The four albums following ""Sticky Fingers"" - I mean the three after ""Exile on Mainstreet"" - ""Goats Head Soup,"" ""It's Only Rock and Roll"" and ""Black and Blue"" always have taken it on the chin from Stones critics . . . who don't know what they're talking about. In retrospect, if you're still playing Stones albums -- and you should be -- these three hold up among the best. The new Universal remasters are so fine it's scary. What a gorgeous job. I've got a $10,000 stereo, and, trust me, it's been dying to hear CDs that sound this good. Those of you on mp3 and music on the computer and iPod and all that, you do not know what you're missing. All others, give ""Black and Blue"" a revisit. The Stones are not emphasizing songs here, but the old line that this was the album they just tried out new guitarists after Mick Taylor split is lazy reviewing become accepted fact. The Stones are in superb, coiled form here. Yes, there are not a lot of songs, but the band was exploring jams at this point, tinged with Jamaican vibes, dance floor repetition and nuance in the shifting layers of sound and rhythm. ""Hot Stuff,"" ""Hey Negrita"" -- both are brilliant. The two ballads are classics. Crazy Mama, particularly in the remaster, is an overwhelmingly joyful rocker from the Faces school. ""Melody"" is a great lost Stones song, and the semi-duds (""Hand of Fate,"" which some love, and ""Cherry Oh Baby"") certainly are not embarrassing. I, frankly, love this album, what? Thirty some years on. Buy it, get your Ya Ya's out, and turn it loud.",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,4,I liked it,
,B00168G2M0,-1,-1,3,"Blues? Using the term loosely, more like R & B or better yet disco. A side from some lyrics there is no musical tie to the Blues. If your expecting to find some 'lost' number of songs... forget it. Maybe it'll grow on me like an ugly mole.",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,5,I got this for my Husband and loved it. I ordered it from Amazon digital music .You can sample the music if you want.,
,B00168G2M0,1,1,4,"To say this is a curious album for the Rolling Stones is a bit of an understatement.  Mick Taylor had just recently left the band (he joined as replacement of the band's founding member, Brian Jones, in 1969), and his replacement had not yet been selected.  So what do you do when you're the biggest and baddest rock 'n' roll band on the planet?  You host auditions and record the whole darn thing, that's what!  Among the hopeful new guitarists were Rory Gallagher, Steve Marriott, Jeff Beck, Harvey Mandel, Wayne Perkins, Peter Frampton, and Ronnie Wood, though only Harvey, Wayne, and Ronnie's work would appear on the subsequent album.

Stylistically, the band found themselves at another crossroad.  Though the majority of the album sticks True to their electric blues roots, there are also elements of reggae (see ""Cherry Oh Baby"") and jazz (see ""Melody""), which were pretty far out of the band's usual playbook.  And yet they managed to incorporate these different styles as only the Rolling Stones can do:  with balls and bravado.  Opening with ""Hot Stuff"" followed by ""Hand Of Fate,"" the door gets kicked in pretty heavily before the gears shift for their cover of Eric Donaldson's ""Cherry Oh Baby.""  Side 1 closes with the slow blues burn of ""Memory Motel"" where both Mick and Keith contributed lead vocals to a love song embedded within a tale of life on the road.

Side 2 opens with ""Hey Negrita,"" another bluesy-rock number, then shifts to the bluesy-jazz ""Melody,"" which features the piano work of Billy Preston rather prominently.  ""Fool To Cry,"" the album's second single, follows before closing out with the rockin' ""Crazy Mama.""  Overall, Black And Blue is a solid addition to the Stones already stellar catalog, but it doesn't hold as much reverence as, say, albums like Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, or Exile On Main St.  But when you record some of the all-time greatest rock 'n' roll records back to back to back, don't you deserve a little time off?  A chance to step back and try something a little different?  I think that's what Black And Blue is all about, a chance for the Stones to step out of their comfort zone and try something a little different.

If all you know of the Rolling Stones is their greatest hits albums, you'll recognize ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Fool To Cry"" from Jump Back.  In my opinion, the strongest outings on this album are ""Hot Stuff,"" ""Hand Of Fate,"" and ""Crazy Mama""; these are what I would consider to be the *essential* tracks on Black And Blue.  ""Cherry Oh Baby"" and ""Hey Negrita"" are pretty cool to listen to, and ""Memory Motel"" and ""Melody"" and excellent ""late night"" tracks for relaxin' at home.  I'm not a huge fan of ""Fool To Cry,"" though; it reminds me too much of ""Angie,"" and I tend to skip it whenever I listen to the album.  But overall, this is an album worth having whether or not you're out to collect the entire Stones catalog; if nothing else, it makes an excellent bookend (but in a good way).",

,B00168G2M0,1,1,5,"I've liked this album every since it was first released. After listening to this version I decided that after all these years I like this record just as much as I always have. Contains the hard charging ""Hand Of Fate"" and the song I always wish I had written (if I wrote songs),""Memory Motel"".You can really hear all the instruments in this record because the sound quality is great. Mick sounds great too! A little bit different but a 70's Stones classic.",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,5,"This is one of TOP 5 Stones albums ... creative, varied, excellent musicianship  ... had it on vinyl since it's release ... had the original issue CD, now buying this remastered version ... this was Ron Wood's debut album with the Stones ... and while he will NEVER be in Mick Taylor's class as a guitarist, his playing here is solid. Highlights on this album are "" Crazy Mama"", ""Hand of Fate"", ""Melody"" ( featuring great vocals & keyboards from the late Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording ) , and ""Memory Motel"" ...

No Stones fan will want to miss this record ...",

The wheels haven't fallen off yet and they are still a top band as of this recording.  I'm listening to the original CD and have to decide if I want to go remaster or not.",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,5,"The Rolling Stones' fifth studio album of the 1970s (and sixth overall for their Rolling Stones Records label which was distributed by Atlantic Records) entitled Black and Blue was released in April of 1976.
This particular Rolling Stones album was the first studio album for the band since the abrupt departure of guitarist Mick Taylor who left after the It's Only Rock and Roll album's releaseand promo videos shot for the album. Some have called Black and Blue ""the guitar audition album"" because Wayne Perkins, Harvey Mandel (of Canned Heat) and Ron Wood (of Rod Stewart's Faces) all took turns auditioning for the guitarist spot abandoned by Taylor (and Wood would eventually acquire the spot as of 1975). Lead singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote all but one track  (""Cherry Oh Baby"") on this album and the album is a classic (as I found out when I grabbed the album for Christmas in 1989 on cassette when it was on Rolling Stones/Columbia/CBS Records).
The Black and Blue album was recorded between December of 1974 and December of 1975 in Germany at Musicland Studios and at Mountain Studios in Montreux with Mick and Keith producing and the late Keith Harwood recording and the legendary Glyn Johns mixing in February of 1976 at Atlantic Studios. Bass player Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts played well on this album as well.
The Black and Blue album opens with the funky opener ""Hot Stuff"" which featured lead guitarist Harvey Mandel which stiffed as a single. Next is the rocker ""Hand of Fate"" with Wayne Perkins doing some great fretwork. We follow with the reggae version of ""Cherry Oh Baby"" featuring Nicky Hopkins on organ. Side one closed with the superb ballad ""Memory Motel"" featuring Mick on piano as well as vocal with Keithalso singing the refrain at the end of the choruses.
Ron Wood's slide induced guitar kicks Side 2 off with the rocker ""Hey Negrita"". Next is the jazzy duet with Billy Preston called ""Melody"" which sounds like something from a jazz club complete with horn sections. Next is the hit ballad from the album entitled ""Fool to Cry"" featuring Jagger on vocals and Fender Rhodes piano and Nicky Hopkins on grand piano (the song was a Top 10 hit in the US). We close with the rocker ""Crazy Mama"" with a great guitar riff from Mick Jagger whom played rhythm guitars on the track and also sings like no tomorrow..
The Black and Blue album did very well hitting #1 making it the fifth Stones studio effort in a row to top Billboard and was the first Platinum album for the band. Some fans hate this album, but others like me, love it. The remaster has all of the original LP credits and artwork restored.
This album is highly recommended.",
,B00168G2M0,-1,-1,3,"I hesitate to call ""Black and Blue"" the beginning of the end for The Rolling Stones creatively, but it certainly does not ascend to the lofty heights of their 1968-72 output, nor is it even quite as good as ""Goat's Head Soup"" or ""It's Only Rock 'N' Roll,"" neither of which were masterpieces but were respectably solid efforts.

""Black and Blue"" was a transitional record for the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. Mick Taylor, widely considered their best ever guitarist and a driving force behind their peak creative period, had left the band shortly after recording ""It's Only Rock 'n' Roll"" in 1974, and the next few months were spent searching for a new guitarist to fill what was a major musical void for the group. Candidates included Harvey Mandel (who actually plays on several tracks on ""B&B"") and even Eric Clapton, but the role wound up going to former Faces member Ron Wood, who joined the band in time for their 1975 tour.

""Black and Blue"" is one of their most experimental records as well, though that's not necessarily for the better in some cases. Funk and reggae were becoming major movements at the time, and Mick was especially swept up in it. Several of the album's tracks boast his fixation with the genres, but they unfortunately drag the album down in most instances. The opening number ""Hot Stuff,"" is built around a pleasant enough riff by Mandel and has a pretty catchy rhythm including some fine piano work, but lyrically it's the same chorus repeated over and over again followed by a sequence of Mick spouting out Jaggerisms in an embarassing faux Jamaican accent. This schtick is revisiting a few times throughout the record, most noticably the dreadful ""Cherry Oh Baby"" and the odd reggae / punk hybrid ""Hey Negrita.""

The album's better tracks are worthy of recognition. ""Hand of Fate"" is a solid, gritty Stones rocker, as well as the most genuinely traditional Stones sounding track on the entire album. Mick delivers a punchy vocal and the band is well oiled and rocking. ""Memory Motel"" and the hit single ""Fool to Cry"" are both uncharacteristic, keyboard drenched power ballads that work better than they should considering their sappiness; the former has some great contributions from Keith on the bridge while the latter has Mick making great use of his Falsetto. Finally, ""Melody"" is a playful, jazz infused number reminiscent of the previous album's ""Short and Curly.""

""Black and Blue"" is by no means a masterpiece, and does indeed the first taste of the Stones past their peak, but there are enough good moments on it to make it a worthwhile listen.",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,4,"""Black and Blue"" is the rock-music equivalent of a quickie, an album on which the Rolling Stones were motivated not by love or excitement so much as a simple need to do it, to get it out of their system.  They're slightly funkier and noticeably more relaxed, like addicts finally finding release (more accurately like randy guys getting laid): one can hear it on ""Hot Stuff"" or ""Hand of Fate,"" even on the lackadaisical reggae ""Cherry Oh Baby.""  The Billy Preston-inspired ""Melody"" is memorable, because it's odd, but it's the album's emotional centerpieces, the designed centerpiece, ""Memory Motel,"" and the real thing, ""Fool to Cry,"" that stand out.  The music of ""Memory Motel"" shamelessly reaches for sentiment--shame on it--but Jagger's rawhide vocal and the honesty it adds to the lyrics save the song.  ""Fool to Cry"" is less appreciated than the album itself: it's straightforward, emotionally True, and sweet as the whisper of the song's little girl.  Not to be mistaken for a great Stones record, but sometimes a quickie just hits the spot.",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,5,"""Black and Blue"" might not be to the taste of rockers who expect every Stones album to trot out another ""If You Can't Rock Me"" or ""Rocks Off"", but I've always found it to be a refreshing change. Listen to the samples, you'll see what I mean. The samples don't do justice to every song here but you'll get an idea of this album's groove. Song for song I prefer it over ""Goats Head Soup"" or ""It's Only Rock & Roll"" (although both of those do have a number of Stones classics). And ""Some Girls"", half its album cuts sound boilerplate thirty years on, but of the eight songs on ""Black and Blue"", the only throwaway would be ""Crazy Mama"".

The track most frequently included on my car CD compilations is the funky workout ""Hey Negrita"", with ""Hot Stuff"" a close runner-up. It's worth noting that most collections (like ""40 Licks"" or whatever it was called) include the edited single versions of ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Fool to Cry"". ""Melody"" is another favorite, distinctive within the Stones' catalog, a good song for hanging out with friends late at night. Years later UB40 would also cover ""Cherry Oh Baby"", but listen and compare, see if you don't agree that the Stones version is far better.

If you've picked up a few Stones albums and you're at risk of tiring of their sound or you think you have what you need already, try ""Black and Blue"" on for size. After the four albums that are the pinnacle of their career - Exile, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Beggars Banquet - this would be the next one on my list.",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,5,"I haven't listened to Black and Blue in ages, in fact I misplaced my original recording of it.  I decided to buy the remastered release and was pleasantly surprised at how great it sounds.  The music has a vibrant and fresh quality that I just don't remember from the original.

The longer jams and musical exploration of genres are fitting, and make this recording a unique treasure in the Stones catalog.

I'm happy to have rediscovered this gem!",
,B00168G2M0,1,1,4,"Hey, in 2009 no one, including this reviewer, NEEDS to comment on the fact that The Rolling Stones, pound for pound, have over forty plus years earned their place as the number one band in the rock `n' roll pantheon. Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from the tail end of their most creative period , moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the `golden era"" of the Stone Age. The album, however, is a little uneven in spots reflecting, I think, a certain exhaustion of material that they could call their totally their own unless the time when they owned a big chunk of rock 'n'roll in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The age of a more sedate music (at least technically) was approaching and I think there was some confusion about whether to embrace it or ""spoof"" it. Still ""Cry Baby"" and ""Memory Motel"" (the stick outs here along with ""Fool To Cry"" make any Stones ""greatest hits"" list. Right?",
,B0016BPAOS,1,1,4,"Almost all the reviewers on youtube say this album is trash because there is no Jim Morrison...well hell, shallow people.

This album, many of the tracks were rehearsed while Jim was alive and wouda been the next album.  Ray Manzerik comes in on most of the vocals and does a very good job.

You can sense the songs structure and feel were made for Jim Morrison to come in the studio and lay down his vocals on the tracks, but it didn't happen.

""Tightrope Ride"" was the single released and I am amazed it wasn't atleast a top 40 hit, the album must not have been promoted too much by the label, although it did reach No. 35 on the charts and thats not bad, having the 35th most popular album in America.

The song ""Ships with Sails"" is a amazing song and if you heard it, you'd KNOW it's classic Doors all the way, a great 6+ min tune that kinda resembles ""Riders on the storm"".

The opening song ""In the Eye of the Sun"" is also a great Doors song that has that great Doors sound.

This album has been ignored long enough, bring it back, release it on CD, its not a Morrison release, but its the Doors and it's a great album!",

,B0016DCUIA,1,1,5,"There was certainly a lot to praise about Parlet's debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pleasure-Principle/dp/B00D6ZCTX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pleasure Principle</a>. On the other hand it certainly didn't gain as much recognition as a lot of recognition that the somewhat more popularly focused P-Funk girl group Brides Of Funkenstein would. This entire idea of intense competition among the many satellite groups coming out from under the P-funk banner took an enormous toll on George Clinton's entire concept. And by the time Parlet were about to unleash it's second album in 1979, this became more than obvious. In addition to that newcomers Shirly Hayden and Janice Evans were just breaking into this chaotically conceived group. On the other hand,with further help from Ron Dunbar and a rather larger group of musicians playing on this album Parlet did gain a new and vital musical focus on this album that more than had the potential to push their momentum forward.

  ""Ridin' High""is actually my favorite Parlet number. It has one of the strongest dance-funk beats around,right on time horns and bass lines and a great hook exploring the songs themes of ""disco highs and disco lows"". ""No Rump To Bump"" continues the concept with a heavier Parliament type funk groove again-working a classic school yard taunt into the intro and refrains. ""Don't Ever Stop (Lovin' Me,Needin' Me)"" blends the vulnerable side of the sexual revolution that stands as an interesting contrast to the ""free from the need to be free"" Clinton attitude through a well arranged dance/funk ballad. ""Booty Snatchers"" makes it clear P-Funk's outlook on the disco scene-to a stomping 4/4 beat the albums concept is illustrated through a perception of disco dancers as ""body's who need bootys"". ""You're Leaving"" gets into some deep bluesy flavored funk-again exploring need in context of a human journey. ""Huff-N-Puff"" is a rocked out funk epic-using the Three Little Pigs concept of the liberated women dealing with hirsute male figures.

  In a lot of ways this album betters Parlet's debut. Not only is the vocal mix quite a lot tougher, but the music-even the disco friendly aspects, are much higher on the funky groove quotient compared to the sleeker jazz influences of the previous album. Mojo magazine once proclaimed this to be Parlet at their best. And since they only recorded three albums in as many years, that is saying a lot. At that time anything from the P-Funk satellite groups were only to be found on vinyl and extremely difficult to locate. Luckily Real Gone Music has made this renowned and Iconic P-Funk album available for those in the digital age. And its worth hearing especially now. This album caught P-Funk and the funk era in general in an interesting transition as the 70's were about to spill over into the 80's. This was a time when many felt they would have no choice but to pimp the pleasure principle to gain creative and commercial recognition. And even at this point,both musically and lyrically,this album seemingly seeks out to try resolving these temporal conflicts within its own context.",
,B0016JRFPM,1,1,5,"I carefully pick my music and every song that I select rates five stars. Recording, listening, and dancing to Oldies but Goodies style music is my hobby and my passion.",
,B0016JRFPM,1,1,5,T.K. Soul has provided clubs with great selections to line dance to.

It's a great dance number - every DJ needs this song in their list.,
,B0016O5GTE,1,1,5,"The mid-to-late Sixties was a strange and difficult time for many Blues men - most were without contracts, forgotten and under-appreciated. Then the Blues boom happened (particularly in the UK) and many had their careers kick-started all over again.

Freddie King was no exception. His last album had been for Federal in 1964, but with a new lease of life on the mighty Atlantic label, he produced two much revered LPs in rapid succession. The first was ""Freddie King Is A Blues Master"" released in 1969 on SD 9004 - and then this peach - ""My Feeling For The Blues"" on Cotillion SD 9016 released in early 1970.

This 1991 Repertoire CD (REP 4170-WZ) is a straightforward transfer of that second 11-track album (36:03 minutes).

Ace saxophonist KING CURTIS produced the record - with all arrangements by Atlantic's newest soul protg DONNY HATHAWAY (except ""Woke Up This Morning"" which was Arranged by King Curtis).

The musicians for the sessions were:
Lead Guitar & Vocals - FREDDIE KING
Rhythm Guitar - CORNELL DUPREE
Tenor Saxophones - GEORGE COLEMAN and FRANK WESS
Tenor & Baritone Saxophones - TREVOR LAWRENCE and WILLE BRIDGES
Trumpets - ERNIE ROYAL and MARTIN BANKS
Piano - GEORGE STUBBS
Bass - JERRY JEMMOTT
Drums - KEVIN RICE
""What'd I Say"" features Bass Marimba and Sax Solo by KING CURTIS
""You Don't Have To Go"" and ""The Things I Used To Do"" feature Harmonica by HUGH McCRACKEN

The 3-way foldout inlay has a brief but informative history of King's career by BERND MATHEJA that is sided on Page 3 by a selected Discography. Although licensed from East West, it doesn't advise who remastered what - but the sound quality is great nonetheless - clean, muscular and so enjoyable. Repertoire as a label has always had a good reputation when it comes to transfers.

Side 1 opens with the down and dirty ""Yonder Wall"" which not surprisingly for the date it was recorded name-checks men coming home from the Vietnam War. It's followed by a cracking Freddie King instrumental called ""The Stumble"" - the kind of cool boppin' blues tune that turns up on those hip compilations you read about. ""I Wonder Why"" and ""Stormy Monday"" (BB King and Jimmy Witherspoon covers) get the brassy treatment like ""Yonder Wall"" to great effect, while Side 1 ends with a wonderful take on Willie Mabon's ""I Don't Know"" with the bass really forward and funky in the mix.

Side 2 opens with a version of Ray Charles' ""What'd I Say"" that builds like the Atlantic original did, which is followed by one of my favourites, a fabulous soulful take on Jimmy Witherspoon's standard ""Ain't Nobody's Business What We Do"" (lyrics above). It's followed by a superb harmonica driven shuffle, a cover of Jimmy Reed's ""You Don't Have To Go"" which features Freddie giving it some funky blues - such a cool number.  The pace is then expertly changed to another ""...my baby is gone..."" song, a cover of B.B. King's ""Woke Up This Morning"" with punchy brass fills (you can so hear Hathaway's soulfulness in a lot of the arrangements).

This album has been reissued subsequently in 2008 by another company but apparently the sound isn't the greatest; the only other stop is the July 2009 Bear Family Box Set called ""Taking Care Of Business"" that covers everything from 1956 through to 1973 across 7 CDs and a Hardback Book - a Christmas treat I feel certain I'm going to allow myself.

Born in 1934, Freddie King suffered a heart attack whilst playing a Christmas concert in 1976 and passed away in hospital two days later. Name-checked by luminaries such as Eric Clapton and Peter Green, on hearing this totally forgotten peach of an album, it's easy to see why this bluesman is remembered with such affection.

A nice CD and worth seeking out - next stop the bank-manager and Bear Family's stupendous box set...",

,B0016O5JLE,1,1,5,"Though this album did not contain two of his most well-known radio hits, the classics ""Mornin'"" and ""We're In This Love Together,"" this album is a thoroughly enjoyable collection of songs that those two songs might have sounded more at home on. Even without them, this album contains a number of notable songs of different styles. It has the bouncy, nicely stylized ""Imagination,"" the gritty, bopping funk number ""Sticky Wicket,"" and the beautiful adult contemporary hit ""After All"" which is very stylistically similar to Mornin' and We're In This Love Together.

""Who Says You Can't Go Home"" and this song aren't different from bad lyric placement. The reason why THIS song is bad because of the line ""Two days in hell just ain't gonna do"". Like I said in the Bon Jovi/Jennifer Nettles song review, songs AREN'T good when they do this. A descent song that does this becomes horrible, and this song was actually already horrible. James Otto isn't a bad artist at all, in fact, he does better with anything other than this song. ""Sunset Man"", which is the album that features this song, is actually not at all bad. Reviewed, the album would get a 3/5. This song isn't good at all, in fact it is very bad, but at least James Otto's other songs have passion.",

,B0016Q7A32,1,1,5,good country music at its finest I'm so happy to get a hold of these grate songs all his music is spot on,
,B0016Q7A32,1,1,5,what else needs to be said . It's George. all his songs are good and this one is no exception.. great song,
,B0016Q7A32,1,1,5,"He may be older, but his voice is still as great as ever. To me this song is an outline of his life.",
,B0016UHBU0,1,1,4,"A beautiful song by a beautiful woman.
A touch of sass with boldness results in the fine sound of the one and only Leona Lewis.
""Better in Time"" is better than ""Bleeding Love"".",
,B0016UHBU0,1,1,4,"The way it's sung is what grabs me. I don't really know all the lyrics but I think just the way it sounds is enough to grab me in.

Nice vocals, especially the way she uses them in the background in the beginning.

4 stars.",
,B0016UHBU0,-1,-1,3,"The proclaimed future of modern pop has struck again, and this time it isn't the instant sensation that was ""Bleeding Love"" nor is it the inspirational ballad of ""Footprints In The Sand."" Nope, instead she gives us some background music, which may sound in with the times, but comes off as little more than a smooth radio-friendly sap fest.

Musically, you can tell from the review title that the new Mariah is clearly musical fan of the old Mariah. But the not-so deep point here is that it could basically be sung by pop goddess, which doesn't differentiate this song from the rest of the competition.

So if you love Leona, love modern music, love smooth pop/R&B tunes, and love ""safe"" music, than welcome to the party. But it holds little more than background music for me, because it doesn't really doesn't try to be anything more. Like some countries in the Olympics, some are just satisfied with OK. The goal here is clearly a Grab N' Dash.",
,B0016UHBU0,1,1,4,"Undoubtingly, when it comes down to the so-called ""It Girls"", most of them are really more about the hype like Rihanna, Jordin Sparks, and the divas that seem to miss out for their songs by being flimsy and cheap. As for Leona Lewis, I am very impressed with the depth of not just her voice, but the songs that she has shown with style and heart. They really don't feel like they are overexposed. Her second single, Better In Time, from her debut album Spirit, really isn't a bad song. The feeling here is a bit more somber with heart, unlike Bleeding In Love, but the song really sounds very well handed. I hope Leona keeps that songstress style coming, she really is the best thing out there right now, and that is better with time.

Song: B-",
,B0016UHBZK,1,1,4,"Leona Lewis has seemingly come out of nowhere to have the number one album and song in the world, and vocally, to me at least, she seems to trump Mariah, Celine, and all those 90's divas. And this song showcases that to the nth degree. Yep, like it or not, those days are making a comeback.

The song is an universally inspirational ballad, in the same vein of ""You Raise Me Up,"" and so many others, complete with huge chorus and finale. Taken from the famous poem I believe, Leona belts out the song in such unoriginal fashion, most people will have serious deja vu, but that won't stop them from eating it up. It could be a huge song on any number of radio formats, and it's the perfect world eating follow-up to ""Bleeding Love.""

Overall, if you love this type of song, this is about the best thing that's ever happened to you, it rivals Josh Groban, and if they play their cards right, it could dominate radio for years to come. As for me, I'm a little on the blah side, although it doesn't irk me as much as the 90's divas. Nope, Leona is better, and she could be the next big thing. Look out 90's divas, you have some much-needed competition.",

It is refreshing to here a tremedous talent like Justin Earle debut without pretension; he simply sings his songs and lets you know ""here I am and this is what I have to say"". There's no ""take it or leave it"" stated or implied, his sincerity shines through far too much for anything so trite. The sincerity and integity found here makes it's way at least through the Harlem River Blues.

,B00171962Y,1,1,4,"""Wipeout"" is mostly an instrumental (with a few other human sounds added); it is a classic guitar type music piece; I don't believe there is any percussion (drums or otherwise); primarily it is a couple of guitars with an upscale beat.

,B001736FSU,1,1,5,I love this song.  It is such a sweet sentiment to those of us who wish to grow old with our significant other.  Who wouldn't love someone who would buy you Rogaine when you start losing all your hair? :),
,B001736FSU,1,1,5,"When I first heard this song, I must admit, I passed it off as another terrible radio song that would annoy the heck out of me. But then came the day... Oh the day... I was watching Good Morning America hoping to see the Indy 4 trailer, and then I saw her. The most amazing...Singer I'd ever seen. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe her. I mean...WOW! Let's just say, it's better if you watch her on the TV.

But, then I heard the song on radio again, and then my eyes and heart were open. Here was an honest, sweet, unconventional, amazing love song. I mean, are there enough adjectives to describe this song? Probably not, I mean, who writes lyrics like,""I buy you Rogaine, when you start losing all your hair."" I mean, it's perfect. More than perfect even. The verses are stunning, and the chorus will blow you out of your seat. I mean, does music get any better?

Overall, this might be the greatest song of all time, by an amazing artist with such talent, skill and mastery. Simply put, BUY THIS SONG!!! And while you're at it, watch her music video, go to her website [...] and support her work!

Note: Although this probably makes no difference, I used to run a now defunct blog that had a shrine to her, but I'm not partial at all to her.

Note to Amazon Technical Staff: Before your MP3 section is taken off technical ""beta,"" make sure songs don't disappear, then reappear, and make sure reviews aren't ""eaten"" when this does happen.

4.5 stars.",
,B00173C27S,-1,-1,3,"There are no doubts about Mariah Carey, and her constant vocals that have shown that there is no holding her down. But, there are those few songs that honestly just aren't some of her best works. Her latest single is no acception to that rule. Touch My Body, the first single from her latest album E=MC2, isn't one of her best songs that she has recorded. While the feeling of the song isn't bad, its video has been a big turnoff. The song does follow Mariah's vocals nicely, but I just wasn't completely impressed. It just didn't seem to blow me away like the songs from her last record, The Emancipation Of Mimi did. I just honestly hope the next single shines better than this one did. It wasn't completely touching.

,B0017DCAZC,1,1,5,"Donna Summer is back and ""Stamp your feet"" is the lead single proper off her forthcoming CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crayons/dp/B0016B6ZKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crayons</a>&nbsp;due out May 20th. This follows the club hit ""I'm a fire"" which topped Billboard's Hot dance club play charts (her 13th #1 there), in the process making her the only artist ever to have topped those charts in every decade from the seventies to date.

While that effort was vintage Summer (very retro cool), ""Stamp your feet"" is very different, much more contemporary sounding; a player's anthem with a slight Hip hop/Pop/Dance feel (thankfully without a rapper in sight), stomping beats, electronic flourishes, and an incredibly catchy sing-a-long cheerleader-style chant and chorus. The lyrics (especially the free-form verbose verses) are fun, yet inspirational, urging on the down-and-out in life to get back up and into the game and win, using an athlete/sportsman as a metaphor.

As ever, Summer shines vocally, (there's some slight vocoder effects) singing mainly in a lower register. The potential for this song is enormous, and if there's any justice, it should be a massive hit!

Co-written by Summer with some young songwriters Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Kylie Minogue, P!nk) and Danielle Brisebois (Natasha Bedingfield, New Radicals, Kelly Clarkson), this is just one of the different colours (or sounds) Summer promises her new CD will contain, and with the two teasers off the album being this great, I can't wait to get my full box of ""Crayons"".

,B0017LA57E,1,1,5,most depeche mode remixes are forced. the ewan peason and the Algieres remix are so good. and to be honest the other two are great too,
,B0017LA57E,1,1,4,"Being a ""faithful and devoted"" Depeche Mode fan, I feel obliged to buy their releases, no matter how important or unnecessary. Music has become so bland, and CD singles so scarce these days, it is almost impossible to find interesting releases that are worth spending $6 for. Well, here is one, though I would rather have all 10+ mixes of ""Revolution"" in one disc, instead of having to wait until April 28 for the 2LP 12"" vinyl for the next instalment. Cannot but feel a little cheated, but noone is forcing me to purchase anything I do not want. This brand new CD single is a nice little DM addition to my collection, and I am happy to have purchased it. Truth be told, the song is nothing to get crazy about, though it is interesting to hear their ambiguous spiritual/political message, trying to get both sides talking. I find even more enjoyable the video with the brilliant Lenin references. Nonetheless, this is a tasty appetiser for the upcoming ""Spirit"" album.

,B0017T0FXU,1,1,5,Have always enjoyed A.P.P...........just wanted to purchase the music again (used to have all the group's music in vinyl yrs ago.),
,B0017T0FXU,1,1,5,Love this and this song another one for the jam list,
,B0017T0FXU,1,1,4,"This band I compare with Pink Floyd a lot, they are two band that have great music and sound alike in a way. This is one of my favorite songs from them, the lyrics kick ass. This is one song that makes you think about people who have really screwed you over, by playing those mind games. To anyone who likes 70's/80's rock this song is 4 you.

Kris L. CocKayne",
,B0017TARAQ,1,1,5,this is an awesome song I stumbled upon using Pandora...  hadn't heard of her before but she's definitely on my hot list.,
,B0017TARAQ,1,1,5,"Meredyth Andrews has a beautiful voice and offers a heartfelt message. It speaks to those times when I feel run down and overworked by all the ""things"" that have demanded my attention in my day to day life. It's a great song to listen to just before sleep.",
,B0017TAR88,1,1,5,"This song reaches out to me when i've mistakenly begun to try to fix the world all by myself and, of course, failed!",
,B0017TAR88,1,1,5,Another home run for Meredith Andrews. The realization that God is always there for us no matter what. A comforting thought to know that He was there all the time,
,B0017TAR88,1,1,5,"Meredith has a wonderful voice and a very believable way of showing her faith, could listen to this all day long",
,B0017TAR88,1,1,5,"I originally got this album after hearing the hit single ""you're not Alone"" on Klove's top 20. This is a great album that really puts you closer to God. Can't say enough. I pray she stays in contemporary christian/gospel music because this is where she belongs. I pray the heartbeat is the same as the message.",
,B0017U96NY,-1,-1,1,This is really awful.  Really I can't understand the acclaim this band gets.  In truth the only people that like this are critics that champion stuff like this that no one will care for so that they can feel important within  their little club of like-minded associates.  Sad.  Husker Don't!!!,
,B0017U96NY,1,1,5,"a tad more melodic than it's predecessor (the classic ""zen arcade""), there is still plenty of guitar mayhem and fists full of aggression here, but songs like ""terms of psychic warfare,"" and ""books about ufos,"" are downright catchy. the latter of the two actually has a glam-rock, new york dolls vibe about it. another great album from husker du. another classic.",
,B0017U96NY,1,1,5,"Husker Du hit the jackpot with their excellent, ambitious 1984 album Zen Arcade. New Day Rising continues to balance their hardcore energy and noise rock with apparenet melodic tendencies. The songs are as aggressive as they were the last time, but a on several occasions there are given more room to melodies than with Zen Arcade, especially on songs like ""Celebrated Summer"", which is miles away from their original hardcore fury. New Day Rising is also more accessible to Zen Arcade, so this might not be a bad record for one to start with, at least if one is not for their later, less energetic and more ""soppy"" material.",
,B0017U96NY,1,1,5,"New Day Rising is proof that a band can follow-up an incredibly brilliant album, in this case Zen Arcade, with an even better album. New Day Rising is sort of like Zen Arcade meets their later, but still brilliant, poppier work. It's not as dark as Zen Arcade, but it has just as much power and emotion. But probably the most stunning thing about this album is that it was made over 15 years ago, and it does not sound dated one bit. New Day Rising blows away the crap that tries to be passed off as music these days. ""Celebrated Summer,"" ""59 Times The Pain,"" ""Terms Of Psychic Warfare,"" ""If I Told You,"" ""Folklore,"" ""I Don't Know What You're Talking About,"" and ""Plans I Make"" should blow your mind. And while the production may sound lacking at first (the drums sound kind of muffled at times), it actually does the album justice upon further listening. Forget the marketed fake angst of much of today's rock and listen to New Day Rising. This is arguably the best Husker album out there. It really makes me sad though that these guys are one of the BEST BANDS EVER, and they still have not gotten the due they deserve. You MUST buy this.",
,B0017UDOK0,1,1,5,"Ordinarily I don't write a review for items with over say, 5 reviews.  But, not surprisingly, this record gets love it or hate it reviews.  All hardcore punk rock enthusiasts love it (how can you not?) and all heaven's to Murgatroid alt post punk lovin' musical sweethearts (we could use other terms but maybe you get the idea?  Sure we do) hate it because it is so intense and unrelenting.

1) There's less time between songs on this baby than possibly any other record.  Cool man.

2) Actually, it's very fast rock.  That may not be obvious.  If you slowed this stuff down it'd just be a rock 'n roll album.  But the breakneck pace launches it into the world of hardcore punk rock.  Virtually by the speed of the music alone.  Let's just say that 24 or so years after its release it still deserves its title of a speed record.  Sure, there's probably some bands that have performed faster (NEIGHBORS of San Diego did a 22 song set in about 24 minutes about 4 years ago and I thought the singer would have an anurism - that his blood vessels would explode - while he was singing and the other 4 band members were each going at maximum possible speed every single song.  By the time the set was over everyone in the place was fully satisfied.  I still regret not video taping that gig.  Unbelievable).  But for the year this came out it was stupendously stunning then and I'll still put it on once a year or so and revel in its full out blasting of some high quality music.

3) Sure, it's not the highest quality recording quality.  Although it's actually higher than a bunch of punk rock that was released back in the day - late 70's, early 80's.  Mainly cuz so much of it was Do It Yourself.  Think about it, SST is a giant indie punk rock label.  They remained, all these years, and certainly then, a label for and by punx with a very eclectic range.  Ok, so most of their records blew.  But this is a classic that will stand the test of time.  Of course, so will SST's BLACK FLAG Damaged and earlier records and their MINUTEMEN records.  Virtually everything else they released is suspect (see HUSKER DU's post Everything Falls Apart records as a for instance, yuk).

When big business is not involved,

A) the artist makes what they want, with no filtering by big business producers trying to make the music more appealing to the masses ie. watering it down, popifying it

B) there is less money to work with so live recordings like this one don't always get recorded with expensive equipment so the recording quality is less than what we're used to hearing from big name artists and

C) there's fewer copies of DIY records because only a thousand or 10,000 are made rather than 500,000 copies.  As it is, this recording quality is quite nice compared to a number of other DIY punk live releases.  Quite listenable I'd say and I don't care to hear poorly recorded live recordings.

Thank you SST and HUSKER DU for making something that still today brings a mighty smile to my face and 1000's of other hardcore fans today and into the future.  The rest of you who can't take this sort of thing, don't.  Go buy a nice GUIDED BY VOICES album.  The existance of this album doesn't diminish what HUSKER DU did later.  It just shows us they sailed a different ship and left us this, their one pure classic.  DRI and DIE KREUZEN, each with an amazing first 7"" of defining, everlasting pure hardcore and then both bands just flaked off into, well, they left and made music that is still an embarrasement to listen to, at least to a punk.  chrisbct@hotmail.com",

It arrived on-time.

Was in excellent condition.",

,B0017VLTNS,1,1,5,"Unfortunately, the Three Degrees didn't stay in the spotlight for very long; their very best material is on this (their first) album, and the CD version includes expanded cuts and extras.  I had been waiting years to replace my LP of this album, so was glad when this became available (finally).",
,B0017VLTNS,1,1,5,The Three Degrees were one of the most sexiest and talented female groups of all time. I'm so glad that somebody took the liberty of finally releasing this classic album on disc. Another Leon Huff and Kenny Gamble excellent recording.,
,B0017VLTNS,1,1,5,"This cd is an awesome example of how disco was not a truly terrible music period and that when fused with other styles it could produce pure magic.  Many will look at the set list here ands see two things - the hit single WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN and the huge TSOP by MFSB which featured The Three Degrees.  But what we really have here is the debut US album by the queens of Philly soul who managed to merge heavenly soul and r@b with disco to produce harmonies and tracks that were mesmerizing.  The opening DIRTY OL MAN is stupendous and was a huge dance hit.  Other gems here are CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME, A WOMAN NEEDS A GOOD MAN and the totally overlooked masterpiece IF AND WHEN that should have been another huge hit.  Their harmonies blend perfectly on every track but here they manage to even add a touch of rock to their style.  Of course due to the time period we do have one very dated track and it is the silly I LIKE BEING A WOMAN.  But it is such fun to hear it and see how it fit in during that time in music's history.

This cd is digitally remastered for superb sound quality and has great bonus tracks and liner notes.  There are certain albums that show a time period in all it's glory.  Here we have a uniquely talented female group with exsquisite harmonies.  They represented Philly soul at its finest and this cd is a must for any music historian or fan of the genre.  When music is good it is good and these ladies are great and this set provides a superb listening experience.",
,B0017VJXEA,1,1,5,This has a message and has a happy upbeat beat.  Something you can really get into.  Gets you movin' even if it has been a while since you moved-LOL,

Hopefully Deitrick will continue to share the gospel through his music.  Very talented.",
,B0017VJXEA,1,1,5,not many new gospel artist can combine the gospel world with a lil R&B but he did a great job on this song.,

I highlighted most of my blogs with a link to a song that emphasized musically the point I was making with the written word, and chose The Rainbow Connection for that specific blog to demonstrate the spiritual aspect of my success. https://sites.google.com/site/newlaketon/home/rainbow
I also added the song to my iTunes collection and chose  Sarah McLachlan's version because it is quite simply the best out there.  This song is a theme song for life. Bless Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher for writing it, Sarah McLachlan for singing it, Amazon for making it available in a quick download and the song itself for making me - and hopefully others - understand that we all have addictions of one sort or another but it is possible to walk away from one that is destroying you.",
,B00181MFTO,-1,-1,3,This is a creditable cover of a classic Beetles song.  It is well done but leaves me a little flat.  Her voice is rich and spot on.  There is not a single thing done wrong but...,
,B000VJ3BYC,1,1,4,"Apparently all live in the studio with a hard rocking, hard treavellin' beat band: don't understand the ""empty"" sound on tunes that jumped outta the speakers on EMI/Capitol.

Here are the titles we've read bout over the years and had to the chance to hear in part on the Anthology installment I.

The stars? Harrison and McCartney. I think George's stuff here could have been freeze-dried for a hearty repast on any number of 1963-64 Beatles l.p.s. ""Crying, Wating, and Hoping"" is beautiful - as usual the guys do an exceptional take on Buddy Holly. Paul's ""Besame Mucho"" (improved by June, 1962; see Anthology I.) has inrrestistible nervous energy on this January, 1962 try.

The big reason I bought this CD are the three Lennon and McCartney compositions, ""Like Dreamers Do"", ""Hello, Little Girl"", and ""Love of the Loved"", which originally arrived via Beatles' friends' discs. ""Dreamers"" might catch the extra attention of Roy Orbison fans, as the title sings out the same phrase from Roy's Classic, ""In Dreams"".

Sound is very good, not great - VG is not up to standards. Hence, 4 big ones, not 5.",
,B000VJ3BYC,-1,-1,1,"Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.",
,B000VJ3BYC,-1,-1,1,"Do not read any other review I,am by many terms the nicest reviewer on items here on Amazon,But this is by far the worst cd I have ever ordered and demanded my money back from Amazon,which they gave me and hope they will remove this seller from there site. This is defiately a bootleg,you only have to google there record company and duh no such company. Save your money and buy something else on Amazon. Its companies like this that give wonderful sites like Amazon a bad name.",
,B000VJ3BYC,1,1,5,"Don't worry about whether you're a Beatles fan or not,  if you want to hear the greatest rock n roll band at the beginning of their careers then you can't miss with this CD.

Sure its raw and whatever else.  Whoopee.  On a decent sound system it sounds quite good as it has a pretty clean sound.  And it also shows that Ringo was the better choice for drummer.  He just had the edge on Pete.  Having said that, Pete Best did a pretty darn good job.

This hold over with Bruno Mars, who is from here. I am writing this because Yvonne Elliman's song is very special for me because 1) I grew up with this song & 2) she is from here.

,B000VRNCBQ,1,1,5,"Where Have I Known You Before proves to me once AGAIN exactly how much different (and better) jazz from the 70's was. This is *phenomenal* instrumental playing.

It's not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination. These band members had a unique ability to really make you open your mind and appreciate instrumental chops played tastefully and creatively, and chops that are constantly full of passion and energy.  You feel like you're getting a complete experience when you hear albums like this one.

This is perhaps one of the finest recordings from the mid 70's you will ever hear, right next to the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Visions of the Emerald Beyond.  I seriously mean that.  Yes, I've heard quite a bit of albums around the same time Where Have I Known You Before was released, and despite the fact this album wasn't exactly popular doesn't really MEAN anything when it comes down to it.  What matters is that I've heard the album, and I'm trying my best to convince YOU why you need to hear it.

The fact that instrumental skills of THIS caliber actually exist, and have been laid down on tape for this recording, really proves to me Return to Forever were more than just a talented group of fellows. This is a band that really gave listeners a challenging and lasting experience.

The keyboard playing is a constant feature of the album. Tastefully played, engaging, and always being displayed in a way that proves the keyboard player is giving everything he has and then some. The guitar playing is the same way. More passion than most guitar players would be able to lay down, that's for sure.

Again I have to ask the magic question- THIS is jazz?  The lengthy and intense keyboard and guitar jams that come and go are considered jazzy?  Are you sure this kind of music doesn't belong in the rock camp? Perhaps rock fusion is the appropriate choice of words.

The album cover shows a sun appearing in a hazy red sky. The only thing hazy about these compositions are the images you get in your head. The music is certainly nothing hazy, or unorganized, or played lazily, or ANYTHING like that- this is just a straight up perfect example of jazz that at one point in time wasn't afraid to be as experimental as possible.

Does Where Have I Known You Before leave a lasting impression? You BET it does. A positive one at that. I'm more than happy giving an album with such brilliant instrumental playing a perfect 5 stars. Replay value is important to me as well, and this album most certainly delivers in that respect.

If you're someone just getting into jazz and would like to hear a fantastic piece of music, check out THIS album. You will be blown away by many moments among all the instrumental jams, I guarantee it.  You simply must check out the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jade Warrior, Camel and Santana as well because these bands have their fair share of music focusing on jazzy and tasteful instrumental chops as well.",
,B000VRNCBQ,1,1,4,"RTF follow up their classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hymn-of-the-Seventh-Galaxy/dp/B0000046X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy</a>&nbsp;with this recording. It showcases another tremendous step forward for the band as their famous lineup in clinched with the addition of Al DiMeola on guitar and Chick Corea's first use of the synthesizer,in this case a moog. A little under half these tracks over consist of 1-2 minute varriations on the title track and tracks like White's ""The Shadow Of Lo"" and Chicks own ""Song To The Pharoah Kings"" do run on a bit longer but in terms of virtuoso musicianship know no equal of course,even if they don't make very easy casual listening. Clarke's opener ""Vulcan Worlds"" (a theme he'd return to the same on his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stanley-Clarke/dp/B0000025KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stanley Clarke</a>&nbsp;album) is one of two exciting and emotionally stimulating tunes here-the theme is expressed very loudly on a very prickly sounding moog. On ""Earth Juice"" Clarke focuses more on his bass playing and they even return to musical ideas as expressed on the previous album on ""Return To The Seventh Galaxy"". While many of these songs are slower and often sweeter then the high octane music featured on their last album this recording has just as much going for it overall.",

,B000VRNDJM,1,1,4,I normally prefer R&B songs but this is a GREAT song. Looking for more from this group.  I expect good things to come.,
,B000VRNDJM,1,1,4,My daughter always plays this from her iPod so I decided it was time that I had my own copy for my Kindle.,
,B000VRNCBQ,1,1,5,"This is one Return to Forever album that somehow passed me by and I am not quite sure how (or why) because it is phenomenally good and ranks right up there as one of my favorite RTF albums.  The style of music on Where Have I Known You Before (1974) is somewhat similar to Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973) although there is a bit more in the way of softer textures, making for a very balanced listening experience.

The lineup at this point included Chick Corea (Fender Rhodes electric piano, acoustic piano, clavinet, Yamaha organ, ARP Odyssey synthesizer, and percussion); bassist extraordinaire Stanley Clarke (Alembic electric bass guitar, Yamaha organ, bell tree, chimes; excellent drummer Lenny White (drums, percussion); and newcomer Al Di Meola (electric and acoustic guitars; acoustic 12 string guitar).  I think it goes without saying that this is a musician's band.  These guys are all unbelievably talented, with Stanley Clarke setting new standards for performance on the bass that would be equaled by few - this guy is mind-blowingly fast.  For his first time playing with RTF (Al was 19 at the time), Al does an incredible job, although his playing is not as dominant in the mix as it would become on later albums.  With this album, Chick had started weaving synthesizers into the RTF sound and he gets some great tone colors out of the ARP Odyssey on this album, which is plastered everywhere.  As a huge fan of progressive rock and electronica, I do not mind the analog synthesizer use at all, although some jazz fans might be turned off.

The eight tracks on the album range in length from 1'02"" to the 14'21"" Song to the Pharoah Kings suite.  In terms of the music, it is an incredible amalgamation of jazz; jazz rock; progressive rock; space rock; funk and even a tiny bit of classical - more like a proggy jazz rock actually.  In fact, as a progger, I really appreciate the dense arrangements and virtuosity.  Speaking of which, just about every odd time signature under the sun is used on Where Have I Known You Before and there is some incredibly complex ensemble work.

Sandwiched in-between the highly electric rave-ups are three of Chick's acoustic piano improvisations including Where Have I Loved You Before; Where Have I Danced With You Before; and Where Have I Known You Before.  This is the closest this album comes to sounding like traditional jazz and showcases Chick's considerable talents on the acoustic piano.  The softer acoustic tracks provide a nice contrast with the highly charged electric tracks.  Earth Juice is the ""funkiest"" piece on the album, although this funk is pretty far removed from Sly and the Family Stone.  Of course, Chick's work on the clavinet here and there on the album really lends to the funkiness.  The suite that closes the album out is a high point for me and opens with a great synthesizer arrangement, which then launches into some extremely complicated ensemble work that sounds very similar to some of the music that was coming out of the English progressive rock scene at the time.  Although there are solos on this lengthy track, they are really very interesting and are seamlessly integrated with the arrangement - in fact, they sound pre-composed.

Although it may not appear to be the case, this Verve release was remastered (albeit a low budget remaster), and the sound quality is very good.  There are a few photos of the band and a lengthy bit of ""cosmic"" verse from Neville Potter.  The imagery of the words is both colorful and evocative.

All in all this is an excellent RTF album (my ""new"" personal favorite) and is very highly recommended along with Romantic Warrior (1976).  Proggers should definitely check this album out.",
,B000VRNCBQ,-1,-1,3,"Aside from Stanley Clarke's brilliant opener ""Vulcan Worlds""
very little on this album even TRIES to rise above the heavy
-handed prog rock-shaped hole RTF have fallen into,and that's
progressive rock of some of it wern't very good! It's not that
the musicians are bad-they're the creme de la' creme and THAT'S
the dissappointing thing;not only do we all know how talented and SUBTLE these guys can be but each song starts out with the maximum of pomise but once your addicted it turns into unlistenable musical bombast for it's own pure sake. If these songs had been given substantial editing this would have been an undisputed classic. Instead it's simply too overdone.",

,B000VRSUJ0,1,1,5,Great Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Product as Stated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No Problems!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
,B000VRSUJ0,1,1,4,The bad part about this song is that it sticks in your head all day long and is tough to get out. The good part is that this is an underrated party song. I am surprised they don't play this at more New York sports games. Throw this in a party play list (unless it is a Red Sox party) and you will have everyone singing along. Great beat.,

Brian McKnight is just a wonderful singer.",

,B000VRSX4M,1,1,5,"This song starts with some very enjoyable tenor vocal harmonies. It has a lively, surging rhythm that continues throughout. There are steel drum-like sounds in the chorus with a few guitar notes punctuating the surging, rolling gait. The lyrics are a bit odd as they seem to be about a man who is drowning which, if True, would contradict the overall sunny quality. But no matter, I still like this oddly upbeat tune.",

,B000VRLAJ2,1,1,5,Great music,
,B000VRTJI6,1,1,5,"The punk rock world was in a questionable state by the turn of the millennium.  One group that undoubtedly ruled the '90s scene -- Green Day, in October of 2000, would issue a nearly-all-acoustic record (""Warning""), which, while being okay, seemed to signal a change in direction, that could have been seen as a death-knell for the genre.  Were it not, that is, for a new crop of young bands, all of whom were just pre-teens in 1994 when Green Day released ""Dookie,"" that emerged around this time to save the day and inject some much-needed youthful vitriol to the sound.

Perhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto, Ontario's Sum 41, who began recording their second release and the album being reviewed, ""All Killer, No Filler"", in October of Y2K, just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew.

Wow!  Talk about this record being a return to form for punk!  After a mood-setting intro, on track number two ""Nothing On My Back,"" the listener is introduced to the band's striking, distinctive, and razor-sharp guitar sound, which was equal parts traditional punk-rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude.  It is a guitar tone that is truly raw, inspired, and decidedly ""old school"" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow.  Often imitated, but never duplicated, because no one ever did it again like Sum did.

And yet, on this same opener, it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up, and then some!  From vocalist/co-guitarist Deryck Whibley's ultra-memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone's well-placed and twanging mid-song interlude, these guys prove they're the real deal, and it doesn't let up from there.  This cut segues into the 50-second ""Never Wake Up,"" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I've heard.  The two best songs, though, lie in the disc's second half.  One is ""Summer,"" a rerecording from the group's debut ""Half Hour of Power,"" and boy, is it a masterpiece!  The main driving force in it is a simple, three-chord progression, but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective.  And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days!  No doubt, one of Sum's signature tunes.  Perhaps my all-time favorite, though, is track number ten, ""Crazy Amanda Bunkface.""  This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss, and Deryck's raging guitar solo, which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day's earlier ""Haushinka,"" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria.  Again, a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk.

And there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music, with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found, that will surely have you putting ""All Killer, No Filler"" on repeat.  I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily, and almost exactly 15 years on from its release, it hasn't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you.  I want to add that I'm 41 (incidentally) and have been listening to underground punk rock (Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, the F.U.'s, et al) for decades, and I still think that ""All Killer, No Filler"" is among the best-crafted punk LPs in my collection, with perhaps the highest replay value of them all.  A masterpiece that started a wave of imitators...  If you don't already own this one, well, what are you waiting for?!",
,B000VRTJI6,1,1,5,Possibly their greatest album. Just buy it already,
,B000VRTJI6,1,1,5,I've liked Sum 41 for years and I've loved their songs. This album is pretty good with a couple of songs that have seen some good radio and TV time. Gotta say my favorite song on the album is Fat Lip. They are a good band and I suggest anyone who is into pop punk to give them a try,
,B000VRTJI6,1,1,4,"It was in 2001, when the punk group Sum-41 finally hit it big with the release of their breakthrough album: ALL KILLER NO FILLER. The band received radio and televised airplay like crazy. Sum-41 also landed soundtrack spots for copilation CD's, the film Spider-man, and the television show Malcom In The Middle. It was clear that the public had finally come around to listening to the punk group's music. The public had good reason. Sum-41 has a great sense of when and how much distortion to use in their very interesting and fast paced rhythm changes. The guitars have a great taste in creating simple but very unique melodies. The bass gives the extra fill in creating the band's harmonies, and the drums keep everything together. The lyrics to ALL KILLER NO FILLER are amusing and can even be considered to be slightly contraversial for the track ""Fat Lip"". The lyricist makes honest and ""in your ears"" remarks about society and its expectations of its citizens. ALL KILLER NO FILLER is a fun piece of work, and one I highly recomend hearing in its entirity.

Stand out tracks include:
""Fat Lip""
""Rhythms""
""Motivation""
""In Too Deep""",
,B000VRSXJC,1,1,5,"i love this song what it takes
Steven Tyler sings it so well
i would deffinitly recommend this song
thank you amazon...",
,B000VRSXNI,1,1,5,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?,
,B000VRSXNI,1,1,5,Their are certain songs that I really like.  This is one of them.  Looking forward to some new stuff from them.,
,B000VRTJI6,-1,-1,1,"These guys stink, just like any so called ""punk"" rock today. Don't buy this.",
,B000VRTJI6,1,1,4,"Sum 41 was unheard of Canadian band(at least as far as America goes), who loved to party and trash hotels. When they released their 2nd LP here in America, instant fame. The usaul don't-[care] lyics and Slayer/Blink 182 (with a touch of melodicness) make this the perfect punk album. You can party to songs (I.E. Blink 182)like ""Fat Lip"", ""In Too Deep"", ""Rhythems"", and ""Motivation"", or embrace Satan in songs (I.E. Slayer, duh) like ""Introduction to Destruction"", if you can even call that a real song. The only problem with this CD? I only like 5 songs. ""Fat Lip"", ""Rhythems"", ""Motivation"", ""In Too Deep"", and ""Summer"". Oh, well. Despite that, this is a really good CD. Go buy it.",
,B000VRTJI6,-1,-1,1,"If you have had enough of corporate punk acts like Green Day and Blink 182, then Sum 41 is sure to tick you off even more.  If all the nu-metal garbage around now wasn't making me mad allready, this new corporate punk is ticking me off even more.  The same old three cord progression on every song, stupid uninspired lyrics, and packaged for MTV wanna be rebellion is what makes up this drink coaster in the making a complete package.  And what makes me laugh even more is how kids think that Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day are supposed punk bands because they're on MTV, well kids, this ain't real punk.  Real punk is Dead Kennedys, old Misfits, Bad Religion, Suicidal Tendencies, Suicide Machines, Black Flag, and dare I say it, even NoFX.  Then again, there are kids scratching their heads wondering ""who are they, they're not on MTV, they're no good"".  But what do I know?, I'm just some guy who listens to the above bands and other stuff outside the mainstream, so my opinion doesn't matter at all.  Now go listen to your Linkin Park CD.",
,B000VRSXHE,1,1,5,"Great song, good old rock and roll. The song brings on emotions and makes you feel good. Steven has amazing rang. You can never beat, to borrow phrase, give me that old time rock and roll.",
,B000VRTJI6,-1,-1,1,"For the love of god WAKE UP AND SMELL THE AIR YOU SPOILED BRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is exactly what's wrong with America today. Cheap music that I could surpass in artistic and equality in twenty minutes and dumb, childish lyrics are a testament to the continuing decline of American intelligence today. This isn't punk or metal at all. This is a horrible travesty to both genres. Metal is ultraheavy guitar riffs with extremenly loud melody and pounding drums. Punk is real rebelism against trends in society. Sum 41 aren't that either. They are nothing but a bunch if talentless clowns who are cashing in on TRL to make a buck [...].
Don't call me an old fogie who listens to Frank Sinatra or Mozart because I am 19 years old but I have stuck with the moral values that garbage like this encourages youth to dismiss.
I feel ashamed that people in my age group are more worried about being cool by cussing that than being intelligent. Well I hope this will change in the next five years and laugh at bands like Sum 41, Limp Bizkit, and all those dumb poser metal groups.",
,B000VRQPLA,1,1,4,"In Paste Magazine's ""Ears We Trust"" column, DJ Bruce Warren described Blue Merle's sound as ""Coldplay + Nickel Creek.""  The Coldplay comparison is apt - singer Luke Reynolds sounds a lot like Coldplay's Chris Martin - but there's not much Nickel Creek in their tunes.  Comparisons aside, I've enjoyed listening to the CD, especially the relatively strong songwriting and skilled arrangements and production.  Best songs: ""Lucky to Know You"" and ""Boxcar Racer.""",
,B000VRWTY2,1,1,4,This song is one of the most important songs of the 20th Century because of it's influence in ushering in the Age of Rock'n'Roll.  This goes into my collection of historic 20th Century music.,
,B000VRQRAO,1,1,5,Always nice to listen to the soothing voice of Barry White.,
,B000VRQRAO,1,1,5,"Music from my younger days. Brings back memories.  Barry White is a wonderful singer. Buy it,  Dance with your special person and enjoy the music & memories.",
,B000VRSXMO,1,1,5,I was excited by the possibility of retrieving music I once enjoyed years ago. The price was reasonable. The ease of the purchase was satisfying. It was an experience I would recommend to all music connoisseurs. I absolutely loved the entire experience.,
,B000VRQPLA,1,1,5,"Blue Merle--file them away in that place in your mind where you put scents long remembered, summer mornings when the roses have been out a little too long and the air is full of their fragrance, lovely and sweet.  This is music to explore, like a boy explores the cliff in the woods outside his house, delighted to find so many things to do and see.  This is music for lakes, and for rivers, and for ice-cream.

Much has been made of the resemblance between Luke's voice and that of the lead singer of Coldplay.  Indeed, his voice is eerily similar; fortunately, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Chris's voice is emotive and anguished, and Luke's is much the same, which suits this lovely music perfectly. Some might persuasively argue that it would better serve Blue Merle to have a vocalist with a voice more uniquely his own.  While a voice less reminiscent of that of Coldplay might be desirable for some, ultimately, no one can deny the power and maturity with which Luke uses his voice.  Did Chris influence him?  Probably.  There is no crime in that.  Could Luke have chosen to sing in a different style?  Perhaps.  But would that have suited the music as well? Probably not.  I think that he was blessed with a voice that performs well in the style in which he has chosen to use it, and we should be grateful.  Maturity and further listening will probably help to separate the two in our minds as the bands grow in different directions.  Musically, the two bands are not that similar, although there is much to admire in Blue Merle for fanatics of Coldplay.

Now, about the music itself?  At the risk of sounding trite, the  guitars really do shimmer, the banjos sparkle in a setting of solid drumming and inventive bass.  The lyrics are excellent, and reveal more on repeated listening, which is a benchmark which I use to decide who gets my 5th star or not.  The entire album is excellent, no weak tracks, and the more I hear it, the more glad I am to listen to it.  Some might consider it a flaw that there is no one ""stand out"" track--no one track that is so instantly memorable or catchy as to be the obvious single.  But this is not music for singles, a treat to be digested quickly and best given with insulin--it is music for sustenance.

For fans of Coldplay, John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows and Jeff Buckley, this is likely a band to watch and an album to love instantly, suitable to for enthusiastic recommendation to friends.  For fans of the well crafted pop song, this album is reason for excitement as well, especially if you like your pop drenched in complicated guitar work and gilded with a newgrass sensibility.  For everyone else, find out what you are missing.  Blue Merle are worth the ride.",
,B000VRQRAO,1,1,5,"I really just love listening to these older songs. They really do bring back so many memories. Memory lane as they say. Some of these songs can really bring you back to a certain times of your life. Often times I remember things that I had long forgotten, or so I thought. It is just great to listen and relax and enjoy these great songs. I grow up with so many of them. I love that I have my music on Amazon, this way I have them every where I go that I can excess my Amazon Music. I do often listen on my laptop when I am travel and staying in hotels. Nice to have some thing familiar with me. I love that I will never ever lose them or scratch them ever again. No more finding the wrong CD in the case either! That really was aggravating. Will have them forever if you are buying your music in mp3 form from Amazon.",

,B000VRWV4U,1,1,5,Going to use this one for Halloween.  It has always been one of my favorites.  I think the kids will like it.,
,B000VRWV4U,1,1,5,"It's been almost half a century since Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett and Lenny Capizzi wrote ""The Monster Mash;"" but it never seems to go out of date--especially at this time of year when Halloween is fast approaching. The song is fun; it's easy to dance to even in our times; and the lyrics amuse me. Listen for ""The Crypt-Kicker Five"" to sing primarily on backup; they are Gary S. Paxton, Leon Russell, Johnny McCrae, Rickie Page, and Terry Berg.

If you like this song, you may want to download or purchase Bobby's album entitled ""The Original Monster Mash,"" although admittedly the jewel of the album is ""The Monster Mash."" You can also buy the CD and more at Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett's own website. Amazon does not allow me to give out other website addresses, but you can just use Google to find Bobby's website.

Enjoy the music!",

,B000VRTJI6,1,1,4,"I myself am not a big fan of the recent pop-punk bands that have been pouring out of the music industry lately. ... But Sum 41 seem to be just a bit different. With a sense of humor (that is actually amusing!) and catchy riffs, Sum 41 have created a standout among their peers. Like everyone else, I was instantly hooked to ""FAT LIP,"" with it's references to mullets, Judas Priest and El Camino's. The rest of the album, however is a little different. Funny most of the times, but occasionally slipping into the typical. But if you have a sense of humor, then you are most likely to enjoy All Killer, No Filler. ...",

,B000VRWUDM,1,1,5,"It's the song that showed of his immense talent to the world, and it really never gets old either.  Mr. McKnight is such an understated, yet powerful crooner.  In a different life, he would have been the antithesis of Frank Sinatra, yet he's never abrasive to any listener.  His pianist stylists are somewhere between Bill Evans and a quiet dive bar's lonely player.  That type of authenticity is long gone from most musicians, but on Anytime he manages to embrace the multi-layered hopelessness without having to sell it.  You're simply there, in the moment, and stuck without a prayer.",

My mom was not perfect.. well to anyone but me and this song makes me think of her and how concerned she always was for me.. maybe she saw the nut job in the making and just tried to me feel better about myself.  Well since the reason I like this song is pretty isolated, it may or may not be a good fit for you but worth buying if you ask me. R.I.P. Donna Lee Vaughn.

,B000VRWT88,1,1,5,"I always think of Be Like That as the cautionary tale of excessive dreaming and a commentary on what happens when we constantly compare ourselves to others. I've spent entirely too many years doing this instead of just chasing what I wanted in life. In doing this, I've missed out on so many opportunities to do great things because they weren't the greater things I thought other people were doing. As a person with cerebral palsy since birth, I've fallen into the trap of wanting to be someone else, a lot. Therefore, Be Like That has special meaning for me.

,B000VSNSM8,1,1,5,"Blowing off enough steam to trounce a dozen Don Juan wanna-be's - Alicia Bridges power punches her way through the classic 'disco dancing' ballad ""I Love The Nightlife""; with no more than an original set of vocals, wildly emotive inflections & intonations (that easily set fire to the 'serious self-stature' themes in the song), a dizzying display of 'unrelenting feminine' provocativeness, and commanding control of her deeply emotional crescendos.

We take in her message to unfaithful boyfriends, how they line up in her perception of romance, and how she deals with their galavanting all over town - thinking she would stay home and stitch their socks. More couples danced way into the night in wild excitement with this one song - than anyone could imagine - from Moscow to Manhattan - from Paris to Omaha. There is so much life, vigor, and honesty in this song with the trumpets blaring their triumphant salute to her 'stand your ground if he messes around' anthem for women throughout the world. A truly remarkable accomplishment for the artists involved. Written by Bridges and Susan Hutcheson; produced by Steve Buckingham.

""Please don't talk about love tonight.
Your sweet talking won't make it right.
Love and lies just bring me down
when you've got women all over town.
You can love them all and when you're through,
maybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you.
I got to go where the people dance.
I want some action ... I want to live!

Action ... I got so much to give.
I want to give it. I want to get some too.

Oh, I ... Ohhh I ... I love the nightlife,
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
Oh, I love the night life,
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.""",

Alicia Bridges co-wrote this song with another person, and sings it with great soul and feeling.  What I like about the song is that as well as having the disco beat, it also conveys a message of heartbreak, love gone wrong, and escaping the pain by dancing to the beat on the disco dance floor.",

Truly stellar performances by two great artists of a truly gorgeous song.",

,B000VSWCQG,1,1,5,"Cher's ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" is a heart wrenching song of regret and lost opportunity. Listening to it brings to mind all the times I could have chosen to spend time with friends and family, but didn't; all the chances I had to say or do something nice for someone, but didn't; all the opportunities I had to make a positive difference, but was too busy.

Musically, I think it is one of Cher's best sung songs, and I enjoy listening to it again and again, because it is able to make me feel things in a way that no other song does.",

,B000VTW3NC,1,1,5,"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas might just be the very best Christmas song there is. Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title. Christmas doesn't have to extravagant but it should be happy,nice,peaceful,comfortable,and enjoyable. If it weren't for Frank Sinatra we wouldn't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging. The original version had somewhat different lyrics. The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung. ""In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow. Until then we'll just have to muddle through somehow."" Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him ""I like your Christmas song"" but that he needed that line ""jollied up"" to include the piece on his Christmas album. Sinatra said ""The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly that line up for me?"" And,of course,as Martin put it ""You don't say no to Frank Sinatra."" The new lyrics in this line became ""Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow. Hang a shining star upon the highest bough."" Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics. Frank Sinatra's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is THE original version of Have Yourself a Merry Christmas and gets 5 out 5 stars hands down. :)",

The lyrics are so beautiful as well as meaningful that they can bring tears to your eyes, if you are in the right frame of mind. The music too matches the lyrics, in that, it too is beautiful. It far outstrips Candle in the Wind, for beauty. It is a song about giving God Thanks, for certain people in his life, that have changed the person's life for the better, no matter what happened to the contrary. It is truly a work of art. Elton was definitely inspired when he wrote this. It will be forever on the top of my all time favorite songs of all time list. I would suggest that you buy it. At least, give a good listen. Maybe a second and a third, until you can hear all the words clearly. He sings things like ""I know why roses don't grow in New York"" and other things like that you probably aren't expecting. Just buy the song and let it enrich your life. The words alone could be a poem to people we love; who make a difference in our lives. A complete and utter dedication to them - those loved ones. Who could pass up something like that? I know I can't...",

I had no idea this song was on Elton John's record ""Honky Chateau.""  I knew it was an Elton John song, and that it was featured in Cameron Crowe's movie ""Almost Famous.""  I also knew I loved it.

Amazing harmonies, excellent guitar playing, etc! I've always loved this song but never seemed to pick it up but for .99 cents sheesh - I've paid $15 for albums that stunk.

Great great song.",

,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5,"""Ah! Leah!"" encapsulates the sound of 80's Rock, strong guitar solo, strong electronics/keyboard, and Iris hit those high notes. The lyrics are good, too - it's a song about a man and woman who can't get along long term but who have no problem with conjugal visits ;) Have a listen, you'll love it.",

,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5,"in the past you would hear a song on the radio and go Woah!  That was the case when I heard this tune.  I heard it on a DC radio station.  I later learned that this song was mostly popular around Pittsburgh, where Iris was from.  My favorite Iris tunes are this one and 'Love is Like a Rock'.  Both are great tunes.",

,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5,"Maybe one of my all-time favorite songs!!  The classic ""one-hit-wonder"" tune if their ever was!  His follow-ups paled by comparison. (Not an indication of other works by him, just that this was so good!)",
,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5,I was in a regular bar in Pittsburgh and Donnie Iris walks in and plays a song or two.  Well you have to respect a performer that remembers his home town.  My good friend even named his daughter Leah because of this song.,
,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5,I heard this song on the radio and really liked it. He should be played more often. I only know one other song by him.,
,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5,"Awesome tune!  I have always loved this tune and in fact named my daughter ""Aleah"" after it.

Better quality and user friendly as far as getting them onto your computer and/or player.",
,B000VWKY6C,1,1,4,"When I was little, my mom used to play this song over and over.  When she became ill, I wanted to find songs from when she was young to try and cheer her up.  This one of the ones that I chose.",

,B000VWJ70G,1,1,5,"I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*.",
,B000VWKVY2,1,1,4,"Good MP3 Sound Quaility. Didn't want the entire album, so I downloaded this song from amazon. Sound quaility is very good. Made a cd with my favorites and this song was needed. Would recommend this song ...",
,B000VWJ70G,1,1,5,"If you don't know this song already,...... you REALLY need to download it if you like real rock.",
,B000VWJ70G,1,1,5,"This young guy shows up. He plugs in his Stratocaster...AND JUST BLEW EVERYONE AWAY. Eric was a True born master. He could write, he could play anything from early progressive, to the blues. He laid the foundation of Rock n Roll, and built a mountain atop it. A mountain, that ALL those to come would aspire to summit. They stand upon his shoulders..even now... Eric was so creative that he was asked, time and again, to come and play alongside some of the most unforgettable musicians, and the most unforgettable bands of all time.

But tragedy struck. The pain was unbearable. A huge piece of Eric disappeared. I know just exactly how he felt, and how he still feels....

And that's all I'm gonna say about that.",

,B000VWJ70G,1,1,5,You can't go wrong with this classic although there is a dramatic difference between Clapton's slow acoustic version and the faster and louder version by the original Derek and the Dominos. Both great.,

,B000VWLEC0,-1,-1,3,"Elton John's star was beginning to dim when he released A Single Man in 1978.  The album is a decent effort, but doesn't match up to his quintessential early 70's albums.  One big reason is that he severed his writing partnership with Bernie Taupin.  Together they created unforgettable songs, but apart, they've been hit and miss.  A Single Man falls into the hit and miss category.  Songs like ""Shine On Through"", ""Ego"", ""Part-Time Lover"" and the gorgeous and heartfelt ""Song For Guy"" (a tribute to his young messenger who was killed in a motorcycle accident) are quite good while others like ""Big Dipper"", ""Georgia"", ""Madness"" & ""Reverie"" fall short of the mark",
,B000VWLEIO,1,1,5,I had forgotten about this song by Elton John. I am a fan of Elton John and this is one of his great ones.,
,B000VWLEIO,1,1,5,Elton John has many great songs and this one is no exception. This man continues to belt them out. Check it out.,
,B000VWLEIO,1,1,5,"There is no question that this year marks Elton John's 45th Anniversary since he & Bernie Taupin met and became one of the most definitive songwriting teams in the world. There have been so many classics that have been so strong for both of them. But of all of them from the 80's, the one that stands out intimately the most is Sacrifice from his 1989 album Sleeping With The Past. It is a very classic piano ballad that sits well, where in a era of songs that were tacky and not as strong from Elton, because of his abuse and marriage ended, it still stands absolutely tall from Elton in voice and harmony. If you're new to Elton John, this is a nice download as well as for die hard Elton John fans, and that is a sacrifice worth taking.

Song: A-",

,B000VWMTHE,1,1,5,"Wonderful by Eric Clapton is a heartfelt classic love rock song that covers what it feels like to be with someone who sees the inner and outer beauty of you.  Yes, I understand that the singer is actually singing about his love interest who turns many heads at the party they attend.  However, I think that it can also be  a positive love song about two people who are in a relationship together who also keep on the rose-colored glasses (metaphorically speaking) even after they have been together for a long time.",
,B000VWMTHE,1,1,5,"Allways LOVED it, still do",

,B000VWOOVS,1,1,5,"This is perhaps EDDIE KENDRICK'S signature solo jam after the TEMPTATIONS.
I call it his express jam, because it is such a jam, when you hear it driving, you tend to want to speed up to the beat! Back in the day, if you were walking, you wanted to speed up a little and walk your cool walk. The extended version is most satifying.",

It's a tough song that even those that hate rap will change there mind. To me I really don't consider this a True rap song it's more of a rock/rap if that makes sense. I would recommend this song to anyone, it's truly not your typical Eminem song, if you liked Lose Yourself by him you will love this one. If you haven't heard of this song, try the Amazon MP3 sample you will not be disappointed.

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. ""Just send for me, oh baby.""

""Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on, I made a vow,

Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe.

,B000VWMT7Y,1,1,5,"I remember first hearing this song in the 1960's (originally put out by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell) and have always loved it. Diana Ross did 2 covers of it and I liked them both. 5 stars from me, but listen to the audio clip before you buy it.",
,B000VWPXT0,1,1,5,"Yep another grunger that did not keep it intact. Very sad, this kid had a very cool voice as in this song. I feel in love with it. Yep a utube special. The voice is unique in so many ways. From his living in Washington, as did eddie Vedder. The pronouncing of words that just sounds so cool when they sing.  It is different and u can hear it. And you gotta have a very good voice. I believe if this kid lived and got his crap together he would be singing stuff people would buy today.",
,B000VWPXT0,1,1,5,This was a good song off of a really good album.  I'm glad I could get such a great price on it through Amazon and I like having it sync wirelessly to my Kindle Fire.,

,B000VWMT7Y,1,1,5,"Diana wowed us when she sang this.  I will always love Marvin and Tammy's version as well, but the arrangement that was done for Diana, they literally helped her to make this song her own.",
,B000VWOQIY,1,1,5,"In 1966 These Beautiful Ladies Ruled the radio...REFLECTIONS  was their last recording as a group,with Diana The Boss""Ross branching out to do her own thing solo .....Great Song ...1966 was the first time I heard synthesized music ""REFLECTIONS"" Yea .....",
,B000VWOQIY,1,1,5,Great.,
,B000VWOQIY,1,1,5,"I'm going to do something that some of you out there reading might consider highly unusual.  I'm going to pick this song apart and explain why each and every part of it is so irresistibly awesome.  ""Reflections"" might just be the greatest song Diana Ross & the Supremes ever released.  This song must have come on the radio a million times throughout the country over the years, and I wouldn't mind listening to it a million times myself.  Here we go!

It starts off on an unusual note for the first few seconds with swirling machinery-type sounds that seems totally out of place at first but now that I've heard the song so many times, I believe these chaotic sounds are supposed to represent the confusion and emotional distraught that Diana Ross feels through her rollercoaster emotional state of mind.

Then Diana Ross begins to sing... and her voice *alone* is brilliant.  It sounds so tender with *just* the right hoarse sound.  Like a young woman who's finally had enough of having someone hold her down, so she's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels.  Like she's on stage and it's her turn to speak, or sing in this case, what's on her mind.  I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger.  I LOVE it!

Then we have the Supremes providing the really somber and suspense-building ""ooooo, oo-oo-oo"" behind Diana's powerful vocals.  Listen to the perfectly executed way the ""oooo"" dreamily soothes and creates tension during the way Diana sings the line ""Through the mirrors of my mind, through these tears I am crying"".  With the Supremes providing back-up, now this song takes on a whole new meaning.  Without the Supremes Diana's vocals would have been great as it is, but WITH the Supremes?  Now it's just insanely good!

What proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line ""I'm all alone now, no love to shield me, trapped in a world of distorted reality"".  Suddenly, during this particular line, the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone.  What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past, they feel cold and angry.  If my words aren't clear, this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is.

It took me a LONG time to notice there's a speedy bass section playing in the background, and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change.  It's brief and easy to not notice unless you're playing REALLY close attention.  And how about the orchestration at the 1:50 mark?  It's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana's emotions all coming to a head and she's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible.  This is ANOTHER really powerful moment.  Granted, my interpretation probably isn't the same as Diana's, but that's okay- we all interpret music differently.

The song finishes on a more optimistic note with dramatically more promising vibes the way Diana Ross demandingly sings ""Reflections of, the way life used to be"" with a pounding rhythm illustrating a brighter future.  The tone of the song right here at this point seems to paint a picture of someone who's learned to move on from a troubled relationship and won't dare repeat the same mistakes again.

And just to throw in some humor, it's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- ""In the UFO!""  No Diana is actually saying ""In the you and I"" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here.  BUT!  If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions (in the beginning and when Diana sings the line ""happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories"" and the line near the end ""I see a dream that's lost from the hurt you have caused"") you could actually be led to believe she's singing about UFO's, haha.

So what is it about ""Reflections"" that is so magnificent?  It's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned.  Sadness, optimism, worry, fear, deserted... these are just some of the feelings I experience.  If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do, you should be able to detect all these emotions and more!  Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3-minute song, and that my friends is downright amazing.",

,B000VWPWNW,1,1,4,"These days it is much harder to actually find singers that have shown simplicity in song where it is actually worthwhile in heart. That is something today's divas have taken for granted in song. But there are some that haven't been given that credit, past being labeled as a one-hit wonder. Oleta Adams is one of those singers that had made that mark beautifully with one glimmer on the charts with her rendition of the Piano In The Dark Singer, Brenda Russell's song Get Here. The song is definitely one of those that shows strength and beauty with age like a fine wine after years of heart. I still love listening to this song each and every time this comes into heart. If you have never even heard a Oleta Adams song before, this is absolutely the one song to go to. So say you're going to get there to this beauty.

,B000VWU2NC,1,1,5,"When it has came down to Elton John, musically the 90's definitely brought out the best in Elton's voice, after getting his life back together from vices, and fallout from the media in England, he reemerged brilliantly with his music, and the music from his 1992 album The One definitely showed that in a melodic way. The Last Song definitely still shows that. It is still as beautiful and simple from Elton's talent, singing about A.I.D.S. after losing his friends and loved ones from Freddie Mercury of Queen to Ryan White, he definitely still knows that even after 20 years after this song came out, it still clicks very well and intimately with Elton's voice and sonnet. If you've haven't heard any of Elton John's songs from the 90's, this is absolutely one worth checking out.

Song: A",
,B000VWU2NC,1,1,5,"This song seems like it was written for me.

,B000VWOOUY,1,1,5,"I love this song. Of all the slow songs Elton John has done this one has to be the most unique of the bunch. It has that 80's New York blues feel to it and plays with chord progressions that move in unexpected places; making a melody that is both complex and familiar. Elton's singing is at its best here. The song takes me to places when I hear it. He sings like a smooth and mellow crooner, giving a little edge just where the song needs it. I am baffled this track wasn't included in any of the greatest hits collections. It was a top ten song on the UI.K. and and top 15 in the U.S.

If you love ballads or mellow songs that are a cut different than your standard pop tune that are still catchy and beautiful you must do yourself a favor and check out Blue Eyes.",

,B000VWSIC4,1,1,4,"The Fox is one of Elton's least known outputs in his entire catalouge.  It justed missed the top 20 (in the US) upon its release in May, 1981.  It also marked a transitional period in his career, coming off the sometimes successful but ultimately unfocused albums like 21 at 33 to the more straight ahead pop smarts of Too Low for Zero.  Although The Fox leans much more toward the unfocusedness of 21 at 33, due to the mishmash of writing partners and use of outside musicians in places, it is a much more interesting and satisfying experience than anything he had turned out in years.

I find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit, prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory.  As a few reviewers have noted previously, this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas (who would also produce his next 3 albums). Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement.  This ambition shows up in songs like ""Fascist Faces"", the beautiful instrumental trio ""Carla/Etude/Fanfare"" and the more traditional love ballad ""Chloe.""  The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir, a full string orchestra, and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this isn't meant to be a cohesive statement, but meant to try to satisfy trends and make ""the cutting edge"" for 1981.  Most of the time, it acheives this due to Elton's tunefulness and ultra-competent instrumentation.

Highlights of the album are many and scattered throughout.  It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit.  While ""Just Like Belgium"" is fun and lively, it really doesn't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks, and ""Heels of the Wind"" seems unneccessary, almost like an afterthought.  Big departures from his previous work are the tracks ""Heart in the Right Place"" with its forceful, blues-rock tone and ""Fascist Faces"" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir.  Both tracks are propelled by the biting, metalish guitar play of Richie Zito, which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton's canon.

In the end, The Fox is far from a masterpiece along the lines of Honky Chateau or Yellow Brick Road, but it is one of the most interesting in Elton's now 35 + year solo career.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the more arty side of what would become ""I'm Still Standing"" and ""Sad Songs"" just a few years down the road.",
,B000VWSIC4,1,1,4,"You know what to expect from Elton John, some nice, lush ballads, a few uptempo numbers and a little bit of rock. Nice melodies, mot so much passion, but a lyrics sheet that, no matter how one tried, could not find a single reference to his sexuality, except Big Dipper.

And so 'The Fox' goes, his usual servings of pop, still using self-serving metaphors (But 'The Fox' is a long way to plummet from 'Captain Fantastic' don't ya think?) (And who's fault is this anyway, It's not as if Elton writes the lyrics, or does he?? Did Bernie Taupin really bestowe the crown of 'Captain Fantastic' on Elton, while relegating himself to role of 'Brown dirt cowboy'?)

But The Fox is a surprise. Although it is not an experimental album, fairly straight-forward, it is still a very inspired album. From the sleazy-journo ode 'Heart's in the right p;ace' to classical music 'Carla Etude' and the all-our rocking opener 'Breaking down barriers', the songs on 'The Fox' are very solid and enjoyable. There is also a lot of diversity here too. Rating 3 1/2 or 3 3/4 or something like that, worth rounding up.

But if you are hoping for a return to his country-rock days; you'll be disappointed, you'll have to wait for the last song and even then you won't get any humility: ""And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
'Cause I am the fox, like it or not"".
But who wants humility in their rock music anyway? I DO!! We're a vocal minority but we're growing, yes you'd better be scared!!",
,B000VWSIC4,1,1,5,"This collection from 1981 has nearly gone unnoticed, probably due to the lack of input from Bernie Taupin.  It is filled with great uptempo, complex arrangments like, ""Breaking Down Barriers"" and""Fascist Faces"".  ""Just Like Belgium"" is one of Elton's most upbeat romantic songs since the mid-seventies and ""Carla/Etude/Fanfare"" (which runs into) ""Chloe"" is a testament to Elton John's creativity.  However, the best song on the album and the only single, ""Nobody Wins"" beats out the rest for arrangment, lyrics and heartfelt tearjerking.  Amazingly, this single is omitted from all collections.  I wish someone would explain this mystery to me.",

Great song by one of the all-time great groups from the '60s-'70s. *I've heard this song on a overseas Internet radio station and their version seems to have the same problem that I encountered with my download: there seems to be a weak spot at the beginning of the song, so I'd check it out if I were in charge of the downloading division of the record label. It's the same sound you hear when a cassette tape gets caught up in the rollers. After you untangle the tape and fix it right on the reel, it's still playable but there's one section that got mangled and doesn't quite sound right. I'm guessing that a master tape from the reel to reel recording days probably suffered this same problem :)Other than that slight flaw, it's still a great song :)",

,B000VZFS2O,1,1,5,"This is officially the first rap love song. I was in L.A. when this came out and every time I hear it now, it takes me back.",
,B000VZFS2O,1,1,5,A classic recording of a great song. This is the one you've heard on the radio or in the movies.,
,B000VZFS2O,1,1,5,This song is a classic. It's old but but timeless. Beat sounds nice in the car to. Knocks pretty hard on the subs.,
,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5,"We LOVE Dave Grohl BECAUSE HE ISN'T a Saduccee dealing diamonds!  When Dave declares, ""Go and tell the Angels everything's alright!"" you know where his heart is!",
,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5,"good song, grew up listening to this group and glad to find it here. Amazon is my choice of finding music i like.",
,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5,"Oh yeah, if you are looking to have your brain slammed back and forth from one ear to the other ear, this is the one! I have heralded only one track/song by the Queens as the ultimate new age piece destined to become the fashion of the new generation in 2013 and beyond (actually it came out on the airwaves years earlier) and it is one of the two and only two (so far) pieces they were able to write and play that I really love and enjoy hearing it over and over again so much that I would buy the album. The superior details of my pick as the new age tune of the coming age are;
first the subject which carries a universal message that everything they tell you or feed to you isn't True. There is a mystical truth that no one knows but you can know if you want to. Simple, right? Nothing earth shattering about that, but I find such deeper nuances and openings to a deeper or higher truth in it every time I hear it.
  Second is the orchestration of the piece, and the organization of my perfect song is wonderful. It begins with string entry on electric guitar, (although I've seen the tall guy banging away on an acoustical guitar in concert) . First thing is a tentative mid range chord swipe followed by a second bold strum using the same chord then blazing away into the chords banged as a rhythm, with varying chords that raise up to the high range and then cut off by a single plucked string that's allowed to fade off for a while a second or two and that leads into the voice singing in a soft tone, suggesting a secret whispered into your ear then raising to a pitch that wails across the table at a bistro you're sitting at with him. As the singer carries on with his performance the harmonizing players join on key notes while the electric guitars jam on at a feverous rate, keeping the same rhythm and beat underneath them swelling when there's a pause in the song, eddying away after he rejoins until without warning  (well, I know where and when by now) it all freezes, stops suddenly and there is only the bass thrum of a string , low and reverberating, steady and carrying the whole band, the world and the secret on it's powerful,confident back. That all too brief sound  is the one I wait for as I fall under its spell and it tells me the secret and the meaning that no one knows. I didn't know what to do about the ending going into a Mexican radio station and the announcer crying ""avey,..avay,..avey,..aiyee..."" but now I do know that the Queens had cradled the entire album around and within leaps into various broadcast stations in order to carry the secret out into the world  and seek a change, I have come to enjoy the brash announcer as another performer doing a job, yet a part of mysteries beyond us. The second song on this album is the Mosquito song, perhaps a dig at music producers and bean counters who would suck the life out of composers and performers? however one that I have come to interpret as music of another creation that is living and composing music in its own way and I avoid judgement on its efforts. For sure the whine of a mosquito gives me chills and snags my interest as I prepare to fend it (her?) away from my flesh, but there's something broadcast-y and remenisent about the sound she makes resembling the whine on a radio being tuned in. As of yet I haven't found a single song I would say I can stand after those two, but the ease,flexibility, quality is above average and excellent.",

,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5,I realized there was another QOTSA song I wanted. I just couldn't remember the name (let alone what album it was on). I then thought about where I was at that point in my life to narrow it down. (Poor memory) Love it! Hard but not thrashy.,

The video on YouTube is rather powerful.  I guess that clinched the purchase of this item for me.  Nelly's ethereal voice inspires me to ""try"" -- to try to live my goals, to make the effort to work out the details of my expectations.  Nearly every time I listen to this song, I cry.  Sometimes when I sing along, I say ""cry"" instead of ""try"" but ... methinks... those words are linked beyond rhyme.",

I can't really put my finger in it, but she's got this kind of understated quality that's refreshing and unusual because successful comedians couldn't pull it off. Lily's humor doesn't hit you over the head, in fact it's so subtle that you'll frequently ask yourself, ""what was funny about that?"" I had completely forgotten about Lily until I saw her on this year's Oscars award show with Meryl Streep. Now that was a funny bit!

,B000VZJS20,1,1,5,"I definitely agree as well that this song is an instant classic. This song is basically about someone wanting to have sex with you in a very passionate and aggressive way. Like many others, I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager. I honestly found the music video very eccentric (in a positive way), but creative at the same time, and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more.  I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video. The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it, and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song (there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative:( Through every forest, above the trees Within my stomach, scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive). Obviously, many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means. I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting.

,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease. On the other hand it's both historic and great music. The historic aspect is this is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come.

Listen to the sound samples on this page and even those short snippets will reveal the magic of this album. I am not going to try to dissect the music or impose my personal taste on you, but if you love swinging and tight quartets with a piano and vibraphone in front you will be more than pleased with this album.

While I promised to not dissect the music I will say that the intensity that Jackson brings to the performances match the backing trio - Peterson and bassist Ray Brown in particular were renown for intensity even on ballads, and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well. So the chemistry among the four is natural and one of the reasons why this album appeals to me.

The album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two sessions (September 15 and 18, 1961.)  Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions, two of which are logged as 'untitled Peterson originals' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue. Regardless, the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile.",
,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,Excellent performance and sound quality,
,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"There are melodies and movements on this album reminiscent of Miles Davis' masterpiece 'Kind of Blue', but with vibes and without, of course, the trumpets/saxes; so thoroughly unique, but in a similar Jazz vein.

This swings hard, but subtle and is incredibly attractive to the ears, with Oscar Peterson's piano tinkling masterfully.

One of my favorite Jazz albums; highly recommended.",

,B000VZJS84,1,1,4,"The reunion of the ""very tall band"" whet my appetite for the first meeting.  Musically, it doesn't disappoint.  From the very first track, ""On Green Dolphin Street,"" Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint, drawing the listener in as on few other recordings (he's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis).  And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes, he's neither intrusive nor overwhelming.  In fact, he's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session.  And Bags is, as usual, the master of bop and blues, a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets (Gary Burton would cut the rotators, add two more mallets, and take the instrument in a different direction).  As recently as 5 years earlier, Milt was still playing with fast-spinning rotators, but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place.  (To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ, if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis, check out ""Bags and Trane."")

One caveat: the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment.  Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of ""stereophonic sound"" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms.  Oscar's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted; Ed Thigpen's drums lack dispersion and upper-register presence. In fact, there's a slightly ""canned"" quality to the overall sound, making you want to take the lid off.  I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording, they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound.  (Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import.  Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money.)",
,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"This is a Jazz album that everyone should have in their collection. The Oscar Peterson Trio is joined Milt Jackson and what a beautiful album they create together.

Recorded in 1961 the album starts with On Green Dolphin Street. This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson's very restrained and delicate Piano solo. Even when the solo reaches the swing section there aren't the torrents of notes that you might expect. This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent.

Of course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers. In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell. Milt Jackson plays with a fire that, to me, was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ. Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming. He really hits some great accents when you really don't expect them - and they work! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good.

Sadly only Oscar Peterson survives from this marvellous quartet at the time of writing. This disc captures them all at the height of their abilities and is an essential purchase.",
,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961, along came the other two members of Oscar's trio, Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD, Brown and Thigpen were great players, and add a lot to the success of this effort. The opener, ""Green Dolphin Street"" is relaxed, but ""Heartstrings"" and ""Work Song"" jump. Then comes the wonderful, almost eight-minute take on ""John Brown's Body"" that soars. The final two cuts, ""A Wonderful Guy"" and ""Reunion Blues"" are also superb. Milt and Oscar, of course, went on to do great work up to the mid-90's, but they were already old pros 41 years ago. If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz, play this for him or her. It's a perfect blend of the four instruments and a great introduction to the category.",
,B000VZJS84,1,1,5,"Just a perfect record.  There is so much swing in this LP, and it comes out of a handful of instruments.
The vibes rule the record, but it is Peterson's piano that holds down the fort from beginning to end.  Tasty bass, economic drums, and a sharp choice of tunes.
The soft intro will fool you.  Two minutes in you will find yourself ready to move with it, and it doesn't let go.
I have gone through 3 copies of this record--2 vinyl and 1 CD--over the past 20 years, and I never get tired of it.
This ranks with the best of Mingus or Miles Davis, in my book.",

,B000VZLMWO,1,1,5,Great Song...This song is great and has a great melody. Chorus is powerful and full! Jimmy Eat World is an awesome group!,
,B000VZLMWO,1,1,5,"""The Middle"" by Jimmy Eat World is a positive song about having the self-confidence to see your own beauty and great qualities in yourself regardless of what others may think. This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can, and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life. I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think (also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would). Last, but not least, this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong (thick-skinned), and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine. My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner:

It just takes some time
Little Girl You're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

  ""The Middle"" is a brilliant track that applies to both men and women from all walks of life even with taking the ""little girl"" metaphor into account. I suggest this song (with absolute self-confidence) if you know that events in your life are going to unfold perfectly and in a joyful manner, but you also crave listening to a song that powerfully gives this reminder (in addition to sending the message to always see your personal beauty and unlimited power regardless of how others may treat you)",

,B000VZO4QU,1,1,5,"Apparently Britain knows something us Americans don't... This song is the best thing to come out of dance since 'Canned Heat.' Written by the legendary Elton John, Scissor Sisters single handily bring back the dance scene, if only for a few gay, happy, short minutes. But really folks, you can't get through this song without at least tapping your toes. In fact, Larry Craig probably did his scandalous foot things to this song.

This song is incredibly catchy, and impossible not to love once you get into it. And the dance factor is cranked up to max here. Whether it be in a closet, or an empty room, or a bar, or a club, rest assured, you'll dance at some point. The vocals, the beats, and the music completely fit the song. And in fact, the structure is perfect for creating all those classic dance vibes.

Overall, a pleasurable experience that really brings back the True dance movement. Not those thumping, trance remixes they put out today, but the quality stuff. So check out this song, you probably haven't heard it here, but it was a huge hit in Britain, so see what you're missing, cause this song is just plain fun.",

,B000VZKP8G,1,1,5,"CALIFORNIA SOUL, an Ashford & Simpson composition, sung by Marlena Shaw is a treat to the ears! I heard this song a few years back, it was playing in the background of a car commercial and everyone in the room wanted to know the name and who sang it. I had to find it and add it to my collection. Since then, I've heard it on 3 more commercials and it was on Lincoln Lawyer soundtrack, and featured in the movie The Italian Job. From the time the music starts playing, you know you're in for a treat and you get it. The music is upbeat and the melody is sweet. Marlena's voice is on point; it's uniquely powerful and full of soul. She has great control of her instrument and you get swept up in the soulful way she delivers each and every note. This song is still going strong and this is a testament to how great of a singer she is. It's no wonder - California Soul has been sampled over and over by rappers (Gang Starr, The Game, etc.), beer manufacturers, Dockers, countless television commercials and a driving game - Driver: San Frisco. I like the album, but I LOVE THIS SONG. You can't listen to it once, you have to play it over and over because it's so good. It's a timeless classic. Great tune and highly recommended.",

It's not the best song in the world and it's not melancholic. The up tempo and melody don't exactly reek of despair but the lyrics can fit if you let them. You still get angst in the tone so as a vehicle to express a frustration through song, you can consider it.
