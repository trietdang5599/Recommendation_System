They started their recording career with Island Records as a progressive rock band. They released 4 fine ( though uneven ) records for Island during 1969-72, before they changed for CBS. This change combined with  David Bowie producing his own \"All the Young Dudes\" for them gave the big breakthrough and a new profile as the rock'n rollers of glam rock.\n\nThis 2 CD collection concentrates on their CBS period, though each of their 4 Island albums are represented by one track. These 4 tracks are all good songs in their own right, but can obviously not cover the great variety of their output during that period. So go for other compilations \/ or the originals ( now with bonus-tracks ) if you want to research their early days.\n\nDavid Bowie produced their first album \"All the Young Dudes\", and his touch his very apparent through-out the album. The sound is close to his own on albums like \"Hunky Dory\", \"Ziggy Stardust\" or \"Alladin Sane\". Only two track has been left out from that album, which along with the follow-up \"Mott\" was their most consistent record. Their song-writing matured during that period, and although the band was uncertain whether they would be able cope with Bowie's skill, when the recording's of \"Mott\" began, that self-produced album shows the band at the peak of their creativity. Only one track is missing from the album. Outstanding tracks from the album are the rockers \"All the Way From Memphis\" and \"Honaloochie Boogie\" along with the great ballads \"\"I Wish I Was Your Mother\", \"Ballad of Mott the Hoople\" and \"Hymn for the Dudes\".\n\nUnfortunately guitarist and songwriter Mick Ralphs was growing frustrated with Ian Hunter taking more and more of the spotlight, and he left soon after the release of \"Mott\". Spooky Tooth guitarist Luther Grosvenor ( Ariel Bender ) was recruited to take his place, but things never become the same again.\n\nTheir final studio album, the slightly chaotic and spotty \"The Hoople\", did contain some fine tracks and was a commercial succes, containing the two hit-singles \"The Golden Age of Rock'n Roll\" and \"Roll Away the Stone\"; but the spark had gone, and they spilt up in 1974.\n\nBesides their albums the band recorded some fine singles-only tracks; all of which are included here. Hunter's ballad \"Rose\" is outstanding and it also became a live-favourite. The late B-side \"Rest in Peace\" is another song in the same category - great song!\n\nThe two 1974 A-sides \"Foxy Foxy\" and \"Saturday Gigs\" are also great; especially the autobiografical ballad \"Saturday Gigs\" is outstanding. This was one of the very last recordings they did, featuring guitarist Mick Ronson. A little sad they did split up after that, because the recording shows that this new line-up had the potential of creating new exciting material. On the other hand \"Saturday Gigs\" is a worthy final note to the career of a great band.\n\nGreat informative booklet!! Recommended!","summary":"Great Compilation!","unixReviewTime":1122595200,"vote":"17","image":null}

When her second CD (\"N.B.\") underperformed critically and commercially in Europe, she scrapped its planned U.S. release and quickly recorded a new CD (\"Pocketful of Sunshine\") that she thought would do better.  The first two singles from that new CD fit seamlessly into current American pop radio: \"Love Like This\" peaked at #11 and \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" went all the way to #5.  The third single, \"Angel,\" is a beautiful ballad-tinged song likely to become a big U.S. hit.\n\n\"Angel\" is a bit more R&B leaning than her usual single; producer Darkchild has produced numerous hits for R&B artists like Destiny's Child, Mary J. Blige, Pussycat Dolls, and Beyonce.  The single starts as an atmospheric piano-driven jam, somewhat reminiscent of Nelly Furtado's \"Say It Right.\"  The song becomes progressively more up-tempo, culminating in a rap-style bridge by Natasha.  What I like most about the song is that the production sounds so current yet it really incorporates Natasha's style as well - she sounds really great vocally here.  A real winner that likely will vie for the top 10.","summary":"\"I'll be your angel,\"","unixReviewTime":1224979200,"vote":null,"image":null}

And along comes this excellent CD reissue to remind us...\n\nUK released July 2014 - Big Break Records CDBBR 0276 (Barcode 5013929057630) gives us the \"I Hope We Get To Love On Time\" album across tracks 1 to 10 - first released on vinyl LP in August 1976 in the USA on ABC Records ABCD-952 (42:42 minutes). Tracks 11 and 12 are Bonuses - an outtake called \"I'm So Glad I Found You\" and the 7\" Single Version of \"You Don't Have To Be A Star (To Be In My Show)\".\n\nThe 16-page booklet is the usual classy job from BBR with photos of the duo live and on TV, rare 7\" single picture sleeves and liner notes by NYC-based Music journalist Christian John Wikane that includes new interviews with the singers. Big Break's resident tape wizard WAYNE A. DICKSON has handled the remaster and it sounds fantastic - full of detail and bounce.\n\nThis is mid Seventies Soft Soul - very Stylistics with a little Disco thrown in - with the ballads like \"Nothing Can Stop Me\" allowing their voices to shine and the melody rise above the heavy string-arrangements. \"Easy Way Out\" is a lovely smoocher while the outtake \"I'm So Glad I Found You\" is a mid-tempo stepper. It's easy to see why the poppy Soul of \"Your Love\" was released as a single (ABC Records AB-12262).\n\nA quality reissue by BBR and a must own for fans.","summary":"\"...Two Hearts Beating Out Loud...\" - I Hope We Get To Love In Time by MARILYN McCOO & BILLY DAVIS, JR (2014 BBR CD Remaster)","unixReviewTime":1407801600,"vote":null,"image":null}

This is great funky blues entertainment.\n\nI read...\n\n\"Luther Allison gave his son some of the greatest gifts a father can give a son. He gave him a comfortable home environment filled with the music that inspired his career and he taught him what he knew about his art. Bernard has a new album, Chills & Thrills, that proves eleven years after Dad's death that the Allison legacy is indeed intact and that, while he performs some of his dad's songs, Bernard Allison has indeed found his own voice.\"...Don Wilcock, Blueswax\n\nHis latest effort, which was recorded in New Hope, Minnesota in the autumn of 2007, he's joined by Eric Gales on second guitar, Rusty Hall on keyboards, Jassen Wilber on bass and Mario Dawson on drums. Guests: Bruce McCabe (piano, clavinet), Kathleen Johnson (background vocals), Jose James (sax)\n\nBernard is a rocker at heart but he can also slow it down from time to time and burn a ballad or two. He had many different musical influences while growing up, including Albert King, Muddy Waters and Freddie King, and later, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Johnny Winter. Bernard and Eric deliver some high quality riffing on this release and are comfortable trading back and forth on each new groove that is spun.\n\nThis disc confirms that Bernard Allison is doing his father proud and has become one of the few bluesmen whose every release is worth a listen. Funky, raw and full of \"Chills and Thrills\". Five stars easily.","summary":"Bernard Plays His Butt Off On This One","unixReviewTime":1357948800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Additionally, I saved the music video to this song in my youtube history last week after also viewing and hearing their B.Y.O. B song.  I was wondering why this song randomly popped in my head and confided to my husband about it. It turns out that he was listening to Toxicity on his itunes account a couple of days before when I was away working my overnight shift. We both listen to various types of music, with rock being one of them. The only difference is that I usually listen to rock music blended with other music genres (such as with electronica, indie rock, a type of rock rap etc) while my husband sometimes prefers harder versions of rock (such as Ramstein). I know that this may sound strange and even crazy to others, but this made sense to me (my husband listening to Toxicity while I was at work and me picking up this song in my head two days later) because I feel that both my husband and I have a strong and powerful connection due to being kindred spirits and getting to know each other the longer we have been married (Im happy and thankful to report that we have been married for 10. 5 years now). I do not fully understand the lyrics, but I admit to enjoying this song due to the compelling singing and the way that the music instruments complement the timing of the song.  As for my husband, he enjoys Toxicity by System Of A Down because he sees it as a hard rock motivational type of track.","summary":"Song That Randomly Popped In My Head","unixReviewTime":1406073600,"vote":null,"image":null}

I admit that I first heard The Way You Move by Outkast (feat. Sleepy Brown) back around 2003 when I was living in California.  One of the positives about this song is that women of various shapes, sizes, skin complexions, hair textures\/hair lengths,and personalities are featured in the online music video that is currently available for free viewing (which to me the online music video sends out a powerful\/healing indirect message of why it is helpful to think highly of yourself regardless of how you are externally seen and\/or perceived).","summary":"An Unexpected Positive Message","unixReviewTime":1446163200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Overall, 'Right To Be Italian' is pretty decent ~girl-power~ I thought. Not quite sure if I would even consider Holly & The Italians to be New Wave. Several tracks that should manage to lure you in are \"Rock Against Romance\", \"Just Young\", the ballad \"Just For Tonight\" and \"Poster Boy\". Line-up: Holly Beth Vincent - synthesizer, guitar & vocals, Bobby Collins - guitar, John Catchell - trumpet and Kevin Wilkinson - drums.

Things weren't helped by Virgin's reluctance to reissue the album on CD, nor the time-limited nature of this Wounded Bird's release. The hard-luck story leaves this great power-pop album once again difficult to find.\n\nAnd rest assured, this is no one-hit wonder of an LP; Holly Beth Vincent's other songs were in the same league as \"Tell That Girl,\" and veteran producer Richard Gottehrer (Blondie, Go-Gos, Richard Hell & The Voidoids) deftly mated the verve of new wave and punk with the timeless sound of guitar-driven rock 'n' roll. Vincent's music is in a league with The Waitresses, Go-Go's and Pearl Harbor & The Explosions, but without the New Wave affectations that prematurely aged the competition's work. Think of this as a sharper-edged version of Bonnie Hayes & The Wild Combo's \"Good Clean Fun.\"\n\nWounded Bird's reissue includes the original front and back covers and song lyrics for the album's original ten tracks.

Tagtgren then left and Akerfeldt returned for the EP \"Unblessing the Purity.\"  Despite his return, these four songs don't sound much like the style heard on the first two releases.  All four tracks are more aggressive and brutal, faster, and less melodic, and they mostly shed the buzzsaw guitar sound that basically mimicked early Entombed and Dismember.  At times, like on \"Weak Aside,\" this EP has a greater influence from Morbid Angel and Florida death metal than the early Swedish death bands, foreshadowing where they'd go on the follow-up full-length \"The Fathomless Mastery.\"  It's fitting since Bloodbath started as a tribute to the classic era of death metal's popularity, and Akerfeldt has always made it known that Morbid Angel was a big influence on some of his early Opeth albums.  Being just an EP, each song can be called a highlight, but if you don't get a kick in the gut when that ridiculous groove in \"Mouth of Empty Praise\" breaks down, you're just being stubborn.  All four of these songs are incredibly fast, uncompromisingly heavy, and celebrate the Bloodbath tradition of honoring the forefathers of the genre with fresh, new songs that recall the glory days of the early '90's.  If you're into devastating brutality, you should enjoy \"Unblessing the Purity.\"","summary":"A Bloody Good EP","unixReviewTime":1409011200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Multiple Grammy award-winning soul singer Luther Vandross became the smooth, brilliant, individualistic stylist of romantic ballads as a solo act, but before he made it big, he was one of the forces that pushed the soul, disco group Change to the big time before he adroitly decided to go as a solo act. The song Searching\" might be considered the 'theme song of Change from the Vandross days, with an infectious ostinato beat from a rocking electric bass, an insistent guitar riff, slick background voices, staccato horns, jazzy drum accents and solo, and a great R&B tenor sax solo.

I was quite skeptical of this release because they signed to Bad Boy but its not half bad. You Dont Want Drama is an instant banger.

Look At The Grillz is cool even though TI and Twista outshined Ball & G on that track. Lloyd shows up on the dynamic Forever.  There are some songs that could have been left off. Trying To Get At You and Baby Girl are horrible attempts at songs for the ladies.  The Streets feat Bun B is boring. Shot Off with Ludacris sounds well... ludicrous. Bottom Line: Living Legends is a solid release by a group that has been on the top of their game since they first came out.

Moreover, I have four different versions with  Casals.\n\nI would say this is probably, the most intimate and serene of the four versions I have. The dream team was Isaac stern and Alexander Schneider first and second violins, Milton Katims viola and Casals and Tortellier first and second cellos respectively. It's to say half Budapest quartet (Katims and Schneider), Stern whose prodigious career was increasing and Paul Tortellier a True legend of the instrument.\n\nAll of them achieved a memorable musical feat through this hypnotic performance, whose penetrating lyricism and absorbing quietness carved in relief. The quality sound (keeping in mind it was recorded in 1952, was surprisingly good).\n\nIn which concerns Schubert's Fifth Symphony, this is the first release. Due multiple motives, this recording was found in the archives of Prades and this finding was fortunate. The approach given to the Mozartian First movement and the heavenly inspiration of the Second movement is unbelievable. In spite of being Kertesz' interpretation with the Vienna the most radiant and engaging that I know, this musical document from 1953, is an invaluable musical document, absolutely essential for all hard music lover.\n\nExtraordinary musical treasure.","summary":"The radiant star of the genius","unixReviewTime":1282867200,"vote":"4","image":null}

Music of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Strauss, Dvorak, Schumann and the like had rarely sounded so precise coming out of Ohio, let alone Vienna, Berlin, New York, etc. Szell had a total exactitude about his conducting style, once saying he could not pour chocolate sauce over asparagus, (when it came to sensuous tone and lush sonic beauty.) But his recordings still tend to be near the top of the cream of the crop, that is in the music he was best at. And Brahms was near the pinnacle for George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. Case in point, this cd of The fourth symphony, with both overtures.\n  I have rarely heard a better Brahms 4th than this Szell recording. It's one of the two or three best Brahms 4th's I've ever heard. The only that top it are Karajan's 1977 BPO recording on DG, and Bruno Walter's luminous version from almost 60 years ago. Szell has better sound than Walter, but not as good sound as Karajan. However, Szell has no need to slather on the lush gloss (chocolate sauce) that Karajan lived for. No version of Brahms' 4th is as precise as this one. The whole work proceeds from beginning to end in the most logical of manners. Everything seems natural and unforced, so that the scope of the work is perfect. The drama of the first movement is captured in just the right way. The scherzo is bursting at all the right points. And the passacaglia finale is done wonderfully, with each variation succinct and unique, yet bound together by the perfectness of the 8 note theme. That George Szell\/Cleveland Orchestra precision is on display here in full measure like almost never before. Absolutely wonderful.\n  As for the Academic Festival and Tragic overtures, they are also done to a T. I've never had much great affection for these overtures though, seeing them as lightweight throwaways in the Brahms canon. (Any Brahms work that features the cymbals can't be taken TOO seriously.) But nonetheless they are popular, and they're a nice filler.\n  Since this disc is very cheap on Amazon.com, it is a great pick-up for the Brahms nut, the orchestral lover, or just somebody who likes stuff done with the precision it deserves. Recommended.-----------------------PEACE\nBTW---This cd is also included in a clamshell-style box set with all the symphonies, the Haydn variations, and more. That set's price does fluctuate a bit, so keep an eye on it.","summary":"One of the two or three best Brahms 4th's I've ever heard.","unixReviewTime":1490918400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Oh, and here is some trivia I heard; \"They\" say, and I'm not 100% certain it's True because you know how some things that \"They\" say aren't entirely accurate sometimes, but anyway, \"They\" say that the band Black foot sold the rights to this song (and others) for a mere pittance...unknowingly duped into letting it go, because they needed the money and had no clue how popular this song would become. The people that bought the song has made a ton of money, but the band got the shaft. I also heard that the band tried to form under another name, but never did manage to make another killer song like Train Train because, well, honestly, they couldn't get over the fact that they practically GAVE several million dollars worth of royalties away. And the song still plays. Somebody still gets paid. But not Blackfoot....Urg...if the story IS True, I'd be sick to death too!

If anything Malcolm McLaren and company are a bit more adventurous in their cultural pillaging, taking music from South Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and country, bluegrass and hip hop from the US. The difference being McLaren's effort is a bit more cheeky and far less concerned with art rock than with duck rock. Unfortunately long and annoying passages from some radio djs (The World's Famous Supreme Team?) are interspersed throughout the tracks and they are as intrusive as they are irritating. Maybe if they came in once or twice I could deal, but they're inserted quite a bit and the same sequences are repeated ad nauseum creating rather annoying breaks or interludes oft times in the middle of the longer tracks. Combine that with the very dated rapping and what you have is an interesting cultural artifact, Duck Rock has been credited as an early introduction of hip hop to England, but its not something I want to listen to often. Unlike Eno & Byrne's previous effort it hasn't dated well and is equally as interesting as it is annoying. I'm afraid the good is about equal to the bad.","summary":"The good is about equal to the bad","unixReviewTime":1287273600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Because Pavarotti was admired as the Donizetti tenor par excellence, his two recordings, early and late, were obvious contenders. The Decca version has always been preferred, thanks to the freshness and charisma of Pavarotti's singing - he owned Una furtiva lagrima for decades - but as much as Sutherland is beloved, her Adina is girlish or light; she tries hard to bring the right comic tone, and even her notorious pronunciation is improved - but a second drawback for me is Bonynge's conducting, although he too tries hard to bring rhythmic life to his ordinarily slack style. Of course, the testimony of countless fans sees beyond these limitations - so be it.\n\nThe later DG L'elisir corrects the weak points in the earlier with alert, expert conducting by Levine and Battle's utterly charming Adina, her voice and characterization a delight. But Pavarotti! This recording dates from a series of live Met performances that began in 1989 (there's a met release in MP3 at various download sites), and the great tenor's voice had grown creaky  and threadbare - to me, it's painful to hear.  When the lead singer is unacceptable, so is the entire performance. Apparently this isn't the case for the enthusiastic reviewers here, but newcomers should be warned. I bought the set sight unseen and threw it away.","summary":"Pavarotti is in sad decline, ruining the rest of an excellent performance","unixReviewTime":1395792000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Recorded in late 1998, it brings together three absolutely beautiful but still very distinctive female voices, all of whom have timbres tailor-made to their roles: Fleming smoky and luscious with oboe-toned lower notes suggestive of the Marschallin's experience and maturity, Graham more open, impassioned and boyish as befits the breeches part of Octavian and Bonney silvery and soaring in girlish ecstasy to incarnate the feisty Sophie. Then we have the gorgeous playing of the VPO, elegant and responsive under Eschenbach's loving but flexible direction with plenty of - but not too many - drawn-out moments when we can linger over the multi-layered harmonies of this wondrous music. The suggestion of tears in Fleming's voice when she ponders the passing of time or the inevitability of Octavian leaving her one day is deeply moving without descending into mawkishness. The famous Trio is a slice of heaven: three impeccable sopranos soaring, entwining and over-lapping in a typically Straussian splurge of emotional outpouring.\n\nI remember Rene Fleming talking about feeling inspired on hearing Helen Donath (I think it was) singing the final scene from \"Capriccio\" when she was a student in Germany on a Fulbright Scholarship and promising herself that one day she would try to sing it as well as Donath - and her performance here is truly one to remember her by as she deploys all that is best and most attractive in her lyric soprano. She is careful to make her German sound idiomatic and expressive and depicts all the quirky humour, wry resignation and heartfelt confusion experienced by the Countess - and the introductory \"Moonlight Music\" is a master class in swooning orchestral indulgence; the horns are from another world.\n\nThe duet from \"Arabella\" allows us to hear more of Barbara's Bonney exquisitely pure, bell-like soprano; again the voices spiral heavenwards in \"Aber der Richtiger\" - surely one of the most memorable extended melodies Strauss ever wrote - like the two larks in Strauss's \"Im Abendrot\" from \"Four Last Songs\". Again and again the attentive listener will forget to breathe so absorbing is this miraculous singing.\n\nIt is of course delightful to hear the veteran, now late, bass-baritone Walter Berry in the cameo roles of Faninal and the Major Domo.\n\nAs you might by now have gathered, I rather like this disc.

Stutheit","reviewText":"It could be that the band wanted to show-off their resilient new lineup (co-founder Sonny Mayo exited the fold in 2008 and was replaced by Clint Lowery), or it could be just that they wanted to have a new batch of songs to take with them on tour. But for whatever the reason, Georgias own Sevendust found it necessary to enter their twelfth year of existence by immediately follow up 2007s Alpha with another new album the next year. But even though their seventh full-length effort from the studio, Chapter VII: Hope And Sorrow, cannot exactly claim to be a watershed release, it is home to all of the 7D ingredients that you know and should already love by now. Hence, expect to hear plenty of infectious vocal hooks soaring over syncopated drumming and bottom-heavy riffs, here, as well as an equal number of clouds-parting choruses that practically scream modern rock radio.\n\nAnd besides, there are a few spots of if not innovation, then at least mild experimentation to be had from time to time. Inside, for example, finds Sevendust exploring some moderately new ground, as it opens with a really ominous and foreboding, industrial-lite intro with creepy synth accents; and track number nine, Sorrow, also opens with an undeniable nod to the industrial metal genre, with moody, techno-industrial-like knick-knacks and well-placed synth flourishes. And moreover, we also get a cool, tranquil piano in the intro of Hope; and two actual, honest-to-goodness guitar solos in Scapegoat and Fear. (The former might be a really mediocre solo, but it is a solo nonetheless; and the latter is a surprisingly ripping, wah-wah-heavy solo.)\n\nFor the most part, though, C VII: H&S is just another day in the office of Sevendust. Even those experimental moments noted above are surrounded in prototypical 7D goodness, because by the time the first two of those tracks has hit their respective choruses, they have each become funky, and really chunky and bottom-heavy big-riff rockers with solid guitar leads and strong, stop-start rhythm sections. And its vocals, meanwhile, alternate between guttural growling in the verses and accomplished clean singing in the infectious, majestically melodic choruses.\n\nElsewhere, Enough might have some questionable lyrics, sure (i.e. Too much is never enough), but it nevertheless makes for a really fun listen, as it is a slammin ode to the mosh pit with really meaty, chunky, fiery guitar licks and machine gun drumming. And the aforementioned Scapegoat is also a noteworthy standout for storming onto the scene with almost crushing force, backing huge, densely crunching guitar chords and pounding, lumbering rhythms with deftly hefty, churning double bass drums.\n\nIn addition to featuring the already described guitar solo, Fear is another big standout on account of it bringing back plenty of Lejons soulful and heartfelt, clean vocal hooks, and pinning them against crunchy, driving guitar chunk. The Past is a good, acoustic-based, and very soaring power ballad with excellent, memorable twin-headed vocal harmonies; but it is immediately followed-up by a commandingly heavy and dense bruiser in Prodigal Son.\n\nOn the downside, a track like Lifeless kind of misses the mark. Why? Because aside from featuring a chilling and haunting intro, the track brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But thats nitpicking I suppose, because there are no stinkers to be found here. And besides, it is almost immediately followed-up by Contradiction, an excellent mosh pit anthem with blood-pumping tempos, brutal guitar\/drum give-and-take, and booming rhythms. A frenetic sense of energy also courses throughout, here, as does plenty of angry, visceral, gang-shout-like vocals. And finally, the set concludes with Walk Away, which is a catchy mix of dueling, back-and-forth vocals offset by sweeping melodies and amazing clean singing.\n\nNaturally, some listeners will hear the chugging guitars and soulful melodic choruses of a song like Lifeless, and immediately turn the album off, automatically dismissing the rest of it as merely formulaic fare. But thats their loss. This is a darn solid album from Sevendust, an exceptional band. So, if you were not a fan of this band before, you probably wouldnt even be reading this in the first place; and if you were a fan, then there is absolutely no reason to stop being one now. Be on the look out for guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Creeds Mark Tremonti, and members of Alter Bridge.","summary":"Another Chapter laid to rest...","unixReviewTime":1391126400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I particularly like the guitar riff that periodically comes into play.  The group does a great job of combining the instrumental background with the words (not a lot of different words, and no heavy thoughts here), but pleasant and catchy.  It's the kind of sound that if you are not careful you will be playing it back in your head as it tends to kind of stick in your mind (especially the guitar riff).  I heard it last night for the first time in ages (on satellite sirius radio) and knew I had to have it right then.  This is a song you will either want right away or decide it isn't your cup of tea.  Enjoy if you like good rock and roll from the past.","summary":"Catchy guitar riff","unixReviewTime":1385942400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The first thing to say in its favor is that the sonics are up to Decca's analog standards, with lots of detail, dynamic range, and punch. That suits Solti's style in Beethoven, because although he reins in his trademark fierce attacks and driving tempos, he's still aggressive. It's not so much that he sides with Toscanini against Furtwangler, but that he performs Beethoven from the outside, marshalling all the externals while revealing almost nothing of his own feelings for the music. Millions of CD buyers clearly like his style, and since I hadn't heard all his Beethoven symphonies, I thought I'd survey them.\n\nCD1 contains the 5th and 2nd symphonies, which sound much the same under Solti's direction. He pulls Beethoven forcefully out of the classical world of Haydn, an effect amplified by using a full modern orchestra. The lovely slow movement of the Second is bulked up beyond what we hear nowadays, and the Scherzo proceeds with startling sfozando accent that stab at the rhythm. The finale is fast and efficient. Strangely, the Fifth could use more of this propulsion. After a biting attck at the famous motto, the strings become almost mechanical. Solti needs to supply vitality form the inside, but he doesn't. As a result, all the movements sound proficient and impersonal. The CSO brass dominate the finale, as you'd expect, but Solti's tempo lags a bit behind Beethoven's Allegro con brio.\n\nCD 2 is devoted to the Eroica and two overtures, Egmont and Coriolan. The opening movement of the symphony is surprisingly old-fashioned and measured, but accents are strong. In its broad, forthright way it's convincing, despite moments when vitality lapses. The funeral march is serious, dignified  and well-paced. If only Solti could find it in himself to be moved, because without that, we won't be. The Scherzo is exemplary and the horn trio a thrill (it's taken at tempo but not fast). The impression of a traditional Eroica is underscored in the finale, which is more respectful than abandoned. The two overtures are in the same vein, their chief virtue being the orchestra and the recorded sound. Still, this is one of the more successful CDs in the set.\n\nCD 3  brings a fairly familiar pairing, the Pastorale and 8th symphonies.  Solti would seem to be ill-suited to the gentler, bucolic side of Beethoven, but he is never less than skillful and respectful. The Pastorale finds him in a relaxed mood--I'm not sure I'd call it genial--and frankly the results are more successful than Karajan's over-poolished, emotionally frigid accounts.  The Chicago strings remain sweet and almost Viennese throughout. After a proficient Scherzo in the style of Szell (no actual peasants allowed) and with excellent wind solos, the storm proceeds without undue shocks. In other words, it doesn't inspire Solti to brutality. The finale needs more joy and reverence, but it is robust and direct. In all, one of Solti's best efforts in Beethoven.\n\nThe 8th opens with a too-heavy Allegro vivace, but Solti is in good humor and doesn't drag things down. To me, this symphony requires the kind of wit, delicacy, and effervescence as Mendelssohn, and since Solti only gives us a traditional Germanic account, with sharper than usual accents, I am not ovelry enthusiastic. But as a filler to the Sixth this is more than adequate, and one can always fall back upon the gorgeous playing.\n\nCD 4 gathers the 7th and 1st Symphonies, an odd pairing. The 7th requires an exceptional reading to efface memories of Kleiber and Karajan, specialists in this work. Solti isn't inspired, but the CSO plays with blazing commitment, which counts for a lot (they were just as good for Reiner in his classic account on RCA Living Stereo).  LIsteners who want to hear lots of horns in the mix will be more than satisfied. Solti's rhythm could be crisper in the first movement; the Allegretto is taken a bit faster than the norm in German readings but isn't light-footed. The Scerzo is alert, speedy, and totally successful. I always hear Karajan's searing finale in my ears, but Solti comes fairly close. In all, a good Seventh keeping up with the Eroica and Pastoral.\n\nThe 1st Sym. copies the style of the 2nd in being ig-boned, forceful, and romantic. The recording is especially good, giving us lots of woodwind detail and impact in the orchestra's wide dynamic range. There's not a puny note here, which is a mized blessing in a work that cries out for delicacy and wit. Of its overblown kind, however, this is a good reading that never sags.\n\nCD 5 contains the Leonore Over. #3, the 4th Sym., and the first movement of the Ninth.  Splitting the 9th on to two discs isn't a sin, but Decca has been stingy with timings: most Beethoven cycles fit on 5 CDs without overtures, or perhaps one. Solti's Fourth is in the same traditional style as his Eighth; it's given weight and iportance but ddoesn't sag. Despite a fairly impersonal slow movement, the other movements are satisfying. The Leonore #3 is forceful and dramatic, lacking only what it must have: blazing inspiration. But if you have hung in this long, I think you will find Solti better--and more traditional--at Beethoven than his take-no-prisoners reputation would lead us to believe.\n\nCD 6 completes the 9th Sym., whose first movement on the preceding CD, was forthright and dramatic but lacking in mystery. If you just want to hear a first-rate orchestra playing in excellent sound, this certainly fits the bill. If you want to hear a new or individual take on a masterpiece, it doesn't. The Scherzo proceeds very well, with Solti keeping the rhythm alive and alert. The  Adagio, at 19 min., is one of the slower ones; this tempo requires the conductor to keep an unwavering conentration. Solti certainly controls his forces well--even Karajan doesn't give us a better played rendition. But by trying for a hushed, reverent atmosphere, Solti misses the music's spsiritual intensity. This is one movement you must conduct form the inside, from your own deep emotions, and Solti doesn't.\n\nThe theatricality of the choral finale is more up his alley. He's ore involved, and the exciting parts are very exciting, with the CSO lower strings outdoing all rivals for richness and accuracy. Solti's apaproach is too straightforward, however, missing much in terms of real eloquence and emotional depth.  Marti Talvela makes a stunning, sonorous bass soloist, and the rest of the quartet is fine. The Chicago chorus is world-class, of course, and far exceeds the woolly, wobbly Vienna Singverein that Karajan used three times on DG. Several reviewers have called this 9th the high point of Solti's cycle, and I tend to agree.\n\nIn sum, a more satisfying Beethoven set than I expected, with excellent sonics and great playing from the CSO. Solti isn't profound, but his other virtues shine through.","summary":"Surprisingly better than its reputation, and the CSO is glorious","unixReviewTime":1179792000,"vote":"10","image":null}

The first time I heard Husker Du was with Warehouse, and I wasn't intrigued so I didn't listen to the CD again for quite some time. Then out of nowhere I was doing my Amazon vinyl shopping (usually while intoxicated which is never good for the wallet..) and I searched Husker Du out of nowhere and found this album at a good price. Bought it and listened to it immediately upon receiving it in the mail. I was blown away from the second I heard a noise out of my speakers. Loud, noisy, screaming guitar. Fast drums, bass beat to back the drums just enough and lyrics I couldn't understand but eventually caught them \"new day rising\" absolutely simple, yet very effective with the yelling and such. I was so hooked already. It's one of those 40+ minute albums that feels like it goes by in seconds. So I just flipped back to side A and did the repeat. The next day after listening to this I got in my truck headed to work and put in Warehouse because it was the only CD I had by them and as opposed to my first time, now I was in love with what I was hearing again. Since then I'm now a Husker Du fiend. These three guys are amazing. New Day Rising is just gorgeous though because it was the start of their more \"friendly\" and \"pop-ish\" music, but it's still so upfront and intense at the same time. Really groundbreaking stuff. This and Zen Arcade are at a tie for my favorite with Warehouse not far behind. Every album they touched though is just magical. Great group of musicians and such entertaining and fun music to listen to no matter what time. Highly recommended album and group.","summary":"Fantastic album","unixReviewTime":1481932800,"vote":null,"image":null}

However, I am in favor of this album greatly. Wanna know why? It's 17 songs in 29 minutes. It's frantic power chords and blazing guitar solos. It's nimble, light-speed basslines and breakneck drum work. It's three young men whose vocals are a rallying cry to the spirit of True punk music. It's the feeling of a real live show where everything is happening at once and you don't know what to expect next. Although not as classy, sophisticate, elaborate or complex as such musical giants as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Frank Zappa, or the works of early Genesis, this is some of the greatest rock 'n' roll ever recorded in all its sweatsoaked, headbanging, fistpumping, anthemic glory. Get a taste of this! Thanks for the time, and peace.","summary":"A sign of things yet to come from this band","unixReviewTime":1293667200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Although they had been together for a decade before this album was released, 1974 was THE year the Three Degrees really made their mark. Not only did they have a US Top 5 and UK #1 hit with the beautiful, wistful WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN, but they also sang a small part at the end of the funky Billboard #1 instrumental hit by MFSB called TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia) which is included here as a welcome bonus track.\n\nFor those new to the group, this is as good a place to start as any. I have purchased five of their albums on CD recently and this one definitely ranks as one of their best. That unmistakable Gamble & Huff sound is all over it. The vocals are smooth and velvety, so don't expect a 1970s girl group that is as spirited as the Pointer Sisters or gritty as Labelle. The arrangements are full and rich and complex even on the ballads with ear-catching tempo changes and unique structures that make the album a very interesting and satisfying listen. On CANT YOU SEE WHAT YOURE DOING TO ME the gals punctuate each delivery of the line with a strong Bay-Bee that really makes the song.  A WOMAN NEEDS A GOOD MAN glides back and forth from classy to sassy with a hi-hat that picks up steam on the bridges only to pull back and slow down for the next versebrilliant! The throbbing DIRTY OL MAN was a big UK hit but didn't catch on in North America; perhaps radio programmers thought the title was too risqu? Who knowsall I know is its catchy as heck. The epic IF AND WHEN outclasses even WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN as the most gorgeous cut on the album, but it was probably too big and grand for radio airplay when picking the singles.\n\nId give this album FIVE STARS except a few numbers here sound a little too much like commercial jingles: I LIKE BEING A WOMAN and YEAR OF DECISION and bonus track LOVE IS THE MESSAGE, otherwise Id rank this as one of their essential albums along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/New-Dimensions\/dp\/B003UN58WY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">New Dimensions<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/3d-Three-D\/dp\/B004IOP1JO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">3d (Three D)<\/a>&nbsp;which were both produced by Giorgio Moroder.","summary":"One of Their Best Albums","unixReviewTime":1465430400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Chris Martin and company have shown that they can appeal to so many different audiences because the songs just deliver heart and soul. But, many Alternative Rock fans have felt that their songs were too soft for radio. But, the group has definitely shown a much more rougher edge on their latest single, Violet Hill. The song which is the 1st single from their album Viva La Vida, is definitely a much harder side to Coldplay's fans. It definitely shows well and proves Coldplay hasn't lost its might.

Coldplay drops their trademark sound for something completely different, and the world of music might never be the same again.\n\nThe sound is possibly indie, definitely something out of the U.K., and certainly something new we've never heard before. It's surreal, it's art, it's a new breed of rock. The lyrics are not as cryptic as previous efforts, but still not a spelled out song, with the only chorus making a shred of sense, \"If you love me, won't you let me know?\" A haunting picture is painted of winter, and the song certainly paints and fits the mood.\n\nChris Martin never sounded better vocally, and they go perfectly with the song. As for catchiness, I don't think this is one you'll be singing in the grocery store, but you'll remember the general feel of the song.\nAs for negatives, there isn't any. Take the song, or leave it. It certainly won't appeal to everyone.\n\nOverall, not the first thing you'd think of when it comes to summer music, but I see a world in which this song becomes a big hit. Certainly over the pond. The song is a haunting painting of ole', with originality, and the element that really makes the song, the mood. You might not find another thing like it, and you're certainly not going to confuse it with something else. Let more U2 comparisons come in, they're as good, and should be as successful.

Over a period spanning 16 years beginning in 1974 they recorded for three different labels, placed nearly three dozen singles on the Top 100 Singles chart and had several highly successful albums to boot. Yes, the music of Daryl Hall and John Oates seemed to be everywhere during this period.\n\nHall and Oates began their recording career at Atlantic records in the early 1970's. In 1974, they had a minor hit with a tune called \"She's Gone\". Although this record was not wildly successful it was clear that these guys were going to be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years. RCA records took note and signed Hall & Oates in 1975. Their very first release for the label \"Sara Smile\" was on the charts for some 7 months and peaked at #3 in the spring of 1976. Atlantic records took note and re-released \"She's Gone\" which also became a Top Ten hit in '76.  In January 1977 RCA released the boys' third single.  \"Rich Girl\" would become the first of six #1 singles for Hall & Oates spending two weeks at the top of the charts In March of that year.  As far as I am concerned this is one of the best songs they ever recorded.","summary":"A number one smash from 1977.","unixReviewTime":1477612800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I wound up sitting in my car with her, talking to her for some 2-3 hours, trying to convince her not to send a 'Dear John Letter' to her boyfriend in Vietnam. I had the radio on at a low volume. When I was almost done with my pitch, this song came on. I turned up a little for her to hear it better. She suddenly had tears running down her, sobbing a little. She turned the radio off. She hugged me briefly, kissing me on the cheek. She opened the car door and got out. She turned around and said: \"Thank you. Roger. I won't send this letter. It would be very cruel of me to do that. You see, I was so afraid to lose him. Instead, I will write him to tell him how much I love him and how much I miss him. Then I will hope for the best.

And as I'm blasting this now in my own house that I pay the mortgage on I can almost hear my mother still banging on the door telling me to 'turn that junk down!'\n\nThe sound quality on the streaming version of this is pretty good. Since its' mostly rap with the instrumentation being a background sound any loss of fidelity is totally acceptable to me on a streaming version. But even then it still sounds strong and natural via streaming. And Steven Tyler sounds great on the Walk This Way collaboration.\n\nNow excuse me I have to go find some Adidas stuff to wear while I listen to this rest of this so I get the full effect.","summary":"Respect the classics man","unixReviewTime":1498694400,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's an upbeat and hopeful number that lifts the spirits, with the typical electronic instrumentation we've come to expect of most '80s films but still done quite well.  And the singer's voice is quite good as well.

Still, I love to see that Michael Tait is doing great things as the lead singer of Newsboys, and TobyMac has continued to come up with some really great messages set to music.  This particular song redefines what is meant by a \"love song\", because it is True, we were created to love and honor God.  As Christians, that's what our lives are to be about.

This pop song is quite creepy and well-written.  You'll be able to remember the catchy verse melody.  I enjoy the lyrics.  \"Digging My Lawn\" has a jazzy, upbeat rhythm with more early Floyd-like playfulness about a man digging Giles lawn, haha!  \"Tremelo Study In A Major\" is an instrumental with appealing... banjo work?  Sure sounds like it to me.  It speeds along in a swift way.  \"Newly Weds\" is basically the same as \"Digging My Lawn\"- very memorable vocal melody.  \"Suite No. 1\" is a short burst of fast-moving and melodic guitar work before the song quickly changes somber and completely different from the first half of the tune.  You'll be able to subtly detect Fripp's genius here.\n\n\"Scrivens\" is a beautiful flute\/sax instrumental with a jazzy rhythm.  \"Make It Today\" has jazzy upbeat female and male vocals and Fifth Dimension-like \"Aquarius\" vocals with more sax and flutes.  So far I love this album!  \"Digging My Lawn\" is basically the same as the other version- still a great pop song.  \"Why Don't You Just Drop In\" has pounding piano work based around pop vocal hooks and surprising Brian Wilson-like mannerisms in the middle.  The guitar solo is pretty crunchy too.  \"I Talk to the Wind\" is arguably superior to the King Crimson tune.  At least this early 1968 version sounds more appropriate as a light shorter pop song (at least in my opinion).  Nothing against the classic In the Court of the Crimson King version of course, which is also excellent.  This version sounds slightly more upbeat and to the point which I guess just feels more appropriate to me.\n\n\"Under the Sky\" has tender vocals very reminiscent of Annie Haslam of Renaissance fame.  A very sad, softly sung tune that sort to reminds of \"You're Only as Pretty as You Feel\" the Jefferson Airplane tune.  \"Plastic Pennies\" has more female vocals, this time with an upbeat and happier melody with innocent lyrics about children playing.  Expect a flute solo at the end too.  Good song.  \"Passages of Time\" is a creepy psychedelic-tinged song with more female vocals.  This lady reminds me so much of Annie Haslam it's not even funny.  Or is it funny?  No it's not!  This version of \"Under the Sky\" doesn't sound particularly different from the other version except for some of the guitar playing being more obvious.\n\n\"Murder\" trades female and male vocals back and forth which is especially cool in the intro- \"Murder, murder, Murdeeeeeeer!\" Otherwise a silly but vocal melody-appealing pop tune with strong psychedelic leanings.  \"I Talk to the Wind\" features female vocals this time and actually once again I prefer *both* versions of this classic song compared to the more famous King Crimson version.  Like the above version, this type of song just feels more appropriate as a shorter pop song with the psychedelic dreaminess.  \"Erudite Eyes\" begins with more early Pink Floyd-like upbeat\/jazzy vocals before soon dissolving into a guitar\/flute jam that's somewhat disjointed but mostly memorable.  This jam does remind me of King Crimson's more messier jams from the early In the Court\/Wake of Poseidon days.\n\n\"Make It Today\" is like the other version but with an extended sax\/jazzy guitar jam in the middle and again at the end.  You know this song actually has serious FM hit potential due to the 60's-ish good time vibes.  It should have been a popular tune.  \"Wonderland\" has a blend of female and male vocals that don't necessarily appeal to me but they're alright I suppose.  The vocal style temporarily changes in the second half to a more appealing one.  \"Why Don't You Just Drop In\" is perhaps better than the other version due to Fripp's guitar playing and what strikes me as cleaner production but I could be wrong about that.  The album finally ends on a VERY high note with the Brian Wilson-inspired \"She Is Loaded\".  This is one of the best written songs on the album in my opinion.  Maybe others feel differently.  \"She used to give me anything I wanted until she won a football pool\".\n\nOverall well for King Crimson fans certainly don't expect lengthy multi-part progressive rock original instrumental work that nowadays people consider legendary, and also don't expect Fripp's guitar brilliance to be showcased unless you listen attentively for it.  Treat the Brondesbury Tapes as a pop album with heavy psychedelic vocals combined with jazzy arrangements.","summary":"whoa, cool!","unixReviewTime":1400976000,"vote":null,"image":null}

The song is really fun to listen to, and sticks from the heart, and the tone of Rivers Cuomo's chords. Unlike other artists like Rihanna, Britney Spears and wannabe acts, at least Weezer make something great out of fun music.

Just when you think they're done with music, they come back with something better than their last. And this time, they might have just topped themselves. When I first heard the song, I didn't care that much for it. It all just seemed too weird, and culinary disgusting, \"I eat my candy with the pork and beans.\" But then I saw the music video, which is a freakin' awesome tribute to YouTube and pop culture, complete with comedy, and cool effects, and everybody appears as themselves in the video. You'll see \"Numa Numa\" guy, and 'Miss I Don't Know Why People Don't Have Maps.'\n\nLyrically, the song and the video go hand in hand, where it celebrates the difference of everybody, which is what YouTube is supposed to be all about. Musically, it's pretty good modern rock material, and apparently so. There's the booming guitars, the vocals, and the catchy hooks.\n\nAnd again, if you haven't seen the video, do yourself a favor, and do so. It's must-see TV. And it really compliments and drives the song, instead of the other way around. Favorite Part: The Mentos in Coke Fountain Show. The only thing that they could have done better in the video is add Lonleygirl15 to the beginning squares, instead of \"Numa Numa\" guy, and save him for his great part later.\n\nOverall, the song is good, not great. Pretty good modern rock, although it doesn't blow me aways by itself. But add the video, and everything changes. And the video is already headed toward the YouTube hall of fame on its own. And the song may end up as one of the most successful of 2008, at least in Modern Rock.\n\nReal Score: 4.5","summary":"Good Song, Totally Awesome Music Video","unixReviewTime":1212624000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Isaac Holt, 16 May 1932, Rosedale, Mississippi, USA; drums) and Hysear Don Walker (piano). Young and Holt both studied at Chicago's American Conservatory Of Music. They later joined the Ramsey Lewis Trio and were featured on two of the group's best-known singles, \"The 'In' Crowd\" and \"Hang On Sloopy\" (both 1965). Young and Holt then broke away and decided to form their own group which they dubbed Young Holt Trio. The act's debut single on Brunswick Records \"Wack Wack' was a modest national hit peaking at #40 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1967.\n\nAbout a year later pianist Walker was replaced by Ken Chaney. Soon Chaney was out and the act was reconstituted as Young-Holt Unlimited.  Under that name the duo hit pay dirt with the million-selling instrumental \"Soulful Strut\". The song peaked at #3 on the pop charts in January of 1969 making it one of the most popular instrumentals of the decade.

Jackie Wilson began his career as a solo artist when in 1953 he was offered an opportunity to replace Clyde McPhatter in the legendary R&B group Billy Ward and His Dominoes. Jackie made several memorable sides with the group before signing with Brunswick in 1957. Once again flying solo, Jackie Wilson would record dozens of hit records over the next decade. Of all of those terrific recordings my favorite has always been the remarkable \"To Be Loved\" from 1958. Feel the sheer exhilaration of a person who firmly believes that someone actually loves him. I have always felt that this was his finest vocal performance as a solo artist. This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"Jackie Wilson at the top of his game!","unixReviewTime":1465344000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Katy loses her fake I.D. and I think her \"boyfriend\" has lost the room key.\n\nIt's OK, but could be better.

That has been the case with Whitney Houston. Hard to believe that it has been over for years since she passed away, and I am often reminded just the real beauty of her voice, compared to so many female jokes of today like Ariana Grande and Beyonce' Knowles that have much less than what she brought to the table. That has shown with each and every song Whitney Houston performed and covered. Especially with The Bodyguard soundtrack. Her cover of Chaka Khan's I'm Every Woman is a very upbeat and delightful song that still moves me each and every time I hear the song. She definitely drove her soul on the rhythm with each and every note, and made it her own for a generation that still knows music today. If you have never heard a Whitney Houston song before, well this is one cover that I sincerely recommend from beginning to end. Too bad female artists will never ignite the way \"The Voice\" reigned.\n\nSong: A","summary":"She Was Every Woman","unixReviewTime":1470528000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Riley had dreamed of being a country music star since she was a little girl. After marrying her high school sweetheart Jeannie C. pulled up her Texas stakes and headed for Nashville. Believing he had a monster hit on his hands producer Shelby Singleton Jr. bided his time waiting for just the right voice to sing this tune about small-town hypocrisy. Singleton flipped when he heard the demo recorded by Jeannie C. Riley. Riley recorded the song in just one take and Singleton pushed the song into radio stations and record stores as quickly as possible. It was an instant smash. \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" song two million copies in just the first two weeks and wound up selling more than six million records.

Stutheit","reviewText":"Despite having a completely new line-up than the one that recorded the first part of the \"Keeper Of The Seven Keys\" series eighteen years ago, \"Keeper Of The Seven Keys: The Legacy\" marks something of a return to form for German power metal primitives\/pioneers Helloween. Bursting at the seems with all of the good stuff that is regularly found in PM -- i.e. strong hooks, crunchy guitar licks, wailing solos, Bruce Dickinson-inspired singing, etc. -- this 2005 effort breaks absolutely no new ground for the band or genre. But it is still a really darn good and impossible to dislike one, nonetheless.\n\nSo now that we have established how excellent \"The Legacy\" is, it should also be noted how epic it is. It is a sprawling, seventy-seven minute-long affair spread out over the course of thirteen tracks and two discs. And while Helloween's Iron Maiden and Judas Priest influences might be as strong as ever, here, the band still manages to somehow possess their own unique sound. It is much more ambitious and progressive than anything that either of those two bands had successfully attempted to date (prior to the year 2005).\n\nAfter a lengthy, drawn-out, and really ominous intro, opener \"The King For A Thousand Years\" kicks up a thrashy groove with speedy double bass thudding, soaring melodic vocals, crunchy speed metal riffing, and galloping beats. From there, things do proceed to get a little mellow, as the song adopts a nice, twin-guitar harmony section, flashy soloing, and pretty acoustic bridge; but this fourteen minute-long epic finally picks back up again to galloping speed metal territory (iced with Maiden-inspired singing and aggressive tempo'ing). The next track, \"The Invisible Man,\" begins with an excellent, and highly technical slapped bass solo that flows into highly energetic and crunchy proto-thrash riffing, twiddly guitar soloing, and steady, humming bass lines. The guitar solo work is very lengthy, sustained, epic, and air-guitar-able in this song, but it also features some memorably Falsetto vocal hooks, and prog-ish synth soloing.\n\nNext comes \"Born On Judgment Day,\" which kicks off with another tricky bass intro before settling into a propulsive, Motorhead-esque double-bass-aided speed metal groove. This highly technical and complex mini-epic finds everybody getting in on the action, as it also boasts a nimble, skillful mid-song drum solo, followed by a bass solo, and more delicious, shred-happy guitar solo work. \"Pleasure Drone,\" then, is another equally-as-large standout, as it is a bass-heavy song with prominent, muscularly grumbling bass lines flowing throughout. It, however, is also highlighted by solid guitar leads, and great, epically high-flying solo flights. The remaining two songs on the first disc are two other considerably large standouts, as \"Mrs. God\" boasts huge, infectiously catchy choruses, and technical, mid-song bass soloing, while \"Silent Rain\" is a piece of pure, straight-up Eighties thrash metal, through and through. It is backed by ripping, wah-tinged soloing, forceful double bass heft, and crunching, rigid, chainsaw-fast guitar picking\n\nThe second disc is a little inconsistent, but certainly not without some charm. It opens with the very catchy and groove-happy \"Occasion Avenue.\" This song can claim to have substantial merit, as it does feature choral-esque chanting vocals, propulsive thrash beats, grumbling bass lines, crunching guitar licks, and soaring guitar harmonies -- and although plenty of soulful, Falsetto vocal hooks find their way into the mix, here, too -- but on the whole, it is just a so-so song. Clocking in at over eleven minutes in length, it does get a little boring and unnecessarily repetitive. And \"Light The Universe\" is also the source of some drag, as it is a slow, and even kind of plodding, piano-aided power ballad. (Although it does score a few merit points for featuring guest female vocals from Blackmore Night's Candice Night.)\n\nFear not, though, because the memorably muscular \"Do You Know What You're Fighting 4?\" kicks the energy level up way high again, as it is a chunky number with clearly Megadeth-ian riffing, and rhythmic, galloping beats. Also included here are an excellent, dazzling, wailing, trade-off solo section, and an empowering, and nearly anthemic chorus. And \"Come Alive\" is another very thrashy piece, although it is preceded by the seriously-proggy \"Shade In The Shadow,\" a song that, with its infectiously melodic and Falsetto vocal hooks, and good, prog-ish soloing, ends up sounding not unlike some Dream Theater tunes. Back on the downside again, \"Get It Up\" is, unfortunately, a mostly unremarkable inclusion. But, it, again, is followed-up by another beaming moment of potential, this one coming in the form of \"My Life For One More Day,\" which is a very propulsive album closer with tasty, crunchy riffing and immediately catchy and memorable sing\/chant-along vocals out the yin-yang.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you have not already been charmed or coerce into liking Helloween (and if you haven't, what the heck is the matter with you?!), \"Keeper Of The Seven Keys: The Legacy\" is not likely to change your mind. But longtime Helloween fans should feel anything but let down with this latest installment. So make sure there is plenty of room left in your C.D. collection\/shelf to add this epically epic prog\/power metal opus to it.","summary":"A surprisingly epic, if unsurprisingly excellent Helloween effort","unixReviewTime":1397606400,"vote":"2","image":null}

This was a match made in heaven. Over the next several years the Red Bird label would release some of the most exciting pop records ever recorded. And while it wasn't really planned that way nearly 90% of the labels successful releases were by female groups or solo artists. One of the most interesting and innovative tunes to be released by Red Bird was The Dixie Cups classic recording of the Mardi Gras favorite \"Iko Iko\". The song, under the original title \"Jock-A-Mo\", was written and released as a single in 1953 by Sugar Boy and his Cane Cutters but failed to make the charts.

The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more.

However, in fairness to reviewing just the song, the tune of Your Body Is A Wonderland by John Mayer is a remarkable pop-rock song that has the singer celebrating the form of his romantic interests body without resorting to put-downs and instead praising what he likes about her form (even if it is based on physical appearance). Regardless, I admit that Your Body Is A Wonderland by John Mayer is a catchy love song.","summary":"For An Adult Romantic Playlist","unixReviewTime":1451779200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Luther Ingram was an R&B singer\/songwriter from Jackson, TN. Ingram was best known for the early '70s hit \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\".\n\nIngram made his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed with KoKo Records in the late 1960's. His first hit \"My Honey And Me\" peaked at #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts, even though Koko was only a small label, owned by his manager and record producer, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.\n\n\"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right\" is a song written by Stax Records songwriters Homer Banks, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson and first released by Bobby \"Blue\" Bland. The song is about an adulterous love affair, told from the point of view of either the mistress or the cheating spouse, depending on the gender of the performer. Luther Ingram recorded his version of the tune in 1972. It would become a Top Ten smash peaking at #3 in August of that year. This is the original hit recording.","summary":"One of the finest soul singles issued in the decade of the 1970's.","unixReviewTime":1472083200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It is a sound and a song once heard you can never forget or drive from your soul.

Three stars means I like the song.  I appreciate hearing it every time it plays on my jukebox.  There are songs I rate more highly, and I save four and five stars for those (only 8 songs in my entire collection rate 5 stars)\n\n\"Blue Morning, Blue Day\" is in my opinion, the second best track on Foreigner's \"Double Vision\" album. (second only to the title track and better than the more popular \"Hot Blooded\".)  Like much of Foreigner's early work, it is powered by memorable guitar riffs combined with strong pop hooks.  Lou Gramm and Mick Jones were songwriters, unlike many of their more album-oriented contemporaries.  This has always caused them some undeserved disrepute in a album-oriented rock\/progressive art rock community.  In an era dominated by disco, Foreigner was one of the few rock acts that managed to make it onto the pop charts.\n\nIf you were a rock fan living in the late 1970s, this song definitely belongs in your collection.  If you are too young to have remembered that era, the two more recent bands I consider to be most like Foreigner are Matchbox Twenty and Toad the Wet Sprocket with maybe a little bit of similarity to the Foo Fighters.","summary":"Good Early Foreigner.","unixReviewTime":1389225600,"vote":null,"image":null}

My Zenith clock radio with its glowing numbers would be the only light in my bedroom, and I would imagine all sorts of ghosts lurking in the corners or hanging around outside among the trees. A truly haunting, lonely piece of music.\n\nIt starts off quietly, with a flute and some strings and light glockenspiel or something. Then the gently strummed acoustic guitar and drums come in, followed by Justin Hayward's mournful vocals. An eerie mellotron enters the mix at 0:42. I love the mellotron, but wow, what a creepy sound. At 1:06 we get our first dose of the crying angel voices, time to grab my pillow and stick my head under the covers. Imagine Scrooge hearing those at the stroke of midnight. Yikes!\n\nAnother pass through verse and chorus and crying angels, then at 2:18 a big smack of the drum and we head into a gloomy flute solo, accompanied by acoustic guitar and more sad mellotron.\n\nThe night passes on, the moon drifts in the sky, the stars twinkle, clouds pass by, but the narrator does not sleep. He is suffering through the night, having many 'what does it all mean' thoughts: just what the truth is, I can't say anymore. The orchestra cranks it up at 3:50, the crying angels continue to torment us. At 4:35 the orchestra surrounds us with a wall of strings and horns as the narrator rolls around in bed, unable to shake free of doom and madness. At 4:57 we are allowed a brief moment of peace before it all shatters at 5:20 in piercing strings and alarmed horns. It is all too much, and the narrator soon loses consciousness.\n\nAt 5:38 he enters a dream state. There is a brief instant of silence, then the voice of Mike Pinder startles us at 5:54 with the spoken 'Late Lament': Breathe deep, the gathering gloom, watch lights fade from every room...this part would freak me out to no end. I love to imitate the British accent: cold hearted orb that rules the night. After this section, the strings and horns ascend to rage against the impending dawn, making one final stab at 7:00. The final gong at 7:07 signifies the appearance of the sun, and the long scary night is thankfully over.","summary":"NOV 19","unixReviewTime":1498176000,"vote":null,"image":null}

I know she released her sophomore album, but it doesn't shine like this one. In my opinion, \"Your Woman\" is probably one of the most underrated, underplayed soul albums of all time. Sunshine outdid herself on this one! Have you listened to the whole cd? Great promotion was given to the track \"Heard It All Before\". That was a serious club anthem for a quick minute, but there was a lot more on this project, a lot of funk and grooves hidden between the verses. I for one continue to rock this album as even the skits are worthy of note. Sunshine would do well to pair up with these producers again and hit us with another solid album. She's too talented to not be at the forefront of the soul scene. I predict she'll be back and will deliver with the zest she's capable of.\n\nDJ Come of Age","summary":"Soulful Masterpiece..one of the most underrated albums ever!","unixReviewTime":1237334400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Hill","reviewText":"As much as I wish Max could have patched things up with his former bandmates and rejoined Sepultura long ago, I've been a fan of Soulfly since this first release.  I always hear it getting ripped on by metal fans for having a prominent nu-metal influence, or fans just dismissing it altogether as nu-metal garbage.  Going back and listening to it today, I think that's a weak criticism.  Just like the Nailbomb album, the first Soulfly has tons of super-heavy riffs that sound like a natural continuation of Sepultura's output, in this case following \"Chaos A.D.\" and \"Roots.\"  The focus is firmly on groove, but with moments of raw, hardcore speed.  Max upped the international element from \"Roots,\" with quite a few songs focused on tribal themes, using unique instruments and guest artists to create a truly distinctive style.  And yes, some hip-hop presents itself sparingly, including an unfortunate collaboration on \"Bleed\" with Fred \"The Turd\" Durst, but the track, which is a revenge song against the killers of Max's stepson, is actually one of my favorites aside from Durst's rap verse.  Even though choices like this might have showed too much emphasis on the flavor of the day, Max showed his yearning for greater musical diversity by incorporating more world music elements than on \"Roots.\"  If you're not already familiar with the album, some of the classics are \"Eye for an Eye,\" \"No Hope=No Fear,\" \"Tribe,\" and \"Prejudice,\" just to name a few highlights.  He created his own form of Brazilian Metal and, on this first release especially, really bared his soul to the world.  The self-titled Soulfy is a fantastic album that any fan of Max's work with Sepultura ought to have.","summary":"Max Starts a New Chapter","unixReviewTime":1381881600,"vote":null,"image":null}

For newcomer Jazmine Sulluvan, she has had a lot she had to prove not only because there have been very few dominant R&B acts, but she had to make her voice and style her own. Her latest single Lions, Tigers & Bears, the third single from her debut album Fearless brings in a very simple and elequent melody to her song, by the orchestrations in the background. The song isn't a bad song at all, but I honestly was expecting a little more from her voice. To be honest with you, the song is at least better than the recent ones Beyonce' has made like Halo and the lagging Diva. Hopefully, Jazmine can bring out something to perform next time that is more than just the big top.\n\nSong: C+","summary":"Circus Act","unixReviewTime":1237161600,"vote":null,"image":null}

For a period that spanned roughly half a decade (1958-1964) folk music emerged from the coffee houses and college campuses of this nation and became an integral part of the mainstream music scene. Some of this music was quite intense but most of the songs that made it to the airwaves were light and upbeat. The Rooftop Singers were a folk group from New York City led by Erik Darling. Darling had been a member of The Tarriers (\"Cindy, Oh Cindy\" and \"The Banana Boat Song\") in 1956 and later on sang with The Weavers for a few years. In early 1963 the folk label Vanguard released the single \"Walk Right In\" which was a very fine folk update of a 1929 country blues song written by musician Gus Cannon and originally recorded by Cannon's Jug Stompers. The song turned out to be one of the biggest hits of the folk era spending a couple of weeks high atop the Billboard Hot 100. Over the years \"Walk Right In\" has been recorded by dozens of artists across a number of genres. The Rooftop Singers' version appears on the soundtrack of the Tom Hanks film \"Forrest Gump\".  This is the original recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"Among the biggest hits of the folk era.","unixReviewTime":1469664000,"vote":null,"image":null}

While Stickwitu wasn't so bad, it has really been awhile since they've tried to take that turn with their music. But, unfortunately, their latest ballad, I Hate This Part, the second single from their sophmore album, Doll Domination, doesn't seem to hit the nail on the head. I really felt the melody, but the lyrics itself were really a turnoff. It just didn't seem to click when it came to the mends of a breakup, the dolls knew what they were singing. They needs to do better ballads, but they also need better singles. The next single from Doll Domination should be better than this.\n\nSong: D","summary":"Hate This Part, Don't Like This Song","unixReviewTime":1226102400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Bobby formed a group called The Shadows with his brother and a friend in 1959.  After Buddy Holly's death in a plane crash on 2\/3\/59 (a\/k\/a \"The Day The Music Died\") it was The Shadows who filled in on Buddy's next scheduled show in Fargo. On Bobby's debut single later on in 1959 the artist was listed as Bobby Vee and the Shadows. All future releases listed Bobby Vee as a solo act.  During the first half of the 1960's singles by Bobby Vee were a fixture on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts and on Top 40 radio.  Who can forget pop classics like \"The Night Has A Thousand Eyes\", \"Run To Him\", \"Rubber Ball\" and \"Take Good Care of My Baby\" to name but a few.  With the emergence of the British Invasion Bobby Vee's popularity would wane in the mid 1960's.  Then in 1967 Bobby Vee would make one final splash on the pop charts with his comeback hit \"Come Back When You Grow Up\".  The song would spend an impressive 16 weeks on the charts and peak at #3 in September of 1967.

Three of the founding members, Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore and Ronald White had been singing together since they each were around the age of eleven. The group, influenced by acts such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and Nolan Strong & the Diablos, featured Clarence Dawson and James Grice in the original lineup.

Three of the founding members, Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore and Ronald White had been singing together since they each were around the age of eleven. The group, influenced by acts such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and Nolan Strong & the Diablos, featured Clarence Dawson and James Grice in the original lineup. A chance meeting with with record producer Berry Gordy Jr. in 1957 would ultimately lead to a contract with Motown records.

During that decade The Miracles would amass an impressive total of 24 Top 40 hits. In June 1967, shortly after Motown changed the name of the group to Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, Tamla records released \"More Love\". Here was yet another gorgeous ballad from the pen of Smokey Robinson.

Greedy record label owners and executives would conspire to cheat artists out of the royalties they were entitled to. Not surprisingly during this period many black artists were victimized by this practice at labels like Herman Lubinsky's Savoy records in New Jersey and Syd Nathan's King records in Cincinnati. In the late 1950's, Berry Gordy Jr. had been bouncing around the record business trying to find his niche. Although he had written a couple of hits for Jackie Wilson Gordy quickly discovered that songwriting was really not all that lucrative. Berry Gordy Jr. had much bigger ambitions. He looked at the musical landscape in America and determined that there was a boatload of money to be made marketing black music to affluent white teenagers. And so with several hundred dollars of borrowed money Gordy founded Motown Records in Detroit. The year was 1960. He dubbed his modest recording studios in an old house in the Detroit suburbs \"Hitsville, USA\". Now there was a ton of talent in Detroit in those days and Berry Gordy was very adroit at recognizing it and getting these artists to sign with Motown.\n\nOne of the first acts signed by Berry Gordy Jr. was an R&B group from Detroit that called themselves The Miracles. Led by the gifted song writer and dynamic vocalist Smokey Robinson The Miracles would become one of Motown's most consistent hit makers. In December 1960 Motown released \"Shop Around\" on it's Tamla label. The song was an immediate success spending 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #2. It was also the label's first #1 hit on the R&B chart. This is the original hit single you would remember from the radio.","summary":"A memorable and historic recording.","unixReviewTime":1473206400,"vote":null,"image":null}

It most certainly was. A young Detroit entrepreneur named Berry Gordy Jr. decided that he was going to start his own record company. His idea was a simple one really. He was going to make records with black artists that appealed to the largest segment of the record buying public which in those days was suburban white teenagers. His formula worked to perfection.\n\nAmong the first artists signed to Gordy's fledgling Motown label was a 17 year old R&B singer from Detroit named Mary Wells. Hearing about this exciting new enterprise Wells approached Berry Gordy Jr. with a tune she had written for Jackie Wilson called \"Bye Bye Baby: Gordy was duly impressed and immediately signed her to Motown. Within just a year she had her first charted single.\n\nIn July 1962 Motown released \"You Beat Me to the Punch\". The song would become Mary's second Top Ten hit peaking at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart. Looking back, Mary Wells really was Motown's very first star performer. Nice tune!","summary":"Berry Gordy Jr. found a star in his own back yard.","unixReviewTime":1477353600,"vote":null,"image":null}

I was also fortunate in being able to hear them live at a concert arena affiliated with George Mason University (back around April 2011) because they were opening for 30 Seconds To Mars. This catchy hard rock song appears to be about a female who captures the interest of the singer, but seems to be juggling romantic affairs with two different men at a time. I admit that I tried to catch the meaning of the song through the video, but became even more unsure of the meaning. Nonetheless, Feel Good Drag by Anberlin is good for those who are open to hearing hard rock songs that capture the complexities\/highs and lows of love triangles.","summary":"A Rock Narrative Of A Complicated Love Affair?","unixReviewTime":1410307200,"vote":null,"image":null}

During the 1970's Wilder was one-half of the Greenwich Village folk group Matthew & Peter.  Then in 1978 he made the move to Los Angeles to follow his dream. Wilder found work as a backing vocalist for both Rickie Lee Jones and Bette Midler. Towards the end of 1983 Wilder released his debut album \"I Don't Speak the Language\".  The first single from that album was that bouncy little number \"Break My Stride\".  The song was a Top 10 hit not only in America but also in the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Germany, New Zealand, Austria, Sweden, Belgium and Denmark.  It is always a joy to hear this extremely uplifting tune!","summary":"One of my favorite pop hits of the 1980's","unixReviewTime":1473811200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Jim achieved his success the old fashioned way.  During the day he drove a truck and swung a hammer to support his young family and at night he played his music at bars and clubs all over Philly.  His first three singles all made the national Top 40 and in then in the spring of 1973 his 4th release \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\" would become his first #1 hit.  It appeared for all the world that Jim Croce was going to be a fixture on the American music scene for a very long time.  Here was an artist that the average Joe could relate to and root for.\n\nThen on September 20, 1973 tragedy struck.  Jim Croce was killed in a plane crash in Natchitoches, LA.  He was just 30 years old.  Jim Croce had a backlog of unreleased material in the can and his label ABC continued to release a new single every few months.  His final Top Ten hit was released in February of 1974.  While I loved all of his singles I think \"I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song\" is my favorite.  The song spent 14 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart peaking at #9.  This is the original hit single recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"One wonders what might have been..........","unixReviewTime":1483401600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Led by lead singer Anthony Gourdine the group would make some of the most memorable R&B singles of the early 1960s.\n\n\"Hurt So Bad\" is a song written by Teddy Randazzo, Bobby Weinstein, and Bobby Hart. The song was written specifically for Little Anthony. Over the decades it has been recorded by dozens of artists including Linda Ronstadt, The Lettermen and Jackie DeShannon. Most would agree that the definitive version of this tune was recorded by Little Anthony and The Imperials. Released in January 1965 \"Hurt So Bad\" would become a Top Ten hit. The song was performed by the group on their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. I think we can all relate when Little Anthony cries out Like needles and pins people say \"you've been making out okay.

But that honestly has been said very, very few times in the world. That definitively has been with said with Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, Rod Stewart's rendition of Tom Waits classic Downtown Train, and Joe Cocker's cover of The Beatles classic With A Little Help From My Friends. But that also can be said about Simply Red. They have had some cover songs that really have been enjoyable from the cover of The Stylistics classic You Make Me Feel Brand New, but their definitive staple is the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes classic If You Don't Know Me By Now, which is one of the most guiltiest pleasure songs I have ever enjoyed. The song really is the catalyst of their success in America since the 1980's and beyond. It is one off those romantic songs that has been sincerely timeless. I have never stopped getting tired of the Mick Hucknall & company ballad, and if you had never heard a Simply Red song, than this is the standard to download.\n\nSong: A","summary":"If You Don't Know Them By Now","unixReviewTime":1459641600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It found its way into summer camps everywhere and its notes could be heard around campfires. It found its relevance when it became the theme song of the Billy Jack series of movies in the early seventies. For those of you not familiar with it, Billy Jack was a renegade hero of the marginalized Indians (now Native Americans) on reservations. Billy Jack defended them against the abuse of racist local officials. Billy Jack is in the dustbins of cinema history but One Tin Soldier continues to call  humanity to task for placing greed ahead of people.

Nothing fancy here, just him finally closing the chapter on that soulful psychedelic rock sound that's been such a mainstay in his music for much of his career in proper fashion. The production is what impresses me on this one, though. I get the feeling Adam Johns (R.I.P.) was one of his biggest influences in that particular area. That thick drum snap, that deep-bottom bass, and that noticeable crunch of those guitar riffs can make even the most longtime classic rock fan smile with glee at what Lenny was able to accomplish here. Ballads are also noteworthy, with the one dedicated to his late father (Sy Kravitz) being extremely poignant. They also balance out the rockier tracks quite nicely. 4-stars is about right since I'm rating this album against the rest of his back catalog and it's one rating Lenny has definitely earned at that point in time. I almost wrote him off as washed-up after putting out that hot misguided mess known as 'Baptism' four years prior to this release, but I'm so darn relieved he did an about-face just in the nick of time. 'It's Time For A Love Revolution' in hindsight could be seen as an unofficial prelude to Lenny's third leg of his ongoing music career which has seen him peak yet again on the following albums 'Black and White America' and 'Strut' (another personal fave of mine). Most artists, especially in rock, don't usually stay relevant once they enter middle age. Count Lenny as one of the few exceptions to that rule!","summary":"Strong \"comeback\" effort from Lenny.

Common sense would tell you that since the other pieces included in this accompaniment backing track practice mp3 are tuned to a 443Hz, you just might want to tune also to the same 443Hz frequency or else you will find yourself playing along with the track out of tune. The pitch is provided FREE with the rest of the mp3 so that you can first tune your instrument properly then practice \"playing in tune\" with the provided backing accompaniment. I'm a classical bassist and often play transcribed violin and cello music. If you can't hear the difference between concert pitch 440Hz tuning and a concert pitch 443Hz tuning note, then you're most likely always playing out of tune with your ensemble and accompaniment. A lot of European orchestras\/symphonies tune to a concert pitch 442 or 443Hz and not the standard ISO American 440Hz. Even some American orchestras\/symphonies are following suit as the 443Hz has been found to be a more natural resonance than the established 440Hz. There is much debate on which frequency to use but best practice is that whichever frequency is provided, this is what you should tune to.","summary":"If a free tuning pitch is provided- common sense tells you the provided pieces are also at the same tuning pitch- TUNE TO IT!","unixReviewTime":1442620800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers who has been so severely overplayed, that her own voice has passed away in the process. Her music used to be popular, but now it has just became annoying. Her own work used to be popular in the 2000 decade when she released songs like Single Ladies and Crazy In Love. But honestly, the songs do not ignite, even when she made herself overflooded. Ego has been one of those songs that lags spirit, soul and voice badly. Beyonce' Knowles does not even come close from the heart. It feels more jaded, than any of the songs she did when she was a part of Destiny's Child. I think because Beyonce' Knowles has made so many bad and poorly made songs, that it is just time for her to retire.\n\nSong: F+","summary":"Ego-Trippped","unixReviewTime":1438992000,"vote":null,"image":null}

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","summary":"Fantastic!","unixReviewTime":1452211200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Not just because the songs are great, but the musician has definitely still shown that they have a everlasting appeal. Rod Stewart has absolutely shown that, making great songs for nearly 50 years, and has honestly been one of the most dynamic singers of all time. He has honestly had some of the best songs, as a great singer and a brilliant and sincere writer. Forever Young, has absolutely been one of those songs that still today has shown sincerity and staying power, with a powerful and intimate message to the young. I still love this song because of the simplicity of Rod's voice, and it still remains a one-of-a-kind style.

While she hasn't been able to score that wide-appeal with all the problems she had gone through. While she has had some appeal, the songs aren't really there hand in heart. That honestly has been proof with Radar, the 4th single from Circus. I thought that the song was very weak, and not really filled with the strength that she used to have. I really was honestly not that impressed with the whole album, and this was one of those songs that to me felt like a big, fat snoozer. She needs to try and appeal to a more broader audience, than staying in that same zone she was trying to recapture.

Grindle","reviewText":"As far as I could gather,Brandy Norwood was pretty much MIA following marriage and childbirth. Didn't blame her at all. Family,a living letter to the next generation,has to be the priority to my own way of thinking. At the same time? It was still an enormous surprise when during the winter of 2008 I heard the news that Brandy was releasing her first album in five years. She was an artist who had always maintained a strong connection to her roots and love of the popular musical continuum of black American artists. Considering the uncomfortable level of female solo artists attempting to follow in the footsteps of artists such as Mary J. Blige, Aaliyah and Brandy here? I really didn't know what to expect from this album. Wasn't sure then even what exactly I thought about the album. Time and that ever important second listen helped to make my mind up on this.\n\n  In the most basic terms? The bulk of this album is sliced up into three main musical categories. Following a spoken intro \"The Definition\",\"Warm It Up (With Love)\" and \"Right Here (Departed)\" are all piano drive uptempo numbers with fast paced Brazilian style marches played out on revered mid 80's style gated drum machines. The center of the album contains two rhythm guitar led pop oriented numbers in \"Camouflage\" and \"Torn Down\". \"Long Distance\",the title song,\"True\" and the closer \"Fall\" each connect with the piano driven gospel ballad back-round of Rodney Jerkins and Brandy gives them her all with her vocal punches.  A number of songs stand out on their own however. \"Piano Man\" finds the orchestral synthesizers playing a totally percussive roll while \"Shattered Love\" has a reverbed country\/surf bass line on it's mid-tempo groove. \"A Capella (Something's Missing)\" finds Brandy singing beautifully with an orchestra of her own vocal harmonies to the tune of a light fuzz guitar while \"1st & Love\" brings the clap powered hand jive into the 2000's era of soul music production.\n\n  Brandy declares at the start of this album that being human means the power to be herself. When I first listened to this album? I felt that she had totally abandoned the heavy funky and soul roots inherent in her sound previous to this for an ultra glossy and rather ordinary pop oriented sound. Listening to this album nearly eight years after it's original release? It became clear that only a couple of songs on this album really fit into that category. What this album ends up doing is entirely eschewing the hip-hop oriented production values of some of her 90's albums. This goes more for gospel\/soul based dance music and ballads that heavier funk. Yet it also references very early aspects of black American music that find Jerkins producing Brandy's voice and body as the main musical instrument. Each of Brandy's albums have had a distinctly different flavor about them. That's one of the qualities I appreciate about her artistry. This one actually may be one of those albums that takes a little getting used to. But peel back the layers of the music and your own preconceptions? You will probably find very compelling music here.","summary":"Brandy Seeks Out The Freedom To Be Herself","unixReviewTime":1423785600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Some of the pictures are close up (like flowers) and you don't know what you are looking at until the editor zooms the picture out a bit. That made this a bit mysterious at times.\n\nWhat you will find is relaxing scenes in nature (lakes and forests), flowers, dolphins (lots), giraffes, cats, butterflies, seagulls, dogs, seals, exotic orchids, horses, deer, people walking on a beach, roses, teddy bears and more.\n\nI'd suggest this for married women with children as themes of childcare and love of a husband are prominent in some songs.\n\nWhile the songs are non religious the dedication is to many religions. So I'd say the artist is possibly New Age. Her song \"Save the World\" does however not say how we can save the world but just repeats the words \"save the world\" over and over again. Maybe a call to action.\n\n~The Rebecca Review","summary":"Enya Like Songs","unixReviewTime":1488844800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Olsen \/ Review Publicist","reviewText":"Never in the history of our world has there been a time for greater concern and action needed over energy, environmental, and social issues, that lie before us at present.  Our most recent 40th anniversary Earth Day held on April 22, 2009 had an estimated 1 billion participants worldwide, an astounding number when compared to the 20,000 million people first participating in 1969. The annual event is held each year to demonstrate what each of us as individuals can accomplish together in unity, while still retaining the core existence by relying solely on the power of one.\n\nCadence Spalding is one person doing their part as role model for bringing about a greater awareness of these concerns by her Save The World 2009 album release on the Sound Manipulations and JSA music label. The 11 tracks pertain to the noblest of desires in conveying her message of what one person alone can accomplish by caring for mother earth, caring for those who cannot help themselves, and by caring for one another as a family unit.\n\nCelebrity New Age musician Mars Lasar is also doing his part by co producing this themed album. His technological production talents and artistic skill in layering and mixing hold the key elements that enable Cadence to excel in the music she has primarily written and presented by her own hand. While having previously performed on Mars' albums, this first solo release certifies her individual talents worthy indeed, bearing fruit for this winning team who also happen to be husband and wife.\n\nSave The World is classical New Age pop, hosting a pleasant mix of ballads finely tuned to perfection in the purest sense. Classical touches of soft angelic vocals appears as lullabies at times, gently rocking you into a contented state, while anthem stanzas increase in momentum, rising above to greet the occasion. The harmonious choral effects arranged by layering passionate vocals offers her message of love, peace, and harmony to all who share the same logic, devotion, and mindful perspective.\n\nTrust In Love is one musical anthem sent as a deep heartfelt narrative of the glorious possibilities for peace and love that await every boy and girl, if only we would just let it be a reality. This soulful song is rich in vocal tone combined with personal statement through meaningful lyrics. The piano phrased beat is surrounded by a deep percussion rhythm like persons marching lock step in tandem, proposing that we trust in love and give peace a chance.\n\nSave The World title song offers an upbeat instrumental expression of the bountiful rewards we receive when we let our conscience be our guide and do our part.  This repeated message if framed by a pounding drum beat, while piano and guitar instrumentals ring out a clear tone during moments of pause between vocals.\n\nThis CD album also includes a bonus DVD which is really a treasure in itself. This professionally captured, artistic photo gallery DVD produced by Mars, is extraordinary in visual effect while highlighting the serene music of Candace. The magnificent colorful photos are dedicated to vivid landscapes, wildlife subjects, and touching scenes capturing people in everyday life.  This CD \/ DVD collector's edition is a beautiful performance and powerful statement, shared with the world after this initial spark of talented inspiration was ignited solely from the power of one.","summary":"Review from NewAgeMusicWorld.

Flaring polyphony vocals, strong celtic flavor - all these are present in the project \"Save the World\". But no doubt Cadence Spalding has her unique style which stirs the soul while listening to this truly outstanding work. But what features make the album \"Save the World\" so particular?\n\nThe first reason is that great love is splashed out with Cadence Spalding's delicate singing. You just float in the aerial harmonies of her enchanting vocals. She is very close to you, so it seems you can simply stretch your hand and gently touch her. And your heart begins to pulse in unison with this divine music.\n\nSecondly I want to point out the perfect sound of the album \"Save the World\". And this is not accidental because this CD\/DVD was produced by Mars Lasar whose firm handwriting is impossible to confuse with anything. The images on the DVD are delightful.\n\nThe album \"Save the World\" should be listened to as a single whole. But my particular choice are the compositions in which Cadence Spalding's voice are fully intertwined with refined, very smooth and at the same time slightly jazzy Mars Lasar's sound. I'd like to mention the songs \"I Do\" and \"Share Your Life\" in this connection. In addition to that Mars Lasar masterfully interweaves ethnic motives and adds strong rhythmic pattern to his music.\n\nOne wants to say many praising words about the album \"Save the World\". This is music for future people who won't be divided by any borders and barriers. This is the voice of a united world.\n\nWhat more can be said? \"Save the World\" is a bright debut and it must be continued.\n\nSerge Kozlovsky\n[...]","summary":"Writings by Serge Kozlovsky","unixReviewTime":1277164800,"vote":null,"image":null}

As with the CD, the themes of the DVD are the power of love, peace, and the need to care for Earth and the voiceless creatures that need our protection. Cadence's sincerity is palpable as is her deep emotional connection to the music and its message. Comparisons to Enya and 2002 are inevitable, but Cadence definitely has her own voice and vision.\n\nThe DVD contains all of the music from the CD paired with breathtaking double micro digital photographs by Mars Lasar of flowers, seascapes, the CA wine country, animals, children, and landscapes. The music is very effective alone, but the pairing with the photography provides a powerful sensory experience.\n\nThe first of the eleven tracks is \"Trust In Love,\" a simple melody that carries a message of love on a global as well as a personal level. The ethereal vocals have minimal accompaniment, but the sound is rich and lush. The title track is more instrumental (including Cadence's voice), with the words \"Save The World\" repeated throughout. \"Grandma's Song\" celebrates family love and a special bond between a young girl and her grandmother - a favorite! \"I Do,\" \"Here To Love You,\" and \"My Man\" are love songs, pure and simple, made heavenly by layers of voices, piano, and keyboards. I also really like \"Share Your Life,\" which also appears in a remixed version. The words tell us to open our lives and hearts to others to begin the global healing process and to make a difference in the world - beautiful in every way. \"Hosanna\" just sort of floats on the air, creating a mood of peaceful contentment. \"Kyrie Eleison\" (Greek for \"Lord have mercy\") is a mother's gentle, loving prayer for her young son. It seems to trail off at the end, but then returns after a period of silence, complete with bagpipes, to act as a grand finale of sorts.","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1235174400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Case in point: in 1983 Linda Ronstadt was generally considered to be the leading female vocalist of the Rock Era. You can imagine the head scratching by her producer and her legions of fans when she boldly announced that she would be recording an album of standards with the legendary arranger and bandleader Nelson Riddle. It all began a year earlier when Linda called Riddle and asked him if he would consider arranging one song for her upcoming album. Rather, Riddle suggested that he do the entire album himself and thus \"What's New\" was conceived. Evidently Linda Ronstadt knew what she was doing because \"What's New\" sold more than two million copies and spent an impressive 81 weeks on Billboard's Album chart. In my view her recording of this 1939 standard from the Great American Songbook is the best thing she ever did.

The group was formed in Brooklyn, NY in 1957 and was originally known as The Chesters. Just a year or so later they changed their name to The Imperials and ultimately to Little Anthony and the Imperials. Led by lead singer Anthony Gourdine the group would make some of the most memorable R&B singles of the early 1960s.\n\n\"Hurt So Bad\" is a song written by Teddy Randazzo, Bobby Weinstein, and Bobby Hart. The song was written specifically for Little Anthony. Over the decades it has been recorded by dozens of artists including Linda Ronstadt, The Lettermen and Jackie DeShannon. Most would agree that the definitive version of this tune was recorded by Little Anthony and The Imperials. Released in January 1965 \"Hurt So Bad\" would become a Top Ten hit. The song was performed by the group on their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. I think we can all relate when Little Anthony cries out Like needles and pins people say \"you've been making out okay. She's in love don't stand in her way\"  There is pain oozing from every syllable in Anthonys mesmerizing vocal performance. One of the best soul records of the 1960's.","summary":"You can feel the pain in every syllable of Little Anthony's mesmerizing vocal.","unixReviewTime":1472688000,"vote":null,"image":null}

She loved music, and exposed me to all kinds. I know every word to every song that ever was from her days in the 30's and 40's to present. She would rock me and sing to me until she lost her voice almost every day when I was a little girl. I titled her gift, \"Thank You For The Music Mom\" and THIS was the last song I added. She is gone now, and not a day goes by I don't want to pick up the phone for a nice long chat and lots of laughter.  I will always love and miss Mom and Dad.  They were a VERY special couple: wonderful parents, great friends,  funny, charming, popular, just plain great people and I thank them BOTH for the music, \"...for giving it to me\". Daddy played piano by ear, and so do I. I ask Echo to play it for me when I am missing them more than I think I can handle sometimes. And it always makes me feel just a little better because I know they know I'm OK.\nLOVE YOU MOM AND DAD!

That practiced discipline represents both one of the greatest strengths and the direst weaknesses of Glazunov's writing; it is extraordinarily easy listening, carefree and predictable, but that rigor becomes tiresome after a while and the works run together.  Thus, while the recordings, price, and selection of pieces represents a spectacular deal, I really cannot give his symphonies full marks.","summary":"A Good Listen","unixReviewTime":1357257600,"vote":"3","image":null}

Entwistle is said to have written it after an evening of drinking with Bill Wyman who was the bass player for the Rolling Stones. It is a comical story about a spider walking across a room who then ends up with an unfortunate fate. I won't spoil it here. Not surprisingly for a bass player composition, it has fine Bass notes and the guitar stays in the basement note-wise (Yeah, yeah, I know that bass player Paul McCartney is quite diverse in his writing). Entwistle's gravelly bass vocals greatly add to the impact of the song. Because this song is both fun and unusual, it should be included in any comprehensive Rock N' Roll collection.","summary":"Get Caught In A Web Of Great Music","unixReviewTime":1499212800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Each of us were captured during those youthful times by the energy of Jack Bruce's driving bass and vocals. Clapton's guitar and the Baker's rhythmic inspirations completed the sonic picture.\n\nThe bottom line is after listening to or playing \"I'm So Glad\" we did feel more glad. Jack Bruce was very present and driving in all of Cream's music, but this is one of those where his bass and vocal talent shine through more brightly.\n\nI've been a fan of Jack Bruce since those days with Cream in the 60's. \"I'm So Glad\" is the song that really brought him to my attention for the first time.

Then I realized that I don't have any of those long blues rock jams that they were famous for. Wheels Of Fire seemed like a good prospect to get the long live version of Spoonful, but I already had all of the other good songs. I kept looking and this very good compilation has all of Strange Brew and some more studio cuts on the first disc, with the second disc being all live to include the long version of Spoonful from Wheels Of Fire. The second live disc alone is worth the price of purchase. As for some of the studio cuts on the first disc that one never hears on the radio, well there is a good reason for that. These cuts only show how experimental this group got to be and that they also considered themselves to be a psychedelic band just as much as a blues rock jam band. It is a shame that they only lasted for a couple of years. It is hard to believe that these recordings are almost 50 years old.","summary":"A Very Good Cream Compilation","unixReviewTime":1498608000,"vote":null,"image":null}

As a singer who's taken the opportunity to perform in works such as the musical film 'Dreamgirls', his interests include neo-soul styles as well as club-focused hip-hop and even a bit of new jack swing. This album doesn't just bring him together with collaborators such as Kanye West and T.I., though, but frequently buries his talented voice with a lot of slick production.\n\nFoxx's scattershot approach could've made for a well-rounded album, but it feels more like a mixed bag than anything. Some tracks have a particular appeal to them while others seem more average than anything. \"Blame It\" became a major radio hit at the time of release, although as a pop rap single it's nothing special. Foxx's vocal abilities shine far better in songs such as the Boyz II Men style emotional ballads \"Rainman\" and \"Why\", the two of which alone make the album worth picking up.","summary":"Somewhat of a Mixed Bag Yet Having Some High Points","unixReviewTime":1525392000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It was surely the right choice because Manhattan Transfer continues to perform to this day their unique blend of bebop, fusion jazz, pop and doowop to enthusiastic audiences all over the world.\n\nThough not primarily a singles group Manhattan Transfer did have a handful of hits the biggest of which was \"The Boy From New York City\". This fabulous remake of the 1964 hit by The Ad Libs peaked at #7 nationally in the summer of 1981. Furthermore, Manhattan Transfer snagged a Grammy for the \"Best Pop Vocal Group\" of 1981.

A musician must live in a habitat thats special and desired until theres an end, so sounds follow with his or her pursuits.  Its True that instruments play in part because of Earths weather, although Id have to consider musicians with their daily routines as well as their vacations.  Musicians rest and play so well, since goals are a matter of proclamations and livelihood, and slogans can be collections of memes like Walk Of Life that contain pressure from so many artist feelings.  While its True that a feeling can be a bad association of ideas, thinking is not everything.  Dire Straits vague perceptions are interesting and stimulate our imagination about beats in relation to cultural clues over golden oldies and turning all the night time into the day.  Im not sure if all the keys can be revolved around a single layer of music as they can several layers of music; the song itself is an interpretation of decades of music, so sounds themselves can become great memes if they're continuously passed down by musicians and listeners.  Walk Of Life is open for interpretation because the 20th century of music was lived for by millions of musicians and listeners, and thus art is more like a proclamation of life rather than its exact description.  If some Amazon reviewers give this song four stars and think that two and two make four, Id tell them that mathematics is collections of memes like songs and that cultures just have to begin somewhere.  Just Dire Straits place in history can be like time itself, and the layers of music from Walk Of Life nourish out of their creative nature to shake up the boundless definitions of music until our ears drip with the healthy, vivid tunes.  The songs layers of music are definitely not built up like a planet so much as a dream, and they're constantly serving up Dire Straits cognizance of music society when they're refining the beats to suit their individual perfection of song estimates.  A singers woo is an abstraction of typical animal roars, so memes about dedication and devotion can be special abstractions rather than just mere acceptances.  Due to this observation, poetry must be at least one abstraction.  Mark Knopfler really digs Johnny!  Its probably confusing to talk about feelings apart from descriptions for the same reason that a musician is often feeling after given descriptions.  Walk Of Life is designed with magnificent echoes, at least metaphorically, and the vague sound levels ramp up on the songs own composition as though they slightly stick to hard substances such as the loudest voices and the gluey arrangement of cultural memes.  Of course, listeners can stipulate what kind of progress lives with a song if they actually describe in their heads the emotions possible and impossible before going on to feel it.  Dire Straits is a present of golden thunder which rocks the sparks after settling down slightly with the peaceful storms, and Walk Of Life is a popular example of theories in practice from creativity.","summary":"Music Rush Going Winds","unixReviewTime":1464998400,"vote":null,"image":null}

He signed Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield to his Philles label in the autumn of 1964 and immediately set about to create a new and distinctive sound for the boys. Their debut single on Philles was \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin\" and it shot right to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart in early 1965. Over the next year Spector would produce three more Top Ten hits for The Righteous Brothers before the duo decided to leave Philles and signed a new record deal with Verve. That may have been a mistake because Phil Spector obviously knew what he was doing and despite a #1 song \"(You're My) Soul and Inspiration\" The Righteous Brothers were never able to attain the same level of success at their new record label that they had at Philles. \"Lovin Feelin\" has been recognized by both the Grammy Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as one of the most important songs in the history of rock & roll.  One of the greatest singles of the decade.","summary":"The original hit recording from 1965.","unixReviewTime":1470528000,"vote":null,"image":null}

That definitely is the case with Patty Smyth. It has been hard for her to have a song played after her work in the 80's with Scandal. But did have that taste of fame and song with her collaboration with the great Don Henley of The Eagles with Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough fro Patty's self-titled debut. The song is one of those guilty pleasure songs that I still enjoy listening to heart and soul, that still ignites with sadness and heart. It is just a shame though that Patty has never been able to try and make another song ignite after that one. Still if you are looking for good duet, this is one to give a listen to.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Love Ain't Enough","unixReviewTime":1376870400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The period from 1978 until 1992 was by far their most successful time. This song was part of their 11th studio album released in 1991. It speaks about the changes in politics after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the USSR regime. The singer Klaus Meine, member of the original line-up, did an outstanding job presenting this power ballad. The song achieved major recognition world wide. It was one of the best selling singles of all times. It was the best selling single performed by a German artist. It peaked at #4 on the US chart in August of 1991. It was not the only power ballad performed by the Scorpions. This song and their other ballads are on the list of my all-time favorites. It is a must have. It is the greatest Heavy Metal Ballad.

That doesn't prevent me from enjoying this song, which is a melancholy but ultimately heartfelt song about asking a loved one to show their love instead of just using empty words.  It's a very simple song in its message, in the instrumentation that consists solely of a single guitar, and in the laid-back and unadorned (and un-auto-tuned) voices of the singers.

The singer and sax player is Rindy Ross, wife of Marv Ross, guitarist. What makes this band different is the fact that the front vocalist also plays the saxophone. Rindy stated at one time that she uses the saxophone as an extension of her voice enabling her to put more feeling and emotion to a given song which her voice alone, in her opinion, would not be able to achieve. The self-titled album was released in the latter part of 1981. Almost a year later it went Platinum, meaning more than a Million copies sold. This song is performed impeccably, very well arranged and executed. It is a True classic of the '80s. I like this song very much. Their other songs are not bad either, but this is the tune that put Quarterflash to a #7 slot in the charts.

Initially composed as a whimsical tune about anthropomorphic muskrats under the name Muskrat Candlelight, it was a minor hit for America before The Captain and Tenille turned it into a huge hit in the 1970's.\n\nNow, decades later, this song is a nostalgic reminder of a more innocent time.  The MP3 version is far clearer than any 45 record or LP album cut from the 1970's, so it's far more enjoyable, especially The Captain's electronic sounds of muskrats kissing and mating.\n\nFor a modern 21st century audience, this song probably won't catch their ear or have the same meaning. It'll come across as though it's a song from a cartoon.  But for anyone who heard this song in the 1970's and just wants a reminder of a different time in life, it's worth the download for the gentle smile and memories it will evoke.","summary":"Nostalgic song, great MP3, but best for those who remember the 70s.","unixReviewTime":1459209600,"vote":null,"image":null}

I noticed that Tommy wasn't on it but pretty much everyone else was. Hey that's cool. They had great records before Tommy joined and I was sure that this one would be up to the usual standards. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. If you look at the photos of the individual band members, you'll notice that it's very much that leather hair band look of the '80's.

It is sock-hop, drive-in, high school dance all rolled into one.\n\nThis was when vocal bass singers really shone, matched by a lead singer, harmonies and lyrics that weren't all that complicated.\n\nBut don't read my review.

They really do bring back so many memories. Memory lane as they say. Some of these songs can really bring you back to a certain times of your life. Often times I remember things that I had long forgotten, or so I thought. It is just great to listen and relax and enjoy these great songs. I grow up with so many of them. I love that I have my music on Amazon, this way I have them every where I go that I can excess my Amazon Music. I do often listen on my laptop when I am travel and staying in hotels. Nice to have some thing familiar with me. I love that I will never ever lose them or scratch them ever again. No more finding the wrong CD in the case either! That really was aggravating.

It moves along with cute and simple pop music as it tells its story but then, all of a sudden, Elvin Bishop unleashes one of the most eloquent interlude guitar solos you ever heard. In 1976, it hit number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The same year it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Lulu was a pop singer and actress who burst onto the British music scene in May of 1964 with a lively cover of the Isley Brothers classic \"Shout\". At that point in her career Lulu was the lead singer of a group called The Luvvers. The record proved to be a substantial hit in the UK peaking at #7 but barely made the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. peaking at #94.\n\nIn 1966 Lulu left the group to pursue a solo career. It was just a year later that Lulu would make her mark both as a singer and as an actress. She appeared in the 1967 film \"To Sir With Love\" alongside Sidney Poitier. She belted out the film's theme song (which had the same title as the movie) in a memorable scene. The song skyrocketed to #1 on the charts in America and stayed there for 5 big weeks. Despite all of it's success in America I was flabbergasted to discover that the song never even made the charts in England. For some unfathomable reason the record company chose to release what was the B-side of \"To Sir With Love\" in the States \"The Boat That I Row\" as the single. For me it is always a joy to see the film and a pleasure to hear this song.","summary":"This is the ORIGINAL HIT RECORDING.","unixReviewTime":1472342400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The band scored several hit records in the late 1960's. The Cowsills specialized in tight harmonies and began performing and recording at a very young age. The group consisted of brothers Barry, Bill, John, Bob and Paul, little sister Susan and their mom Barbara. Their meteoric rise to the top of the charts was the inspiration for the hit TV show \"The Partridge Family\". The Cowsills had three local hits in 1966 that got the attention of the folks at M-G-M records who signed the band in early 1967. Several months later The Cowsills released their first single for M-G-M called \"The Rain, The Park & Other Things\" (you might remember it as \"The Flower Girl\") which made it all the way to #2 on the Billboard charts.

There's hip hop, some salsa, rock, gospel, and a few inspiring ballads. Something for everybody.\n\nThe Alicia Keys produced Impossible is a bluesy piano-led ballad about a man who refuses to open up to Christina about his feelings for her. Frustrated by the lack of communication, she warns \"This is not a circus\/Don't you play me for a clown!\" and wonders \"How long can emotions keep on goin' up and down?\"\n\nChristina's voice is flexible and stronger than ever here. Despite having a cold at the time, she managed to showcase the \"pimped out vocals\" Alicia swore she'd get out of her. Impossible would've been a great choice for the final single over The Voice Within, but the uncredited use of a few lines from the Aretha Franklin classic Ain't No Way most likely played a part in why RCA nixed the idea. A video featuring Christina in a dimly lit jazz club pouring out her soul to her man would've been great, but alas.\n\nIf you choose to download only one song from Stripped (although you should check them all out), the jazzy Impossible is an excellent candidate.

Originally from their certified gold-selling album \"As The Band Turns\" and here from the album \"Ultimate Collection, Atlantic Starr\", this is the R&B, soul supergroup \"Atlantic Starr\", which was a hot group on soul and quiet storm radio stations in the 1980s, featuring the Lewis brothers: David on vocal\/guitar, Wayne on vocals\/keyboards, and Jonathan on trombone\/percussion; Joseph Phillips on flute\/ percussion, and Barbara Weathers on vocals.\n\nThis is a \"specially-remixed\", extended-time version of the hit song \"Silver Shadow\", written by David and Wayne Lewis who also co-produced it with brother Jonathan. The song is built on a latin-tinged beat and a recurring 4-note riff with driving, elastic bass and drum beats, with lyrics sung by the clear, sweet, soft, and supple voice of Weathers who really turns up the heat on the final verse as she delivers the message starting with \"since I was chosen among the rest\". Then the song goes into a series of vamps to the end that are not on the original album or radio versions. Highly Recommended. Five DETERMINED Stars. (A&M records. 1-MP3 track.

There are so many things to like about Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get. Let's go through it...\n\n1) nice rhythm guitar punctuated with strings and horns during intro.\n2) Great vocal variety, especially love high pitched voice 'some people are made of wood' and lower voice guy 'some people are up to no good'. Very Temptationsesque.\n3) fuzz electric guitar comes in at 0:40\n4) lots of excellent ahs, hahs, huhs, heys, other various grunts and stuff...see 0:37, 1:02, 1:33-1:35, etc.\n5) 1:15-1:20 rough main vocals on 'I said what you see' especially on 'what'...then nice Falsetto on 'baby'\n6) 1:41-1:42 'people'...soul!!!\n7) 3:01 piccolo? marching band music now...","summary":"MAY 26","unixReviewTime":1496793600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It doesn't get more Jimmy Cliff than this. A watershed moment in Jamaican film and reggae music, the film is a cult classic and so is the album. The music is fairly straightforward, it bops along to Jimmy's manifesto to himself: life is short and he is going to go out there and get what he wants, no matter what. He sings that he would 'rather be a free man in my grave than living as a puppet or a slave.' I seem to recall a discussion among friends about this universal concept; as long as one has hope, then one must continue to survive, even as a slave. But everyone has a breaking point, when you can't take it anymore and you are willing to die in order to be free.

They absolutely had stopped coming from the heart, but for others there has been a long wait to hear them swoon, and Anita Baker has been one of those seductive divas. She made absolutely some of the most sensual albums of her life and her career, and her 1994 album Rhythm Of Love is absolutely no exception. Her lead single from the album Body & Soul is absolutely one of those songs that sincerely takes my breath away, from the heart and the beautiful voice within. It still shows a seductive diva singing her heart into song out so well into each and every note. It truly is one of Anita's best songs, and if you really have been stuck on Rapture, you should get a dear listen to this song.

Stylistically it's essentially a Steely Dan song, as Fagen was half of Steely Dan. The International Geophysical Year of the title was a real event, a scientific program declared to share scientific knowledge, especially between East and West, that produced the first sattelites  (Sputnik and Vanguard), the Antarctic Treaty and NASA among other things.\n\nDonald Fagen's song is set in that period with the singer extolling the beautiful world that is coming due to the scientific progress of mankind - \" From this point of time it's clear, this dream's in sight \", and goes on to predict everything from solar powered cities to undersea rail tunnels. There are even spandex jackets for everyone.\n\nFagen was alive in the I.G.Y. and like any of us who were young then would have totally believed the idealistic optimism expressed by the lyrics. The song captures perfectly a certain Camelot-like moment of time when all this seemed actually possible. It's hard to convey to anyone today the feeling of prosperous late Fifties America that everything was going incredibly well and that we were only a few more scientific discoveries from perfection. The song does that; it captures the thoughts and the feelings of that time perfectly.\n\nBut the song is from 1982 and that throws a whole new light on its lyrics. Hey, it's 1982 and where is all this stuff? Not only have none of these inventions happened but the whole dream has been shattered and we've only arrived in an era of pessimism and doubt. Fagen's usual Steely Dan cynicism and satirical bent takes over and the jaunty tune and pie in the sky lyrics become their own undoing. The song both captures the moment then destroys it.\n\nA brilliant song.","summary":"Great song that can be taken two ways","unixReviewTime":1396656000,"vote":"2","image":null}

The first time I played the DVD, I quickly felt like the music was going to be much better than what I remember being exciting in those years of my youth. The theme is\n\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\nNow my empty cup is as sweet as the punch\n\nI tend to like simpler songs. In introducing the collective mentality that makes up The Association as a multiplicity coming together, it put the focus on each individual adding something like transistorized bits of what people hear on the radio. Watching so many people take turns with a line in this song made it surprising that a mess could sound this good. All of them allowed the good parts to come back a few times instead of growing like World War One, World War Two, a Cold War, the war on weed and money laundering.","summary":"sweet as the punch","unixReviewTime":1445299200,"vote":null,"image":null}

My husband singing this song out of the blue was special to me because he has actually been there for me through both the good and challenging times for me (since we met in August 2002 and our marriage on January 22, 2004), especially with a career change that was unexpectedly forced on me over five and a half months ago. However, much to my relief our marriage has only grown stronger and closer since then and I found it heartwarming that my husband decided to sing I Swear to me out of the blue to me first thing that morning (16 days ago). Additionally, I first heard I Swear by All-4-One during my teenage years via local radio and it had been a while since I last heard it. Anyhow, I Swear by All-4-One is a beautiful pop song about loving someone and being there for someone throughout both good fortune and tribulations in life (with the lyrics till death do us part).

Thank God for CD's. I was introduced to Randy Newman's writing before Randy Newman the artist about 45 years ago.  This album showcased songs from his first 3 studio albums and a couple from Sail Away.  The beauty of this album is simple voice and piano that gives you the feeling of hearing the song the way it was written instead of the way it was covered by another artist or his own studio production.  Great album it should still be in print.","summary":"Great album that should still be in print","unixReviewTime":1427673600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It only gets 4 stars from me, as its short (32 mins), and this is Randy early in his career (1970), when perhaps he wasn't quite as confident. So there aren't as many humerous quips between tracks, as you might get if a live album is ever released from later in his career.\nHowever, there's no getting away from it this is Randy Newman singing his quirky, funny, sad songs alone at the Piano. Although the album is short, you do get 14 tracks including many of the mans greatest songs:\nI Think Its Going To Rain Today, Davy The Fat Boy, Last Night I Had a Dream, Mama Told Me Not To Come.\nGet this and the Randy Newman Songbook album to hear the great man alone at the Piano.","summary":"Randy Newman + Piano = Magic","unixReviewTime":1188172800,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's just him, a piano, a microphone, and (what Newman claimed in an interview) about a dozen people in a club. It sounds like he's playing at your private party - you can hear the laughter of the crowd, of Newman himself, and all of the ambient noise of the club.\nSome of his best early songs are here: \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\" (a great version), \"Old Kentucy Home\" (this version lets you hear the great piano part much better than on \"12 Songs\"), \"Yellow Man.\" Also, two songs that were never released elsewhere: \"Tickle Me\" and \"Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong\" are both great and hilarious songs (the second song was recorded for \"Sail Away\" but not included - it is included on the recent re-release of \"Sail Away\" in orchestral version). Also included are some songs then yet to be released: \"Last Night I Had a Dream\" and \"Lonely at the Top\" which were both on \"Sail Away\" released after \"Live.\"\nThe album was supposedly released because Newman was taking so long in producing \"Sail Away\" and the record company wanted to keep momentum up. The public benefitted doubly: we got a great live album and a great follow-up.\nI had the privledge of seeing Newman in concert during the \"Land of Dreams\" tour some years ago. Again, it was just Newman and a piano. His show hasn't changed much (not that it needs to): he asks for requests and the audience begins shouting out song titles, he laughs during his songs, makes fun of himself and tells some great stories. Listening to Newman's early material shows that his style was set very early on, and he's been building on it ever since (though some think he's merely repeating himself, which I don't agree with).\nThe only thing that would be better than this album would be a follow-up. A live album from one of his recent tours with just him and piano. He's put out so much great material since then and sometimes his recordings hide his piano playing. It would be a happy companion to this great album.","summary":"One of the best stopgap releases ever...","unixReviewTime":1041984000,"vote":"9","image":null}

Anyhow,So Hott by Kid Rock seems to be a hard core rock song about basically wanting to only know someone on an extremely casual level (due to a connection based more on a physical attraction and their perceived good looks and\/or beauty).  The guitar riffs to So Hott bring the song alive as well as his unapologetic and unabashed singing with the daring lyrics. The online music video to So Hott by Kid rock even fits close to the meaning of the song.

Especially the bass and guitar fueled chorus that thunders like a concrete tsunami descending on a trailer park. The simplistic pile driven vocals each come in like 500 lb bunker busters. Its an opus to social discord, the alienated and disenfranchised, rage and retribution. I don't condone violence, but yet like the vocalist unwinding the story, there's something darkly inspiring and powerful to see one so downtrodden and beaten into non-existence finally rise up and lash out at those that drove them to where they are, and left not even a corner for them to crouch in. As already stated, I don't condone violence, but every once in a while something tragic happens, and you can't help but feel like it was honestly earned. This song encapsulates all of that for me.","summary":"Hey man, nice gun.","unixReviewTime":1439337600,"vote":null,"image":null}

In 1963, multiple Academy Award and multiple Grammy award-winning composer, arranger, pianist, and orchestra leader Henry Mancini composed the triple-Grammy winning and Academy Award-nominated \"The Pink Panther Theme\" for the eponymously-entitled comedic-heist motion picture co-written and directed by long-time Mancini associate Blake Edwards. The music was coordinated with the movement of the animated pink panther cartoon character in the opening credits and has been used in some of the 11 follow-on Pink Panther movies over 30 years. It is so closely associated with Peter Sellers who starred as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, though he only starred in about four of the movies.\n\nThe memorable Mancini musical theme was played by an orchestra made up of many of the same studio musicians associated with some of Mancini's greatest musical triumphs such as \"Peter Gunn\" and \"Mr Lucky\". Plas Johnson plays the widely-acclaimed tenor sax solo which conveys elegance, hipness, and musical buoyancy in a memorable performance. In addition, other Mancini stalwarts include Pete Candoli on trumpet, Dick Nash on trombone, Jimmy Rowles on piano, Shelly Manne on drums, Larry Bunker on vibes, Bob Bain on guitar, and Ted Nash and Ronny Lang on saxophones. The thrill of the performance beyond Johnson's key tenor sax role in stating the theme and performing the solo, include hot unison saxophone section riffs, the unison flute theme statement, unison trumpet section splashes, and key off-kilter pauses that add to the ambiance. My Highest Recommendation. Five DROLL Stars. (RCA Victor records. 1-MP3 track.

The song was originally published in 1933 as a piano composition.  The tune became so popular in sheet music sales that in 1938 lyrics were added.  Several big bands of the day including Artie Shaw, Larry Clinton and Guy Lombardo to name but a few recorded the tune with varying degrees of success.  Then in 1963 Nino Tempo and April Stevens, a brother-and-sister duo from Niagara Falls, NY released their version.  It would prove to be the second most popular version of all-time and hit #1 on the pop charts in November 1963, just before President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.  Deep Purple also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock and Roll Record of 1963.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"Wonderful version of a tune from the Great American Songbook.","unixReviewTime":1468368000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Electricity is one of those songs. The song originally appeared on the expanded version of Elton John's 2004 album Peachtree Road album.

Previous finale song lyrics have been similar (\"Flying Without Wings\", \"magic rainbow\" from \"The Time Of My Life\", for example).\n\nAnd even though there wasn't a chance to pick from several contending songs this year (again, no surprise considering A.I.'s desire to promote new judge and songwriter Kara DioGuardi), \"No Boundaries\" is a surprisingly good fit for Kris Allen.  The producers of this recording made some wise decisions...keeping the arrangement simple with acoustic guitar being the focus, and including just enough strings and electric guitar to spice things up and give the song some power.  The harmony vocals really work to accentuate Kris' lead vocal, and the way Kris slides down to lower notes while holding out the 'boundaries' lyric sounds great and adds emotional impact.  All in all, a more-than-decent effort, especially considering the circumstances.","summary":"Kris Makes The Most Out Of 'Idol' Coronation Song","unixReviewTime":1243555200,"vote":"6","image":null}

Absolutely, but Kris honestly does a great job with it in studio, and it's slightly catchy. And plus, for all you sappy people out there, isn't this right up your alley in inspiration?\n\nOverall, while the lyrics keep it from reach the top of its mountain, Kris Allen saves the song in the studio, and does a great job with it. Sure, Adam does slightly better, but still a very good effort.

Neil Young sings Be on my side I'll be on your side, baby. Kind of like the power struggle over the bed between me, wife, and dog when we are going to sleep at night.\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse perform Down by the River with a loosely structured rural grace. Neil sings with a hushed confessional tone, describing how he shot her dead. The ol murder ballad. 'He had to do it, she was shooting her mouth off about his mom.' Oops, that's Crispin Glover in River's Edge. Both are about a river and a murder. Perhaps Neil was a young Feck. If you haven't seen River's Edge, I sorry for you.\n\nWhen Neil isn't singing, he's choking out all sorts of primal electric sounds on his guitar. Love those one note solos! 1:52...then at\n\n3:22 he lays down this amazing lick. Guitars trade some great stabbing chords for a bit, then an even crazier one\/two note solo starts up at 3:56. Neil at his electric best: cutting loose in his idiosyncratic way, no rules, working out all the subtle nuances of one note until he feels it's ok to move on to a different one. Then having little spasms of fast-picked chaos.\n\nI just love Neil's vocal delivery.

I think the fact that he came out on the other side and is in love with Peggy and his family states a lot about his character. \"Down by the River\" was written long before this time, though, and he had the magic then, too. I guess he was born with it. This song is simple but heartfelt and full of emotion, not to mention great (as in GREAT) guitar riffs.

Back in the 1970s, we were preparing for prom. Our theme song was to be \"Hotel California\" by The Eagles. However, we were told that our choice was too risque for our high school prom. We had to go back to the drawing board. Finally, our buddy James Taylor and \"Shower The People\" proved to be acceptable to our teachers and faculty. The real irony is that Taylor's lyric \"if it feels nice, don't think twice\" made it right past their censor noses. I chuckle about that to this day. And I have to admit that this really is a good song. In its soft rock genre, I would call it a standout song. It is worthy of being in your collection. Taylor is no slouch of a musician.","summary":"Quite Talented Acoustic Song","unixReviewTime":1499299200,"vote":null,"image":null}

A coworker kindly made a copy of the Linkin Park cd Meteora music collection from a computer and Somewhere I Belong happens to be one of my favorite songs from the Meteora collection even to this day. I rationally and intuitively understand that Somewhere I Belong is one of those songs that has a different meaning depending on who hears it andor who created it. However, I take Somewhere I Belong to be a constructive tune about simply wanting to feel andor be where spiritually, personally, andor psychologically belonging can happily occur (simply guessing from the lyrics I want to heal could imply various levels of healing-emotionally psychological spiritual etc.).","summary":"One Of A Kind Soul Baring Rock Song","unixReviewTime":1528502400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Will you forgive me?\" - Bad Habits refrain\n\nFive DETERMINED Stars. \"Bad Habits\" (Uncut) is an excellent track by the acclaimed Grammy-winning soul\/R&B composer and singer, Maxwell, from his 2009 album: the Grammy-winning, platinum-selling \"BLACKsummers'night\". The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart and is part of a planned trilogy which was followed by the 2016 album \"blackSUMMERsnight\". The musical group includes Frederico Pena on keyboards, Shedrick Mitchel on organ, Keyon Harrold on trumpet, Kenneth Whalum III on saxophones, and Saunders Sermons II on trombone. Maxwell executes his sensual, but cryptic PG lyrics as he describes an intense meeting with a lover that builds when trumpeter Harrold, saxophonist Whalum, and trombonist Sermons join forces in the background. There is some Marvin Gaye influence in subject matter, horn use, and mood, but with Maxwell's originality. Produced by MUSZE (Maxwell) and Hod David. Highly Recommended with sensual cautions. Five SEXY Stars. (Columbia records. 1-MP3 track. X-Ray lyrics.

So this is about a 95% discount !!!!! And as seems all too common for these kinds of deals, it has been obfuscated to disguise the value. My guess is that it must be for the purpose of market segmentation between normal shoppers and us bargain hunters. And as also often seems to be the case, pianist Dubravka Tomsic is part of the conspiracy. As far as I can tell, she has absolutely nothing to do with the music on this set. This appears to be entirely the work of Jean-Pierre Armengaud, as indicated by the credits on the individual tracks. The other thing they've done to slightly cloud the issue is to mix up the order of the Etudes, Preludes and Images so they aren't quite as Debussy intended. This can be easily corrected. The sound quality here is gorgeous, with possibly a bit more ambiance than I would normally prefer for piano recordings, but the performances also tend to be on the slow dreamy side compared to what I am used to and prefer for Debussy, so the performances suit the venue. So go ahead and accuse me of nitpicking - this is great !!!!!!","summary":"Great deal that T. Fisher hasn't found yet","unixReviewTime":1339891200,"vote":"32","image":null}

Formed in San Jose, Ca. in 1970, The Doobies found themselves riding high on the Billboard Top Pop Singles Chart when in the fall of 1972 their debut release \"Listen To The Music\" leaped all the way to #11. Quite an accomplishment! Over the next few years, in the waning days of Top 40 radio on the AM dial, the hits just kept on comin' with memorable songs like \"Long Train Runnin'\", \"Black Water\" and \"China Grove\". Meanwhile, The Doobie Brothers were also making their mark on the FM side. The album-oriented rock (AOR) format was just gaining traction in the early to mid 70's and Doobie's tunes were prominently featured in that format as well. What I particularly enjoyed about The Doobie Brothers was that no two songs seemed to sound alike. This was a very innovative group that featured tight harmonies and superior musicianship. The group was plagued by constant personnel changes which made the fact that their music was so consistently good all the more remarkable.\n\nThen in 1975 Michael McDonald came aboard to replace Tom Johnston and lent his considerable talents to the group. But The Doobie Brothers had a lot of trouble coming up with another big hit. \"Takin' It To The Streets\" and \"It Keeps You Runnin'\" were great records but it seemed the public had lost some interest. In late 1978 the group released the album \"Minute By Minute\". This record was greeted with wild enthusiasm by the public. Not only did it reach #1 on the Billboard Albums chart, but it stayed there for five weeks. \"Minute By Minute\" also spawned the #1 single \"What A Fool Believes\" which in my opinion would rank among the best singles of the 1970's. What a fabulous tune!","summary":"The best record they ever made.","unixReviewTime":1473120000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It is very sad that she has not been able to honestly ignite within her songs, the way other great divas did before her like the great Whitney Houston, or Anita Baker. Tragically after she left Sony for other offers in the 90's, When she made it in the 2000's, the only album that really delivered with her fans really was The Emancipation Of Mimi, and none of the albums have been able to stride in musicality and soul. When she released her album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, it was really more of a dud than a sense of the brilliance she used to have. The songs completely have been a waste of time. Obsessed was really the only hit song for her die hard fans, but it wasn't enough. Musically, the song wasn't strong enough the way that she had with songs like We Belong Together or Shake It Off. Obsessed was a real failure, and one Mariah Carey song that really is a stinker.\n\nSong: C-","summary":"No Obsession","unixReviewTime":1469923200,"vote":null,"image":null}

He was partially blinded in an unfortunate accident in his back yard at age 5 and became totally blinded at the age of 7. Rather than wallow in his misfortune, a very young Ray Charles began to study classical piano and clarinet at the State School for Deaf and Blind Children in St. Augustine, FL. Ray quickly figured out that music was what he wanted to do with his life. He moved to Seattle in 1948 at the age of 18 and formed the Maxin Trio. Just a year later the group signed a recording contract with a small Los Angeles based label called Swingtime. After just a few months the groups debut release \"Confession Blues\" rose all the way to #2 on Billboard's R & B chart. A couple of other hits followed and important people in the music business began to take notice. One of them was Ahmet Ertegan of Atlantic records who had a knack for discovering important new talent. Ray Charles would ink a deal with Atlantic records in 1952 and the rest as they say is history. Over the next five and a half decades Ray Charles would become an institution and one of the most important recording artists and \"live\" performers in American musical history.\n\nWhile Ray Charles was wildly popular among jazz and R & B afficianados during the 1950's he really hit his stride with general audiences after signing a deal with ABC-Paramount in 1960. There were certainly a lot of raised eyebrows when Ray opted to leave Atlantic but evidently he knew what he was doing. During his 14 year stay at ABC Ray Charles had around 60 charted singles and recorded dozens of successful albums in a wide variety of musical styles. Which brings us to his biggest hit single of all-time.\n\n\"I Can't Stop Loving You\" is a popular song written and composed by country singer, songwriter and musician Don Gibson, who first recorded it on December 30, 1957, for RCA Victor Records. It was released in 1958 as the B-side of \"Oh, Lonesome Me\", becoming a double-sided country hit single. Four years later in 1962 Ray Charles recorded his unforgettable version of this tune. It raced up the charts at breakneck speed and within just a few weeks was the #1 song in the land and remained at the top of the charts for 5 weeks. The song earned Charles a Grammy for \"Best R&B Record\" of 1962. This is Ray Charles at the absolute zenith of his long and incredibly successful career.","summary":"The original Hall of Fame recording by an American Master.","unixReviewTime":1471564800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The off tempo guitar riffs and hard rocking blues from Keith Richards and Ronnie Woods is timeless and sharp, the solid rhythm section of Watts and Wyman rounds it off to a blistering piece of music. Then you add the icing to the cake with Mick Jagger at his grueling, bluesy, deep throttleing best and you have yourself another Stones classic. It's one of a handful of songs I can hit the replay button on over and over again and never get tired of hearing it. So crank it up, it needs to be loud to enjoy this in all its glory. I rank it right up there wth Gimme Shelter, Wild Horses, and so many other Rolling Stone's masterpieces.","summary":"As good as they get","unixReviewTime":1372809600,"vote":null,"image":null}

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWith that said, I did pay for this this song.  If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free \/ cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","summary":"LOVE","unixReviewTime":1474502400,"vote":null,"image":null}

His rapping skills are probably on its highest point in this album. With great Wu beats from exec producers RZA, Busta Ryhmes and Dr. Dre.

In fact they are still at it. The group finally struck pay dirt in 1984 with a tune called \"On The Dark Side\" from the motion picture \"Eddie and the Cruisers\".  At long last this talented and hard-working outfit had themselves a major national hit. The single was originally released on the Scotti Brothers label in October 1983.  Listing the artist as \"Eddie and The Cruisers\" the song spent a total of 9 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart peaking at a rather lackluster #64.  But \"Eddie and The Cruisers\" would become something of a cult classic.  The record label saw fit to re-release the single In August of 1984.  Now the label credited \"John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band\" as being the artist.  The record got a ton of airplay and this time around the tune spent 18 weeks on the national charts peaking at #7.  What a terrific rock and roll record!  One of the best singles of the 1980's.","summary":"From the motion picture \"Eddie and The Cruisers\".","unixReviewTime":1491868800,"vote":null,"image":null}

But when I do think of all of the songs that he brilliantly sung since the 70's, all I can absolutely think of is just one simple song that still ignites at the soul from television. The theme from the Bruce Willis 80's show Moonlighting, which has been enriched at the heart. The theme from Moonlighting still shows a brilliance in jazz and the engrained heart of pop culture. It is still one of those deep guilty pleasure songs that works today, just like it did back in the 80's, 90's and 2000's. Al really had a gift from the heart that swooned so many people time and time again. He will definitely be missed every time you hear the moonlight soul.

Honestly, throughout Mariah Carey's career, she really has been very poor at really finding the right songs that have matched her soul in covers, and sonnets from her heart. Musically, she does not have the ear and voice for covers within the soul that songstresses like the great Whitney Houston and Celine Dion have had with covers and delivered from the soul overall. Hard to believe that there were only two cover songs that Mariah Carey had delivered on very well. Her rendition of the Jackson 5's I'll Be There, and Endless Love with Luther Vandross in 1994. But otherwise, it has been more of a waste from Mariah Carey overall. Her rendition of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, has a few problems overall. One is that she does not sing a key verse that Lou Gramm did so well, \"This Mountain I Must Climb Feels Like The World Upon My Shoulder...\", a huge bust from Mariah. Second of all, Mariah Carey sounds cheaper with her 80's covers over the years: Against All Odds by Phil Collins, Journey's Opens Arms and Def Leppard's Bringing On The Heartbreak from 2003's Charmbracelet. This is one song I would not recommend for any die hard Mariah Carey fan, and for new ones alike. She does not want to know what love is, after her wasted past few marriages, and with the musical ear.\n\nSong: C-","summary":"Wasted Foreigner","unixReviewTime":1468886400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I'm personally not a big listener of music from the swing era, but can appreciate it as the art it is.  This is a very good version of music from that era performed by one of our own premiere military bands.  The instrumentation is spot on and full of energy and the vocals are rich and capture the era with accuracy that True swing lovers will appreciate.  My wife had ordered this and it wasn't what she expected.  That said, I know lots of people who LOVE swing and the several with whom I shared this tapped their feet and looked like they wished there was more room to dance.  If you love swing, and support our military, you'll enjoy having this song in your library.","summary":"Cutting a rug with a classic song","unixReviewTime":1426118400,"vote":null,"image":null}

This is one of the more offbeat, but finest holiday albums released in the past 20 to 25 years. And as the years (and Christmases) go by, it seems more and more that this is the Christmas seed from which all of Dylan's recent \"great American songbook\" albums have sprung from. This album was meant to echo the classic, old-time Xmas songs of way back when. Like Sinatra, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, Burl Ives and company. The arrangements and production values reflect that. Yes, Bob's voice is ragged, creakly, sandpapery and rough, but you get a feeling that he puts new life into these songs which can seem tired at best in the hands of another singer. And you feel that he truly believes the sentiments expressed in these songs, something very rare in today's Xmas albums. Another trick of the trade that Bob (and perhaps everybody) knows: just like the late great Leonard Cohen, Bob uses sweet female voices to be the sugar on his sometimes hard to get vocals. The backup singers here remind me of the Andrews Sisters. The point is that this album works.\n  Highlights include Here Comes Santa Claus, I'll Be Home for Christmas, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song and more. I'd never heard the song Christmas Island before, but now I have to rank it among my favorite Xmas songs. It's cute and kitschy. This album is recommended for Dylan fans, Xmas album nuts, and those who grow a bit tired of the holiday fare on Lite FM. It's also a wonderful primer for those who wish to get into (or try to appreciate) Dylan's more recent standards albums, Shadows in the Night, Fallen Angels and Triplicate. All in all a nice recommendation. Happy (very early) Holidays!------------------------------PEACE\nBTW-The one bad song was Must Be Santa.

The 10 songs comprised are complete re-workings of her earlier hits, plus 2 new, never-heard-before tracks.  Some of the musical arrangements actually come out even better than the original studio versions.  For example, \"Boys In The Trees\" has a much more layered, lush acoustic arrangement.\n\nSome of the other re-workings that I enjoyed were \"You're So Vain\", \"Let The River Run\", and \"Anticipation.\"  But the crown jewel and pinnacle (not to mention my personal favorite) on this LP is her earliest 1971 hit, \"That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be.\"  Carly has always been a great storyteller, and the drastic re-working of this song still applies a lot of context.  I love the entire, layered, high quality melody of the song too -- it's one of the best tracks that Carly has EVER sung from her entire 35 year career.  :)  It's one of those songs that I tend to put on repeat whenever I'm in a relaxed mood.\n\nI recommend this CD for Carly purists and casual music listeners.  Her catalog has continued to stand the test of time, and you certainly won't be sorry once you've heard this record.  :)","summary":"Another consummate, brilliant record -- no one does it better than Carly.  :)","unixReviewTime":1406678400,"vote":null,"image":null}

While Michael definitively ruled as \"The King Of Pop\" between the releases of OFF THE WALL and DANGEROUS, some of his later work suffered from intermittent bouts of artistic deadpan.  This single, however, released during that period of flux before his unfortunate end, is his most outstanding recording ever.  Emotionally vexing, angry but tempered with hope, musically complex and built upon a bedrock of progressive rock architecture, EARTH SONG demonstrates his ability to be utterly transformative and sincerely artistic in protest.  If you, like me, collected those Pop Music perfections of OFF THE WALL, THRILLER, BAD, and DANGEROUS, allowing the rest to lay low, once you either saw the video for EARTH SONG or caught the song on radio, or even saw the updated performance from THIS IS IT (this version reaches the pinnacle of sound engineering) it probably became a must-have for you, so adding it to your MJ collection digitally through Amazon is a perfect solution.  The sound on this digital download is amazing and coupled with a few others and\/or CD rips, you can assemble yourself a wonderful personalized MJ CD.  I sincerely consider EARTH SONG to be MJ's compositional and musical masterpiece.  Enjoy!","summary":"Michael's Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1491523200,"vote":null,"image":null}

That brings me to this cd\/dvd combo, Desperate Measures.  When I checked this out, the first thing I noticed was the rather poor average review score.  I was baffled by the negative reviews for this product...and while I don't think they are merited, Im now starting to understand why they exist.  The band released this directly after Swan Songs when everyone was excited for a new albumand then they got this instead.  This release is really more of a bonus thing (the sort of thing that bands don't usually put out until they have a few main albums under their belt), so I can understand why some people were disappointed.  Nonetheless, Im going to judge it purely on its merits, which will be easier for me since Im not coming into it with the same expectations as someone several years ago.\n\nDisc 1 is a cd full of bonus songs: a mixture of original songs, covers, and some live tracks.  The first two original songs (Dove and Grenade, and Tear It Up) are great (and are among my favorite HU tracks), but El Urgencia is just okay, in my opinion.  The next couple songs are coversand they aren't exactly great (ugh, well, at least the HU boys seemed to be having some fun with it).  The last songs on the cd are live tracks, and they are pretty good; in fact, I rather enjoyed the live atmosphere of them.  It kinda makes me wish theyd release a full live album someday.  Oh, something odd to note (if you buy this on amazon) is that the mp3s being sold are actually the clean versionand there doesnt appear to be an explicit version of the mp3s being sold at all (as of the time of posting this review).  I have not been able to figure out why, but keep that in mind if you are like me and trying to get everything in its original, unaltered form.\n\nDisc 2 is actually a dvd.  It contains live concert footage, and a few little interviews\/extra bits (which are amusing) sprinkled throughout.  I was excited about having high quality concert recordings, but it feels like it was edited by someone with ADD.  The camera angle jumps around constantly, about every second, and it's a bit jarring to watch.  Still, its nice to have concert footage that wasn't filmed on someone's cell phone (and I eventually got used to the editing), so Im pleased to have this inclusion.  If nothing else, like the live tracks from Disc 1, this makes me yearn for a live album release.\n\nOverall, this cd\/dvd bundle is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of quality.  The original songs and live tracks are worth owning, but the covers are questionable.  The concert dvd is nice to have for the more hardcore fans, but I could understand why the casual fan might want to skip it.  I feel this item is worth owning, for me at least, since I'm happy to have some concert footage not filmed on a potato.  Also, as far as I know, this is the only official release containing live concert footage, and thus, it is now an important part of the historical record.  About 200 years from now when historians are studying Hollywood Undead, theyll be very grateful for this scrap of high-quality recordings.  If you are an HU fan and are considering picking this up, just keep in mind what it actually contains, and make an informed decision as to whether its worth it to you or not.","summary":"A bit of a mixed bag...","unixReviewTime":1476403200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's a classic instrumental one hit wonder, the archetypal breezy cheezy 70s pop AM radio hit. I love the fade in, the organ, and the rhythm guitar. I especially love the electric guitar solo, it has that recorded in a cave reverb quality. Not crazy about the horns during the song, but I love them during the build up at the end. And the tiny one second drum break around 2:01 is cool. I don't know if Bach would have liked it, but I think it's a pretty cool arrangement and from a long gone era in pop music when hit songs were allowed to be unapologetically geeky and joyful.","summary":"FEB 25","unixReviewTime":1496102400,"vote":null,"image":null}

In fact, they would be those brothers (yes, the Clipse are brothers) selling their albums out the trunk of their cars. I have never heard a song by them that just blew me away lyrically. Their hottest song to date, and one of my favorite rap songs to come out in recent years, is featured on this album: \"I'm Good.\" I really, really like that song and it's positive nature. The beat and hook are fantastic and their energetic, optimistic vibes make the song even better. Simply put, it's a feel good rap song.\n\nI lost count of how many times they mentioned their chains, how good their chains looked, and how bright their chains are. That's what stands out most after listening to these 13 tracks. I can say this matter-of-factly, though: The best tracks here are \"I'm Good\" and \"Champion.\" The rest of the album is basically the same as far as quality is concerned. \"Never Will It Stop\"and\"There Was a Murder\" are the LP's biggest most glaring missteps. These tracks are just all around bad. \"Showing Out\" is an energetic track if nothing else. It has an OK beat and a decent offering by Yo Gotti.\n\nI gave this album 2 1\/2 stars and I wonder if I was being too generous in doing so. Perhaps.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"I'm Good\"\n2. \"Champion\"\n3. \"Freedom\"\n4. \"Popular Demand\"\n5. \"Showing Out\"","summary":"2.5 stars What saves them is hot beats from Pharrell","unixReviewTime":1295654400,"vote":null,"image":null}

As close and light as I dare get to brushing up against something like Elton John's 'Your Song' or Rita Coolidge's 'We're All Alone'. If You Could Read My Mind includes a folky air of mystic dreaminess and presents a romantic honesty without flying off into Sapland. The music is pretty subdued, nice acoustic guitars and the use of one of my favorite techniques, the gently rising, unobtrusive string arrangement. Then there's Gord's voice, so soft and comfortable, like a perfectly worn baseball mitt. I also like that the lyrics don't always rhyme in the places where you think they should. It's a Dear Jane letter, the writer trying to explain why he is no longer in love, and having a hard time understanding it himself. Lots of cool images - a ghost from a wishing well, a fortress strong, a paperback novel from the drugstore, an old-time movie.\n\nThere are many different photos of Gordon Lightfoot out there...I prefer the rugged curly haired mustachioed mid 70s AM radio adult contemporary Gord's Gold version.","summary":"JUN 22","unixReviewTime":1497052800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Little Wing is a complex little song made to sound simple and melodic. This song has such appeal that it has been broadly covered by some of the greatest musicians in the world. Little Wing is a must have for any comprehensive collection. It shows the rich lush psychedelic sound that Jimi could do so well. There will never be a better guitarist than Jimi Hendrix was and this was among his most talented compositions. Without a doubt, this is essential Jimi Hendrix.","summary":"Like Walking In The Clouds","unixReviewTime":1498780800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Brian Jones on the vibraslap at the end of each opening bar, makes me think of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef calmly sizing each other up in some dusty lawless town. I never knew Brian Jones played on this, what a bittersweet discovery. Wow, Dave Mason too? Argghhh, can't believe I didn't know this...well, glad to know it now.\n\nThe story unfolds....the joker speaks to the thief about his troubles. The blues. Life is a drag. He finishes his words at 0:52 and Jimi cranks out a nice solo in solidarity. At 1:09, the thief 'kindly' speaks. He can sympathize and says there are 'many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.' But he says, let's not talk about this tonight, it's getting late.\n\n1:43 - so the joker and thief wander off into the night, Jimi blazing a trail for them to follow. At 2:00 they fall asleep and are swept off into some sort of dream land (my favorite part). At 2:17 they wake from their slumber and realize they aren't quite sure where they are. A wah wah chaos of tumbleweeds and dust encircles them as they attempt to get their situation in order. 2:33 - back on some trail, with a growing sense of urgency.\n\n2:50 - The joker and the thief have traveled over distance and time, and now out of nowhere they approach a fortress of princes, damsels, servants, possibly various other court attendants, who may have been aware of them for awhile, observing them from the watchtower. But they are not there yet. They must deal with growling wildcats and howling winds. I've always preferred a happy ending - they finally make it to the castle and are welcomed with hearty meals and bowls of mead.","summary":"JUL 6","unixReviewTime":1497052800,"vote":null,"image":null}

{"overall":5.0,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2011","reviewerID":"A2TWT7ZPBBYZYF","asin":"B00334PWXU","style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"reviewerName":"Raj Manoharan","reviewText":"A reissue of an earlier release by the Billboard-charting New Age duo 2002, this CD, like their new album Damayanti, is a wondrous collection of some of the most breathtaking, exquisitely beautiful music ever recorded.\n\nHusband-and-wife Randy and Pamela Copus have hit on a winning formula, combining Randy's guitars and Pamela's flute and harp along with keyboards and synthesizers to create a hypnotic sound that mesmerizes and enthralls. It's no wonder that they consistently chart on Billboard - they have clearly connected with their audience by continually delivering pleasing melodies and luxurious arrangements.\n\nHaving recently reviewed Damayanti and now Deep Still Blue, I have noticed that 2002 has developed a consistent style that comprises deliberate, measured pacing. I haven't heard a 2002 song so far that's faster than mid-tempo. Each track takes its time, unfolding at its own leisure, allowing the listener to bask in all of its rich sonic intricacies. This is a refreshing change of pace from most albums of any genre, where tunes careen from one style to another, sometimes to jarring effect. Instead, 2002 stays True to its particular style or theme and is all the more successful for it.\n\nThis consistency of methodology is a major reason why Randy Copus is quickly becoming my favorite, strictly-New Age guitarist. Rather than a flashy display of virtuosity, his lead- and rhythm-guitar playing is as deliberate and measured as the expansive songs themselves. Each note he picks delivers precise and maximum impact, and his chords are as comforting as floating clouds. This is masterful technique in itself. The full effect of Randy's approach can be heard on such stunning tracks as \"An Ocean Apart,\" \"Little Angel,\" and \"The Voyage Home.\"\n\nPamela Copus is equally impressive in her subtle flute and harp playing. I'm not a flute and harp fan, but she makes it very accessible and enjoyable. Again, like Randy, her musical goal with her instruments is not to dazzle but to help paint a vivid, sonic portrait. Sometimes the flute trades lines with the guitar and other times it harmonizes with it, while the harp provides unobtrusive, decorative fills here and there. The result is a sound that is very cinematic.\n\nVocals also play a part in the proceedings, although not in the traditional sense. For the most part, the occasional vocals are wordless (\"vocalese\") and are very angelic and choir-like. The title track has actual lyrics written by Randy and Pamela's daughter Sarah and has an entrancing, hypnotic sound that I can only describe as New Age hippie folk, and I mean that in a good way.\n\nDeep Still Blue is another gem in 2002's stellar catalogue, and as \"Flight of the Swan\" is to Damayanti, \"An Ocean Apart\" is the jewel in the crown here - although the entire album is a delight from start to finish. Deep Still Blue and Damayanti are definitely two of my desert island picks.","summary":"The RajMan Review","unixReviewTime":1318723200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Kellee Maize's work reminds me of that, though as yet she hasn't produced much that resembles music (not lyrically, anyway).  She's apparently had the big insight that lots of words rhyme with each other or sound a lot alike, and thinks by stringing them together something profound may result.  Well, not quite.\n\nUsing big words that rhyme does not an artist nor poet make.  Gosh- consonance, continents and consequence DO sound a lot alike, wow.  You can visit any mental hospital and find dozens of such \"visionaries\", what they produce is called \"word salad\".  It's gibberish, utter nonsense.  Ms. Maize is either unbalanced or having a good laugh at our expense, possibly both.  There's nary an original thought here, no- strike that- there's not a THOUGHT here, not one that's coherent or complete, at any rate.  The words SEEM to suggest things, like a verbal Rorschach test, words randomly thrown together DO, but the meaning is imposed from without, a projection, as they say. Granted, the tunes are catchy, the beats infectious.  But if you see anything profound and revelatory in the lyrics, I suggest you Google them, and have a look some Sunday morning, in the clear light of day.  I warrant that YOU are the source of your epiphanies, the inspiration and beauty comes from within, not from Ms. Maize's ramblings, which are alternately pretentious, gratuitous, and in poor taste, to put it mildly.  In fairness though, why this strikes me as rubbish and songs like \"COME TOGETHER\" or \"I AM THE WALRUS\" by the Beatles strike me as genius, I don't know (LSD way back when may have had something to do with it, admittedly, in this case, so who knows).\n\nBTW, what is an \"aligned archetype\"?  An archetype is ONE facet of a person, one of many that complements other facets, their confluence or amalgam forms personality. I could have made some sense of \"aligned archetypes\", plural, its use in the singular is baffling- how so, aligned with what?\n\nBelow are the lyrics to Something Sacred.  I had to work around the obscenities, Amazon wouldn't accept them.  Some might think it a travesty, an insult to the things that people actually hold sacred to use the word thusly.  \"Something Sacrilegious\" might be more fitting.  Neither sacrilege nor obscenities bother me in the least, actually, but utter twaddle taken as profundity does, especially when there's so much out there that IS profound, explicitly so, like THE AVETT BROTHERS or LOVERS or HOLY GHOST! or MATTHEW DEAR, for example. I'll give you a million dollars if you can cogently explain the meaning of this song to me (well, not really, I don't have a million CENTS). But here are the lyrics, judge for yourself:\n\nSOMETHING SACRED:\n\nAlliteration for the nation, consonance for continents\nI hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this\n\nJustifiable rythym\nAsking what you been missin'\nPimps so corporate n' kissin\nValues are tied in the lynching\nAll the fat needs some pinchin\nSteady youth in a prison\nNo lovin' supervision\nThere's no cooks in the kitchen\nPoison water no fishin'\nAll the sales men are pitchin'\nTo steal cause circumcision\n[Sexual assault] us continue snitchin'\nMoney drugs over [female dogs]\nI see something real different\nI'll be holdin' a vision\nIt's not just superstition\n\nSomething sacred sewed me sideways\nI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way\nHoly hell on a hardened highway\nFeeling freaky focused\nFriday to Friday\n\nI'm fighting my ego\nI think may be it's sequel\nIs opposite of evil\nSugar f***ed up my equal\nNever researched the prequel\nToxins all in your fecal\nPoppin' pills swelling measle\nTell me where is my people\nThey don't bow at no steeple\nLightworkers gettin deepa\nQuantum physics'll teach ya\nMy lyrics they might reach ya\nRead the poems I preach ya\nThis full length is my feature\nA mysterious creature\nWe are one blood all keepers\n\nSomething sacred sewed me sideways\nI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way\nHoly hell on a hardened highway\nFeeling freaky focused\nFriday to Friday\n\nMy spaceship is leavin'\nOut the window I'm seein'\nEnd of left brain per diam\nPsychics say they can see them\nDaddy's fightin my demons\nBeside me steady dreamin\nThat he helps me make freedom\nFrom the grave he is screamin\nF! the man and his s*men\nKinda fishy no reason\nCorporation is reakin'\nSmells of workers well treated\nEarth mother she is fiendin'\nFor a break in the season\nDiscontent no one pleasin'\nCalled a [female body part] that is bleedin'\n\nSomething sacred sewed me sideways\nI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my way\nHoly hell on a hardened highway\nFeeling freaky focused\nFriday to Friday\n\nAlliteration for the nation, consonance for continents\nI hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this","summary":"Smoke and mirrors, WYSIWYG","unixReviewTime":1384560000,"vote":"5","image":null}

Note that it is *not* the Rhino release from 2001 which had a dozen or so bonus tracks and singles added but which is almost impossible to find at the time of writing.\n\nAs an album...well, it's OK. It's a reminder of what a good singer Cher was, even without the gloss and electronics she went in for later. She has a fine natural voice which she uses very well, there's a good band with a quality horn section added at times and as a period piece it's decent music making. Frankly, though, the material lets it down.\n\nIt's largely good material: Dylan, Stills & Young, Otis Redding...they're classy names. However, if you're going to cover a song which a great artist has already recorded in a classic version, you need to do something very different or very special, and Cher doesn't really manage either here. After four and a half decades the generic late-60s sound and arrangements sound pretty bland, and much of the real soul, passion or eroticism is drained out of these songs. Dock Of The Bay has none of Otis's agonised hopelessness and \"Lay Baby Lay\" (!) lacks any of Dylan's laid back, sexy delivery, for example, and the same is True pretty well throughout.\n\nFor me this is an interesting collection to look back on, but a good singer is largely wasted here, I think. It's available pretty cheaply so you may want to give it a try, but it's not one I'll be taking out and playing much, I'm afraid.","summary":"An interesting period piece","unixReviewTime":1440979200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Bands like Poison, Skid Row, G n R, Def Leppard, Whitesnake....the list could go on and on. Back in the days when rock music was fun, melodic, and not bogged down with angst and pretension.\n\nThis album sounds as if it could have been recorded in 1988, and from the moment you hear \"21 Till I Die,\" it brings back a warm feeling of nostalgia. Other highlights include \"Blame It On Love\" and \"Rock and A Hard Place,\" which is vintage Hysteria-era Def Leppard. Nearly all of the tracks are excellent. What's even better is the fact that the band does not sound as if they are trying too hard. They sound like they are having a great time, and so will you during this listening experience.\n\nAn album like this will come along every so often and remind us just how good this type of music can sound when it is done right. \"Crazy Lixx\" has put a big grin on my face, as it has restored my faith in sensible, melodic hard rock once again, and brought me back to a time in my life when music was exciting.","summary":"80's Style Hair Metal Revival!!","unixReviewTime":1299974400,"vote":"2","image":null}

I on the other hand love rock, pop, rap, and so on. I will make exceptions with this song as well as some Country groups. The reason why I like this song is it doesn't have that twang. This is kind of a Country\/Pop song, I am surprised I like it, but I do like some songs from Willie Nelson, Alabama, Vince Gill, E.T.C.. I would tell anybody regardless of music taste to check this out, it's not your ordinary Country song. This is a song a lot of people will be surprised, and actually like.\n\nTHX,\nKris L.

Precious few albums have ever been made where the b-sides are just as good as, or perhaps better than the hits. Everybody knows the song \"Kissing You\" from this album... but every song is great. I love every song with an equal amount of passion(which is very rare, especially for me) but if I had to pick a stand out favorite it would be \"Closer.\" I've fantasized about being in love many times to that song.\n\nThis album contains all the elements that us real music lovers(and in my case real music makers) love. Class A passionate vocals(Vocally, Keith was on the level of a Luther Vandross), Excellent lyrics, smooth and catchy music, impeccable production and a perfect balance.\n\nSome albums are either too up tempo, or too laid back, this albums has all three. Up tempo tracks(When You Love Somebody), Mid tempo tracks(When It Comes To You) and power ballads (Kissing You). If you love real music your money or your time will not be wasted by purchasing this album.","summary":"20 Years a Fan.","unixReviewTime":1457654400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Brown, she is really finding her footing well in R&B and Soul. She did that noblely with Shark In The Water, her first single from her debut single from Travelling By The Light, now her latest single, L.O.V.E. tries to bring out the 60's Pop & Soul rhythms of the mainstream, that acts like Dusty Springfield brought out back then. While it was delivered a few years ago by Duffy, V.V. Brown is following nicely. Hopefully, she can keep it up, and be brought out more from her songs.\n\nSong: B-","summary":"V.V.

It combines the lo-fi punk approach with a distinct pop sensibility and a gorgeous girll group type vocalizing. While teh lo-fi recording is obviously done on prupose and would hurt many other recordings here it serves its purpose prefectly well by enhancing the underlying pop sensibility. The combined effect of 60's girl group hooks and noisy approach is actually what the Raveonettes tried without any success to attain on their recordings. The Dum Dum Girls actually succeed mainly because they have more talent, actually  belong  to a real scene where this kind of music does naturally occur and they are less poseurs than that other group.

That can be a touchy subject, but Thorn's thorny mournings go down easy, couched as they are in comfortable melodies.  \"Oh, the Divorces!\" is a speculation on who's next; \"Singles Bar\" explores the same question in a very different context.  The punchy \"Hormones\" wryly laments the generational differences in biological clocks.  The highlight is \"Late in the Afternoon,\" a beautiful, bittersweet, multi-layered observation on the seasons of love.  This is not an album for the millennials, unless they're interested in what makes Mum's clock tick.","summary":"Love in the middle ages . . .","unixReviewTime":1377820800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Anderson","reviewText":"There's no getting around it. Most of those who will be curious about this album miss the full-fledged Ben& Tracey team of Everything But The Girl. But EBTG certainly had a lot of different flavors to it. My favorite period was their last, the electronic\/house period -- the final three albums. Much of their earlier work was more intimate, spare, maybe more personal in a way.\n\nMost of the material on Tracey's Love and Its Opposite probably compare to that early work. It's softer, less beat-oriented. There is a dance song here, as I recall. And Kentish Town -- not a dance piece by any means -- still has a hypnotic rhythm. It's probably my favorite song on the album. A bit dark, mysterious, ethereal.\n\nSo, if you like the spare and acoustic EBTG, you'll probably enjoy this album more than I did. I'm not a good judge of lyrics, so I won't comment on them, except to say they didn't sound bad or clunky. I focused on the music. Though it was pretty, I can't say the songs really grabbed me. I did enjoy Kentish Town and Swimming most of all. Perhaps I'm not in the situation in my life to appreciate the topical subject matter.\n\nI hope some day we can see another group effort. Until then, this album should satisfy at least part of the EBTG fan base.","summary":"3 1\/2 stars for a solid but not stellar solo effort","unixReviewTime":1288742400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I've been looking forward to their follow up, The Light Meets The Dark.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't live up to their debut.\n\nWith this release, Tenth Avenue North has firmly established themselves on the pop side of the pop\/rock genre.  In fact, I would be hard pressed to call any of the songs on this disc as rock.  There are some upbeat tracks, but for the most part, things pretty much seem to be on an even keel.  And that's my biggest problem with this disc.  The songs all start to sound the same after a while.\n\nThe lyrics on the first disc were moving and inspirational.  Here, they don't seem quite as deep, even bordering on cliche.  That's even worse to me since the lyrics are usually what make or break a release for me.\n\nThere are some good tracks here.  For example, disc opener \"Healing Begins\" is a nice mid-tempo number that reminds us that we won't truly heal until we accept God's forgiveness.  The verses talk about how all our trying won't do any good.  It starts out rather quiet and slow, but it picks up in both volumn and tempo when they reach the first chorus.  You can even hear some strings in the midst of the guitar and drums.  It really does give me a sense of freedom to remember that God knows my faults and has forgiven them.\n\nThey up the tempo with the next track, \"Strong Enough to Save.\"  This track is on the rock side of the spectrum, especially on the chorus, with the loud guitar and strong drum beat.  It follows up the theme of the first track by reminding us that the God who controls nature is strong enough to save us.\n\n\"The Trust is Who You Are\" uses guitar to remind us that our belief in God needs to actually affect how we live.  Once again, we've got a guitar driven song that starts slow and builds to mid-tempo by the chorus.\n\nAnother favorite track is the disc closer.  \"Oh My Dear\" is a piano driven ballad.  The longest track here, it's absolutely beautiful to listen to.  The lyrics are pretty powerful as well.  They're written from the point of view of a person who goes over to help a friend who is going through a very rough patch, mainly due to sins of the past.  The forgiveness and love shown are convicting and heartwarming at the same time.\n\nThere are a couple songs that I find annoying because of the lyrics.  \"On and On\" is written from God's point of view as He reminds us of His love and sacrifice for us.  It's got a great piano and strings background that is pretty.  It's an upbeat ballad that could really deliver a powerful wallop.  Yet it leaves me feeling cold because the lyrics cover ground they've done better in other songs on their two discs.\n\nThen there's \"House of Mirrors.\"  And upbeat guitar track, it challenges us to break the mirror of our pasts and focus on what God has done for us.  Again, it's something they've covered before and the chorus is just so simple.  I've heard prediction it will be a concert favorite, and I think that will be the case because the simple chorus will be easy to shout out, but it doesn't make for a good song on a CD.\n\nFrankly, this is one of those discs I think I will enjoy best in bits and pieces.  The songs are okay by themselves, so as they come through iTunes shuffle or some such program, I will enjoy hearing them.  But when I sit down and listen to them back to back, I find them lyrically and musically repetitive.\n\nI really did want to like The Light Meets The Dark.  Tenth Avenue North has a gift for putting familiar truths into fresh, encouraging packages.  But the repetitive nature of the songs here makes it only average.","summary":"The Light Meets the Dark is Just Gray","unixReviewTime":1430784000,"vote":null,"image":null}
