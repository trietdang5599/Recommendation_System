A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,"KISS is a rock n roll band. In the 1970-80s era, they embodied an aspect of rock alongside the Who, the Stones and the others. Most of their music is high testosterone, like ""Strutter,"" ""Hard Luck Woman,"" and ""I Was Made for Loving You,"" bordering on self-parody. They were and are fun.

Then there's ""Beth."" It is a quiet song, but is gritty in its message. It isn't a metal ballad, but could have just easily been performed by Bread. There is depth, passion, and love. It is poetic, melodic, and, in my opinion, has earned its spot as one of rock music's greatest songs.

If the rest of KISS' songwriting was on par with ""Beth,"" KISS could've been more than a fun band stuck its era, but had a legacy to last until the end of rock n roll.

It begins:

Beth, I hear you callin'
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playin'
And we just can't find the sound

It ends:
Beth, I know you're lonely
And I hope you'll be alright
'Cause me and the boys will be playin'
All night

Look, if you are reading this review, you already know the song. Nothing here that's new. I suppose my review is for that one guy on the planet who loves KISS but magically, mysteriously missed this song. Is that even possible?

AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000VZQHNS,-1,1,5,"Nelly Furtado completely remade herself in 2006.  Her earlier work, including hits ""I'm Like a Bird"" and ""Powerless"" were fun and entertaining songs (and Nelly is a very attractive, appealing artist), but they didn't excite the mass audiences.  They had more appeal to the Adult Contemporary chart.

  2006 saw the debut of her song ""Promiscuous"", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take ""Promiscuous"" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This set the tone for the remainder of her album ""Loose"", which showed her new image to be genuine instead of posed.","Nelly Furtado completely remade herself in 2006 .

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5,"The 90s backlash has been ugly, with this not only 90s classic, but music classic being pushed aside since radio chewed it up and spit it back out, 1,000 spins later. It still lives on in the minds of millions of fans who still put this high up on their life's soundtrack.

It's a song that runs on a million trains of thoughts, ranging from karma, to self-appreciation, to celebrity-bashing. It's certainly ground-breakingly awesome, bringing awesomeness to another level not only in the world of pop rock, but music period. Hearkening back to those piano-driven pop ballads of the 70s, this outwardly simple song holds a lot of complexity to it. Just ask U2 guitarist/song-writer ""The Edge."" When asked in Time Magazine back in '06 what songs he would most like to have written, there was ""Wonderwall,"" and ""You Get What You Give."" And even though some would say it's a throwback to years gone by, it keeps itself a modern eye, staying relevant not only in the 90s, but also in the 00s.

Then you gotta love those vocals, using the False, and they're just so perfect for the song. And again, it's a throwback to the 70s. As for the last few verses, although some outlets have cut them, I don't really care about them, and they kind box the song in the 90s a little bit too much. Although the way he sings it is great, it's kind of here nor there, didn't need that.

So looking at best 90s songs, this ranks in the top 10, which is pretty impressive considering the litnia of the decade. Once the brutal 90s backlash is over this song and ones like it will once again receive the credit they deserve, but until then, ""You Get What You Give"" will play on as the soundtrack for a moment in time, forever frozen in splendor.","The 90s backlash has been ugly , with this not only 90s classic , but music classic being pushed aside since radio chewed it up and spit it back out , 1,000 spins later .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000VZUIAQ,1,1,4,"Often, there are times a song can touch you simply from the heart. When it comes to Snow Patrol, they had struggled for years trying to make it happen in the underground scene. But, their breakthrough song, Chasing Cars from their album Eyes Open, was one of the most soulful songs released in 2006. I like this song because it simply comes straight from the heart, and is just a very simple song. I also hope they don't get classified as a one hit wonder either, the guys feel like they actually have something else up their sleeves soon.

'My Favorite Mistake' in particular, the first track talks about a relationship that is almost just for show and not working out well. Even Sheryl admits it's a ""mistake"".

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000W02O2K,1,1,5,"Dreams by The Cranberries is a powerful 90s rock song that is both stirring and healing to the soul.  Fighting the Urge to Look Up The Meaning to the Song, Dreams is about coming to terms with multiple changes happening in someones life while appreciating a person who occupies a large place in your heart (metaphorically).  I recently enjoyed hearing Dreams by The Cranberries on iheartradio because it is not played as often on the radio where I currently live  I completely understand that this song could mean something completely different from what Im guessing it is but for me the song reminds me of my husband in a benevolent way.  This is because he has helped me add even more brighter colors (metaphorically speaking) to my life and has helped me appreciate life even more just by his example of how he sees the positive benefits in certain things that would test even the strongest of souls.  Hence, when the lead singer of Cranberries sings you're a dream to me it reminds me of how I have told this to my husband before (just in slightly different words). Overall, Dreams by Cranberry is both an elevating and novelty type of rock song.","Dreams by The Cranberries is a powerful 90s rock song that is both stirring and healing to the soul .

In this case, FOB goes for a breakup song, which most creative in the song title, is written in TXT MSS. Thankfully, the song is not sung in that. In style, this song resembles 'Arms Race' a little to closely, but differs in minor, but better, changes in the verses and chorus.

Their first single here, comes off less as a single, and more as an arena-anthem. As a single, I thought it was good when in first came out, catchy, unique, good build-up. However, this song has worn on me, and not by radio mind you, but just the song itself. The song could be described as an angry power-rock (rather than power-pop) anthem, and because of the style that goes along with a song like this, it just doesn't hold any staying power. Maybe for a month or two, but then it's history.

So overall, if you've never heard the song, try it, you might like it.

This multi-track was then mixed and dubbed down onto 16-track tape. This process was repeated across all 16 tracks to create a lush 256-voice ""virtual"" choir that could ""sing"" chromatic chords.[2] A number of these prepared multi-tracks were then cut into several endless loops, each of which contained the basic notes of the main chords used in the song. The chorus loops could then be played by using the mixing desk rather like a keyboardeach chord could be sounded by bringing up the fader for that loop. The instrumental break featured the repeated spoken phrase, ""Big boys don't cry..."", spoken by Kathy Warren, the receptionist of their own Strawberry Studios where the band recorded the track. These whispered lyrics would later serve as the inspiration for Brit  group, The Cure, who had an album and song called Boys Don't Cry.

This album is a testament to the life the hip-hop femme fatale has lived, and it's her most truthful work to date. From the vagaries of love to life's struggles to the business of music, Brown completely opens up, detailing every last secret that has haunted her career.
On ""A Letter,"" she dedicates a verse to her mother and each of her brothers, apologizing for her mistakes. Then on ""730,"" a bouncy track produced by Loafey, Foxy speaks directly to another woman who's trying to rain on her parade. But that doesn't mean that the entire album is about heartache, as reggae-influenced songs like ""Tables Will Turn,"" featuring Baby Cham, and ""Oh Yeah,"" featuring Spragga Benz, introduce a new wrinkle to Brown's rapping style.

She admits it saying ""Yeah I did, but I blew um up the same"". ""Tables will turn"" is anotehr tight song that I think is on of the tightest on the cd...produced by regage producer Dave kelly. In regage dave kelly is the equivalent of timbaland in hip-hop so she couldn't get any better with him. The songs I like the most are: Oh Yeah, Bk Anthem, The letter, 730, tables will turn, hood scriptures, run dem, na na be like, so hot, and teh saddest day.

Sometimes, Johnny gets a little mellow on some cuts given the maturity and adult romantic feel of the songs. I still love the gorgeous Let's Get the Mood Right. It makes for good music to hear in the bedroom late at night.  Other favorites are Touch, Maybe and Having Illusions. I love the sexy It's Your Body and the late Roger Troutman of Zapp being on it. One of Roger's best of his final performances when he was alive. It still surprises me that he would follow the somewhat uneven Provocative with this well sung, well performed effort.  Staying True to himself and his vocal style is what makes his third Motown album my second favorite album by him.","This is such a wonderful effort . It consists of mostly ballads , but Johnny Gill pulls it off on all the songs . Sometimes , Johnny gets a little mellow on some cuts given the maturity and adult romantic feel of the songs . I still love the gorgeous Let 's Get the Mood Right . It makes for good music to hear in the bedroom late at night . Other favorites are Touch , Maybe and Having Illusions . I love the sexy It 's Your Body and the late Roger Troutman of Zapp being on it . One of Roger 's best of his final performances when he was alive .

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W11NDU,-1,-1,3,"Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album? Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself, and everyone said he was coming off too cocky. Well, Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition's Home Again came out, so wasn't he being a little cocky himself? Yeah, everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo, but to be honest, this wasn't his best album.
Take the Babyface-penned title track, for example. The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus: ""Let's get the mood right/Turn on your heart light."" Turn on your heart light? That's too cheesy, even for Babyface. And ""Love In An Elevator"" is full of corny lyrics like ""They say there's no luck on the thirteenth floor/But I found love and so much more"" and ""Like The Staples, I wanna take you there."" ""Simply Say I Love You"" is okay, but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember hearing Stevie in that song.
The only songs that really stand out are ""Maybe"" and ""It's Your Body"". The latter features Roger Troutman, and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible. The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing: sex, sex, and more sex. The sleepy production doesn't make things better, either.
Another problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs, especially the very last track, ""So Gentle"". It features a rap from Ron DeVoe, so you know what the main problem is. But the thing is that the preceding song ""I Know You Want Me"" features uninspired rapping from some other guy, and his rapping is actually worse than Ron's.
I still like Johnny Gill, but this album seems like it was rushed. And the strong adlibs he's known for usually adds feeling to the songs, but here it seems like they're trying to hide the questionable material. You're better off getting the solo albums he made before this.","Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album ?

AJK5WHV1GW941,B000W11N6W,1,1,5,"It isn't hard to say that this is a good album, it fact, it is not hard to say this album is nothing short of a masterpiece.  India. Arie delivers a brilliant sophomore album entitled, ""Voyage to India"".  In fact, if this album was really a ""voyage"" to somewhere, many would probably pay top dollar to be there!

 This is such a positive album.  The lyrics just make any listener smile.  Anyone who knows anything about India knows she loves to play the guitar, and it is evident that she loves the guitar when listening to her album.  There is a guitar in every song on the album.  Although I think she's a bit indulgent with the guitar, she doesn't bore the listener with it.  It actually sounds right nice and adds something distinctive to her album.

 ""Good Man"" is definitely an album highlight.  The lyrics are meaningful and real.  The song is about a man who has children and if anything ever happens to him, he wants his children to know he loved them and that he was a good man.  Many parents can relate to this song because it's the same way they feel about their children.  ""Talk to Her"" has one of those beats you can snap your fingers and bob your head to.  Aside from the laid back beat, the song offers a very relevant message in today's world; talk to women with respect (men).  This song has simple lyrics, but they say so much.  I love it!  ""God is Real"" is another one of the many beautiful songs on ""Voyage to India"".  This song has a very noticeable guitar in the background.  India's vocals are really good on this track, they help the song to be more believable.  The song is about questioning the existence of God.  India does an excellent job of stating her claim of why she thinks or as she says ""knows"" that God is real.  ""Can I Walk With You"" and ""The One"" are just nice love songs.  India's vocals are, again, on point for these tracks.  If anyone were to ask me to pick to tracks to listen to on this album, I'd go with these.  The album contains no fillers, just brilliant work by a great artist of today.  If debating on whether or not to cop this one, GET IT NOW!  India will take you by surprise, like she did men.  I am very impressed with the talent of this woman.  She's a shining star! 5 star album!

A24P8BEJ26FU01,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3,"RnB/Soul singer, India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002. Most sophomore albums by other neo-soul artists, such as D'Angelo and Macy Gray (note that I haven't heard either of these albums) were deemed by fans to have fallen to the dreaded sophomore slump so India Arie had a lot to prove. India Arie proved she had undeniable talent with her debut album, both lyrically and vocally and most fans tend to compare the two albums. On both, India Arie wrote or co-wrote all the songs and she writes about meaningful topics such as self-respect and communication in relationships. On her sophomore album, ""Voyage To India"", India Arie provides her wonderful lyrics and vocals in songs that seem to tell what many women are thinking of, rather than being self-reflective as she was on her debut.
India Arie starts her sophomore album off with a short intro, just over a minute in length, called ""Growth"" which states that the only thing that is constant in the world is change. It's a somewhat pointless intro, but the statement she makes is definitely True. The second track is an mid-tempo song called ""Little Things"". As expected by the title, this song talks about appreciating the little things in life such as a ""call in the morning from my little sister singing me happy birthday"". As with most of India Arie's songs, the lyrics are not complex but are beautiful in their simplicity. Next comes ""Talk To Her"", a somewhat preachy song about how to talk to a woman. India Arie instructs the listener to treat the woman with respect and ""talk to her the way you want someone to talk to your mama"". In other words, talk to her respectfully no matter what she's wearing (""It doesn't matter if she's wearing a miniskirt or a business suit""), a message that desperately needs to be heard in today's society. The song also talks about the importance of respect and communication in relationships.
Afterwards comes the mid-tempo ""Slow Down"", a debatable album highlight. The song speaks about taking life day by day and not rushing through everything. The lyrics are once again simple yet beautiful. It's about remembering that speed isn't always the best way to achieve your goals. Next comes the romantic ""The Truth"", with its lyrics seemingly half-spoken, half-sung (more like spoken to a tune). Nonetheless, a sweet, romantic song about what India Arie loves about her man. The next song, ""Beautiful Surprise"", has a similar theme about finding love when you least expect it. It was written by India Arie alone and really shows off her talent for songwriting. After comes a short interlude, ""Healing"" which talks briefly about releasing all sadness from you. Like most interludes however, it is not too memorable.
Subsequently come two songs about moving away from the pains of the past, ""Get It Together"" and ""Headed in The Right Direction"". ""Get It Together"" is another somewhat preachy song that talks about having to get it together to heal your body and heart. It is a beautiful song when you listen to it but in the grand scheme of things, it does not stand out. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" fares much better, probably because it is more upbeat however it is fairly short compared to the other songs on the album. After that comes ""Can I Walk With You"" is an album highlight that seems to talk about taking friendship to another level and it is probably my favourite song on the album. Then comes ""The One"", a very overused song title but this is probably one of the better songs of that title. Lyrically and vocally it is a unique (in a good way) song but it is also quite short.
Next comes ""Complicated Melody"" another romantic, metaphoric song that compares India's man to colours, numbers and songs. It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice. Otherwise, it adds little to the quality of the album. The song, while it sounds nice, is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons. Following this comes another interlude, ""Gratitude"" which is not much different from the other two. Then comes another highlight, ""Good Man"", another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album. India's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well. The second last track, ""God Is Real"" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album. Finally, there is the bonus track ""Interested"" which doesn't stand out at all compared to the other tracks. The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great.
Overall Mark: 3/5
Although this is still a great album, ""Voyage To India"" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie's debut so good. The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other. As a whole the album sounds great, but when you break it down, many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and, of course, different lyrics. India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists, like Jewel (similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop), so memorable. The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable.","RnB / Soul singer , India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002 .

Lyrically and vocally it is a unique ( in a good way ) song but it is also quite short . Next comes "" Complicated Melody "" another romantic , metaphoric song that compares India 's man to colours , numbers and songs . It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice . Otherwise , it adds little to the quality of the album . The song , while it sounds nice , is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons . Following this comes another interlude , "" Gratitude "" which is not much different from the other two . Then comes another highlight , "" Good Man "" , another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album . India 's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well . The second last track , "" God Is Real "" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album . Finally , there is the bonus track "" Interested "" which does n't stand out at all compared to the other tracks . The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great . Although this is still a great album , "" Voyage To India "" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie 's debut so good . The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other . As a whole the album sounds great , but when you break it down , many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and , of course , different lyrics . India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists , like Jewel ( similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop ) , so memorable . The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable ."

A1IV4XBV2XEQPQ,B000W11N6W,1,1,4,"Sometimes simplicity can go a long way. That is why artists like India. Arie manage to survive and succeed in an industry of overproduction and glitz. Arie returns after bearing her ""Acoustic Soul"" to the world. She is now ready to take us on a ""Voyage To India"" and it's worth taking.
Although the first track'""Growth,"" is an interlude opening up the second chapter in Arie's anthology, this record, in many senses, is more of a continuation of the previous rather than an evolution of the artist.
The only difference is the first single ""Little Things"" which is a track that, surprisingly, does not have any guitars on it, but its lyrics capture the same granola down-to-earth essence as her debut single ""Video.""
""Talk to Her"" is a run-on song. But Arie's way with melodies is best depicted by the mood jam ""Slow Down"" and the uplifting folk ditty ""Beautiful Surprise.""
Considering all aspects Arie brings into her craft, one could say that Arie's sound is a cross between Erykah Badu and Tracy Chapman.
Arie's diverse influences play a role in her distinct sound. As she has stated in her previous album, her influences range from Stevie Wonder to Karen Carpenter.
""Get It Together"", a song about maintaining strength when times are rough, captures that with her warm vocals and guitar-lead melody. Then, ""Headed In The Right Direction"" starts out like an '80's Luther Vandross anthem and then wanes towards the end.
All songs aside, Arie shines most on ""Can I Walk With You"" - a song about the need to belong. Arie's vocals on this song depict a yearning like no other. This is definitely a gem, if Motown Records had any sense this would be the next single.
""Voyage To India"" then meanders into sharp beats on ""The One"" and ""Complicated Melody,"" which is exactly what it says - it doesn't go anywhere. But the fall is cushioned by ""Good Man"" and the bonus track ""Interested,"" which keeps Arie's soulful tradition alive.
This album is bound to be a coffee shop favorite.
It contains slow jams, simple, yet deep folk numbers and sultry vocals. Although it is a well-rounded album, it sounds more like ""Acoustic Soul 2"" rather than a record with its own unique taste.","Sometimes simplicity can go a long way .

Sure, she gets preachy at times on here, but that's only on two or three songs, and even those are good. And every time I listen to this album, I love it even more.
""Little Things"" is an okay song for a first single, but there are better songs than that on here. Check out the two highlights, ""Good Man"", where India tells a story about a man who tells his wife to remember him if he dies someday, and ""Talk to Her"" (which is still very preachy), where India tells men to respect their women. The latter, as well as a few other songs, features Laurnea, who's been M.I.A. from the industry for a while. Where did India find her??? Even as a backup singer, she shines like she always did.
""Can I Walk With You"" has that ready-for-VH1 feel to it, as does ""Interested"", but that doesn't make these songs any less engaging. Also, I noticed that ""Slow Down"" has the same melody as last year's ""Back to the Middle"". But this album is still solid. Don't buy it expecting some kind of growth in songwriting or spiritual evolution (it's only been a year since her Acoustic Soul album).

ABE14SVILZLNY,B000W11N6W,-1,1,5,"With the surprise double-platinum success of 2001's Acoustic Soul, India. Arie became that rare bird -- particularly in contemporary R&B -- who straddles the line between artistic innovation and schmaltz. Certainly a talented guitar-playing songstress, she also takes her lyrical cues from Hallmark cards, a mix at once comfortable and off-putting -- and difficult to put one's finger on.
This follow-up, seemingly rushed into stores, doesn't clear up the confusion; as with Alicia Keys, it's almost impossible to criticize a contemporary urban artist who writes life-affirming, organic songs, yet this journey ends as unconvincingly as Soul or Songs in A Minor. What's more, it lacks any sort of knockout number -- Soul had two, ""Video"" and ""Brown Skin"" -- leaving us to wonder just where Arie intended on taking us.
Which is not to say that the potential isn't there, only that balance is not. Is she the younger visage of Tracy Chapman (""The One,"" ""Power of Words"")? Channeling Chaka Khan on two gleefully old school steppin' tracks, ""Interested"" and ""Slow Down""? When she takes her own advice to ""live for the moment,"" she gets better results: ""Get it Together"" is a swirling slam-dunk of a love song, and ""Good Man,"" an overlooked track off the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, makes a nice fit here. When she comes off preachy, it's with treacly results: ""God is Real"" and ""Little Things"" are cloying bits of armchair philosophy.
Voyage is at its most interesting, and often its best, when Arie tries to come from out of the shadows of her influences and chart her own path. Though she stumbles on ""The Truth"" trying to incorporate slicker R&B-style beats into the mix, the titular Spanish folk tinges of ""Headed in the Right Direction"" says it all, as does ""India's Song,"" which could have been the album's most overwrought track but instead perfectly mixes Chapman's subdued introspection with Woody Guthrie's wide-eyed folk. These are the tracks suggest the voyage isn't over; it may have only just begun.","With the surprise double - platinum success of 2001 's Acoustic Soul , India .

First off the production is weaker than on ""Acoustic"" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either.
Tired duds like ""Little Things"" and the predictably titled ""God Is Love"" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for ""deep"" when they come off like Hallmark card messages.
Bland ""folk""-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead ""Voyage"" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. ""Good Man"" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record.
Fortunately, ""Voyage"" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. ""The Truth"" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired ""love yourself"" retreads.

Look, ""Voyage To India"" makes India to be more of a ""Black-girl"" version of bland, ""folk"" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being ""bootylicious"" or partying or ""her man"" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on ""Voyage"" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not ""deep"".

A3FWHXSZSTKFIU,B000W11N6W,-1,-1,3,"Coming off of a classic first album, we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician/singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts.  The grooves swing, the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great. The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record.
But you know how an artist's intentions can be TOO clear?  The messages too in-your-face?  How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away?  That's what's wrong here.
The problem I have is with the lyrics: they're WAY too preachy.
I thought that the music was so well-done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio, but that's turned out to not be the case.  A song will come in with a great beat, great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you're inundated with Sunday School-level lessons for three minutes.  Where's the risk-taking of ""Brown Skin"" or the gutsy self-confidence of ""Video""?  Where's the humanity of ""Ready for Love"" or the philisophical punch of ""I See God In You""?  It's just not there this time around.  It's almost as if she's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages.  This album is cursed with the kind of ""We Are the World"" heavy-handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year.
Great playing mired in WAY heavy-handed and too-simple lyrics.  The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar, which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much-needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity.  This, however, is too far at the other end of the love/hate spectrum.  If I wanted a gospel album, I'd have bought a gospel album.  She's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well, which is fine, but because of that there's a lot of not-great sap here too.  Not even racy, midnight-mood, slow-jammy sap...it's just simplistic I'm-in-love type stuff that, lyrically, you could get anywhere.
The shining track here is ""The One"" but it's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record.  This is all a terrible shame; I wanted to like this one, especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of (groan) Alicia Keyes, but this record falls short in the most important department: the message.","Coming off of a classic first album , we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician / singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts . The grooves swing , the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great . The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record . But you know how an artist 's intentions can be TOO clear ? The messages too in - your - face ? How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you 're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away ? That 's what 's wrong here . The problem I have is with the lyrics : they 're WAY too preachy . I thought that the music was so well - done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio , but that 's turned out to not be the case . A song will come in with a great beat , great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you 're inundated with Sunday School - level lessons for three minutes . Where 's the risk - taking of "" Brown Skin "" or the gutsy self - confidence of "" Video "" ? Where 's the humanity of "" Ready for Love "" or the philisophical punch of "" I See God In You "" ? It 's just not there this time around . It 's almost as if she 's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it 's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages .

A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000W15BBK,1,1,5,"Maybe you heard the Adam Lambert or Alan Jackson version, but the Man in Black is who made it an international hit in 1963.

Johnny co-wrote it with his soon-to-be-wife June. Their daughter Rosanne said, ""The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.""

I have this on my running playlist. There is are mariachi-style horns and guitar-drum beat which pace this excellently for runners looking for more pep in their step.

""Love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire.""

I full recommend ""Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash.

AKGF27HN0OF19,B000W11NQ2,1,1,4,"Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one, and for the most part it works well.  After dabbling with country on the ""Riddles In The Sand"" album, Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on ""Mango"".  ""Please Bypass This Heart"" is nothing spectacular, but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it's best with ""If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me"".  I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song (this is coming from a guy who does not like country music).  Other highlights on the album include ""Frank And Lola"" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re-kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida.  ""Desperation Samba"" is another great Buffett ""south of the border"" tune.  The title track ""Last Mango In Paris"" is classic Buffett.  The album closer ""Beyond The End"" is a song a lot of Buffett fans don't seem to care for, but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc.  The album also includes several of Buffett's popular concert favorites ""Jolly Mon"" and ""Gypsies In The Palace"".  Some of the production on this album is very 80's oriented which dates it a bit, but overall this is another good album from Jimmy.","Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one , and for the most part it works well .

Yet, his music was definitely a cavalcade of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well. But when he did a cover song that was out of the ordinary, he not only made it his own nicely, but it sometimes still stands taller than the original artist in that tone. The prime example of Johnny's musical intimacy came nearly at the end of his life when he did a cover of Nice Inch Nails song Hurt. The song is definitely something still worth listening too. Not just from Johnny's voice, but also because of his simplicity of the guitar and piano. It is a great song to listen too, not just if you are a die hard Johnny Cash fan, but also for anyone who is new to his music. Get this, and you won't be hurt.

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000W1877U,1,1,5,"Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year's ""Ys,"" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk.

And after the solemnities of ""Ys,"" apparently Newsom has decided to go a bit more lighthearted. ""Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band"" is an unpretentious little EP, with some new songs and new takes on older songs -- a fun little treat.

It opens with the strong folky chords of ""Colleen,"" a slice of Celtic-flavoured balladry that trickles through an oddball melody. ""I tell it as I best know how,"" croons Newsom in her crazy-fairy voice. ""Pick me up and toss me round/I lost my shoes and tore my best gown...""

She then follows it up with new versions of two older songs: the gentle haunting reimagining of ""Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"" and a full-band version of ""Cosmia,"" which seems nicely fleshed-out and polished.

After to the legendary grandeur of ""Ys,"" this little EP seems relaxed and laid-back, as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set. They're done with an ear for fun, but that doesn't take the delicate, appealing edge from the music.

Her twangly, delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes, and what sounds like some soft drums, all mingled together. In ""Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"" we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp. And over it all is Newsom's creaky, meandering vocals, wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy.

One new song and two reworkings, but ""Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band"" is stil worth getting for anyone who likes eerie, weird little folk songs.","Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year 's "" Ys , "" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk .

AJK5WHV1GW941,B000W176MM,1,1,4,"I would hear Kem on the radio, mostly on the stations which focused on playing jazz music and said to myself, ""This is just where this artist belongs"". I liked his voice from the first time I was introduced to it. It's very unique and befitting for jazz. It has been a long time since I have heard Kem on the radio, but something just compelled me to pick up his debut album and listen closely; I'm glad I did.

Please be warned: The younger generation may not like or appreciate this album. For example, when I was listening to this album, my brother gave me a crazy look and said, ""What the hell are you listening to?"" On the contrast, my older sister heard me playing the LP and said, ""You know about Kem? I didn't know you liked Kem!"" I really don't want to limit him to a particular audience, by this really is grown folks music. There is not one up-tempo song  in sight, just slow jams and mid-tempos. Everyone doesn't always like fast music anyway; I'm one of them. I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music. I get so tired of it, I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays. ""Love Calls"" was the first single from ""Kemistry"" and what a fantastic song it is! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about. This song is very laid back and mellow; it's sure to put one in a romantic mindset. Also, the lyrics are really good. He's letting the listening know that when love calls, there is no where to hide. ""Inside"" and ""Cherish this Moment"" are fine moments on the album. These tracks actually bring Sade to mind. I love the hook on ""Inside"" simply because it's catchy. This album is slightly flawed because it was boring in a few areas, but overall, I was impressed.  He did a fine job.

Mikeisha's Top 5

1. ""Inside""
2. ""Brotha Man""

4. ""I'm Missin' Your Love""

A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"First let me say that I love the wordplay used for the title of Kem's debut album.  Now on to the music - initially when I heard his first single, LOVE CALLS, I thought it was Al Jarreau but as the song went on I realized that it was a new artist named Kem. The rest of the songs are totally and unmistakably, KEM!!

I love the vibe of this entire album and had a hard time not pressing repeat on a few songs, namely: LOVE CALLS, MATTER OF TIME, SAY & YOU ARE.
Yes, it is more of a ""chill out"" album but certainly not one that bored me - I found myself paying attention to the adult lyrics and the beautiful music production.  I'd highly recommend this disc to lovers of r&b mixed with subtle jazz notes - it's a great debut from a real artist who I hope to hear much more from in the future (despite his sorry label and lack of promotion).","First let me say that I love the wordplay used for the title of Kem 's debut album .

A3IC5E3OFHYAZX,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"Yeah, the '80s may have watered it down with excessive layers of synthesizers and the general favoring of style over substance. Sure, the '90s have all but stomped it out due to the ubiquitous presence of hip-hop's ""dark"" side (heavily-programmed instruments, blatant sampling, offensive lyrics, bad singing). However, thanks to budding artists like Kem Owens, soul music has finally come around full-circle after 20+ years of musical diarrhea.

Kem's sparkling debut should truly set the standard in terms of what to look for in good soul music: REAL INSTRUMENTS (played by REAL MUSICIANS, of course), REAL SONGS (inspired, meaningful lyrics and solid composition skills), and REAL SINGING ABILITY (knowing HOW to sing in addition to having vocal talent). If more and more artists today would just adhere to these relatively simple guidelines, then there wouldn't be so much bad music out there to begin with. An album containing a few hit singles and a load of filler doesn't do it for me. That's why I'm recommending 'Kemistry' to ANYONE who honestly craves good music without the hype to go with it.

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"I remember hearing ""Love Calls"" being played on the radio at work all the time, and the DJ never said who made the song. Maybe the DJ didn't know, because nobody else did either. When I finally found out the song was from a newcomer named Kem and that his album Kemistry was out, my brother and sister told me to pick the album up. And boy, talk about good advice.
Since ""Love Calls"" is the first single, it's probably also the most recognizable song on the album - but I don't know if I would necessarily say it's the best song. Not to say it isn't a great song, but there are other great tracks too, like ""Inside"" (no, it's not about sex) and the gospel-flavored ""This Place"". And ""Brotha Man"" is a great storytelling track.
With ten tracks at around 47 minutes, it's clear that Kem isn't a debut artist who's trying to overprove himself. And he doesn't need to, because every song on this album is great. So why isn't he getting the recognition he deserves? Probably because he's on Motown, the label that seems to only promote artists when they feel like it (see also Remy Shand). But hopefully Kem will soon sell several copies of this great release.","I remember hearing "" Love Calls "" being played on the radio at work all the time , and the DJ never said who made the song .

AA8HFTJIAQA4G,B000W176MM,-1,-1,3,"Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound. Well not new just different from most contemporary music today. Essentially he's a jazz singer when you break it down. Listening to his CD is like an extended set of the ""Oasis After Dark"". He released this CD on his own a year ago and after sellin 10,000 copies he managed to get the attention of Motown. Listening to this CD is difficult because while the tone is great and his vocals are good there seems to be something missing. I often found myself asleep before the CD was finished. Kinda like listening to one of those ""Sounds of The Earth"" CD's ... or something to help you go to sleep. 10 distinct songs about love and life. He goes from an Al Jarreau sound on Track 7 ""Brotha Man"" till a Simply Redd feel on Track 3 ""Say"", my favorite track on the CD by the way. Soothing is the best thing I guess you can say about this CD. A nice CD to go to sleep to. Now whether that's a compliment or not I'm not sure. This is definitely not for everyone, but the Jazz Enthusiast will probably be more likely to find use for this CD. ""Is it like Floetry""? No. They are more hip than this CD. ""Is It like SADE""? No. She invokes more soul in her music. ""Al Jarreau?"" No. Jarreau is more livelier than this cat. This one still kind puzzles me. My favorite cuts are 3,4,5,and 6. See if you can get a better grasp on it than I can.","Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound . Well not new just different from most contemporary music today .

A2ZTFPWOPNNHTW,B000W176MM,1,1,4,"After hearing ""Love Calls"" on the radio, I had to hear more from this gifted vocalist. At first listen, I could hear the purity and the many dimensions of that VOICE, which is soothing, smooth like 18 year old Appleton, seductive, and playful. Kem is not your ordinary run of the mill singer but an extraordinary song stylist. His voice dips and dives, rounds syllables (much like Al, Anita, & Phyllis), scats, and just downright croons.
After getting ahold of Kemistry I was not dissappointed, rather joyous of the fact that I owned a solid musical experience. This is adult music at its finest. The ambience is intimate and jazzy. The instrumentation is also complimentary to Kem's vocal prowess. There are also nice percussive elements that add to the vibe of the cd.

AGEIT17HENDIS,B000W1AO4Y,-1,-1,3,"I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw (in the good sense) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums. First, on the Hank Williams tribute album, ""Timeless"", where she did a cover of his classic tale of love's trials and tribulations ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself. I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt's ""Beulah Land"" on his tribute album. Finally, I noted the fine job that she did on a duet with John Prine on ""Wedding Bells"" on his ""In Spite Of Ourselves"" cover album of country classics.

That said, although I have high, very high regard for Ms. Williams' cover work I am more ambivalent about her own albums. This album under review is such a case. I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs. She, obviously, can write thoughtfully of love, lost, the cruel nature of the world, her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above-mentioned efforts is missing here. A few do, however, stand out. ""Mama You Sweet"", ""Words"", ""West"" and ""Rescue"" clearly rise to the occasion. As I say, the rest is so-so and suffer a little from trying to cross-over from her country base.","I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw ( in the good sense ) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums .

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4,"Although Lucinda Williams has been doing her thing for almost thirty years, it seems that she didn't really get a WHOLE lot of attention until she released Car Wheels on a Gravel Road in 1998. That album was so influential that it seems that all of her albums after that point will be compared to it, which might account for all the negative reviews for her latest album, West.

Actually, now that I think about it, this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options. But if this is your first Lucinda Williams album, I suggest you get educated on some of her earlier material first. She doesn't sound different or anything, but, well, Lucinda is another one of those singers that makes great songs yet she doesn't have a great voice, so if you're not a fan of hers, this album might put you to sleep. But it really IS very accessible.

Lucinda composed this album following the death of her mother, which is probably why most of the songs are mellow. They don't drown into each other though, as I can easily pick up highlights like ""Are You Alright"", ""Learning How to Live"" and the title track. And the songs about her mother are poignant yet exceptional, as shown in ""Mama You Sweet"" and especially ""Fancy Funeral"". But my favorite song would probably have to be ""Words"".

While I can do without ""Come On"" and the nine-minute spoken word ""Wrap My Head Around That"", the rest of the album is quality Lucinda. It might not be her best album, but it's far above-average, so if you want to find exceptional music, go west.

A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"The career of singer/songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP, ""West.""

A moody collection of life, love and Americana, the record testifies to her ever-evolving talent and drive for musical perfection.

Williams is a tough chick -- the kind you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of -- but her sensitivity comes to the forefront once again.

""Are You Alright?,"" the lead single and opening track, is beautiful in its stark vulnerability. Asking questions such as, ""Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?"" and ""Is there anything I can do?,"" Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would-be lover. She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored, unyielding honesty.

This upfront quality permeates the collection. ""Everything Has Changed,"" for instance, underscores the monotony of life, whereas the richly melodic ""What If"" has Williams questioning many so-called facts of life.

""Where Is My Love?"" is passionate and pleading in its quest for the ultimate affirmation, appropriately going hand in hand with the autobiographical song ""Learning How to Live."" A particular standout, the latter finds Williams picking up the pieces of her life and moving on after a difficult breakup:

""'All I have left is this dime store ring/But I wouldn't trade it for anything/The days ahead will never be the same/For you I might have even changed my name/I'm learning how to live.""

The melancholy edge of the disc can also be attributed to the recent death of her mother, whom she pays tribute to in the desperate yet understated ""Mama You Sweet."" This experience surely played a part in the composition of another standout track, ""Fancy Funeral."":

""So don't buy a fancy funeral/It's not worth it in the end/Goodbyes can still be beautiful/With all the money that you'll spend/There's no amount of riches/Can bring back what you lost.""

Her search for love continues on the haunting, lyrically intense ""Unsuffer Me.""

Alternately, ""Rescue"" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress.

Different melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album. ""Wrap My Head Around That"" has funky, organic grooves with clean-cut lyrics that don't mess around with pretense or metaphors, and the surprisingly upbeat ""Come On"" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame.

""Words"" attests to the life-affirming power of language, whether uttered or harbored within, providing the most seductive melody of the disc, while the title track closes the album with her most evocative lyrics yet:

""I sleep out in the desert/Under the stars above/And keep making an effort/To wander into love/Who knows what the future holds/Or where the cards may fall/But if you don't come out west and see/You'll never know at all.""

Williams will likely never be able to replicate the cultural impact of her already classic 1998 album ""Car Wheels On a Gravel Road,"" but ""West"" proves that her talents as a musician continue to mature.

With her compelling abilities to connect with listeners on such an intricate, personal level, it is no surprise that more than 20 years into her career, her fanbase only continues to expand.

iTunes and Best Buy are among a myriad of music retailers that sell slightly different versions of ""West,"" offering various bonus demos of the album's selections.","The career of singer / songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP , "" West . A moody collection of life , love and Americana , the record testifies to her ever - evolving talent and drive for musical perfection . Williams is a tough chick -- the kind you would n't want to get on the wrong side of -- but her sensitivity comes to the forefront once again . "" Are You Alright ? , "" the lead single and opening track , is beautiful in its stark vulnerability . Asking questions such as , "" Do you have someone to hug and kiss you ? "" and "" Is there anything I can do ? , "" Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would - be lover . She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored , unyielding honesty . This upfront quality permeates the collection . "" Everything Has Changed , "" for instance , underscores the monotony of life , whereas the richly melodic "" What If "" has Williams questioning many so - called facts of life . "" Where Is My Love ? "" is passionate and pleading in its quest for the ultimate affirmation , appropriately going hand in hand with the autobiographical song "" Learning How to Live . "" A particular standout , the latter finds Williams picking up the pieces of her life and moving on after a difficult breakup : 

 "" ' All I have left is this dime store ring / But I would n't trade it for anything / The days ahead will never be the same / For you I might have even changed my name / I'm learning how to live . "" 

 The melancholy edge of the disc can also be attributed to the recent death of her mother , whom she pays tribute to in the desperate yet understated "" Mama You Sweet . "" This experience surely played a part in the composition of another standout track , "" Fancy Funeral . "" : 

 "" So do n't buy a fancy funeral / It 's not worth it in the end / Goodbyes can still be beautiful / With all the money that you 'll spend / There 's no amount of riches / Can bring back what you lost . "" 

 Her search for love continues on the haunting , lyrically intense "" Unsuffer Me . Alternately , "" Rescue "" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress . Different melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album . "" Wrap My Head Around That "" has funky , organic grooves with clean - cut lyrics that do n't mess around with pretense or metaphors , and the surprisingly upbeat "" Come On "" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame .

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4,"'West' is definately a step in the right direction after 'World Without Tears'. Vocally there isn't a lot different than Willaims has ever done. Musically, she or her producer, Hal Willner, has taken a few positive strides.

I do agree with others the lead-off track is one of the weakest on this disk. The repetativeness is completely distracting and not worthy of Willams' talents.  Ditto w/""Mama You Sweet"".

The strongest tracks are by far ""Unsuffer Me"", ""Where is My Love"", ""Rescue"", ""What If"" and ""Wrap My Head Around It"".  Especially the strings on ""Unsuffer Me"" and the guitar on ""Where is My Love"" really make the songs.  They are subtle yet make all the difference.

I do like ""Fancy Funeral"", though it is a little down...even for me.  ""Come On"" starts really good, but it doesn't really go anywhere.

The good thing is, the rest of the songs are perfectly serviceable.  Nothing outstanding, but nothing making me hit the 'skip' button like I did with 'World Without Tears'.","' West ' is definately a step in the right direction after ' World Without Tears ' .

Learning How To Live is a song about learning how to move on after breaking up with someone.  The lyrics in the song are very meaningful to me.  Lucinda gets help with some talented musicians on this CD.  Come On is a track about feeling frustrated in a relationship.

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4,"Lucinda Williams is in my opinion one of the most overlooked musicians in our era, considering that it's taken way too many years for her to get critical and some commercial acclaim, starting with 1998's ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". The current decade has found Williams to be very productive, with 2001's ""Essence"" and 2003's ""World Without Tears"" studio albums and one live album. Now comes the new studio album.

On ""West"" (13 tracks, 69 min.), Lucinda Williams sings about her usual topics of relationships, loss, loneliness, heartache. She also confronts the death of her mother (""Mama You Sweet"" and ""Fancy Funeral""). The opener ""Are You Alright"" sets the tone for the album: a slow-tempo, aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame. There are not many up-tempo songs on here, which may bother some people, but it doesn't bother me as in the end this is a mood album. Highlights for me include ""Unsuffer Me"", which is the best song on this album; the bitter yet funny ""Come On""; the epic 9+ Min. ""Wrap My Head Around That""; the sweet ""Words""; and the title track, which closes the album. The CD I bought came also with a 2 song (11 min.) bonus CD, which brings demo versions of ""Where Is My Love"" and ""Rescue"". Nice, but not really essential.

In all, I have come to like this album more with every listen. This is certainly not the most accessible Lucinda Williams, nor her best (that would still be ""Car Wheels""), but this is a rich album in every sense. But it's not for anyone in a hurry. I saw Lucinda Williams live on her ""World Without Tears"" tour, and was blown away by her stage presence.

With many dope recognizable singles such as ""Music Makes Me High"", ""Renee"", and ""Lex, Coups..."" (there is a remix floating out there I strongly recommend you hear). But what separates this crew from other groups is personalty. Mr. Cheeks is very charismatic on the microphone, and Freaky Tah plays the background vocals (those unfamiliar, think of him being what Flava Flav is to Chuck D in Public Enemy, only more serious).

One reason that makes this album great is their creative hooks, some of them will have you remembering for a while. ""Music Makes Me High"", and ""The Yearn"" are both entertaining (although I believe ""Da Game"" is very similar to the latter song). ""1,2,3"" is another great song too with the late Freaky Tah on the solo. ""Get Up"" is another song to easily remember, and slightly changes the atmosphere on the album. Other dope tracks to check out are the title song, and ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless"".

This album is great for the '95/'96 era and can easily stack up to the many east coast hip hop albums that came out around that time. The album flows great, and I personally believe many fans will enjoy. The lyrics are definitely on point majority of the album. Peace.

A175TPTHMNS7S4,B000W18GBW,1,1,4,"In my mind, this CD is what east coast hip hop should sound like.  This album had an impact in that was summed up well by one reviewer that said: ""When this album dropped in '96, everybody's ears perked up a bit and heads turned.""  This was one of those albums that you could turn on and just zone out to.  Tracks like ""The Yearn"", ""Music Makes Me High"", and ""Get Up"" were sure to get any party started while cuts like ""Legal Drug Money"", ""All Right"", ""Straight From The Ghetto"", and ""1,2,3"" were equally effective tales of ghetto life.  Then you throw in classics tracks like ""Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz, & Benz"", ""Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless"", and ""Renee"" and you have as good a rap album as you're gonna find on the east coast.  Even the intro is hot without taking all day to get to the point.  This is easily the best album released by the Lost Boyz.  It seems that Mr Cheeks leads the charge while Freaky Tah picks up the slack.  Tah doesn't rhyme much, but he does manage to spit a few bars on ""Legal Drug Money"", ""The Yearn"", ""All Right"", and ""1,2,3"".  And when he's not rhyming, he's ad libbing in the background on most songs (don't front like I was the only one that was singing along with Tah in most of those songs).  There are a few shortcomings that keep this album from achieving classic status.  Freaky Tah has a very simplistic flow that can come off as boring from time to time (but not often).  Then there are tracks like ""Da Game"" and ""Is This The Part"" that could've been left off the album and no one would've missed it.  Aside from those mishaps, the rest of the album is flawless.  It's been 8 years since this album came out (damn, that was 8 years ago?!) and you can still zone out to it in 2004.  Overall, this album is near classic with party jams and street tales that are effective in their purposes.  This CD is definitely worth your money if you're considering buying it.

Lucinda was touring in support of ""Live @ the Fillmore"" & said she was writing songs for a new record.  As I recall, she played a new song she said she'd recently written, ""Everything Has Changed.""  I preordered Lucinda's ""West"" set while my wife was still here.  Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe.  Lucinda lost her mother; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me, they punctuate every breath I take.  I spin the CD & Lucinda's gentle aching voice comes on, ""Are you alight?""  When people ask me that, I want to say, ""He*l no!""  But when she sings, ""All of a sudden you went away; I hope you come back around someday; I haven't seen you in a real long time; Could you give me some kind of sign?  Are you alright?  ...Cause I've been feeling a little scared,"" it sounds like she's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love.  What an amazing song, ""Just tell me that you're okay.""  If this were the only song on the CD, it'd be worth it.

""Unsuffer Me"" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss.  Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it.  ""Anoint my head with your sweet kiss, my joy is dead; I long for bliss,"" she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone's electric guitar churns mercilessly.  Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity.  During my wife's last weeks, my daughter said to me, ""It's like watching a train wreck; you can't look away.""  There something of that strength that comes through in Williams' music.

Other cuts are also amazing.  ""Learning How to Live"" is a breakup song, adjusting to loss.  ""Fancy Funeral"" may sound a bit bizarre, but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed.  The sheer force of Lucinda's anger in ""Come On"" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed-breakup song, ""Dude, you're so fired; shut up, I'm not inspired.""  ""Words"" has Lucinda's voice, weathered, worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best, writing a good song.

Yes, Lucinda has an amazing catalog of recordings from ""Happy Woman Blues"" to the self-titled record to Car Wheels & World Without Tears.

AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"This is an album about loss and survival. It's darker than some of Lucinda's other releases. It may not be for all Williams fans; it certainly is very different and more experimental than her last three albums. If you're uncertain about it the first time, give it a couple of other spins--it'll grow on you. The depth of emotion and Lucinda's raw vocals (meaning they weren't re-recorded--producer Hal Wilner used the demo vocal tracks as he loved the emotion in the performances) give this album an extra kick. I've seen some mixed reviews from fans here--I suspect this is an album that fans will probably come back to later and realize how good it is.

Clearly under the influence of later Dylan (perhaps ""Time Out of Mind""), the album features a nice mixture of midtempo numbers and killer ballads. Williams' voice which aches with longing and bitterness in many of these songs continues to be one of her strengths in addition to her top notch songwriting. She strikes reminds me somewhat of John Hiatt. ""Words"" has one of the sweetest melodies Williams has come up with the opening line sums up much of this album--""I would rather suffer in sweet silent solitude"". She may feel like she's in solitude but these moving, observant songs open up a world to music fans everywhere.

The music clips might be a bit deceptive. This is a moody, atmospheric album (even more so than her previous efforts). It also sounds even more personal than usual. The musicians that provide backing on the album including vets such as Jim Keltner give the album a distinctive sound. Producer Hal Willner does a great job of capturing the rich, distinctive qualities of Williams' voice.

This is one of Williams' finest albums holding its own with ""Lucinda Williams"", ""Sweet Old World"" and ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". Be aware, however, if you are a Williams fan that this is probably one of her more experimental albums and one of her most moody, atmospheric productions yet. Kudos to Hal Willner who convinced Williams to keep many of her raw, demo vocals for the album. What they may lack in polish they make up for in emotion.

BestBuy is currently offering an edition with a second disc featuring two demos for tracks on the main album. ""Where Is My Love"" and ""Rescue"" (both terrific songs). Personally, I'd love to hear some acoustic demos or performances of some of these songs vs. electric demos but that's me. Pick it up today!","This is an album about loss and survival .

A26TWY9AD935HC,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"Lucinda Williams has made a career out of doing things her way.  Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be.  With the success of CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD, that relentless fight finally paid dividends as the commerce finally caught up with her art.  Rather than repeating CAR WHEELS formula over and over, Lucinda left behind the Southern travel logs and delved into more emotional material.  The songs on ESSENCE and WORLD WITHOUT TEARS not only dug into the deeper depths of her psyche, but also loosened up musically, mixing more rock and hard blues into her Americana palette.  WEST seems like a logical extension of the two previous albums emotionally, while moving into new territory musically.

Produced by veteran Hal Willner, WEST takes a quantum leap from her previous releases by taking arrangements far beyond where her previous music went.  Saving the vocals and guitar from demos, the songs are built up layer by layer with strings and keyboards and various session players including Jim Keltner and Bill Frisell to create music quite different from her past efforts.  The good news is that the production is not camouflage for weak material.  Williams has delivered a solid set of tunes, at times harrowing, as she pokes at he emotional scabs of broken relationships and the death of her mother.  I can see how this material will put some off, when they are looking for material closer to CAR WHEELS regional sketches.  Still, you cannot deny the solid songwriting on songs like WHERE IS MY LOVE, WORDS (a ode to her poetic muse) and ARE YOU ALRIGHT?  Other songs like UNSUFFER ME, RESCUE and the talking blues/rap of WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT move into new territory, to my ears at least, with great success.

I'm glad that there are artists like Lucinda Williams who choose to challenge themselves and their fans with each new output of work.  Those that take the ride with WEST will be rewarded with a CD of solid songs and performances that rank with the best of Lucinda's previous work.  WEST seems to me to be the end of a trilogy of work that includes her post CAR WHEELS work.  If you're not a big fan of the previous two albums, you'll more than likely be disappointed with this new one.  In that case there is always the back catalog to enjoy.  I'll be interested to see what new directions she chooses in the future, and will no doubt, continue to enjoy this CD for years to come.","Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be .

A beautiful mid-tempo from Miss India. Arie. This is definitely in my top 2 favorite songs by her. In fact, if you were to ask me what song is better than this one from her first two albums and a few of the tracks from her third, I'd say this one takes the cake.

It just doesn't get more contemporary soul-ish than this. The runs and the deep notes are so amazing on this track. And it means that much more when you actually know like all the lyrics to the song!

Other songs with meaning recommended (all by India):

Nature (Acoustic Soul)
Slow Down (the remaining three are from her second album, Voyage To India)
Little Things &
The Truth.

AB6O8EM172B74,B000W1QVYG,1,1,5,"As a guy who has been hurt by women (as we all have been!) - this song turns out to be a terrific release of some of the frustration and anger which a man may feel as a result of having been hurt, dumped, or somehow otherwise 'offended' by a member of the 'fairer' sex.

The lead singer, a man called Graham Bonnet, does an awesome job of getting the message, and 'feeling,' behind the Title (and lyrics) out to the listener.

The video inspired me to purchase this song, and, although my mood is not always angry, spiteful, or vengeful - I am usually able, upon 'demand,' to 'conjure up' the proper memories and female related pain and torment to completely, and thoroughly, enjoy this classic British rock song from the late 1970's!

You can't literally give 110% in anything that you do - the numbers will simply not allow it.  But (and you need to watch the video to fully understand appreciate where I am coming from here) in this case, with this song, and in this video, 110% is, in fact, given.

A1Q8TMHHMPQHO9,B000W1MEEC,1,1,5,"Lovely music!

This beautiful album was RECORDED on September 16 and 17 (not originally released as the data on the amazon claimed at the time I wrote this review)- Kenny Burrell, a True giant of mainstream and moderately modern jazz guitar really shines here in the illustrious company of Richard Davis on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.

Some of the songs are really swinging, some are beautifully sad, some are pretty darn modern, but the general feeling of the album would be - in my interpretation - warm. The cozy tone of the leader's guitar really enriches his fanciful solo flights as well as the numbers where the rest of the trio has a larger role.

Initially issued on LP in 1960, the album was re-released in 1966 under the title ""Man at Work"", with really beautiful photo by Don Brownstein reproduced inside the CD's package (the cover photo of Burrell, taken from the original edition, is by Chuck Stewart). Actually, my only problem with this lovely CD is that the original liner notes - printed twice, are too small even for a reasonably young fellow with a normal eye-sight... Keeping the cover art was smart, but the backside of LP is not visually interesting enough to compensate for too small letters.

If you like jazz-guitar or mainstream jazz, you should get this album, to hear fresh and convincing versions of various standards (f. i. Ellington-Strayhorn's ""Just a sittin' and a-rockin'"", Monk's ""Well, You Needn't"") as well as some less often performed songs.","Lovely music !

A32T2H8150OJLU,B000W1SRR0,1,1,5,"Nina Persson's ""Black Winged Bird"" is lilting and soothing, romantic and bordering on melancholy.  The relaxing flow of this song makes it inherently listenable as foreground or background music.

I particularly like the fact that the song relies on Nina's vocal talents and not on overdone electronica or instrumental overkill.  The strings and other back-up instruments that complement Persson's voice are spot on.

While this song may not have the pop appeal or driving force it usually takes to gain major recognition, I've had this track on my iPod's playlist ever since it was made available at Amazon.com.

This song isn't what I'd cal mainstream country, folk, or even pop, but is an intruiging mixture of those genres.  I don't really like country that well, but I LIKE this song.

Thanks for a nice track Nina and Amazon!

A2IHB3M0ZIKNOZ,B000W1TKEY,1,1,5,"What happens when one of the greatest composers of R&B/Funk discovers a woman who would go on to become one of the greatest singers of R&B/Funk is Tell Me Something Good. Stevie Wonder was deep into his Funk classics like You Haven't Done Nothin' and Boogie On Reggae Woman when he first heard Chaka Khan & Rufus and the word is, virtually on-the-spot, wrote Tell Me Something Good for her. It's one of his best songs, one of her best songs and one of the best early 70's songs, period.

It's stripped down, too, right to the essentials. It doesn't have the multiple rhythms of a typical Wonder song of the time, it doesn't have the elaborate vocals of Earth, wind & Fire or Kool & the Gang, or the smooth horn section of the Ohio Players. But it doesn't need all that because it has Chaka Khan singing her heart out. This song tore up the airwaves in 1974 and is just as good today.","What happens when one of the greatest composers of R&B / Funk discovers a woman who would go on to become one of the greatest singers of R&B / Funk is Tell Me Something Good .

A3SI83LHXQCVS2,B000W1TJBI,1,1,4,"And I don't really see why. Longtime fans call it their poppiest, and while it's definitely the mellowest, that doesn't mean that it's not noisy or self-indulgent for the mainstream. While the lyrics don't mean all that much, it adds up the eccentricness of the album, making it more fun with each listen. About the only other flaw with this album is that Lee Ranaldo doesn't sing on any tracks on this album.
""Bull in the Heather"" is a classic, as is its video with that Le Tigre girl cameoed in it. Kim has an excellent voice on it, as well as it being loved among the fans. The outro part sounds real cool.
Opener ""Winner's Blues"" is a real nice track, as it's an acoustic-like track, a brilliant track on this album.
I just love ""In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader"". It's a punk-like track here, probably the fastest one, and Thurston sounds as if he's having a lot of fun during the recording of it. Then it goes into ""Sweet Shine"" the only song with any real length on the album. It's a great love song.
She has some pretty interesting tracks as well. Her style overall has a sexy sound to it. ""Bone"" is very awesome, I love the energy of the drums on it, then the chords are well-progressed. It's just a real memorable one on this album. She sings 7 of the 14 songs.
'Experiental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' is something that really shines on track 12 ""Tokyo Eye"", a very noisy song. It's very awesome to listen to either in the car or on your stereo.
This one's good for introducing people to SY. I got this January of this year, and I think it's excellent. There are some flaws, but overall, I think it's pretty good. The songs are very short, which helps, 'cuz it doesn't really contain enough epic stuff. So yeah, I am recommending it here.

A1ANRKHR4QWXJU,B000W1UOTY,1,-1,3,"This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto.","This CD is more than Rodrigo 's Concerto .

A37ZKZP74PYAVY,B000W1SB94,1,1,5,"""Dry"" is P.J. Harvey's debut album, released in 1992 it was a critical success while it did modest on the commercial side of things. Harvey was a breath of fresh air to the industry and was that generation's Patti Smith. Her mixture of pounding riffs and raw vocals created one superb album, the multi-talented Harvey wasn't content with just singing she had to co-produce the album, play guitars and violin, and write all but two of the tracks (those two she co-wrote). There are standouts but the album is overall a solid effort and flows well.

The album starts with the simplistic ""Oh My Lover"", the track is simple yet effective and isn't an all-out assault on the ears. I really like the starkness in P.J.'s voice.
""O Stella"" seems a bit like a reprise of the previous track, though I do like this song better, it's shorter and does more musically, but that doesn't mean I hate ""Oh My Lover"".

Next up is ""Dress"", I like the repitition in the lyrics and the double bass part which is played to perfection. The song has a very syncopated feel, even though at times an irregular feel.
""Victory"" is another great track with a nice echo section in it and some nice guitar parts. The bass is great, the drums are probably stronger than ever since the start of the album.

""Happy And Bleeding"" sounded like it had elements of country and folk in it upon first listen and I still can hear little elements of it, though not as much now, it's another great track though a bit of variation in the riffs would've be nice.
""Sheela-Na-Gig"" is one of the best songs on the album and the most successfull single off the album, the structure of the song is perfect, especially the 'I'm gonna wash that man right of my hair...' bit. I like the chorus, it's really catchy.

""Hair"" keeps the same formula that has made the album what it is and doesn't interrupt the flow at all. All the basic things are here, good lyrics, catchy hooks and superb instrumenation.
""Joe"" is another short track that is set at a very fast tempo, it seems to be gone and over really quick. It's still a nice track though.

""Plants And Rags"" is the best song on the album and seems a bit out of place on the album, I love the way the strings are used and written. This song is without a doubt the most emotional album on the album and P.J. proves her voice's potential well on this track.

""Fountain"" starts off incredibly lo-fi and then breaks into the signature sound of the album. I like the contrast and how it makes the song a bit segmented. ""Water"" has been described as the 'lightest' track off the album, although it does seem a bit light, it still has that punch about it. Great vocals by P.J. again.

Overall, ""Dry"" is special, it retains it's rock-alternative sound while still displaying emotion and beauty. The two best tracks would have to be ""Plants And Rags"" & ""Sheela-Na-Gig"", simply because they well, standout. This album though is incredibly solid throughout and flows nicely making this an irresistable album by a True musical genius.",""" Dry "" is P.J.

And also do to poor production the album which was obviously recorded in mono does not deliver the goods that it is supposed to deliver.

However, of all of the Detroit stars there is one that was my favourite from the get-go. Come and Get These Memories was my introduction to Martha and the Vandellas (and make no mistake the Vandellas were an integral component of the sound). For about six years I waited with anticipation the next Martha release. I have listened to these songs so often that I know every word to every song.

This is a great collection. Every song is a killer. It is a five star collection. BUT, there are many excellent Martha songs not included. Where's Livewire, In My Lonely Room, Wild One? There are others equally deserving that have been omitted. So, as good as this compilation is, it is far from perfect. You don't need to be a completist in order to regret the omissions. If you are looking for a Martha collection go further - there are numerous other collections that contain more. Notwithstanding my reservations I cannot give any Martha CD anything but five stars.","As a teenager i absolutely loved   Motown . I bought every Motown 45 that I could get my hands on sight unseen .

This one, 1999's '20th Century Masters' is the way to go if your new to this wonderful trio. 'Dancing In The Street,' of course, is their biggest hit. That was actually the song on my old Motown CD, but I liked it a lot. Other highlights for me are 'Jimmy Mack,' 'Heat Wave,' and 'Quicksand.'

So, if you want some more great Motown to add to your collection, don't pass The Vandellas by. They are simply too good to ignore. Highly, highly recommend. Plus, as always, the sound quality is excellent.

A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000W1W96K,1,1,4,"After Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown's biggest female stars.  But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition.  Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session.  The song, ""I'll Have to Let Him Go,"" which is not included in this collection, was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas.  The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes, although the lineup changed over the years; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites, Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese).  The group's second single ""Come and Get These Memories"" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way.  Other Top 5 hits included ""Dancing in the Street,"" """"Nowhere to Run,"" ""Jimmy Mack,"" ""I'm Ready for Love,"" ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,"" and ""Honey Chile.""  These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968, when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip.  The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown, Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 1995.  This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group's hits, but is limited to only 11 cuts.

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000W20FY2,1,1,5,"Now I have a feeling that following the disappointing reception of his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steve-Winwood/dp/B001GHSFMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steve Winwood</a>&nbsp;three years earlier that some refinements had to be made in order for Winwood to become as commercially successful as he was creatively so. One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic/harmonic instincts he might've developed during his Traffic period. Also he might've also had the sense that,although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi,that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall. And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings. The result was this album-one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist.

  ""While You See A Chance"" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for. With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction? This is essentially an electronic/new wave re-imagining of the uptempo gospel/soul he started doing from the outset. The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder-like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number. ""Second Hand Human"" is a hugely melodic,chiming synthesizer heavy pop/pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album. Starting off as a melodic,folksy ballad ""Slowdown Sundown"" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains. ""Spanish Dancer"" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody. ""Night Train"" is a sleekly electronic jazz/funk jam while the dynamic ballad ""Dust concludes the album.

  To my way of thinking? Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose. Winwood didn't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out. He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco/new wave synthesizer touches. And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive. He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them. I include Prince and Stevie Wonder in with that too. Although this album does have its detractors for that very reason among some of the less tolerant followers of the ""keeping it real"" music critic brigade? It would be very difficult to debate how much this album successfully extended on what was started on Winwood's commercially failed debut album and actually began an entirely new and fruitful career for him as a solo artist with a lot to say.","Now I have a feeling that following the disappointing reception of his debut album&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Steve - Winwood / dp / B001GHSFMQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Steve Winwood</a>&nbsp;three years earlier that some refinements had to be made in order for Winwood to become as commercially successful as he was creatively so . One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic / harmonic instincts he might 've developed during his Traffic period . Also he might 've also had the sense that , although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi , that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall . And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings . The result was this album - one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist . "" While You See A Chance "" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for . With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction ? This is essentially an electronic / new wave re - imagining of the uptempo gospel / soul he started doing from the outset . The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder - like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number . "" Second Hand Human "" is a hugely melodic , chiming synthesizer heavy pop / pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album . Starting off as a melodic , folksy ballad "" Slowdown Sundown "" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains . "" Spanish Dancer "" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody . "" Night Train "" is a sleekly electronic jazz / funk jam while the dynamic ballad "" Dust concludes the album . Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose . Winwood did n't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out . He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco / new wave synthesizer touches . And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive . He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them .

The sparse instrumentation as compared with his group work plus the signature synthesizer which I personally like and think gives the album a unique sound allows for Steve to showcase his best talent i.e. his remarkable tone in his vocals without the rest of a band to distract from it and he bares his soul here with meaningful lyrics told by a master storyteller.

AFSBKKDFLZZX5,B000W20FY2,1,1,5,"Although this early 1980s Winwood release has been overshadowed by some of Winwood's better known albums from later in that decade, this is still a great album.

I actually prefer Arc Of A Diver to some of Winwood later work, like Roll With It, which is better known and was more commercially successful. This is a really good album.

Winwood's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes even disco pap like ""Second Hand Woman"" and ""Spanish Dancer"" bearable, and results in ARC OF A DIVER being an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.","ARC OF A DIVER is Steve Winwood 's masterpiece .

A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000W20FY2,1,1,5,"During my MTV days, Steve Winwood's big 80's splash with songs from Back In The High Life didn't go unnoticed by me.  After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat ""While You See A Chance.""  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.  I find myself enjoying this song more than ""Higher Love.""

The title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  ""Spanish Dancer"" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called ""lazy music"" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.  This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life.

I wonder why ""Second-Hand Woman"" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being ""a slot machine to take my dime"" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds True for the near eight minute on-the-run opus ""Night Train"" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.

Two non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are ""Slowdown Sundown.""  A wistful ballad, calling wine that ""glassful of memories""  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track ""Dust"" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, ""a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing,"" meaning time, ""the universal healer.""  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote ""the sands of time wash us all clean.""

Mellow, but not ""lazy music"" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads.","During my MTV days , Steve Winwood 's big 80 's splash with songs from Back In The High Life did n't go unnoticed by me .

The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.
After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W21FZU,1,1,4,"Hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since Sting had started his successful solo career, after he had said goodbye to The Police. Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W21FZU,1,1,4,"If there is honestly one thing that I do adore about Sting, is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own. He has been doing it for 30 years on his own, and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police. I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock. But when he has a song come out, people will really listen to him, most of the time. When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999, many people weren't very eager at listening to the album at first, after the title track was released. However when Desert Rose was released as a single, many people really flocked over to the album. Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90's. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold. This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan.

A2IK776FY6MEMG,B000W21ER4,1,1,5,"I'm in a Weezer mood today. I'm listening to their entire catalog this afternoon and it's not getting old.

I was in high school when these guys rocked the world with 'Buddy Holly'. It meant nothing to me at the time though. Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90's (You know, the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE's thing. I didn't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth. I was just super lame.)

Looking back on it now, after having enjoyed Weezer for the last decade or so, they really are amazing. They have a distinctive sound that's very alternative but also very much their own. It's also not a hard sound. I find their instrumentals to be soothing ear candy.

And it's not an accident that 'Buddy Holly' is the song everyone remembers form the blue album. It's the best song on the album. Yeah it's the one with the most radio play, but that's because it's awesome. 'Susanne' is a close second, mainly because it reminds me of the closing credits to Mallrats. (Which I loved in the 90's but had no idea it was Weezer sining. I told you I was lame.) But 'Susanne' is only available on the deluxe version of the Blue Album. It's not available via the Prime streaming option. If you're buying the album, the Deluxe version is the only way to go.

A25KDGSE2EVYXY,B000W21ER4,-1,1,4,"This is Weezer's first ever album, and I think it's pretty good. I think Raditude might be my first favorite. I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin' tune to listen to, but it's not quite hard-rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.

""My Name is Jonas"" might be a song about the singer's brother, since the actual singer's name is Rivers. A punk rock song with a light guitar intro. The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first.

The Amazon sample for ""No One Else"" says ""My girl's got eyeballs,"" but the whole line is ""My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head."" The music is fun, catchy, and a little simple.

""The World Has Turned And Left Me Here"" is so Weezer-y, you can almost immediately tell who sang it if you hear it for the first time on the radio. I would've given it a 5/5, but it kind of got old after a while.

""Buddy Holly"" is Awesome! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly? Kinda, kinda not.

Next comes ""Undone"", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.

""Surf Wax America"" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.

Next comes ""Say It Ain't So"". This one has everything that a Weezer fan would like; Pretty good lyrics, rockin' chorus, guitar solo, and it's really catchy. Say it IS so!

Somebody said that ""In The Garage"" this one is an anthem for nerds/ rock 'n' roll lovers, and I might have to agree. It's my favorite song on the album. I like the intro because it sounds so different from the rest of the song. [Is that a bagpipe?]

""Holiday"" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure. Yes, it has a middle section, but much louder and better than the one SWA had.

""Only in Dreams"" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5/10]

Now for the bonus tracks:

For ""Mykel and Carley"", I'm not so sure who Mykel and Carley are, but the song was great! It had a guitar intro that reminded me of the intro for My Name is Jonas. Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band's newest album, Death to False Metal.

""Jamie"" is Just boring. Enough said.

However, ""Susanne"" is Another great hit from Weezer!]

Finally, we have ""PaperFace"". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it.","This is Weezer 's first ever album , and I think it 's pretty good . I think Raditude might be my first favorite .

A19I5KZQM3CA6W,B000W21ER4,1,-1,1,"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?

To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.

After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.

On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.

A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):

I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.

If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as ""You're just jealous!"" or ""I'd like to see you do better!"" or ""How is it in your parents' basement?"" or ""You must jerk off to your computer!"" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:

""Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!""

FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.

To those of you who would call me ""pretentious"" or ""music snob"" or ""self-righteous"" or ""self-absorbed,"" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is ""simple,"" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:

""Devil's Night Out"" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" by The Sex Pistols
""The Essential Heart"" by Heart
""Highway To Hell"" by AC/DC
""Meat Is Murder"" by The Smiths
""The Strange Case Of..."" by Halestorm
""Greatest Hits"" by Tom Petty
""Complete Greatest Hits"" by The Cars
""Ugly"" by Life of Agony
""Remain In Light"" by Talking Heads

As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!

I also wish to point out that arguments such as ""Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!"" or ""You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!"" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)","I can remember owning this album when I was in high school , so even though I now can not stand Weezer in the least bit ( now being 26 ) , it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time .

Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius , Symphony X , Kamelot , Sonata Arctica , Meshuggah , Insomnium , Voyager , Life of Agony , Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel , to give but a few of so many examples . From my current perspective , those bands actually know how to be creative , complex , artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible , nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal . On the flip side , however , I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways , and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager , I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned , but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album ca n't appreciate more complex music . Heck , as little as 6 or 7 years ago , I would likely have given this album 4 , or even 5 stars instead of 1 . In fact , I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then , as crazy as that sounds . After becoming a major fan of those other bands , however , I can not help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self . It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach . Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be , and I will not disagree with that . But then again , that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that , as musicians , they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be , but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses . After all , I used to be a fan , so I WOULD know , and I DO get it . Bottom line : It just no longer does anything for me . Simple as that . A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS ( Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments ! ! ! ): 

 I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer . I have a right to criticize them , just like I can criticize any other band out there , especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis , per the title of this review . Likewise , others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like , such as the ones I mentioned here in my review , but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them . If you are going to comment on this review , please spare me of any comments such as "" You 're just jealous ! "" or "" I 'd like to see you do better ! "" or "" How is it in your parents ' basement ? "" or "" You must jerk off to your computer ! "" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand , and are just futile attempts to disarm me , and if anything , they prove to me that you can not think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion . It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans , much akin to Justin Bieber , Lil Wayne or Britney Spears . It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore , be it music , movies , books , etc . and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do . Not only that , but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews , based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows : "" Anyone who does n't like what I like , and who dares to say that they do n't like it , must be a complete loser with no job , no life and still live with their parents ! "" FYI : I have a college degree ( from a HIGHLY prestigious university , no less ) , and a very successful career at one of the world 's leading financial services institutions , at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike . Not only that , but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents . If anything , they need me more than the other way around . To top it off , I enjoy working out at the gym , taking care of my 60 - gallon fish tank , and going to concerts to support the bands I like . To top it off , I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee ! ! ! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE ! ! ! Henceforth , the above - quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished . If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions , then here is my advice to you : Please learn some proper debating skills , get some help , or just learn to accept opinions ! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth , or , in this case , coming off your keyboard , then you have automatically lost the argument , and I automatically own you , hands down . Weezer are NOT above criticism , and neither is any other band out there . Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time . NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me ( or anyone else ) of the right to speak out against them . If you can not accept my opinion of your saviors , then KINDLY LEAVE ! Thank you . To those of you who would call me "" pretentious "" or "" music snob "" or "" self - righteous "" or "" self - absorbed , "" you are truly pathetic . If you read my many positive reviews ( which FAR outnumber my negative reviews , btw ) , you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have . In particular , and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is "" simple , "" ( and there is n't ) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums : "" Devil 's Night Out "" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones 
 "" Never Mind The Bollocks , Here 's The Sex Pistols "" by The Sex Pistols 
 "" The Essential Heart "" by Heart 
 "" Highway To Hell "" by AC / DC 
 "" Meat Is Murder "" by The Smiths 
 "" The Strange Case Of ... "" by Halestorm 
 "" Greatest Hits "" by Tom Petty 
 "" Complete Greatest Hits "" by The Cars 
 "" Ugly "" by Life of Agony 
 "" Remain In Light "" by Talking Heads 

 As far as music goes , what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have . My collection , of which this album used to be a part , consists of more than 1000 CDs , so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like . OWNED AGAIN ! I also wish to point out that arguments such as "" Oh , but you can HEAR what they 're singing ! "" or "" You can actually sing along and/or dance to it ! "" are simply NOT going to cut it . If you are going to defend Weezer , especially against a former fan such as myself , you are going to have to do better than that . Those comments still do n't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself , be it vocally , lyrically , instrumentally , etc . If you have something of a deeper , more substantial argument for me , I would be glad to take a challenge ."

AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000W21ER4,1,1,5,"Weezer's infamous self-titled debut (otherwise known as ""The Blue Album"") is one of the few pieces of music from it's time that still holds up just as well today. When they made their mark in 1994, Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling, uninspiring grunge clones. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate, they did, however, create a quite perfect debut, one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today, but Weezer remain vital, and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple. You can't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who, whether they realize it or not, knows a good Weezer tune. So, it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release, a Deluxe Edition made it's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b-sides, outtakes, demos, live songs etc. The question is, is it worth buying again?

The answer? A resounding yes. For starters, I'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it, what better time to get yourself another copy. And even if it's still in perfect condition, the bonus material is worth it alone, for the Weezer fanatic. I don't have to tell you how good the original album is. You've heard it, you know. It's perfect, front to back. The material on the second disc, while admittedly not as good as the album itself, is still worthy. Take, for example, Rivers' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub, ""Mykel and Carli"" (who passed away in a tragic car accident), with it's chorus that, in typical Weezer fashion, sticks in your head for the rest of your life. ""Suzanne"" and ""Jamie"" are probably the most well-known b-sides among Weezer fans, while a trio of demos -- referred to as ""The Kitchen Tapes"" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history. There are also live songs (""My Name Is Jonas"" & ""Surf Wax America"") and acoustic versions (""Jamie"" and ""No One Else""), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of ""Say It Ain't So"" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album). Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics (finally) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer. The package is very well done, and surely outshines the bare-bones nature of the original release.

Overall, a good album just got even better. Despite it's price tag, the average Weezer fan just should not be without this. It might make you love the band even more. You definitely get your money's worth. And as I said before, the original album itself is just classic. Say what you will about Weezer's newer material, but this stuff just can't be beat. They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty. I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album, an accomplishment a lot of musicians cannot acheive.","Weezer 's infamous self - titled debut ( otherwise known as "" The Blue Album "" ) is one of the few pieces of music from it 's time that still holds up just as well today .

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000W21ER4,1,1,5,"It's kind of hard to expound on Weezer's classic debut. In the aftermath of grunge and the death of Kurt Cobain, along came four noisy geeks who made the world safe for noisy hook laden songs about loudmouthed girlfriends (""No One Else""), the joys of high-school love (""Buddy Holly"") and a great metaphor about an unraveling relationship (""Undone - The Sweater Song""). Along with seven other great songs, this was a first album that yielded some perennial material, and founded the cult that Rivers Coumo rides today.
So why should you pony up the extra dough for the ""expanded"" edition? Is the second disc really worth it? For a change, the answer is yes. You get four great live tracks, complete with some funny self depreciating comments, one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer (""Jamie""), and a handful of demos. The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled ""My Evaline"" that highlights Weezer's uncanny harmony abilities, something occasionally lost in the din.
If you're reading this, you're probably already inclined towards buying this. Go ahead.

The songs from Rock and Pop still have stood the test of time, nearly 30 years after their last record Synchronicity. But out of all the songs the trio had done, the one that has stood the test of time and beyond in Every Breath You Take. It is definitely one of the most iconic songs of all time that has put words beyond what could ever be said. I like the song not only because of the rhythm, but it really takes me back to a time when music was really becoming all about fads in the 80's, but this songs goes beyond the fads, and stays True to the song. Sting may have wrote it in regards to a divorce, but the song is definitely a must download for any Police fan, or for anyone who had never heard their music before.

A2VHYWSV7ZLZOV,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5,"Ah, the Supreme Warbler!  She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical.  Were they parody?  Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil and spat them out when they were spent?  There were, after all, musical satirists like Anna Russell and much later, The Bonzo Dog Band and Monty Python, who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits, and made pots of money doing it, too.  But they knew exactly what they were doing.  What about Mrs. Miller?

Jonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller, but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller.  The former act was, in case some readers don't know it already, a gifted piano player/bandleader Paul Weston, and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer's singer, Jo Stafford.  She eventually became Weston's wife.  They were best known as themselves, but forged a separate career in musical parody.  What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing isn't easy, and Jo did it by singing sharp.  Try it.  It's harder than singing flat; believe me (and sounds even more horrible).  Now, you may be asking, what do Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have to do with Mrs. Miller?  For me, it's personal, but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people.

I tried to introduce a foreign-born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene.  He would have none of it.  He said, ""she's doing that deliberately; that's not funny.""  You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller.  In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny, and Mrs. Miller roll-on-the-floor hysterical, I got an unexpected response.  No, he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you, and maybe even some songs you hate.  Somehow, she's innocent, charming, and yes, very, very funny.  Whatever the True story, and you'll read of several in these Amazon reviews, what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures.  She may or may not have been exploited, or she may have exploited herself, but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal.

Just listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming.  How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time?  And face it, who's gonna take ""Sweet Pea,"" ""Catch A Falling Star"" and ""I've Got A Tiger By the Tail"" seriously, anyway?  This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting.  And her ""Boots?""  Sorry, Nancy, Mrs. Miller's is The Definitive Version.

My one, small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of ""Up, Up And Away.""  Talk about Definitive! (If you're a Mrs. Miller fan already, and haven't heard ""Up, Up and Away,"" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity). But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in ""Lover's Concerto.""  She NAILS it!  And people said she couldn't sing!

I think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task, both musically, and as comedians, but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof, enjoyed it, made some money, and did it with purpose; you can even hear them winking in their recordings.  I do think they are funny, but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny.  My coworker was right about one thing:  Mrs. Miller was Grandma.  And you might laugh WITH her and even AT her when her back was turned, but never would you sneer at her face to face.  No, you want to give her a hug, because somehow these crazy, one-of-a-kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer.  I completely disagree with those who say that laughing at Mrs. Miller's music is cruel.  I think Mrs. Miller might have understood, had she lived to witness her digital revival, that she had created something entertaining and unique, even if it wasn't taken as she had intended.  Nothing to be ashamed of there, and if her life was in some ways tragic, its legacy is not the least bit sad.","Ah , the Supreme Warbler ! She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical . Were they parody ? Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil and spat them out when they were spent ? There were , after all , musical satirists like Anna Russell and much later , The Bonzo Dog Band and Monty Python , who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits , and made pots of money doing it , too . But they knew exactly what they were doing . What about Mrs. Miller ? 

 Jonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller , but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller . The former act was , in case some readers do n't know it already , a gifted piano player / bandleader Paul Weston , and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer 's singer , Jo Stafford . She eventually became Weston 's wife . They were best known as themselves , but forged a separate career in musical parody . What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing is n't easy , and Jo did it by singing sharp .   Try it . It 's harder than singing flat ; believe me ( and sounds even more horrible ) . For me , it 's personal , but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people . I tried to introduce a foreign - born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene . He said , "" she 's doing that deliberately ; that 's not funny . "" You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller . In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny , and Mrs. Miller roll - on - the - floor hysterical , I got an unexpected response . No , he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you , and maybe even some songs you hate . Somehow , she 's innocent , charming , and yes , very , very funny . Whatever the True story , and you 'll read of several in these Amazon reviews , what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures . She may or may not have been exploited , or she may have exploited herself , but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal . Just listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming . How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time ? And face it , who 's gon na take "" Sweet Pea , "" "" Catch A Falling Star "" and "" I 've Got A Tiger By the Tail "" seriously , anyway ? This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting . Sorry , Nancy , Mrs. Miller 's is The Definitive Version . My one , small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of "" Up , Up And Away . "" Talk about Definitive ! ( If you 're a Mrs. Miller fan already , and have n't heard "" Up , Up and Away , "" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity ) . But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in "" Lover 's Concerto . "" And people said she could n't sing ! I think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task , both musically , and as comedians , but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof , enjoyed it , made some money , and did it with purpose ; you can even hear them winking in their recordings .

She tried so hard and was so diligent and serious.  And the risks she took!  Sure she could have sung opera or inspirational music, and got laughed at far less (actually probably ignored) - - but whether or not her recording career was a joke on HER, the fact that she accepted the challenge to record such unlikely (then) pop and rock and roll material is what made her GREAT.

She was Mrs. Miller, who sang with a quasi-operatic soprano.  She mostly recorded cover versions of recent pop hits.  She often went off-pitch, and sometimes she fell behind (or got ahead of) the beat.  She sang with more vibrato than Tiny Tim, and occasionally she would perform bird whistles.  Of course, the whole thing was a joke by the record company.  It's pretty funny, although it wears a bit thin after a while.  I don't think too many people can take 21 songs by Mrs. Miller!

A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5,"Elva Ruby Connes Miller was truly one of the most amazing voices of the twentieth century. That isn't to say that she has a great voice, or even a good voice, for that matter. What she has is an amazing penchant for an off-key vibrato intensive warbling that makes her second only to Florence Foster Jenkins for most hilarious soprano of the last century. Miller was a fixture in local community theater and amateur productions, and at one point even took her talent to Vietnam to entertain the troops. I am sure they were very entertained. Truly this woman had a heart of gold, even if she had a tongue of lead.

This compilation is stunning in its breadth. The treatment she gives to these songs cannot even be imagined until heard for oneself. She covers a variety of styles, with a heavy concentration of 1960s sugar-pop like ""Monday, Monday"", ""Let's Hang On"", and ""Yellow Submarine"". (Yes, it's True that Ringo sings substantially better than Mrs. Miller.) Particularly entertaining is the truly dreadful altered lyric masterpiece ""Queen of the House."" I can't imagine having been a supporting musician or recording technician that had to sit through multiple takes of these masterworks.

Listening to this CD is delightfully awful, and I recommend the experience highly to any audiophile who thinks they have heard it all.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000WCZW7M,1,-1,3,"The past few years have really brought out anew for pop star Amy Grant. She had moved back into her Christian roots well with her core audience, but unfortunate, she hasn't been able to click with newer music buyers. Since her A&M catalog was recently moved over to EMI, on her label Sparrow. While so many acts have done well with a new label in catalog sales, Amy still has a long way to return to the success she had a long time ago. A few years ago, it was well said with her previous hits package Greatest Hits 1986-2004 which did very well with the actual appeal. Now that she has another hits package, does Amy Grant really have the appeal she once conquered with record buyers?

Amy Grant's 2007 Greatest Hits mixes in a bit of the old and the new that Amy had delivered well from her 90's pop mix, to her contemporary mixes of soul and Christian music. The songs have been remastered nicely, and tries to deliver nicely as a re-introduction to Amy to a whole new audience. The collection includes some of her great gems like Every Heartbeat and Baby Baby, to her contemporary Christian classics like Lead Me On and Father's Eyes. While the collection works fairly well for new fans, it misses a few great songs from her pop era that worked better from her previous hits package. The collection overlooks a few great tracks like The Next Time I Fall, her often overlooked duet with former Chicago singer Peter Cetera, as well as The Things We Do For Love, which she did for the Ellen Degeneres film Mr. Wrong, and her delightful cover of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi from House Of Love, which had a very colorful video, and a better beat than when Joni recorded it years ago.

All in all, Amy Grant's Greatest Hits isn't a bad collection though, but it just doesn't deliver like the A&M days really did, or her previous Greatest Hits 1986-2004 album, which unfortunately is no longer in print. Hopefully, there could be a better hits collection that could attract Amy's great pop days like that one did, but this one could've had more to be desired, and that makes it a missed heartbeat.

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000WCZW7M,-1,1,5,"With three decades of music under her belt, Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections.  And while they are both great, there was no place to find a sample of her entire career.  Until now.

This disc is an attempt to collect the hits from Amy's entire career, and it does a remarkable good job.  With just nineteen songs, it hits all the highlights.  It includes ""Simple Things,"" the title track from her last major studio release and ""Old Man's Rubble"" from her self title debut.  In fact, it includes at least one song from each of her major studio releases (not counting the hymns projects or the Christmas releases) except for her third, ""Never Alone.""  Heck, it even includes ""Stay for Awhile.""  That song originated on Collection and went on to become a hit in its own right.

And there are plenty of classics here, from ""Baby Baby"" and ""Saved by Love"" to ""Thy Word,"" ""El Shaddai,"" and ""Father's Eyes.""

Having said that, there are some drawbacks.  Fans who already own all her releases will find absolutely nothing new here.  All nineteen tracks have been previous released.  While they have been digitally remastered to sound better, I must admit I don't notice the difference.  Of course, when you are getting almost an hour and twenty minutes of music, this is being picky.

An equally picky point is the over representation of ""Heart in Motion.""  I know it was her biggest release by far.  But it gets five tracks, which is about a quarter of the disc space.  And, to be honest, it's not my favorite of her releases.  Seems like one or two could have been cut to include a song from somewhere else.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"" didn't make the cut.  That would have been a good switch.

Finally, there's the timing.  Amy's last two releases have been a greatest hits and a live disc.  I know she just changed record labels, but I would have preferred to see this after another studio release.

In reality, these are all minor quibbles.  Any fan of Amy's music will find lots of memories in these nineteen songs and be glad to have them all in one place.","With three decades of music under her belt , Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections .

I didn't realize at the time what a diverse catalog that she had (starting from 1977).  Over time, I became truly blown away by Amy's sweet, sexy, breath-y voice.  And in the course of 4 decades, it hasn't changed all that much -- it's slightly become deeper and much more mature.  And she also married guitarist Vince Gill in 1994 after they met for the duet on 1994's ""House Of Love.""

This CD is a short overview of her work, which is mostly her mainstream hits -- from 1977 to 2003.  I actually own the deluxe version which has over an hour of bonus content, including 5 music videos and Amy's own interviews of the songs.

Amy's most recent recording was 2013's ""How Mercy Looks From Here"".  Please be sure to check out her entire catalog.  :)  If you want to know more, I can list her discology for you as well.","In 1991 , during high school , I was exposed to Amy Grant 's "" Heart In Motion "" album . I did n't realize at the time what a diverse catalog that she had ( starting from 1977 ) . Over time , I became truly blown away by Amy 's sweet , sexy , breath - y voice . And in the course of 4 decades , it has n't changed all that much -- it 's slightly become deeper and much more mature . And she also married guitarist Vince Gill in 1994 after they met for the duet on 1994 's "" House Of Love . "" 

 This CD is a short overview of her work , which is mostly her mainstream hits -- from 1977 to 2003 . I actually own the deluxe version which has over an hour of bonus content , including 5 music videos and Amy 's own interviews of the songs . So now I will rate each song , which is in backwards chronological order . :)

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000WGRNA2,1,1,5,"This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits. In Europe, an expanded 13-track collection was released adding the other three but this version is long out of print. So this album, apart from being a high quality original album, also served as hits volume 2 until the more comprehensive Definitive Collection was released.

The one track that made it onto the American hits collection is Where've you been, which has become Kathy's signature song. However, in this particular song it is the lyrics that people seem to love - they relate to the sentiments expressed. The other hits were all upbeat, catchy songs - Come from the heart, Burning old memories and She came from Fort Worth Texas.

Of the other songs, my favorite is Hills of Alabam. No surprise, really, as this was written and originally recorded by my favorite bluegrass singer, Claire Lynch, who adds backing vocals. Claire's own version can be found on an untitled album by the Front porch string band, of which she was lead singer. The title track is also excellent, as are Here's hoping, True north, Love chooses you and I'll take care of you.

While I slightly prefer her two previous albums (Walk the way the wind blows, Untasted honey), there isn't much to choose between the three and those two are better represented on that hits collection. So if you already have that, this should be the next Kathy Mattea album on your shopping list.","This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits .

A8SCX6VUTE05H,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5,"CooleyHighHarmony is a classic album that has yet to be topped by any of these so-called R&B artists that are out now. Boyz II Men put Philly on the map as well as laid themselves a strong foundation in R&B with that album. There was only one way they could have went after Cooleyhighharmony: up. And they did with this superb sophomore release.

There are too many tracks that are vintage Boyz II Men tracks. Thank You, All Around The World, Vibin and U Know are excellent tracks the the Philly quartet. I'll Make Love To You and On Bended Knee were on Blender(cheap knockoff of Rolling Stone) and Vh1 as awesomely bad songs countdown but those love ballads are classics so the hell with Blender and VH1! These are the songs that these immature little freaks were conceived to and they have the nerve to trash it but never once do they mention any Eminem, D12 or any Shady records artists as well as Justin Timberlake. Are they trying to say that none of these artists make awesomely bad records? Really? I find that type of favoritism questionable. Plus forms of media like Vh1, Blender and GQ only appeal to idiotic trendies that think that saying ""Meh"" at the beginning of every sentence and defending movies that stink to high heaven makes them hip.

50 Candles, Water Runs Dry, Trying Times and Yesterday are more smooth R&B ballads that give this album a much needed boost. There are no bad songs on this album so I'll keep going on.

Bottom Line: Boyz II Men's II is the best sophomore album from an R&B quartet of all time. The ballads are exceptional and the fast songs aren't bad plus the group still has what most groups R&B groups now sorely lack: harmony. If you love 90s R&B in its purest form you cant go wrong with this sophomore effort by Boyz II Men.

Standouts: THANK YOU, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, U KNOW, VIBIN, TRYING TIMES, I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU, ON BENDED KNEE, WATER RUNS DRY and YESTERDAY.","CooleyHighHarmony is a classic album that has yet to be topped by any of these so - called R&B artists that are out now .

These are the songs that these immature little freaks were conceived to and they have the nerve to trash it but never once do they mention any Eminem , D12 or any Shady records artists as well as Justin Timberlake . Are they trying to say that none of these artists make awesomely bad records ? Really ? I find that type of favoritism questionable . Plus forms of media like Vh1 , Blender and GQ only appeal to idiotic trendies that think that saying "" Meh "" at the beginning of every sentence and defending movies that stink to high heaven makes them hip . 50 Candles , Water Runs Dry , Trying Times and Yesterday are more smooth R&B ballads that give this album a much needed boost . There are no bad songs on this album so I 'll keep going on . Bottom Line : Boyz II Men 's II is the best sophomore album from an R&B quartet of all time . The ballads are exceptional and the fast songs are n't bad plus the group still has what most groups R&B groups now sorely lack : harmony . If you love 90s R&B in its purest form you ca nt go wrong with this sophomore effort by Boyz II Men . Standouts : THANK YOU , ALL AROUND THE WORLD , U KNOW , VIBIN , TRYING TIMES , I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU , ON BENDED KNEE , WATER RUNS DRY and YESTERDAY ."

AYOO12C9Y2T95,B000WKT6B2,1,1,4,"Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to ""Cooleyhighharmony"", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group.

HIGHLIGHTS:

This album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before ""Khalil"") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half.

Part 1 has ""Thank You"" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. ""Vibin'"" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'/dancin' the night away/Groovin'/Vibin'/non-stop until the break of day). ""I Sit Away"" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and ""Nobody Knows""..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)

In the ""slow side"", Babyface's ""I'll Make Love to you"" set a record for the length of time at #1. ""On Bended Knee"" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and ""Water Runs Dry"" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic ""Yesterday"" and they pull off the True feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.

LOWS:

""All Around the World"" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's ""Travelin' Man"" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, ""Khalil"" is a pretty blah track. ""Jezzebel"" is a dull overlong affair. ""50 Candles"" includes the lyric ""Holding your body like a plastic molding""....'nuff said.

BOTTOM LINE:

There are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like ""I Sit By"" and ""Yesterday"" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans.","Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups ( Temps and Tops ) with more up - to - date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip - hop stylings .

ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5,"This CD is a throwback to my youth.  I was about twelve years old when it came out--back when Boyz 2 Men was truly  a hot commodity.  They have a wonderful ""old school"" flavor reminiscent of the old doowop guy groups of 1960s.  This is especially evident in the four part harmonies, the smooth and romantic lyrics and the original interpretations of old standards (""Yesterday"").

Where do I begin to describe the mood of this wonderful and innovative R&B album?  There is something for everyone on this CD.  We have the funky, catchy ""Thank You"" that samples from ""La-Di-Da-Di"" performed by Doug E. Fresh.  The hook is infectious!  We have ""All Around the World"" to get you up and dancing, no doubt.  One of my personal favorites is ""I Sit Away,"" written by Tony Rich (of the Tony Rich Project fame).  It has a haunting hook and a beautiful, introspective feel.  Truly an ode to solitude.  There are also a couple of songs on this album that became huge hits for the fellas back in the early 1990s.  They include ""I'll Make Love to You"" (on those songs to get you in the mood), and ""Water Runs Dry.""

One of the strongest points of this album is the luscious arrangements and fine tuning of production on each of the cuts.  Even my least favorite of the songs--""50 Candles""--has a very sexy, clean and catchy arrangment.

Check this out!  And all of you young ones out there, don't write the Boyz as just another R&B band from the 1990s.  They were truly in a class by themselves.","I was about twelve years old when it came out -- back when Boyz 2 Men was truly   a hot commodity .

In the case for Boyz II Men, they became even more popular then the boys from Philadelphia. At that time, they became bigger than most of the manufactured music out there. Although they started big, the ballads they were making were explosive.
The 1994 album, II became the most successful R&B album of the decade, selling almost 14 million albums, and launching 4 smash hit songs including Water Runs Dry, I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, and Thank You. At that time, they really proved that the music spoke for itself, not an image among all boundaries. The style blended beautifully with similar artists like The Temptations, The Four Tops, and even The Jackson 5. Nevertheless, they actually were at the very beginning of the Corporate Pop era that lead to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. Luckily, the music wasn't locked into Teen Idol stardom, which made Boyz II Men one of the most popular groups of the 90's.
It is kind of sad that a lot of teen acts that are out there aren't mature enough like Boyz II Men. It is just incredible to know that some acts constantly can't capture that era. Hopefully, the next True Soul group, can recapture the legacy Boyz II Men set.","For the music of 1994 , the scene changed immediately , from Grunge to Hip Hop .

Nope, this song isn't afraid to let out a yell or two, or three, but their not screaming through the whole song either. Nope, it's a perfect blend sure to please a real rock radio listener.

The verses work very nicely, and keep the song moving toward the main show of the chorus. And the chorus really rocks. Sure, it might be a little too familiar for rock radio in its short burst of the 1st round, but it saves all its energy for the rest of the song, when it brings the house down with its catchy and infectious energy that sounds right out of the 90's.

Overall, with its loaded gun of energy, and familiar, but still rockin' elements driving it, if you listen to rock radio, you're going to love it. This song really took me back to that 90's alt rock movement with bands like Collective Soul and Nirvana, and ""Psycho"" certainly does the greats justice.","Strange enough , you do n't hear many songs on rock radio , that actually know how to rock .

Murder on Music Row is the story about what Nashville and radio has done to the legends of music.  Done as a duet with Alan Jackson it wasn't as big of a song as I would have thought it had been.  Then the rest of the cd is one hit after another.  Like Adlida, Carried Away, Blue Clear Sky,His  rodeo song I Can Still Make Cheyenne.

A1TGCU5CZF9LKA,B000WLIE7I,1,1,5,"George Strait has had so many number one hits it's kind of hard to count. He had 50 a couple of years ago, but he's had so many since than, I honestly don't know.

This set documents most of his best work of the 1990s, and includes two mighty fine new recordings, 'The Best Day' and the duet with country music legend Alan Jackson, 'Murder On Music Row.' You also get some of his finest songs of the 1990s as a country chart topper, including 'Lead On' and 'Carrying Your Love With Me.'

And, MCA did a great job remastering the songs too. The sound quality is excellent!

Overall, this is a great set to own. And if you own 'Greatest Hits Vol. 2' and/or 'Greatest Hits,' pair it with this, and you have a mighty fine George collection.

Highly recommended for the new or casual Strait fan. You'll get your money's worth with this set. Very entertaining.

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000WLIE7I,1,1,5,"The album picks up George's career where the boxed set (Strait out of the box) ends, so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998. It shows that George's style was evolving but still firmly rooted in traditional country music.

The album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album, the first (The best day) being an excellent ballad. The second song (Murder on music row) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle, a bluegrass performer. Here, George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson. George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet, George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song. While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place, they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days.

The remaining tracks are taken from just four albums, these being Lead on (Adalida, Lead on, You can't make a heart love somebody), Blue clear sky (the title track, Carried away, I can still make it to Cheyenne, King of the mountain), Carrying your love with me (the title track, Round about way, One night at a time, Today my word slipped away) and One step at a time (True, We really shouldn't be doing this). Of these songs, Today my world slipped away is a cover of a Vern Gosdin country hit but the others (as far as I know) are original songs.

Picking out highlights in such a strong collection is difficult, but I'll nominate Murder on Music Row, Adalida, Blue clear sky and King of the mountain. If you are new to George's music, this compilation makes a great introduction.","The album picks up George 's career where the boxed set ( Strait out of the box ) ends , so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998 .

A1ALPL858XSDE,B000WLIE7I,1,1,4,"Hallelujah!  George Strait and MCA have finally released a single-disc collection of hits that isn't skimpy!  Unlike Strait's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks, of which two are new recordings.  Specifically, it picks up where the multi-disc retrospective Strait Out Of  The Box leaves off, with the old hits culled from Strait's 1994 through  1998 albums.
 While more extensive, this anthology is far from  perfect however.  ""Lead On"" and ""King Of The Mountain"" (the latter barely  scraped into the top 20) drag along unmelodically and are slower than  molasses.  Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits  (""I Can Still Make Cheyenne"" recalling ""Amarillo By Morning"" and  ""Adalida""  bringing to mind ""The Love Bug"").  With ""Carrying Your Love With Me"" and  ""Carried Away,"" Strait even repeats himself within the same collection.
  If you think I am getting too nit-picky about this set, you may be right.  The crisp, heartfelt delivery on ""You Can't Make A Heart Love Somebody"" is  just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country  music.  And as ""Blue Clear Sky"" and ""Round About Way"" illustrate, no one  handles a play-on-words more effectively than Strait.  You'd also be  hard-pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than ""We  Really Shouldn't Be Doing This.""
 The two new singles contribute in  mixed degrees to the Strait legacy.  Recent chart-topper ""The Best Day"" is  nice, but it also seems too similar to some old hits (""Love Without End,  Amen,"" ""Check Yes Or No).""  Here our protagonist progresses through a love  for camping, cars, and finally, his ideal woman.  Much better is ""Murder On  Music Row,"" a duet with Alan Jackson.  This mega-event pairing of two of  modern country's most traditional (and successful) artists is an  effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today's  country....
 As  noted earlier, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is not flawless.  In light of  its several strong points, however, it has to be recommended as a must buy  for all country music listeners.","Hallelujah !

This one is one of the exceptions. One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall ""laid-back"" feel. I like that it isn't wild or very rocking. Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me (usually, anyway). Burl, with his warm, friendly voice, doesn't come across as a ""celebrity"" but as more of a ""grandfatherly"" figure. The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back-up vocals. Of course, the title track and ""Rudolph"" are probably the most-known tracks on the album, but the others are good, too. The album has one of the best versions of ""Little Drummer Boy"" that I've heard! ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" closes the album perfectly. Right now, it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s) from the album, but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song, and it would probably be ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away.""

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5,"Burl Ives really isn't remembered as much as he should be these days; and that's a shame. On this album Burl sings wonderfully; and his friendly, grandfatherly vibes go into every song he sings! This CD is a must-have for fans of Burl; and anyone who wants some very special holiday songs would do well to add this to their music collection. The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is very nicely done.

The title track opens the album; this catchy, infectiously happy and upbeat tune could never go out of style; and Burl practically owns this song the way he delivers it. He puts a lot of positive energy into his version of this song; and it shows quite clearly when I hear him perform it. Great! ""Christmas Is a Birthday"" is very easy on the ear; what a charming ballad--and it's religious, too. ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" switches gears back to a more secular song; Burl puts his own stamp on this tune by playing a bit with the tempo and a few key changes--and it all holds its own very well.

""White Christmas"" glows brighter than silver and gold combined when Mr. Ives sings it; that background chorus rounds out the number nicely although wisely the arrangement makes it so that they can't attempt to share the spotlight with Burl. ""The Little Drummer Boy"" has another terrific arrangement; the percussion and guitar are used very well and the music fits perfectly with Burl Ives' singing. In addition, ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" leaves nothing to be desired--this music is all THAT good!

""Winter Wonderland"" shines bright in Burl's capable hands; I really like this number. ""Silver Bells"" couldn't have been done any better and the CD ends with Burl Ives performing ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day."" I haven't heard this number as often as I've heard the other tunes on this CD but it's really quite beautiful and it even leaves me wanting more.

Burl Ives turned out a wonderful record album back in 1965; and it's amazingly wonderful to have this on CD in our times so that we can enjoy it over and over again. I highly recommend this album; it's full of splendid holiday music.","Burl Ives really is n't remembered as much as he should be these days ; and that 's a shame .

A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5,"The only complaint about ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas"" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums.  His first, ""Christmas Day in the Morning,"" came out in 1952, followed by ""Christmas Eve"" in 1956.  ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas"" came out in 1965, with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" the following year.  The title song of this album was written by for the special by Johnny Marks, who also wrote the song ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" which Ives sings on this album, and the final track, ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.""  That is a pretty good trio of Christmas songs, which would make Marks one of the best writers of Christmas songs ever.

How this album is different from the previous Burl Ives Christmas albums is that he has shifted to this point to more of a pop-oriented approach to singing Christmas songs that the traditional folk style that defined his earlier albums.  There are still some folk songs on this album, with ""Christmas is a Birthday,"" ""Christmas Child (Loo, Loo, Loo),"" ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away,"" and ""Snow for Johnny.""  But most of the songs are definitely more popular than secular, with ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"" ""White Christmas,"" ""Winter Wonderland,"" and ""Silver Bells.""  I tend to think of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" as being more religious than it really us, but that is more because the music is more hymn-like.

The net result is that you have Burl Ives singing eight recognizable Christmas songs and introducing you to four songs that you have probably not heard before that are perfectly suited to his strengths as a singer.  Ives started out in the 1920s as an itinerate folk singers, moved to Broadway in the 1930s, appeared on the radio in the 1940s, and became a popular folk singer in the 1950s.  But most people today probably remember him as the Snowman who narrates the story of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" that still airs each holiday season forty years later.  Because of that connection it is entirely possible that a Burl Ives Christmas album will be warmly received in your home by those who do not know about the rest of his resume.  He certainly produces the requisite warm seasonal feelings.","The only complaint about "" Have a Holly Jolly Christmas "" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums . His first , "" Christmas Day in the Morning , "" came out in 1952 , followed by "" Christmas Eve "" in 1956 . "" Have a Holly Jolly Christmas "" came out in 1965 , with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special "" Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer "" the following year .

A3LPZ3KE5TAZMA,B000WLTDIM,1,1,5,"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play ""Amarillo By Morning,"" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to ""Amarillo by Morning.""

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been.

AK0CENM3LUM28,B000WLQKQ0,1,1,4,"Bailamos (Enrique Iglesias) / B000WLQKQ0

I hadn't heard of Enrique Iglesias until he showed up on my Pandora radio play list, but this song is a truly lovely dance song. The instrumentals are stunning, and Iglesias' smooth and deep strains complement the style perfectly. There's nothing terribly *new* in this song - it's a very standard dance-and-romance song - but a song doesn't need to be innovative to be beautiful, raw, and real. Listen to the sample and you may love it.

Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.

A3LPZ3KE5TAZMA,B000WLTDIM,1,1,5,"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play ""Amarillo By Morning,"" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to ""Amarillo by Morning.""

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","I grew up in rural West Texas , where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals .

A1WPFIZ8P3O86V,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5,"Most people wanting a representative collection of Patsy Cline's hits for their music library will be satisfied with the 22 songs included on this single disc collection - 59 minutes altogether.

It has 'Crazy', that great Willie Nelson song that has played from jukeboxes and bars throughout American for the past few decades, always sounding as good as ever. I think it's considered to be the most played song ever, by whoever keeps track of such things. Its worth getting this album for that track alone, although if you are download friendly then you could shortcut that process and simply purchase the track all by itself.

But if you did that, you'd miss the 21 other great songs here, starting with 'Walkin' after Midnight', and continuing one after another to transport us to those days in the late 1950's and early 1960's when Patsy Cline was at the top of her career.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5,"Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley, September 8, 1932 - March 5, 1963) was a superbly gifted country music singer--very few could, can or ever will match her ability to take any tune and make it sound wonderful, special, fresh and very new! Patsy also put her heart and soul into everything she sang; and that's grand. Sadly, she died so young in a private plane crash; but at least she lives on through her music. This is an excellent CD of her artistry for both fans and newcomers alike.

There's not a single dud in the lot here; every song is just that good! ""Walkin' After Midnight,"" written by  Alan Block and Donn Hecht, is a fine way to start the track set--Patsy is squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! The music, as is the case with all the tracks here, fits in perfectly with Patsy's vocals. ""A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)"" is very well done and Patsy does a great job on ""Lovesick Blues"" which is a number I really like. ""I Fall to Pieces"" (Pasty's first #1 hit on the country charts and her second hit on the pop charts) and ""True Love"" from Patsy's 1961 album entitled ""Patsy Cline Showcase"" are most poignant and Patsy sings ""San Antonio Rose"" with panache--I love it! ""Crazy,"" a number by Willie Nelson, shines bright in Patsy's more than capable hands; it's her signature song despite the fact that she didn't like it at all initially!

""Strange"" is very well done--there's some backup vocals for Patsy and while they do sound pretty good Patsy never really needed backup; her talent carried her through every time! Patsy's interpretation of Hank Cochran's ""She's Got You"" is very impressive; and Patsy's ""Heartaches"" is easily the very best I've ever heard! ""Half As Much"" is easy on the ear even if the lyrics aren't all that happy while ""When I Get through with You (You'll Love Me Too)"" is certainly more upbeat. ""Imagine That"" gets a fine treatment from Patsy and ""So Wrong"" yet again features Patsy's beautiful contralto voice. ""Why Can't He Be You"" is another moving number.

""Leavin' on Your Mind"" is an incredibly fine tune that gets the royal treatment from Patsy Cline and ""When You Need a Laugh"" is a real gem! ""Back in Baby's Arms"" has a great sound to it as do the other numbers here and songs like ""Faded Love"" make me wish so badly that Patsy was still with us. ""Always"" is a classic for sure and the album ends with two splendid songs, Harlan Howard's ""He Called Me Baby"" and Don Gibson's ""Sweet Dreams (Of You).""

Patsy Cline shared so much of her gift with us that we are all better off for it. I highly recommend her exceptional music.","Patsy Cline ( born Virginia Patterson Hensley , September 8 , 1932 - March 5 , 1963 ) was a superbly gifted country music singer -- very few could , can or ever will match her ability to take any tune and make it sound wonderful , special , fresh and very new !

AGEIT17HENDIS,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5,"Frankly, on the face of it Patsy Cline would not fall into my idea of a torch singer. That is, until you heard that voice coming out of the past to chill you to the marrow with her heart-rendering versions of some very classic country and crossover ballads. For those of us who came of age in the late 1950's or early 1960's this was the music at the high school dance where you got to ask that guy or girl that you had your eye on for that slow dance that gave you time to talk and feel out the situation. Thanks, Patsy. This volume contains so many classics it is hard to know where to begin but I counted at least 15 that you ABSOLUTELY need to listen to. That, my friends, rather says it all. Classic Hank Willaims tunes like Cheating Heart, Willie Nelson's Crazy, others like Why's He Not You and She's Got Him. Wow. A few non-ballad novelty type songs could have been left out and done no damage but when you look at the overall package. Again, WOW.","Frankly , on the face of it Patsy Cline would not fall into my idea of a torch singer .

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5,"Patsy set the standard for female country singers, with many of those that followed trying (or so it seemed) to be the next Patsy Cline - even today, over forty years after her death in a plane crash. Many compilations are available but most of them seem to miss something important. Not this one - all of Patsy's classic songs can be found here.

Crazy was a top ten pop hit in America and (in 1990) a top twenty hit in Britain. Heartaches was Patsy's first American top forty pop hit. Don Gibson wrote Sweet dreams and had a big country hit with it, but once Patsy recorded it, it became much more popular and will be forever thought of as a Patsy Cline song. She's got you was an American top twenty pop hit and was also Patsy's first British hit, albeit only a minor one I fall to pieces was yet another top twenty pop hit in America. Walking after midnight is the song that began it all for Patsy in the fifties. Poor man's roses, Back in baby's arms and Leaving on your mind are other Patsy classics included here. Faded love, a cover of a Bob Wills song that, like Sweet dreams, is regarded as a Patsy Cline classic despite being a cover.

Also here are Patsy's fine interpretations of Lovesick blues, Half as much (Hank Williams), True Love (Bing Crosby), San Antonio rose (Bob Wills), Always (written by Irving Berlin) and many other fine songs.

You begin driving with one hand, the other is now a microphone or a very vivid gesturer of your feelings.  Your voice begins without you realizing, singing along with all of the memories of past best friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, and imaginary friends swimming in front of your eyes.  Then you realize that you are crying as you sing at the loudest your emotion allows. Two hands on the wheel now, clinging while you say whoa-oa-oa. Then your hand returns, holding up a hush finger to your memory, ""Don't speak!"" you wail.  The words all come to you and for about five minutes you are overcome.  Wherever you are, red light, freeway, parking lot, side streets, or waiting for the song to end before you leave your car because you are at your destination, you sing.

This is a very unique song because it has an extremely powerful message that everyone will enjoy. It's also a unique song about religion and Jesus' comfort and support which is one of the only songs of its kind to become a crossover top-10 pop hit. I especially enjoy how Ms. Lane picks up her pitch as she sings the chorus.

This song should have been longer with some sort of instrumental solo in the middle and at the end fading away slowly in conjunction with the other instruments. None the less I like this type of song from Nelly. I've been a fan off Nelly since she started in the late 90's. I was in high school and normally listened to rock music like Guns N' Roses, Metalica, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd etc. I hated when she changed to more ""dirty"" type music. But she had to grow up and wish she would make more of this types of songs. This is more classy Nelly and I like a well orchestrate song with melodies.

I first heard this band in 1999 when I purchased their album ""Plugged In Permanent"" on Metal Blade/Hypnotic Records. 11 years later, I am listening to ""This Is Thirteen"" on VH1 Classic Records. evidently, Anvil is more concerned about having fun than making money. also, they have had basically the same image on their albums with the exception of one album. it should also be noted that they are obsessed with the number 3, as all their albums have 3 word titles.

So I picked this new one up partly because that documentary The Story of Anvil was awesome!  And I have to say I am impressed with Thirteen as well.  I agree with everything Lips was pitching when they were shopping this record around in the movie, it is great stuff.  The CD cover is blah, but the music is what matters.

A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B000X6XH9M,1,1,4,"Lewis Black's third album, Rules of Enragement, is his first release where his material really became more political. Keeping with tradition, Lewis starts out his show by busting on the city he's performing in. This time around he busts on Minnesota and his bit on their cold weather is hysterical. As usual, he's spot on when it comes to tackling issues like greed in big business and society's obsession with health. In particular, his commentary on milk and water are very funny. However, the end of the album is dominated by his views on Iraq. While his commentary is accurate, it does tend to drag at times. All told, Rules of Enragement is a very good album even if it tends to be too political near the end.","Lewis Black 's third album , Rules of Enragement , is his first release where his material really became more political .

It's always better to actually watch a comic because then you can see the expressions on their faces, and that actually adds to joke just enough to make it funnier.  My favorite part has to be where he rants on about Enron where he comes up with a law should exist.  ""If you have a company, and it can't explain in one sentence what it does, it's illegal.""

Jim talks a lot about his recessive genes causing his absolute paleness, his Midwest upbringing, and his hatred of reading. But the most famous of his jokes is present here, the famed Hot Pocket joke. How much can one man talk about the destructive nature of this lovely frozen food item? You will be surprised.

The best part of this release is the included DVD with several of classic Gaffigan stand ups originally on Comedy Central. He sure looked really skinny and pale back then!

It is solid, but no where as strong as his subsequent releases, King Baby and Mr. Universe. It is worth it if you are a Jim Gaffigan fan.","This is a earlier , much more foul - mouthed Gaffigan .

His wry accents and pregnant pauses are unbeatably tight.

I love all of his dvds and cds, but DMT may be his funniest. [I will say, however, that I've never seen a comedian milk the same bits over and over on so many different cds. Nearly every bit he's ever done is on at least two and sometimes three or four different cds, providing less value than one might want. In that light, I'd recommend this, King Baby and Beyond The Pale, as they have almost every bit from his first four or so collections as well as new material.]

No other American comic seems as adept at pointing out our endless national foibles yet making them seem so endearingly moronic. Hot Pockets is pricelessly funny; I almost fall over laughing every time I hear it. In fact, to avoid that today I woke up and decide to start the week off right by laying in bed five minutes longer and listening to Hot Pockets on headphones. As usual I cracked up time and again, but was fortunately unable to fall over. I did roll over a few times though. Any comedian who can make me crack up time and again at the same bit is clearly doing something right. Bill Hicks and Carlin and Chris Rock can, and a very few others. Jim's in that small group, no doubt.

Great comedy is a combination of smart material, timing, and that x factor that separates the good from the great.

A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000X6ZBCS,1,1,5,"Comedy CDs are an iffy recommendation.  What's funny today might bore you tomorrow.  Some jokes are only funny the first time.  Jim Gaffigan's CD, ""Doin' My Time,"" scores high on the replay factor.  Perhaps it's his delivery (dry self-deprecation with a twist of smug).  Perhaps it's his avant-garde style of humor (he spends about a quarter of the time pretending to be a critical female member of his own show, weaving ""her"" comments with his).  Perhaps it's just his voice, which has a malleable whine to it that never gets annoying and which makes his self-mockery seem humorously authentic instead of just patronizing or pathetic.

Part of it is definitely the humor itself.  Whether his jokes make bizarre 180's (""I used to smoke.  Yeah.  Smoking's real addictive.  But you know what's REALLY addictive?  Heroin.""), or whether their humor lies in their dead ends; whether they take the ""didja ever notice?"" concept and snap it in half (his ""Hot Pocket"" and bottled water/Mexican food bits are a good example of this), or whether they're just plain crude, grouchy, silly and dumpy, they all stand up to repeated listenings.  There are a few times where you get the impression that the joke -- such as his bit on glasses -- would work a lot better if you could see the man (and, in fact, most of them are like that; Jim is almost as much fun to watch as he is to listen to), but none of them fail to be laugh-worthy because of it.  Pasty, flabby, and grumpy, though he may be, Jim Gaffigan is also a funny, funny man, and this is a funny, funny CD.

A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B000X964EY,-1,1,5,"Monolithic Baby! is the sixth full-length Monster Magnet studio album, it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time.

The album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.

The aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.

The fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.

Regardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'

Most Monster Magnet fans are fond of Dave's Vocals and lyrics, which are up to their usual high standard on this record, and most fans will be more than happy with this album, the songwriting is of a very high caliber and there are so many rocking songs that this is one of the most direct, focused and in your face records the band have made.

Of course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments. If that describes your feelings in similar situations then maybe give Monolithic Baby! a miss, elsewise do not hesitate to pick up a copy, it really is a very enjoyable record.","Monolithic Baby ! is the sixth full - length Monster Magnet studio album , it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time .

""There's No Way Out of Here"" and ""Ultimate Everything"" should go down in history as two of the most underrated rock songs of the 2000's.

Another thrilling work by James Horner containing one of the best cues ever written for Star Trek, the 8-minute ""Stealing the Enterprise"" sequence. The rest of the soundtrack is largely melancholy and somber, befitting the tone of the film. There's also a ten-minute sequence of source muzak for the completist.

Like the Star Trek II release, this one comes with extensive illustrated liner notes. Unlike the previous release, the original soundtrack is included on a second disc. I don't see the need, but it isn't a great deal of extra money, and this is another classic film score that anyone interested enough to read a review of should have.","Perhaps only slightly less memorable than its predecessor,&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Star - Trek - II - The - Wrath - of - Khan - Newly - Expanded - Edition / dp / B002IAPHK8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan ( Newly Expanded Edition)</a > .

AS77LYI1LPQE6,B000X9KKO4,1,1,5,"James Horner's score for Star Trek III is a bit personal for me.  It was the first soundrack I can ever remember wanting to own, and once my father finally did get me the cassette, my 8 year old ears must have listened to it about 1000 times over. Now that it's nearly 20 years later, that number is probably closer to 10,000, but never like this.

Film Score Monthly has made possible what I thought was impossible.  I had given up hope that the Star Trek franchise would never get the expanded music treatment that the Star Wars movies and the Lord of the Rings movies got.  Finally getting to hear recordings of the Self-Destruct sequence...finally getting to hear the spectacular music behind the Genesis Armageddon.  It's more that I ever thought we'd ever get.

A2EA0E30XG0M0F,B000XXZ31K,1,1,4,"Angels & Airwaves continues forward with their 80s-tinged blending of punk vocals, anthemic and chest-beating U2 choruses, and the guitar shadings and conceptual nature of classic Pink Floyd. All in all, some of my favorite musical touchstones that have been part of the soundtrack to my life.

""Call To Arms"" opens in classic AvA style, widescreen and epic, beautiful chiming guitars and pulsing keyboards building up into a huge song with big choruses and gorgeous Hammond organ.

""Everything's Magic"" has become sort've ""our song"" between my girlfriend and I. I heard it for the first time just days before we met, and it was played quite a bit in the car during our first few months. Everytime we hear it come on in a department store or the mall, we give eachother this look and a smile that is priceless. There's a nice pop-punk quality to it (which is different from anything on their first album), although the chorus is a pure adrenaline rush reminescent of early Asia.

""Love Like Rockets"" is another ""classic AvA"" song, with those trademark sequenced keyboards and drums. The intro is perfectly epic, utilising sound samples of President Eisenhower, astronauts, and various radio chatter and feedback that brings to mind the Space Race of the 50's and 60's. Tom seems to be making a parallel between the giddy rush of new love, and launching on a rocket into an unknown frontier.

""Breathe"" is sort've a ballad with nice soft keyboards. ""Sirens"" is fast-paced and frenetic and the chorus reminds me of The Proclaimers. ""Secret Crowds"" has a huge chorus, although I love the music and words during the verses a bit more. ""Star of Bethlehem/True Love"" was originally recorded for a compilation CD in late 2006, and is mixed a little differently on I-Empire. Another mini-epic, with trancey sequencers and Edge-like guitar effects. ""Lifeline"" has a keyboard sound that immediately brought me fresh memories of 1985, considering that it sounded exactly like the intro to Reading Rainbow.

""Jumping Rooftops"" is a cut-and-pasted percussion and keyboard interlude that leads into ""Rite of Spring"", which is another relatively experimental song, sounding more raw and punky as Tom reflects on his teenage life. (He said that he wanted to write a song that would sound like a garage band's first tune, written in high school.) The album ends with ""Heaven"", reprising musical and lyrical themes from ""Valkyrie Missile"", the opening track on We Don't Need To Whisper, effectively ending the two-album concept and bringing things full circle.

The lyrics continue in the same vein of We Don't Need To Whisper, and are positively infectious in their optimistic spiritual outlook, topics of reformation and reinvention, living your dreams, and never giving up. This is a message that I wish more Top 40 bands would preach, and is vastly needed during the hard times we live in. Being a grounded but optimistic person myself (as well as having a love for the 80's, Sci-Fi, and prog-rock), this band is perfect blend of my favorite things.

Overall, I-Empire sounds quite a bit like their last album, although has a couple of curveballs and is a little more organic sounding. New bassist Matt Wachter (formerly of 30 Seconds To Mars) and guitarist David Kennedy don't stand out too much (being buried behind layers of effects and keyboards, not to mention Tom's own playing), but drummer Atom Willard continues with greatness previously seen before, with a fiery, explosive energy, awesome fills, and a rhythmic groove that very nearly puts him in the ""virtuoso"" category. Check out his electronic/acoustic percussion showcase throughout the first few minutes of ""Star of Bethlehem/True Love"" (notably performed just as perfect in a live setting when I caught the band live in early 2008.)

The album artwork is a departure from the last one, instead featuring a painted montage (by Drew Struzan, famous movie poster artist of Lucas and Spielberg) of the band over a sunset horizon. Yet another reference to a positive 80's childhood.

If AvA fans can't get enough of this type of sound, I'd strongly recommend some other prog-rock bands such as Pendragon (Believe or Pure), 30 Seconds To Mars, It Bites (The Tall Ships or The Big Lad In The Windmill), Rush (Grace Under Pressure or Power Windows), dredg, Coheed & Cambria and Asia.","Angels & Airwaves continues forward with their 80s - tinged blending of punk vocals , anthemic and chest - beating U2 choruses , and the guitar shadings and conceptual nature of classic Pink Floyd .

I also wonder if Tom's heart is really in this material considering it was released only a year after their first album.

This is especially evidenced when the band shoots for romantic tunes like ""Love Like Rockets"" and ""Breathe"" (""True Love"" works out pretty well, though).

While none of the songs are bad, the songs that stand out the most are the final two tracks: ""Rite of Spring"" and ""Heaven"". The opening track ""Call to Arms"" is pretty good too, as are the instrumentals ""Jumping Rooftops"" and ""Star of Bethlehem"". I-Empire is still satisfying enough for rock fans, but there's really nothing extraordinary here either. B.I.F.

A235NA61RC6YC1,B000XXZ31K,1,-1,3,"The Good
""Call to Arms"" is no doubt the band's anthem for this album. A major difference you notice right away is that this album is a lot brighter and hopeful as compared to their 2006 album We Don't Need to Whisper. ""Everything's Magic"" adds a hint of keyboards and lots of progressive effects that complement Tom Delonge's (ex-Blink 182) melodic, high-pitched vocals. ""Breathe"" is not your typical radio ballad, but more like a sci-fi movie love song. Driving guitars mixed with melodic vocal breaks make up the track ""Secret Crowds."" Drummer Atom Willard (Offspring) experiments with some unique drum beats on this one. ""True Love"" employs electronic drum beats, unique guitar licks, and uplifting vocals.

The Bad
Despite the different effects and drum beats used, the album tends to sound like one long, drawn-out song.

The Verdict
The brighter more optimistic Angles and Airwaves are far more enjoyable than their darker and hopeless debut. However, lack of diversity keeps this album from returning to my CD player.","The Good

A26O6MQFA36WBK,B000XXZ31K,1,1,4,"Angels and Airwaves was a band that was created by former Blink 182 singer/guitarist Tom Delonge and his ambition to create something truly different was very admirable. The band's debut CD, We Don't Need to Whisper, was a very good CD that unfortunately suffered from a bit of a slow pace and some weak lyrics. But still, it was a great start and I was very interested to see the band's follow up CD, I-Empire. I-Empire (called by Tom ""the ""part 2"" to We Don't Need to Whisper) is a much faster CD that's a lot more accessible and easier to like. The music on here is really uplifting, and it's perfect music for playing VERY loud, especially on a nice sound system or while driving fast in a car. It's definitely a much better CD than the 1st effort. That said, though, it still suffers from some of the flaws of We Don't Need to Whisper; the lyrics have not improved; in fact, they've gotten even a bit worse. I think Tom needs a new approach to his lyric writing for this band; I thought it was weird during their first CD that the music is this futuristic, very ""epic and different"" in style, and presented itself as a grandoise and epic masterpiece...yet the songs were about ""your best friend is not your girlfriend"" ...it didn't work. I-Empire's faster music fits its lyrics a lot better, but unfortunately, the lyrics on here are often extremely corny, and almost every single song's a love song. I really wish Tom would try to sing about something else, as his ""I love you, you make me feel alive"" lyrics really started to get old for me on this CD. Blink 182's self-titled final CD featured some excellent lyrics and the songs showed real variety in their subject matter; Angels and Airwaves is about love, that's it. Only a couple tracks on this CD seem to deviate from that. That aside, though, this CD shows much more variety in the songs and much more exciting music and it easily makes it a more fun listen.

Call to Arms; 8/10. A very cool start to the CD. Some nice lyrics and a catchy chorus. A good song.

Everything's Magic; 7/10. Another good song, a very fast-paced and fun song; the lead single. Features great music that sounds a bit like Blink 182's Anthem Part 2. The chorus isn't too great, though.

Breathe; 8/10; A very nice song musically. The first slow song on the CD yet it's not unbearably slow. It's a little repetative lyrically, (he says ""I love you"" over 16 times in it,) but it's a really nice and ambient song. Well-done.

Love Like Rockets; 7/10; Although the subject matter of the song's a little stupid when you think about it, it's a cool-sounding and ""different"" song with a pretty cool chorus. The song's got a cool space-like theme to it. The ""imagine"" line's pretty cool. Overall, it works. Has a cool, powerful ending, too.

Sirens; 7/10; Took me a while to get used to this song, (the ""dadadadada"" lyrics got on my nerves at first,) but now it's actually pretty good. The whole song's very catchy and the verses are sung very well. Good lyrics, actually.

Secret Crowds; 6/10; This is more of a ""rock song,"" that sounds like it'd be perfectly played in a football stadium. It's not too bad lyrically, (providing the theme for the CD; ""If I had my own world, I'd build you an empire,"")and the verses are pretty nice, but there's unfortunately no hook here; the big refrain of the song doesn't have any sort of tune, it just features Tom singing slower and louder. It needed more of a tune or a hook. The band obviously disagrees, though, since this is currently the planned 2nd single.

Star of Bethlehem; 7/10; When Angels and Airwaves first played this song live, it was an epic, 6-minute plus song with a very long instrumental at the beginning with the lyrics eventually kicking in at about the 3-minute mark. For the CD, the song was wisely split up; most of the long instrumental takes place in this song, while the rest of the song kicks in on the next track, True Love. This is a pretty cool instrumental, both atmospheric and fast, as well as very memorable. Goes very well with the next song.

True Love; 8/10; Another great song, with a very fast chorus and featuring the continuing instrumental from the previous song. Lyrics are pretty cool. Another song that's definitely got more of a ""rock"" sound to it. Well-done.

Lifeline; 3/10; Really irritating song, the only bad one on the CD. Tom's vocals on this song are horrible; he REALLY strains on it and it just sounds very forced and corny. Really bad lyrics, too. Easily the worst song on the 2 CD's. Musically it's pretty weak, too. The verses have a good tune but unfortunately Tom's strained vocals end up making the song pretty intolerable.

Jumping Rooftops; NA/10; a cool little techno intermission as we transition into the powerful final tracks on the CD.

Rite of Spring; 8/10; It's hard for me to give this an 8/10 because the lyrics are really horrible; it's too bad because it's actually very good subject matter; Tom talking about his life, with a really cool chorus and verses; overall a very catchy and really impressive song musically, but the lyrics are pretty awful. Tom tries to rhyme to really bad results, and we end up with a song that tries to rhyme ""pass"" with ""cash"" and lines like ""it took about an hour to start a punk rock band, to offset my ****** up family land."" Had he not tried to rhyme I think we would have ended up with a MUCH better song lyrically, but still, it's a great song and one of the most memorable on the CD.

Heaven; 10/10; An excellent end to I-Empire with the best lyrics on the CD. It starts by sampling distorted clips from past Angels and Airwaves songs, then speeds up. Very great musically, very good lyrically. Serves almost as a part 2 to the apocalyptic Valkyrie Missile from We Don't Need to Whisper and it's overall a cool closing to the story told on the band's first 2 CD's.

Angels and Airwaves have greated a great ""part 2"" to their first CD that's both faster and more fun. Now that they've finished this story, though, I hope their next CD's something completely different entirely, especially in the lyrical department. I'd like to see this band sing about some different subjects at some point. Easily recommended for anyone who'se ever been a fan of Tom's work in the past of if you like this ""stadium rock"" genre.

That said, I have to end this review on a negative note. After listening to the recently released ""In Defense of the Genre"" CD by rock band Say Anything, I've gotta say that THIS is a band whose lyrics are real, whose lyrics are True to life and whose lyrics are layered and very deep, and whose lyrics really mean something to the band. Tom Delonge's lyrics for Angels and Airwaves, on the other hand, are so far removed from any type of reality and are so formulaic and so cliche'd that it gives his songs the depth of a shallow pool...it's like listening to the boy bands of the 1990's again....yeesh. He just seems unwilling (or unable) to stretch himself at all in this category and it was such a step down on this CD from Whisper, which was itself a step down from where Blink left off from on their excellent final CD. The lack of emotional weight on these songs and True hooks ended up making the CD fairly forgettable. I liked Rite of Spring a lot because despite its horrible lyrics, it was nice to hear Tom finally sing about something that was obviously real life. Despite these complaints, this gets a 4-star rating. It's a good CD and fans of Angels and Airwaves fans SHOULD definitely check it out. But don't expect it to remain in your CD players for long....It's more exciting than Whisper, but just not nearly as memorable.

In any case, this album is as good as the last, which is to say it's spectacular.

The only problem with it is that Rite of Spring is utter garbage; amateurish lyrics and simple, garage, my-first-punk-song from the musical standpoint. It's always skipped and the album should not have it.

The rest ranges from pretty good to really good. Very much a relief that A&A didn't screw things up after their first one, and it was not a fluke!","I already reviewed this but Amazon killed the review for an unknown reason .

Of all the CD's I've listened to this year, this one, by far, is very optimistic and uplifting, to say the least.  The anthemic, 80's synth-pop, stadium-rock sound works very well here.  And if it does sound formulaic, so be it!  Very heartfelt and inspirational too!  Tom DeLonge has definitely come a long way from his Blink-182 days, and I'm all the more glad for it!  Instead of the usual bratty, toilet humor, we get mature, ""reach for the sky"" sentiments, that is, keep going, no matter what happens to you in life.

A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B000YBH2UG,1,1,5,"Up until now my favorite Daft Punk album has been the amazing Discovery, but this album is so good it gives it a run for its money. While most convert albums suffer a bit from the ""noise"" of the crowd's cheers, in this case they actually add to the experience rather than distracting.

Discovery was a sweet box of evolving melodies, but this is a driving, thrumming, buzzing beat box of awesome! I always loved how the melodies of Discovery melded into each other, making you want to listen to the entire album. This is a series of Daft Punk's best songs mixed together perfectly with enough wonderous glorious bass to benchmark any speaker system.

If I have a single complaint, it's the that the Close Encounters of the Third Kind opening is missing from the audio recording, and should be included. Other than that, listen to this and enjoy. It's awesome music for just listening, but it's REALLY great for exercise, doing chores, or (obviously) having a dance party. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.

Final note: If you have a record player the complete Alive Boxed Set is totally worth it as it includes a backstage pass, stickers, bonus tracks, a turntable pad, and a gorgeous art book.","Up until now my favorite Daft Punk album has been the amazing Discovery , but this album is so good it gives it a run for its money .

This is a really great power ballad from the '80s, with catchy/memorable music, and touching lyrics about finding your True love/soul mate, without being sappy.  I don't like overly romantic or mushy love songs, and this one manages to be lovely without crossing into embarrassing territory (at least for me).  I always thought it would be a good wedding song.

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000YN32BM,1,1,4,"Fronted by the otherworldly voice of Ben Bridwell, Band Of Horses make dreamy folk music ala Fleet Foxes and My Morning Jacket. Alternating between cushiony pop, unabashed folk and guitar rock, ""Cease To Begin"" cuts a wide swath musically.

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000YN32BM,1,1,4,"Last year, Band of Horses released a truly impressive debut album ""Everything All the time"", containing several instantly classic songs like ""The Funeral"" and ""The Great Salt Lake"". Despite pretty much non-stop touring since them the guys are back already with a new album.

""Cease to Begin"" (10 tracks, 35 min.) is an equally impressive album. The opener ""Is There A Ghost"" starts off very BoH-like, only to crash into electric guitars and very up-tempo about 1 minute into the song, bringing the message that these guys have expanded their musical pallet. ""Ode to Lag"" follows, with equally strong music. The good tracks keep coing: ""No One's Gonna Love You"" is a great pensive tune, as is ""Detlef Schrempf"" (yes, he the German former NBA basketball player), and ""The General Specific"" closes the first half of the album, an exuberrant tune. After a short instrumental, the second half kicks off with a rousing ""Islands On the Coast"", followed by a great, somber ""Marry Song"", with superb underlying keyboards. Yet the best is still to come! ""Cigarettes Wedding Bands"" is THE stand-out track of the album, sure proof how much BoH has matured musically in just a year's time. The closer ""Window Blues"" is too twangy/country for my liking, and the least interesting track on the album.

""Cease to Begin"" is an outstanding album, and equal, if not better, than ""Everything All the Time"". They have not so much abandoned their early-My Morning Jacket-soundalike style, but expanded on it, to great effect. I've had the good fortune of seeing Band of Horses last year during the ""Everything All the Time"" tour, and if you have a chance to see these guys in concert, don't miss them, you will be blown away. Meanwhile ""Cease to Begin"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","Last year , Band of Horses released a truly impressive debut album "" Everything All the time "" , containing several instantly classic songs like "" The Funeral "" and "" The Great Salt Lake "" .

ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,B000YOIQEY,1,1,5,"I've been listening to this album on and off for over a year now, and I just keep coming back to it. It's one of the best recordings of choral music I know. This is quite a remarkable achievement since a pairing up of Mozart and Gabriel Faur&eacute; really shouldn't work. But it does work, and work wonderfully.

Mozart's Vesperae Solennes blends into Faur&eacute;'s Requiem so seamlessly that the first few times I listened to the album, I had to check the track listing to make sure whether the Mozart had ended and the Faur&eacute; begun yet.

They do sound different, don't get me wrong, with over a hundred years between them. But both works, performed beautifully by The Sixteen (the choir) and the Academy of St-Martin-in-the-Fields, radiate a warm tranquility, and this mood carries over seamlessly from one to the other, across a century.

A really great disc, highly recommended.","I 've been listening to this album on and off for over a year now , and I just keep coming back to it .

A3RN5W5IWPMKHD,B000YQZQUY,1,1,4,"With it's use in movies like ""The Departed"" and in commercials for Samuel Adams beers, this track has become something of an unofficial anthem for the city of Boston.

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000YZSG1Q,1,1,4,"Currently Emilie Autumn's image/music tends towards... well, the best description I can come up with is Tim Burtonesque, industrial-goth-doll. But her debut album had a vastly different flavor -- while it has the same dark edges and spatterings of industrial rock here and there, ""Enchant"" is a more romantic, Victorian/medieval album.

It opens with an ethereal, twinkly expanse of sound, and Autumn intoning the first four lines from Shakespeare's 53rd sonnet. Then she launches into a starry rendition of her own poetry: ""Across the sky/I will come for you/If you ask me to/Demystify/Your uncommon dreams/Stranger things have come True...""

That opening song may give you the impression that Autumn is a sort of Delerium/Enigma artist, but she quickly proves that it's not the case. Instead, she dabbles in a little of everything: hard-rock in ""Chambermaid"" and the blaring ""Heard It All,"" some spacey jazz in ""Second Hand Faith,"" rambling piano ballads in ""Castle Down"" and ""Ever,""  dramatic string-soaked ballads in ""If You Feel Better"" and ""Save You."" It ends with the satiny ""Epilogue: What If,"" which just reinforces that Autumn is not someone you can pin easy labels on: ""What if I'm a snowstorm burning/What if I'm a world unturning/What if I'm an ocean, far too shallow, much too deep?""

Among the best songs are a trio of pop songs  which have a sort of medieval/fairy-tale flavor: ""Rapunzel"" is a bittersweet song about... well, Rapunze; and ""Juliet"" is an exquisite, glittering swirl about... well, Juliet. And ""Rose Red"" swings between a spiky pop sound (""Tell me no stories and I'll tell you no lies/No one wants to hurt me/but everybody tries!"") and a luscious ye-olde one (""Rose Rose Rose Red/Will I ever see thee wed?/Only if you can capture me"").

I probably could have guessed that ""Enchant"" was Autumn's first album without even checking wikipedia -- it sounds like she was experimenting with different styles and trying to figure out which one fit her best. You can hear some romantic goth, classical, hard-rock, jazz and a bit of Regina Spektor's anti-pop here. But ""Enchant's"" different styles flow easily into one another.

This is mainly because of Autumn's classical musical skills -- she winds silken strings of piano and violin around almost every song, along with some shimmering keyboard and the occasional blasts of electric guitar. The entire album has a sort of rock'n'roll Victorian-romantic flavor, and quite frankly that combination is something I wish there was more of.

Her voice is also very lovely and versatile: she can sound punky, angelic, or low and powerful. And her lyrics and poems are very evocative and atmospheric (""But would you tear my castle down/Stone by stone/And let the wind run through my windows/'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose""), and tinged with a sense of bittersweet romance.

While it explores various musical styles, ""Enchant"" has a distinctive flavor that shows off Emilie Autumn's talents -- and leaves you wanting to see whatever else she's produced.","Currently Emilie Autumn 's image / music tends towards ... well , the best description I can come up with is Tim Burtonesque , industrial - goth - doll .

A10S47RQ7EJHX6,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"I've been a fan of Type O ever since I first heard ""Blood & Fire"" on my Mortal Kombat soundtrack cassette when I was 10. When Peter Steele died, I felt like I had just lost an uncle. But enough with the biography, let's get on to the review...

I picked this album up when it first came out, and I honestly wasn't very impressed. I liked the fact that they had gone back to the long, complex song structures, but other than that, I really wasn't feeling it.

Recently, I started throwing this album in more often and found myself loving it more and more. At this point, I would have to say that it's my favorite next to Slow Deep and Hard, and Bloody Kisses. Musically, this album is a complete success. Their maturity really shows, and the gothic Beatles-esque melodies that were absent from Life is Killing Me have returned.

I would go so far to label these songs as ""beautiful"". With the exception of Halloween in Heaven (it's waaaay too cheesey), I would give these songs 9 and 10/10 each. My absolute favorites are: September Sun, These Three Things, She Burned Me Down, and Hail and Farewell to Britain. I may even have to say this album is tied for 2nd place with Bloody Kisses only because this album flows better where BK was kind of all over the place stylistically.

All in all, this is a great swansong to Peter Steele's amazingly unique career. Buy this. Set aside an hour or so and listen to this album as a whole. Loudly, I might add. It will not disappoint.","I 've been a fan of Type O ever since I first heard "" Blood & Fire "" on my Mortal Kombat soundtrack cassette when I was 10 .

ASVNSWIXBV72Q,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"All of Type O Negative's usual elements are still firmly in place on their seventh full-length. For example, really memorable, Sabbath-inspired guitar riffing, good solos, prominent, grumbling bass lines, Peter Steele's masculine yet limpid vocals (including a baritone that is so deep, it almost matches his bass sound), both humorous and depressing lyrics, creepy keyboards, well-written melodies, bullying grooves, gothic overtones, occasional psychedelic sounds, and solid drumming are all definitely very much apart of the band's famous arsenal.

But there is also an intangible something and feeling of greatness present on 2007's ""Dead Again,"" making it easily their finest release since 1996's iconic ""October Rust."" For one, there should be absolutely no question as to if Type O are just phoning it in and/or recycling old material (which was something that some fans believed to be the case on 1999's ""World Coming Down"" and 2003's ""Life Is Killing Me""), because they now sound as inspired, energetic, and all-around strong as ever! Plus, they can't be said to exactly reinvent the genre here, but thanks to the rather broad and sophisticated songwriting on display here, these 10 songs do possess a fairly refreshing  and unpredictable quality. The album shuffles back and forth between several different moods and genres, including really heavy doom metal, sludge, thrash (thus showing-off Steele's roots in the genre, as a founding member of Carnivore), goth metal, industrial, and progressive and traditional rock. It is viscerally heavy and frequently quite fast, yet (in True T.O.N. style), it also retains a certain level of control and tunefulness throughout. Suffice it to say, this is one very rewarding, well-rounded, and epically epic piece of music. In addition, at 77 minutes in length (!), it should be more than long enough to satiate all fans' appetites for the foreseeable future.

The terrifically ominous and choir-abetted intro of the title track begins thins on a creepy note. It then segues into propulsive speed metal territory -- a rollicking groove, strong bass work throughout, and a sing-song-y chorus to add catchiness. ""Tripping A Blind Man"" works similarly: An old-school Black Sabbath-meets-Eighties thrash (i.e., say, Megadeth) piece with a neat gothic keyboard beginning before suddenly becoming almost crushing and breakneck when blazing tempos, fast guitar leads, and an exceptional solo (near the end) slam onto the scene. ""The Profits Of Doom"" falls somewhere between My Dying Bride, Crowbar, Acid Bath, Deep Purple, and Alice In Chains. It is a slow and extremely progressive, slow-burning, brooding, and trance-inducing epic which nears the eleven minute mark and has thunderous, trudging power chords that weigh a ton, a beefy bottom-end completed by noteworthy, and dirty, grungy-sounding bass lines, and vocals that trade-off between growling, eerie spoken-words, and impressive, proper singing.

On the flip side, ""September Sun"" is a very pretty, somber, textured, tranquil, and emotionally-moving Alice Cooper-esque ballad that is peppered with cool piano keys, melodic strings, and warm and powerful crooning. The lyrics are also worth mentioning here, because they are so sad and dark that it wouldn't be surprising if they leave a lump in the listener's throat. Next up, ""Halloween In Heaven"" is much catchier and more accessible than usual. Here, a memorable, driving, stoner metal-ish main riff is accented nicely by soaring, clean backing female vocals. At fourteen and-a-half-minutes long, song number six, ""These Three Things,"" takes the cake for being the set's pinnacle and is possibly the biggest highlight to be found here. It is an extremely dark, goth-y, and stormy piece based primarily on droning guitars and muscular bass work, but it also makes sure to include numerous different facets, and lots of nice subtleties, atmosphere, and mood-enhancers.

Taking a break from their more experimental side, ""She Burned Me Down"" is more proof that, when they want to, Type O Negative can always kick out pure doom metal with the best of them, and is highlighted by excellent, mesmerizing riffage, emotional vocals, and a fiery and winding guitar solo. ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" again takes things into an up-tempo pace; in fact, one could argue it sounds kind of like a Motorhead tune. It is centered around storming (and sometimes almost punk-y) drumming (including a few bass kicks), call-and-response choruses, and a steadfastly meaty and sludgy bass bottom. The curiously entitled ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" boasts a leather-clad rock `n' roll vibe, tasty, crunchy, lumbering guitars, and Ozzy Osbourne-inspired singing. Finally, the closing ""Hail And Farewell To Britain"" once again downshifts into depressive doom territory, with a bass-heavy mix, big, fat, chugging guitar riffs, lock-step-unison rhythms, and a great keyboard solo.

Cutting to the chase, ""Dead Again"" is, quite simply, one very amazing album, and an essential listen. And it is the sound of a band that is easily firing on all cylinders; hence, contrary to its misleading title, it is also proof that this band has never sounded more alive/lively. However, in an oh-so-cruel twist-of-fate, Peter Steele passed away from heart failure in April 2010, at the age of 48. But even if we are faced with the sad truth that we will now never again hear anything new from T.O.N., at least fans can take solace in the fact that the frontman lead a remarkable career, and unquestionably went out on the absolute top.

A1M9WSTQ1M7IGX,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"I reviewed the green-version CD when it came out.  I'm saddened beyond words at the untimely loss of Peter Steele just last week.  I'm convinced he had a lot of great music ahead of him.  That said, it's my opinion that he went out absolutely on top with ""Dead Again"".  When this disc came out, I listened to it nearly continuously for two years--no lie.  I've never had such a strong reaction to any Type O Negative CD, not even ""Bloody Kisses"" and ""October Rust"", my two other favorites.  While there may be some Type O fans who might disagree with me, ""Dead Again"" is so phenomenal that it's practically beyond criticism.  The ""highs"" have never been higher, and the overall level of quality is tremendous, with the exception of ""She Burned Me Down"" which seems to go on a bit pointlessly.  Standout tracks include ""Dead Again,"" ""Tripping A Blind Man,"" ""Profits of Doom,"" ""September Sun,"" ""These Three Things,"" ""An Ode To Locksmiths,"" and ""All Hail And Farewell To Britain.""

I could be barking up the wrong tree, but I've long thought that Peter Steele has to have had significant exposure to classical music.  This isn't a new opinion for me, but his development as a songwriter suggests to me he was drawing on an awareness of symphonic masters.  Two tracks in particular bear this out.

""September Sun"" is an astonishing song that became something of an obsession.  The very first time I heard track four, I literally groaned and said to myself, ""they can't be serious!""  ""September Sun"" starts like a ""hair band"" power ballad, with a simple nice piano intro--totally not Type O. And then it occurred to me, knowing that this is Peter Steele, this has to be a joke and it's going to get turned inside out and trashed. And actually something very different happens.  Steele does something profoundly Brucknerian with ""September Sun""--he takes a very simple basic theme, expands upon it, puts it through a metamorphosis, and it ends up becoming something far more imposing, grander, astonishing, and even menacing, than you can have even been lead to believe it would become, by the time the song is over nearly 10 minutes later, and really takes you somewhere. ""September Sun"" has to be heard in its astonishing entirety, and for me it is an especially imposing, threatening, beautiful, and entirely unnerving piece of music. It haunts me while still blowing me away.

""These Three Things"" is also a musical standout (I usually don't pay attention to the words, and listening to Peter Steele rant against abortion is more humorous than anything else--and it was not intended as a joke).  At just under 15 minutes, it's the longest song that Type O ever recorded.  And unlike some of their lengthier songs which are really just a collection of several smaller songs strung together, ""These Three Things"" takes musical ideas and works them out over the length of the song, transforming them by the end.  Beyond the drone introduction, the initial section of the song is musically one of the most brutal things that Type O has ever done--relentless, overpowering, and raw.  And then the music takes a 180, introduces a new musical theme, and then transforms it over the remainder of the song.  I wasn't overwhelmed by ""These Three Things"" initially, but almost more than any other song on this CD, it grew on me to the point of becoming one of the very highlights.

I've long had the opinion that ""Dead Again"" is Type O Negative's finest work--which is not to diminish ""Bloody Kisses"" or ""October Rust"" in any way, as great as they are.  In ""Dead Again,"" Type O pushed themselves hard, not settling to re-do what they have already done, and I think they made real breakthroughs and succeeded on every level.

To Peter Steele, let me say this:  THANK YOU, Peter, for giving us such outstanding music.  Words will never express how grateful I am.  I also feel very fortunate to have seen Type O play live numerous times.  You didn't do it by yourself, Type O clearly was a band, not a man with three backup players, but you were the creative force, the vision, and the voice.  I will be listening to your music likely for the rest of my life, and I have no doubt it will stand the test of time.  Many musicians have made a name for themselves, but few have had the capacity for such an original vision, and the talent to achieve it.  You did, and I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart.  At the end of several of a number of Type O's concerts, you would say right before leaving, while grasping your heart, ""Thank you, for without you, we are nothing,"" and it never came across as anything but heartfelt.  Hearing more about you after your passing, about your truly humble nature, I am more sure than ever that those words were your truth.  But my truth is, it was not you in our debt, but the other way around.  We are lucky to have had you sharing your gift with us.  Thank you, Peter.  If there is an ""other side"" (and I have a hard time believing there is), I hope you had a good journey and are at peace.  You deserve it.

An interview with the band is included as well, but it's nothing special, even though it concludes with Josh Silver touring Coney Island, which is actually pretty funny.  As for the album itself, you can check my old review for a more detailed take on it, but other than the DVD and new red colored cover, this is the same ""Dead Again"" that you picked up last year.  That's not a bad thing for more casual or new fans to the band who haven't picked up ""Dead Again"" yet, of which by all means this is the edition to pick up.

A3BZSCR2JB153Q,B000Z7S78U,1,1,4,"Type O is one of my favorite bands, and their album ""October Rust"" is my all-time favorite album. For a band with such a self-deprecating sense of humor and such a choppy musical history, Type O Negative creates powerful, emotional music that transcends the goth stereotypes it wallows in (and helped create). And Peter Steele's dark vocals, once sort of a gimmick, have become integral to their brooding sound.

Anyway, like I said, ""October Rust"" is the best album ever. But the follow-up, ""World Coming Down"", was rather disappointing. I was losing hope for the band when their last album, ""Life Is Killing Me"", turned out to be a significant improvement. While not as uniformly brilliant as ""Rust"", it had some excellent songs and brought back their sense of humor. So I had high hopes for the newest release, ""Dead Again"".

The album is surprising in a lot of ways. First of all, many of the songs are much faster than previous Type O material. Peter doesn't sing quite so deep and gloomy this time around, and guitarist Kenny Hickey does much more singing than before. A few songs break the ten-minute mark, something they haven't really done since their first record. And while much of their sound remains typically Type O, many of the lyrics deal with new themes and ideas.

According to recent interviews, Peter Steele has returned to his Catholic upbringing, and so much of the album deals with Christianity and religion. ""The Profit of Doom"" uses an asteroid striking the Earth as a metaphor for the Apocalypse. ""These Three Things"" deals with abortion and the Jewish state of Israel. ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" offers a rather twisted version of Genesis. ""Halloween in Heaven"" is a bit lighter in tone, dealing with all the dead great musicians playing a concert in Heaven. And as usual, some of the songs are simply about Peter Steele himself and his personal problems. The title track ""Dead Again"" is about drug addiction, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" deals with his anger management issues.

Thankfully, their sense of humor has not disappeared or been overwhelmed by the serious subject matter. I laughed out loud at some of the song titles, such as ""Tripping A Blind Man"" and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow,"" and several songs have some hilarious lines. Among my favorites:

""I had no pulse last time I checked / I'd trade my life for self-respect"" (from ""Dead Again"")

""Elvis ain't dead, so he isn't here"" (from ""Halloween in Heaven"")

""If only I'd known how cool death is / I'd have killed myself sooner"" (from ""Halloween in Heaven"")

And let's not forget their album liner notes. The band photo from Life Is Killing Me featured four sets of feet with toe tags on them. Not to be outdone, Dead Again shows a picture of four mangled chalk outlines opposite photos of skeletons inside coffins. And in the section for equipment used, it says ""Type O Negative has yet to learn how to use the following equipment."" I always get a kick out of that sort of thing.

Even though I think ""Life Is Killing Me"" had some better individual songs than ""Dead Again"", I think ""Dead Again"" is a better album as a whole.  The whole tone of the album sounds more concise and uniform.  But that's just me.  It is a bit on the long side, but that's my only real complaint.

As a whole, fans of Type O should be happy with this release. The band they know and love has clearly matured over the years, but their style is undeniably intact. However, some people might be put off by the religious content of many of the songs. People bravely hoping for a return to ""October Rust"" territory will surely be disappointed as well.

A5TJL46NVFH47,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,4,"Musically, ""Dead Again"" features some of the most ambitious, memorable songs in Type O's career.  The formula hasn't exactly changed, but these songs for the most part match up to past classics.  However, lyrically, this is easily Peter Steele's worst work ever, and oftentimes the inane lyrics detract from the emotional power the arrangements inherently have.

There are several reasons this might be the case.  For instance, it's quite possible that all Peter knew how to write about were the typical Type O topics: death, romance, wolves, fire, etc... The lyrics on this release instead attempt to make real inspirational/thoughtful and moral statements.  That in itself is not the problem, nor is the fact that apparently now Catholic Steele preaches his newfound faith through several of these songs.  The problem is that the lyrics are usually either simple and literal (""I'm a drug addict, always will be"", ""there's no excuse for drug abuse"", ""A child is torn from the womb unbaptized, there's no question it's infanticide"") or pun-filled attempts at humor (""Turn your cheek, gets ripped off, that's why we're given four"").  The song ""Ode to Locksmiths"" actually has the line ""Now I know why girls hate boys,'cuz Eve was in fact raped"".  It seems painfully obvious that Steele's faith is hardly sincere (more out of fear of death than anything) and that he's only preaching because he feels he should, not because he really believes in what he says, judging by the tired and sometimes ridiculous points he tries to make.  Steele himself even said in an interview that he had a hard time finding lyrical inspiration for this album.  A few of the tracks have decent lyrics, such as ""September Sun"" but most, being long songs, have their fair share of good and bad parts.  Only 2 become unlistenable, ""She Burned Me Down"" and ""Halloween in Heaven"".

Other than that, this is a much more energetic and punky Type O than we've had in a while.  Nearly all of the songs have some sort of throw back to their early days, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" is fast throughout.  Many of the songs are quite positive, also... this may be the least depressing album in their career.  Even the World Coming Down-esque ""These Three Things"" has a triumphant finale.  There's no question to me that the drama in their songwriting has improved... all of the epics on this album truly build energy and go somewhere.  Kenny's guitar work seems more Sabbath-inspired than ever before, and although the guitar tone has lost the signature, thick, flanged tone, the combination of Steele's vocal melodies and Silver's organ textures still creates the signature Type O sound.  The songs are full of tempo changes just like the Type O epics of old (""Black No. 1"") but there seems to be a logic and flow present in these songs that just wasn't there in those days.  The album is incredibly consistent, and has no filler and is easy to listen to all the way through despite its length.

In conclusion, ""Profits of Doom"", ""These Three Things"", ""Ode to Locksmiths"" and the haunting closer ""All Hail and Farewell to Britain"" with its excellent ambient outro all contain some of my favorite Type O moments.  I'd recommend ""Dead Again"" to any Type O fan who doesn't put too much importance in the lyrics.","Musically , "" Dead Again "" features some of the most ambitious , memorable songs in Type O 's career .

AMKHSFDQDXDMS,B000Z7S78U,-1,-1,1,"I was very disappointed with this release.  The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band.  The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.

The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'.  I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie ""Wedding Singer"". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like.  I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.

Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better.  Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses.  I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.

A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Few would have guessed that Type O Negative would still be developing and improving after all these years. Sure, this album may not contain any obvious classics, and some longtime fans may complain that distinctness and variety are missing from the band's most recent work. But at the level of an entire album, Dead Again is the most consistent and accomplished release of Type O Negative's career. The band's wild-and-wooly past achievements, not to mention Peter Steele's darkly odd sense of humor, are still represented here in ""Dead Again,"" ""Halloween in Heaven,"" and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow."" But otherwise, many of the songs on this album show great strides in the Type O game plan, and as an overall statement this album is a punishing display of sonic architecture and mood manipulation. The playing is better than ever before, with guitarist Kenny Hickey and drummer Johnny Kelly toughening up their attacks considerably. Kenny's throat-shredder vocals are also utilized with great success, offering effective counterpoints to Peter's always grave-rattling lower baritone. There is some intrigue in the songwriting department as well, including the dramatic quasi-ballad ""September Sun,"" which includes a surprisingly romantic piano intro from Josh Silver.

Meanwhile, Type O's songs are getting longer and longer overall, and here the lengthy compositions offer the band room for True musical exploration, rather than just repetition. This album's pinnacle is surely the sinister epic ""The Profit of Doom,"" while the 14-minute apocalypse ""These Three Things"" actually manages to stay musically fascinating throughout its entire length (though it tends toward Tool-ness in places). One source of static here may be the lyrics, as Peter's eccentric manic-depressive humor has been largely replaced by esoteric neo-Catholic theology, particularly in ""An Ode to Locksmiths"" and the aforementioned ""These Three Things."" Also, many reviewers seem to be picking out one song that doesn't quite work, and I would nominate the sluggish ""She Burned Me Down,"" which isn't quite the epic slow-burner that it thinks it is.

A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"TON returns to inject a major dose of truly exceptional musick into the basilar membrane which is both empowering and contemplative, considering the Rasputin theme and aestheics as well. The lyrical theme is entirely seperate to the aesthetic, which makes them both distinct unto themselves:

Musick

Track List: 1. Dead Again 2. Tripping A Blind Man 3. The Profits Of Doom 4. September Sun 5. Halloween in Heaven 6. These Three Things 7. She Burned Me Down 8. Some Stupid Tomorrow 9. An Ode To Locksmiths 10. Hail And Farewell To Britain

Dead Again preserves their evocatively best style, with rhythmically crunching and echoing guitars, haunting cathedral keyboards, the darkly erotic inunciations and deep reverberations from Peter Steele, and the hypnotic beat of the drums all combine to create another Goth-Metal masterpiece akin to Bloody Kisses. As is typical TON, each song takes its time, coursing and describing the emotions, while stimulating a sense of sweet euphoria.

Of note, The Profit of Doom, dealing with The Antichrist Beast of Revelation complete with references to the six triumverate; Halloween In Heaven, a jaunty tune featuring a female voice {Tara VanFlower of Lycia} complimenting Steele's well with a pleasing contrast. September Sun, & These Three Things combine ponderous ballad moments with sudden bursts of energy creating a perfect mix of melancholy and rage.

Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find an additional disc contained inside with a Live recording featuring tracks from Bloody Kisses {Christian Woman, Love You To Death, Black No. 1}, October Rust {Everything Dies / My Girlfriend's Girlfriend}, Slow Deep & Hard, {Gravitational Constant}, and Origin of The [...]{Are You Afraid}, all of which sounds extraordinary.

Overall, Dead Again contains a mutiplicity of content from the art {even the thorny vines on the CD itself is a very nice touch} to the quantity of music, which hearkens to Bloody Kisses and October Rust while standing upon its own merit. Highly recommended.

Aesthetics

The cover art features Grigori Efimovich Rasputin, Mystic, so called ""Holy Devil"" and ""Mad Monk"", deriving from The Khlysty, a sect who practiced self-flagellation, although he disagreed with their masochistic methods and basically became a renegade monk with a penchant for carnal indulgence - from imbibing in copious libations, passionate dance {it was rumored that he even celebrated a phallic cavort with the legendary ample appendage} , to sensual pleasures with many of the local women who admired his extraordinary abilities, as well as his libertine lifestyle, in which he revelled, and was more than willing and able to satisfy on a frequent basis.

His influence pervaded the Russian Aristocracy, wherein he had the Czar and Czarina transfixed. Briefly, extremely fortunate for them, he attained the power to heal, and used that ability to cure the Czar's son Alex, which gained their unyielding loyalty. From the beginning, there were those who resented him, claiming he was in league with The Devil. Through treachorous subterfuge, he was tricked and betrayed, and eventually excarnated after displaying apparent invincibility, to the fear and trepidation of his detractors.

He lived his life to the fullest, attained a passionate joie de vivre, employing lesser magic principles to charm and confound when it served his purposes, and excelled in his chosen endeavors, all of which designates him a de-facto Satanist, in My estimation.

The back cover features the images of Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and Alex, the unfortunate royal children who were assassinated {with the exception of Maria, who would later write a book entitled ""Rasputin: The Man Behind The Myth""} in Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) on 16th July 1918, by the filthy hands of stuporstitious peasants wanting to rid the kingdom of anything to do with Rasputin. The ignorant frightened cowards.

The green font used on the entire album can be a bit distracting, which is something of a Russian version of the English alphabet, with several reversed letters. Also mentionable, the booklet is a fold-out cross design containing full lyrics and liner notes.","TON returns to inject a major dose of truly exceptional musick into the basilar membrane which is both empowering and contemplative , considering the Rasputin theme and aestheics as well . The lyrical theme is entirely seperate to the aesthetic , which makes them both distinct unto themselves : 

 Musick 

 Track List : 1 . Dead Again 2 . Tripping A Blind Man 3 . The Profits Of Doom 4 . Halloween in Heaven 6 . She Burned Me Down 8 . Some Stupid Tomorrow 9 . Hail And Farewell To Britain 

 Dead Again preserves their evocatively best style , with rhythmically crunching and echoing guitars , haunting cathedral keyboards , the darkly erotic inunciations and deep reverberations from Peter Steele , and the hypnotic beat of the drums all combine to create another Goth - Metal masterpiece akin to Bloody Kisses . As is typical TON , each song takes its time , coursing and describing the emotions , while stimulating a sense of sweet euphoria . Of note , The Profit of Doom , dealing with The Antichrist Beast of Revelation complete with references to the six triumverate ; Halloween In Heaven , a jaunty tune featuring a female voice { Tara VanFlower of Lycia } complimenting Steele 's well with a pleasing contrast .

A1435P5AMCPB3X,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"This is the long awaited follow up to ""life is killing me"", and it was well worth it.  This is on their new lable SPV, who did a masterful packageing deal with their lyrics being layed out in a cross fold out booklet.  Enough about the exterior, this album dredges up sounds reminiscnet of Slow Deep and Hard and Bloody Kisses Smashed together and angrier than ever. The album has 10 tracks and clocks in at a dredging 77 minutes of Highs and Lows.  Personal favorite tracks are ""Tripping A Blind Man"", ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"", and the best track for me ""Ode To Locksmiths""  a fast and swinging ditty that even dredges memories of Carnivore.  There are two tracks that move in at 10 plus minutes (Profit of Doom, and These Three Things).  These tracks have about 3-4 tempo changes each and would make for great live tracks.  Halloween in Heaven, Dead Again, and Some Stupid Tomorrow will likely be good candidates for singles to push radio play of the group, being the shorter tracks on the album.  Finally, the track September Sun is a close second for my favorite track, a slow burner that is ballad like in only a haunting type o negative way.  The album is mixed brilliantly, just a great venture for these guys.  Buy this album, good intro to the band, and a must for fans.

FYI: for those of you curious about the 5 live tracks available at a large retail store, The CD clocks in at around 44 minutes, and has the tracks Everything Dies/ My Girlfriends Girlfriend, Are you Afraid/Gravitational Constant, Christian Women, Love you to Death, and Black Number One.  This is just a really cool addition. Collectors, run out and grab it!!!!","This is the long awaited follow up to "" life is killing me "" , and it was well worth it .

The song ""Profits of Doom"" is basically about the end of the world and wether you believe or not. As a previous comment by someone i will not shame, They did not see the relevence of the lyrics at the beginning of the song and what they had to do with the faster half. Obviously someone knows nothing of biblical history or they would. ""These 3 Things"" Is my favorite song on the entire album. This is 1 of their greatest albums yet.

Free of the personal demons that created the themes for World Coming Down and Life Is Killing Me(Great albums), Peter Steele and company deliver 77 mins of slow, dirgy sabbath-like metal, with a LOT of punk thrown in this time around(Dead Again, Halloween In Heaven). Kenny does a lot of screaming on this album too...like a lot. It also has its mellow points as well with September Sun. She Burned Me Down is almost like a sequel to Burnt Flowers Fallen, a great track. As a whole, the album will stand the test of time just like their other releases. Great metal record.

Second, it's actually sort of a meaningful song, at least to me.

together with all the great legends like Elvis, Jerry Lee, Roy Orbison,
Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins etc. He was nicknamed ""Jerry Lee Lewis' brother""
He then suddenly ""disappeared"" until I saw him on a DVD Country Family
Show from Nasville; an old grey man with a grey mustache was announced
by Bill Anderson, the host, as Ed Bruce. I couln't believe it! After 43
years this rockabilly star from the heydays of Rock & Roll sat there
and sang a wonderful country song called ""My first taste of Texas"".
I immediately consulted all Billboard books and found out that he
turned to country in 1967 and had built up quite a carreer until 1987.
The next step was to look at Amazon's music chapter and there were
several CD's available being this one the chosen one because of the

But it's also sad, as if saying goodbye to times long past.

I love music that takes me into that gypsy place. It's a powerful place for me, as if in some past life I was there and only remember the happy times.

At times I have really no idea what she is singing about at all but it sure sounds beautiful. The production value on this album is outstanding and the sound is crisp.

AC0Z6U9OWFRT0,B0010S8HRO,1,1,5,"Most of the time when I buy a CD, I listen to it a few times and then put it back on the shelf for weeks or months at a time before I give it another listen. There are occasions, however, when I buy a CD and it really grabs a hold of me. On these rare occasions, I become engrossed, almost addicted to the album. Martha Wainwright's self-titled debut has been one of these occasions.

Because of who her family is, it would be easy to immediately dismiss her as ""the sister of Rufas,"" or ""the daughter of Louden and Kate McGarrigle."" This would be a mistake, because Martha Wainwright's music is distinctly unique and she is a huge talent in her own right.

Her voice is gorgeous, but not in a traditional sense. Her voice has a soulful, high-pitched, eerie beauty, like nothing I've ever heard before. In her delivery, there is a real sense of emotion and feeling that really connects with the listener. With most albums, when you are done listening, you are done. When you are finished with Martha Wainwright's album, you feel as though you had just been visited by a presence, and that feeling stays with you, long after the CD has ended.

From the opening ""Far Away"", the listener is immediately swept into the CD. This song is subtle, building up ever so slightly, and is slightly underwhelming, which gives the song the perfect effect. The hauntingly beautiful background vocals add a nice touch. The more upbeat ""G.P.T."" has an infectious, singsong verse before going into its' soulful chorus. The bluesy morose ""Factory"" shows a more vulnerable side to Martha Wainwright. ""These Flowers"" has a kind-of a dream-like lullaby atmosphere. ""Ball and Chain,"" (not a cover of the classic Janis Joplin song) sounds somewhat Janis-Joplin like. It is here that Wainwright lets down all restraints and finally lets all that had been building up inside her explode. ""Why does this always happen?"" she yells, demanding an answer, yet knowing none will come. The album comes back to earth with the beautiful ""Don't forget"" a song about lost love. These types of songs are so clich,' but Wainwright sounds so sincere, and this song feels so lived in, that it's impossible not to be moved. The tongue-in-cheek ""This Life,"" tries to answer the question of whether the monotony of life in general is worth living. The light percussion over the subtle strumming of the acoustic strings creates the perfect backdrop for the song. Although it is asked whether or not suicide is the answer, this seemingly heavy-handed topic does not emotionally drain the listener the way an Alice In Chains song might. It's as though these suicidal ideas are just passing thoughts, not to be taken seriously. The catchy mid-paced ""When the day is Short,"" keeps the momentum going. The brutally honest ""Bloody Mother F***ing A** Hole"" is one of the album's centerpieces. You'd expect a song with a title like that to sound like Hole or Babes In Toyland, but that's not the case at all. This acoustic song starts out very subtle, building up angst as it rolls along, as though the hurt and resentment inside had been building up a long time and now is being vented out. But when Wainwright delivers the main lines ""you bloody mother f***ing A** hole,"" she sounds more hurt than angry. ""I will not pretend, I will not put on a smile, I will not say I'm alight for you, for you, whoever you are."" In other words, she is taking a stand, against anyone who would try to supress her, or not let her be herself. The explicit content sounds especially powerful because it comes out of left field. It's really unexpected. It's not like an Eminem album where every-other word is f*** this and f*** that. The bluesy easy-going ""TV Show"" has an engrossing stream-like lyrical flow. There's an array of strings in the background that are effective, yet subtle. The singsong ""Maker"" is enchanting, especially when the lush array of background vocals in the chorus kick in. The somber stripped-down acoustic ""Who was I kidding"" is heavyhearted, yet not overdone. The elegant piano balled ""Whiter I Must Wander"" is the perfect way to close out the album, ending on a whisper.

Martha Wainwright's debut is a truly wonderful listen, through and through. It's brutally honest, yet not melodramatic, confident, yet never cocky. Martha Wainwright is an amazing and very promising talent. One of the best CDs of 2005.","Most of the time when I buy a CD , I listen to it a few times and then put it back on the shelf for weeks or months at a time before I give it another listen .

Upon listening it becomes clear very quickly she has not only the voice but also the songs to back up this confidence.

If I didn't know any better, I'd have just as easily guessed this was from 1978 than 2005, sharing as it does a real kinship in sound to (then) emerging singers like Chrissie Hynde, Debbie Harry and in particular Kate Bush. Like Bush's debut 'The Kick Inside', arrangements here swoon and soar, choruses surprise and there's an almost frightening level of intensity at times, which makes for riveting listening throughout. It's also an album that's unafraid to tackle difficult subject matter, though for me, much of it is simply about attempting to transcend life's limitations.

After all that verbosity, all you really need to know is this is a beautiful collection of songs by a striking new artist - and if you like her brother Rufus, then odds are you'll like Martha Wainwright too.","On the cover of this , her debut album , Martha Wainwright wears a look of resolve and determination as if to say "" whatever it takes , my music will be heard ... but only on my terms "" .

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B0010S8HRO,-1,1,4,"I figured coming from such creative stock that Martha Wainwright's album would be 5+ star worthy.  It's good, but it's not great.  Like her brother Rufus, I like the idea of her, more than I actually like her.

I have heard her sing with her father (Loudon Wainwright III) and she came across much more bluesy than she does on this effort (check out ""You Never Call"" on his live disk). Her voice on this disk hits some qualities of Marianne Faithful (great) to some more alt. generic female lead singer(not so great).

The good thing (for me) is that she kind of defies a certain style.  It's not that she's all over the place, just that the music doesn't fit nicely into one genre.

Wainwright's writing is pretty good for her initial effort. I think that's where all her family's strentgh lies anyway...which is not a knock to their performing abilities.

But like most disks there are some outstanding tracks: ""When the Day is Short"", ""Wither I Must Wander"" and the oft mentioned ode (?)to her father, ""BMFA"".

It's at least worth a check-out, if not a purchase.","I figured coming from such creative stock that Martha Wainwright 's album would be 5 + star worthy . It 's good , but it 's not great .

A3R9HPWFF9QWSN,B0010UX41G,1,1,5,"About a year ago, I bought three albums --the latest album by the Blind Boys of Alabama (wonderful), R. L. Burnside's A Troubled Mind (one of the two best I bought from Fat Possum records --the other was Robert Balfour), and this album.  In other words, I bought three outstanding albums, all at the same time.

So which one do I listen to most often? The Three Pickers.

I've been a fan of Earl Scruggs for a long time. His albums with Lester Flatt are incomparable. They're the only blue grass albums that compare to jazz in my opinion, like listening to early Louis Armstrong.

I like Ricky Skraggs, mostly for his background work on the Evangeline album, by Emmy Lou Harris. (I don't greatly like the one album I bought by Ricky with his own group.)

I know that Doc Watson is a giant and I love his voice and manner but I've never spent time listening to him, principally because C&W and folk aren't my first thing. I've spent fifty-five years listening to jazz first and classical music second. It's not that easy changing gears.

I bought this album first because Earl Scruggs was on it, second because Ricky and Doc are premiere players, and lastly because it looked pure and unadulterated, just world class performers playing together for fun.

That's what it is. All three pickers are in good form. They are having fun. It's clear they like being together. All of the songs they play are good, some wondrous.

I like the cuts with Ricky Scraggs' group least, those with the three of the pickers and with Doc and his son most. Doc Watson has a beautiful tenor-baritone voice; he plays fine guitar both in background and solo. Earl Scruggs still plays with the fire and passion he had thirty-five years ago. What technical control he has! Ricky Scraggs is a first rate instrumentalist and very good in ensemble singing, but less successful as a solo vocalist. I wish I liked Ricky's group better --it's good but the cuts with the other groups are better. Alison Krause is on some cuts but doesn't have much to do.

I usually don't like chatter on a music record but here it fits. The love --for the music they are playing and among the three men themselves -- is transparent.  It adds a warm glow to an exceptional record.

Besides being a collection of songs honoring  Seeger, these are wonderful on their own. Re-release these as singles, and  they will be hits in the folk-music circles, and could hold their own on  some more popular stations (like Chicago's WXRT).

For me, I loved Studs  Terkel reading ""Blessed Be the Nation,"" Jackson Browne/Bonnie  Raitt singing, ""Kisses Sweeter than Wine,"" and the deeply  haunting ""My Father's Mansion"" as sung by Billy Bragg and Eliza  Carthy in a celtic flavor.

Hearing Donovan's version of ""My Rainbow  Race"" was refreshing, and Dick Gaughan's dramatic rendering of  ""Waist Deep in the Big Muddy"" knocked my socks off. Surprising me  was Tim Robbins' ""All My Children of the Sun."" So he can sing,  too? Amazing.

Listen to Greg Brown singing ""Sailing Down My Golden  River."" He has a Johnny Cash thing going on when he sings it, don't  you think? Check it out. Very cool.

But for everyone who says that she sounds best on tracks about drama, ""Hurt Again"" and ""Talk to Me"" are right up your alley. The only problem is that after 16 years of albums, some of these topics can start to sound redundant. That's why that tracks like the NE-YO/StarGate-produced ""Fade Away"" and ""Come to Me (Peace)"" are a nice change of pace. Even the duet with Usher, ""Shake Down"", while only a fair song, adds a little bit of love into the mix.

You can still rely on Mary J. Blige to deliver that great R&B in a time where R&B is losing the battle with hip-hop and country music as the leading genres.

But I seem to be the only one on the planet who just can't get into this one. I simply don't get it. Mary has been selling millions of albums across the world for 16 years now and that could explain why, to these ears, she's beginning to sound a bit weary. She's been telling us all how she's incredibly happy now, how her life is exactly where she wants it to be and how, whilst going through all the pain in her recent past, one thing she's always strived to do is keep things real with her fans. This might all well be True but I'm yet to see Mary actually LOOKING happy in an interview or a video. (Jill Scott always looks happy for instance, even these days - and she's just been through a divorce!).

But maybe that's just Mary's way. Maybe it's the 'street' or 'ghetto fabulous' thing to; to never smile even if feeling blissful. Her continuous banging on about said bliss is starting to grate on the nerves a tad though. She's a strong woman, no doubt, and a trooper. She does ""keep on going"", as one reviewer said but at what cost? Like I said, the poor woman is probably just really tired.

When she burst onto the scene back in 1992 with songs like ""Real Love"", ""Reminisce"" and ""Love No Limit"", she showed energy, versatility and raw emotion that have long since dissipated. The bittersweet ""Be Happy"" and the poignant ""I'm Goin' Down from her sophomore album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life/dp/B000002OU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life</a>&nbsp;proved she was no one-hit wonder. And let's not forget her star turns on hip-hop classics like ""Can't Knock The Hustle"" with Jay-Z (1996) and ""I'll Be There For You/You're All I Need To Get By"" with Method Man (1995). I for one thought the title ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"" was absolutely well deserved.

But every subsequent album has been less satisfying, and more geared towards what was playing on the radio than the one that preceded it. By the time ""The Breakthrough"" came out, I was starting to lose interest. It was clear to any objective listener that Mary was just treading water and I've barely played the CD three times since I got it. This one I simply couldn't bear and had to take right back to the store and ask for something else.

As soon as I saw the video to her single ""Just Fine"", I had my doubts. The Michael Jackson homage-paying intro (and the video itself) was probably well intentioned but to me, they just fell flat. It just doesn't sound or look like she really means it. She's singing about being uplifted but she sounds (and looks) anything but. Jackson looked ecstatic in the video to ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" but to me, Mary looks like she'd rather be somewhere else, doing something else. It's not so much in her moves, it's in her eyes and her facial expressions.

The female empowerment of ""Grown Woman"" and ""Feel Like A Woman"" sound like the kind of thing that would play well to Oprah's studio audience but this listener just couldn't find the groove - and I'm no chauvinist. It would take too long to list the female empowerment tunes I've grooved to in my time.

Pharrell's multi-tempoed ""'Til The Morning"" and Ne-Yo's interestingly winding ""Smoke"" are probably the only two songs on here that break away from the made-for-radio formula that dominates the album and Mary is probably singing the best she's ever sung - much more control, much less excess - but somehow for me, that just makes her less interesting to listen to. A perfect example of what I mean is the solemn ""Fade Away"". Forget all the almost spiritual wailing and chest beating of the good old days, Mary sounds like she's barely breaking a sweat.

Maybe that's how music is now in the 21st century and I need to either get with the program or leave it alone. Or maybe, just maybe, as listeners, we've allowed our standards to drop to basement level and as a result, anything even slightly passable is lauded as the next best thing. Mary is undoubtedly one of the legends of our time and I'll never even try to take that away from her but I do wonder if the way many of us fans are almost deifying the woman these days, is blinding us to the fact that her music is simply not as good as it used to be. I realise that we're living in an age where creativity and individuality are not rewarded and where studio executives and radio programmers are now telling artistes what kind of music to make so it's entirely possible that Mary's heart isn't really in the music she's putting out, despite all her talk of the contrary. Whatever. In the end, we'll only get the quality of music that we as consumers demand.

Maybe Mary's new life is indeed the happy and peaceful one she says it is. All I know is that while it must be a good thing (especially for her) that all the pain is behind her and all the angst gone, her supposedly newly-found joy is not coming through in the music quite yet. To me, singing songs of empowerment and bliss while looking and sounding utterly miserable just makes Mary painful to watch - and to listen to.

The album will probably still sell truckloads and earn her all kinds of awards, so I know my view is the minority one. I also know that my review is very likely to be unpopular here but I had to say my piece. I didn't want to post the review but a good Amazon buddy of mine (who will remain nameless) encouraged me to do so, so here it is.

The Michael Jackson homage - paying intro ( and the video itself ) was probably well intentioned but to me , they just fell flat . It just does n't sound or look like she really means it . She 's singing about being uplifted but she sounds ( and looks ) anything but . Jackson looked ecstatic in the video to "" Do n't Stop ' Til You Get Enough "" but to me , Mary looks like she 'd rather be somewhere else , doing something else . It 's not so much in her moves , it 's in her eyes and her facial expressions . The female empowerment of "" Grown Woman "" and "" Feel Like A Woman "" sound like the kind of thing that would play well to Oprah 's studio audience but this listener just could n't find the groove - and I 'm no chauvinist . It would take too long to list the female empowerment tunes I 've grooved to in my time . Pharrell 's multi - tempoed "" ' Til The Morning "" and Ne - Yo 's interestingly winding "" Smoke "" are probably the only two songs on here that break away from the made - for - radio formula that dominates the album and Mary is probably singing the best she 's ever sung - much more control , much less excess - but somehow for me , that just makes her less interesting to listen to . A perfect example of what I mean is the solemn "" Fade Away "" . Forget all the almost spiritual wailing and chest beating of the good old days , Mary sounds like she 's barely breaking a sweat . Maybe that 's how music is now in the 21st century and I need to either get with the program or leave it alone . Or maybe , just maybe , as listeners , we 've allowed our standards to drop to basement level and as a result , anything even slightly passable is lauded as the next best thing . Mary is undoubtedly one of the legends of our time and I 'll never even try to take that away from her but I do wonder if the way many of us fans are almost deifying the woman these days , is blinding us to the fact that her music is simply not as good as it used to be . I realise that we 're living in an age where creativity and individuality are not rewarded and where studio executives and radio programmers are now telling artistes what kind of music to make so it 's entirely possible that Mary 's heart is n't really in the music she 's putting out , despite all her talk of the contrary . In the end , we 'll only get the quality of music that we as consumers demand . Maybe Mary 's new life is indeed the happy and peaceful one she says it is . All I know is that while it must be a good thing ( especially for her ) that all the pain is behind her and all the angst gone , her supposedly newly - found joy is not coming through in the music quite yet . To me , singing songs of empowerment and bliss while looking and sounding utterly miserable just makes Mary painful to watch - and to listen to . The album will probably still sell truckloads and earn her all kinds of awards , so I know my view is the minority one . I also know that my review is very likely to be unpopular here I did n't want to post the review but a good Amazon buddy of mine ( who will remain nameless ) encouraged me to do so , so here it is . Let the hissing , booing and clicking on the "" no "" button begin ."

I look forward to seeing how it gets mixed at the clubs, I didn't think they could improve Be Without You, but the Blanco version would wake up the dead, so im hoping he does a mix of this as well.

A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"As a life-long Mary fan, I had no preconceived notion about how this album would sound.  After so many years it's just nice to still have Mary in the ""game"" putting out good music.

Overall I love this album and have already put quite a few songs on repeat.  I love the album cover & rear cover art with Mary lounging on a classic vinyl collection and I love how each song melds into the next one.

I got the copy with the bonus dvd and while I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the disc included with her LOVE & LIFE cd, I still enjoyed hearing Mary speak about the album's concept and what each track meant to her during the recording of the album.

My favorite tracks are:  JUST FINE - great lead off single, it got me hyped about the album's release

IF U LOVE ME? - produced by Bryan Michael Cox and although his songs are becoming easily identifiable with the pretty piano riffs, this is still a uniquely ""Mary joint""

FEEL LIKE A WOMAN, STAY DOWN, HURT AGAIN, SHAKE DOWN (great duet with Usher), SMOKE, COME TO ME (PEACE), TILL THE MORNING (love the beats & musical production) & FADE AWAY - very moving song, the lyrics made me cry & Mary sounds terrific!

Overall, this is a strong collection of songs, Mary sounds great and I'd recommend it to any any fan whether you're a Mary-newbie or a long-timer.","As a life - long Mary fan , I had no preconceived notion about how this album would sound .

There are jazzy inflections, girl group coquettishness, nuanced phrasing: a full range of tones and textures.

A24N1BAS3CU27H,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Mary J. Blige returns with her eighth studio album, ""Growing pains"". I've been a fan of hers ever since she burst onto the scene singing about ""Real love"". Sixteen years later, she's still as strong as ever; ""Growing pains"" became her fourth US chart topping album and has sold over a million so far. It's the latest instalment in a musical journey, which intentionally or not has chronicled the state of her life at the time of each release.

This is no different. Very much in love (with her husband and with herself), the songs reflect this. From lead-off single, the upbeat joyous hand-clap filled ""Just fine"" where she states she's just that, thank you (from the same team that gave Rihanna her chart ""raining"" hit ""Umbrella""), opening cut ""Work that"" (a song of female self belief/assertion no matter what you look like, lovely song), the more sparse guitar driven ""Grown woman"" (with Ludacris), There is a bit to dance to. ""Roses"" is an angry mid tempo song with unsettling beats (where you wouldn't want to mess with her; she's having one of them days), and closing cut ""Come to me (peace)"" is a lovely song with a hypnotic throbbing bassline and a pop feel (Love it!).

For ballads, we have just about everything else, with lyrics dealing with unabashed love,  or vulnerability; ""Shake down"" (a duet with Usher), ""Feel like a woman"", ""Stay down"", ""Hurt again"" (lovely harmonies), the string swathed ""What love is"", ""Work in progress (growing pains)"" (with autobiographical lyrics, the title says it all), ""Talk to me"" (where she's trying to rekindle conversation in the relationship), the piano sprinkled ""If you love me"", and the pseudo jazz feel of ""Smoke"" (with a slightly off kilter beat).

My favourite cut is her song about wanting to get away from it all when things get tough; ""Fade away"", a dreamy plodding mid-tempo number (a bit like ""Everything"" from ""Share my world"") with soothing harmonies. It's like sailing on a calm sea. Outstanding!

Mary has been on an upward tangent ever since the day she appeared on the scene, a tangent that shows no sign of dipping any day soon.","Mary J.

AJK5WHV1GW941,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Mary J. Blige is absolutely ADORED by many of my friends.  They love and appreciate her because she never tried to be ""Hollywood.""  She has been that same girl from New York that she was when she made her debut in 1992 and for that, we love her!  She was never surreptitious about her ordeals with drugs, abusive relationships and family drama.  The pain that she has endured is felt all throughout her music, which is something else her supporters appreciate.  She is definitely one of the most sincere and real people in the industry of entertainment; there's no arguing that point.  Her album, ""Growing Pains"" is a great offering.  It doesn't have any songs that are quite as memorable as, say, ""I'm Goin' Down"", ""Sweet Thing"", ""Love No Limit"", ""Be Happy"", or ""Not Gon Cry"" (I could go on for days, she has a slew of sensational songs!!!), but it is a good listen and worth purchasing.

 Mary Jane Blige has this unique way of delivering songs; that is, to me, what makes her music so listenable and memorable.  It is not easy to explain, but once you listen to her best songs, you'll understand.  With this album, her delivery is still as it has always been.  ""Talk to Me"" is a prime example of my previous explanation.  She does a nice job executing this track.  She extends her voice quite a bit here, and I enjoyed listening.  Even her faster tracks are heartfelt, for example, ""Just Fine.""  This song was released to radio, and though it took a few listens to lure me in, I was eventually taken in by this track.  The beat and hook are infectious.  It's one of the best moments on ""Growing Pains.""  In short, this song is about a woman who is truly confident with being herself and is not about to change because she's ""fine."" (I suppose that could mean ""fine"" as in mood and/or physical appearance, take it how you want.)  Someone strongly suggested that I listen to ""Stay Down"" and I am so happy I listened to him!  I listen to that song a lot because, lyrically, it is beautiful.  This song is about staying with your mate through the bad times because good times are sure to come and overpower those harder times.  Those who hear this song are sure to gain something from it.  This album is a bit flawed in a few places.  ""Smoke"" is the weakest moment on the album.  The production is not good, the lyrics are just alright; collectively, it's just not a good track.  Usher shows up for ""Shake Down"" and does a good job, but this track doesn't stand out.  Everything about this track sits on the average mark.

 R&B lovers, Mary lovers, and lovers of music, what are you waiting for?  Go get it!  This woman is a True artist and she exhibits that on this album.

A27RIWPJMP3XYD,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Mary J. Blige continues to bring it on practically every album she releases these days. And Growing Pains is no different. She busts out with the highly energetic and super sassy ""Work That"" to lead off the album. Then, like a well-produced mixtape, it seamlessly segues to the equally groove-happy ""Grown Woman"" featuring a decent rap from Ludacris. We are then delighted with the first single ""Just Fine,"" a simple ditty with a happy-go-lucky Mary expressing herself like only she can. ""Feel Like A Woman"" is a slower cut that basically tells men to treat her like a lady. ""Stay Down"" is a more serious track about pushing on through the tough times and not giving up so easily. Those same sentiments are reverberated on the songs ""Talk To Me"" and ""If You Love Me."" ""Hurt Again"" is a smooth track that discusses the inner battle between being in love and not setting yourself up for a broken heart...yet again. Usher has the album's only other cameo appearance for the straightforward ""Shake Down."" ""Till The Morning"" has an old school bounce to it, with lyrics from Mary to match. ""Roses"" is one of Mary's most powerful songs of recent memory, essentially saying that it takes more than just the little things to make a relationship work. ""Fade Away"" speaks about losing a love and having trouble facing the world again and moving on with all the heartache consuming your spirit. ""What Love Is"" is a very deep and analytical song about the different emotions and moods that truthfully depends on your current status with love. ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"" is a self-explanatory track about Mary still being just as imperfect as the next person. Mary gets a little abstract with the simple yet cryptic track ""Smoke,"" leaving room for the listener to draw their own conclusions on what she's really talking about. The subdued power ballad ""Come To Me (Peace)"" closes out the album on a positive note. Growing Pains is definitely closer to her classic material even though it doesn't quite reach those heights on it's own. Nevertheless, MJB brings us another solid effort to enjoy until the next album comes out. And with a formula that is obviously working, Mary J. Blige will certainly bring it once again.","Mary J.

AGAMDS21PJZPK,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"I instantly became a fan of Mary J. Blige once I heard the song ""You Remind Me"".  Her debut CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-the-411/dp/B000002OME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's the 411?</a>&nbsp;was an instant favorite of mine because of the way that Mary mixed r&b songs with hip hop samples.  Obviously, the direction of the production had something to do with that but since I am also a rap music fan, I was able to appreciate Mary J. Blige even more.  My favorite tracks ended up being ""Love No Limit"", ""Reminisce"", ""I Don't Want To Do Anything"" w/K-Ci, ""My Love"", ""Real Love"" and Mary's remake of the Rufus & Chaka Khan classic ""Sweet Thing"".  In 1994, Mary J. Blige released her 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life/dp/B000002OU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life</a>.  This is clearly my favorite r&b CD of all time.  Mary not only surpassed my expectations after her debut CD, but she definitely had gained a fan for life as she did her best to chronicle the good times, the pain and everything inbetween to put together a fantastic CD.  My favorite track was ""I Never Wanna Live Without You"" but I could play the CD in its entirety.  My other personal favorites include ""Mary's Joint"", ""I'm The Only Woman"", ""Be Happy"", ""Mary Jane"" and ""Be With You"".  The alternate versions of the tracks were phenominal as well.  I am sure everyone remembers Smif N Wessun on ""I Love You"", LL Cool J on ""Mary Jane"", and the late Notorious BIG (Biggie) ripping the ""I'm Goin' Down"" (Remix)) which used the beat for the track ""The What"" that was featured on Biggie's ""Ready To Die"" that also included Method Man.  Mary J had plenty of other releases:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Share-My-World/dp/B000002P64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Share My World</a>&nbsp;(1997)
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary/dp/B00000JWQH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary</a>&nbsp;(1999)
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-More-Drama/dp/B00005V9DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No More Drama</a>&nbsp;(2002)
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Life/dp/B0000AQS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Life</a>&nbsp;(2003)

From these 4 releases you had my personal favorites such as ""Seven Days"", ""All That I Can Say"", ""The Love I Never Had"", ""Special Part Of Me"", ""Ooh!"", ""Everything"" and ""Share My World"".  Mary J. returned in 2005 with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>.  She enjoyed tremendous success with her 1st single ""Be Without You"".  ""Darkchild"" blessed her with my favorite track, ""Enough Cryin'"" and my other favorites included ""I Found My Everything"", ""Take Me As I Am"", ""No One Will Do"" and ""Father In You"".  Mary's record company got a little greedy with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reflections-A-Retrospective/dp/B000JU8HHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reflections - A Retrospective</a>.  The CD started off with 4 new tracks which included the single ""We Ride"", the title track and ""King & Queen"" w/John Legend.  Then Geffen tried to conduct a greatest hits CD with the rest of the CD which was a mere 11 tracks, with 2 of the tracks being songs that were never on her CDs but were quality collaborations with the remix to Method Man's ""All I Need"", that was featured on ""Tical"" and ""911"" w/Wyclef Jean.

""Growing Pains"" was released on December 18th, 2007.  The CD starts off with the uptempo ""Work That"".  Mary makes an uplifting anthem for the ladies that tells them to be happy with themselves and not to live everyday trying to please other people.  Do your best to work with the best attributes that you have.  Ludacris appears on ""Grown Woman"" to return the favor for Mary J. appearing on the track ""Runaway Love"" that was featured on Ludacris' last release ""Release Therapy"".  In my opinion, ""Grown Woman"" is basically a continuation of ""Work That"".  You have to come to a point in your life where you are happy with yourself as a woman, mentally and physically.  Mary J. has struggled with that fact for many years in her life and she is trying to be a positive example for ladies, young and old around the world.  Luda does a decent job with his verse but he is trying to talk about some things that could be done with this woman instead of adding to the positivity that Mary is trying to bring to the track, with a touch of attitude.  ""Just Fine"" is basically Growing Pains' ""Family Affair"".  It doesn't matter how the week at work was or what trials and tribulations that you went through during the course of the week, it's Friday night and this beat comes on, go out and have a good time or just do the infamous 2 step like I do.  ""Just Fine"" is a nice, uptempo feel good jam.  ""Feel Like A Woman""  has Mary talking to her man about making her feel appreciated as a woman.  Whether it's a shopping trip, making love to her through the night or just making a nice gesture, tonight she just wants to feel like a woman.  The slow jam man, Bryan Michael Cox shows up to produce ""Stay Down"", which is a thoughtful slow jam.  In every relationship, you are going to have ups and downs.  No relationship is perfect.  The relationship is enduring one of those down times and Mary is asking her man to try to keep putting up with these down times so that they can receive the greater award at the end.  ""Hurt Again"" has Mary describing a situation where she is starting to have feelings for someone but she is hesitant in letting him know that because of all the times that she has been hurt in the past.  ""Shake Down"" is tolerable but when you see Usher and Mary J. Blige on a track, you have huge expectations.  Just like when you saw Usher and Alicia Keys on the track ""My Boo"", you expect the artists to make the collaboration memorable.  On ""Shake Down"", it's decent but nothing that you would expect when you have Mary and Usher on the same track.  Pharrell does his best to try to take you back to the 80s on ""Til The Morning"", but for the most part, unless you want to grab some old fashioned roller skates and go to the skating rink, this song won't work for most Mary J. Blige fans.  On ""Roses"", Mary has to get a point across to her man that she is fed up with all of the confrontations with her man and today she is not having it for any reason.  I can definitely relate to this track.  Men:  You're in a no win situation when this day comes so let her vent and this type of day will go by faster and be much easier for you to handle...lol

Clearly, my favorite track on ""Growing Pains"" is ""Fade Away"".  Stargate, who has produced multilple Ne-Yo songs, Joe's ""It's Me"", Chris Brown's ""With You"", Rihanna & Ne-Yo's ""Hate That I Love You"", Trey Songz' ""Can't Help But Wait"" and most importantly to some people, Beyonce's ""Irreplaceable"", produce this memorable Mary J. track in ""Fade Away"".  Ne-Yo co-produces and writes the track as well.  Mary finds herself at times, because of all of her troubles not even wanting to be here on Earth.  That's how bad times have gotten for her in the past.  Although, her life is definitely much better than those times, she may still have moments where she feels like she did before irregardless of her success because of her past transgressions.  Ne-Yo does an excellent job of reaching back so to speak in times in Mary's past to capture these moments.  Here's the bridge: ""Couldn't look myself in the mirror, asking myself how dumb could you be.""  ""Maybe everything would be much clearer, if no one could see me"".  Mary's times in the past were so bad she didn't even want to me amongst the living at times.  There were times when she just want to take herself out of this world and not even be here anymore.  That's where I feel the ""....invinsibility would be great"" part comes from on the track.  ""What Love Is"" is another memorable Mary, Stargate and Ne-Yo collaboration as Mary writes her rendition of what she feels the four letter word means just like Alicia Keys did on ""The Thing About Love"" from her ""As I Am"" CD.  The effects at the end of the track add to the track as well.  ""Work In Progress"" (Growing Pains) is also written by Ne-Yo as Mary walks you through how she is getting through life day by day the best she can.  She is clearly trying her best, but she also wants to let women in the world know that she is just as human as they are despite her success.  ""Talk To Me"" deals with Mary wanting to receive better communication from her man and the benefits of effective communication in a relationship.  ""If You Love Me"" is a decent track but it sounds too much like ""Be Without You"" Part 2 to me.  ""Smoke"" is clearly unlike any Mary J. Blige track that I have ever heard.  This track seems to be a part of Mary J.'s musical maturity. You never would have heard Mary on a track like this in the What's The 411 and My Life days.  As a matter of fact, she would have had a profanity laced tirade ready for Puffy if he even tried to bring her a track like this.  In the end, it clearly works for me and it's nice to see Mary trying different things.  ""Come To Me (Peace)"" ends ""Growing Pains"" on a good note as she is trying to win over the affection of a lost love from the past.

Overall, ""Growing Pains"" may not be Mary J. Blige's best CD, but if you look at her career since 1992's ""What's The 411"" to now, you see alot of progression in her music and lyrics in 2007.  Not only do you see a growth process with Mary as a 37 year old woman but you also hear the growth process through her lyrics and her production.  If you are a fan of the majority of Mary J's releases, then you should also add ""Growing Pains"" to your collection.

Just Fine","I instantly became a fan of Mary J. Blige once I heard the song "" You Remind Me "" . Her debut CD&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/What - s - the-411 / dp / B000002OME / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">What 's the 411?</a>&nbsp;was an instant favorite of mine because of the way that Mary mixed r&b songs with hip hop samples . Obviously , the direction of the production had something to do with that but since I am also a rap music fan , I was able to appreciate Mary J. Blige even more . My favorite tracks ended up being "" Love No Limit "" , "" Reminisce "" , "" I Do n't Want To Do Anything "" w / K - Ci , "" My Love "" , "" Real Love "" and Mary 's remake of the Rufus & Chaka Khan classic "" Sweet Thing "" . In 1994 , Mary J. Blige released her 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/My - Life / dp / B000002OU8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">My Life</a > . This is clearly my favorite r&b CD of all time . Mary not only surpassed my expectations after her debut CD , but she definitely had gained a fan for life as she did her best to chronicle the good times , the pain and everything inbetween to put together a fantastic CD . My favorite track was "" I Never Wanna Live Without You "" but I could play the CD in its entirety . My other personal favorites include "" Mary 's Joint "" , "" I 'm The Only Woman "" , "" Be Happy "" , "" Mary Jane "" and "" Be With You "" . The alternate versions of the tracks were phenominal as well . I am sure everyone remembers Smif N Wessun on "" I Love You "" , LL Cool J on "" Mary Jane "" , and the late Notorious BIG ( Biggie ) ripping the "" I 'm Goin' Down "" ( Remix ) ) which used the beat for the track "" The What "" that was featured on Biggie 's "" Ready To Die "" that also included Method Man . Mary J had plenty of other releases : 

 < a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Share - My - World / dp / B000002P64 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Share My World</a>&nbsp;(1997 ) < a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Mary / dp / B00000JWQH / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Mary</a>&nbsp;(1999 ) 
 < a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/No - More - Drama / dp / B00005V9DW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">No More Drama</a>&nbsp;(2002 ) < a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Love - Life / dp / B0000AQS8W / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Love & Life</a>&nbsp;(2003 ) 

 From these 4 releases you had my personal favorites such as "" Seven Days "" , "" All That I Can Say "" , "" The Love I Never Had "" , "" Special Part Of Me "" , "" Ooh ! "" , "" Everything "" and "" Share My World "" . Mary J. returned in 2005 with&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/The - Breakthrough / dp / B000BNTM32 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a > . She enjoyed tremendous success with her 1st single "" Be Without You "" . "" Darkchild "" blessed her with my favorite track , "" Enough Cryin ' "" and my other favorites included "" I Found My Everything "" , "" Take Me As I Am "" , "" No One Will Do "" and "" Father In You "" . Mary 's record company got a little greedy with&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Reflections - A - Retrospective / dp / B000JU8HHE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Reflections - A Retrospective</a > . The CD started off with 4 new tracks which included the single "" We Ride "" , the title track and "" King & Queen "" w / John Legend . Then Geffen tried to conduct a greatest hits CD with the rest of the CD which was a mere 11 tracks , with 2 of the tracks being songs that were never on her CDs but were quality collaborations with the remix to Method Man 's "" All I Need "" , that was featured on "" Tical "" and "" 911 "" w / Wyclef Jean . "" Growing Pains "" was released on December 18th , 2007 . The CD starts off with the uptempo "" Work That "" . Mary makes an uplifting anthem for the ladies that tells them to be happy with themselves and not to live everyday trying to please other people . Do your best to work with the best attributes that you have . Ludacris appears on "" Grown Woman "" to return the favor for Mary J. appearing on the track "" Runaway Love "" that was featured on Ludacris ' last release "" Release Therapy "" . In my opinion , "" Grown Woman "" is basically a continuation of "" Work That "" . You have to come to a point in your life where you are happy with yourself as a woman , mentally and physically . Mary J. has struggled with that fact for many years in her life and she is trying to be a positive example for ladies , young and old around the world . Luda does a decent job with his verse but he is trying to talk about some things that could be done with this woman instead of adding to the positivity that Mary is trying to bring to the track , with a touch of attitude . "" Just Fine "" is basically Growing Pains ' "" Family Affair "" . It does n't matter how the week at work was or what trials and tribulations that you went through during the course of the week , it 's Friday night and this beat comes on , go out and have a good time or just do the infamous 2 step like I do . "" Just Fine "" is a nice , uptempo feel good jam . "" Feel Like A Woman ""   has Mary talking to her man about making her feel appreciated as a woman . Whether it 's a shopping trip , making love to her through the night or just making a nice gesture , tonight she just wants to feel like a woman . The slow jam man , Bryan Michael Cox shows up to produce "" Stay Down "" , which is a thoughtful slow jam . No relationship is perfect . The relationship is enduring one of those down times and Mary is asking her man to try to keep putting up with these down times so that they can receive the greater award at the end . "" Hurt Again "" has Mary describing a situation where she is starting to have feelings for someone but she is hesitant in letting him know that because of all the times that she has been hurt in the past . "" Shake Down "" is tolerable but when you see Usher and Mary J. Blige on a track , you have huge expectations .

On "" Shake Down "" , it 's decent but nothing that you would expect when you have Mary and Usher on the same track .

A28N19JIB5161D,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I've been a fan of Mary's since 1992, so my review is slanted in her favor. The first single, ""Just Fine"" is a dance hit in heavy rotation on urban radio.  ""Till The Morning"" produce by Pharrell is a strong 5 star song.  ""Roses"" is a Mary Anthem, dedicated to ladies in tough relationships.  ""Fade Away"" produced by Ne-yo is a song about painful change, and ending a bad relationship.  Notice the theme.......Mary brings real emotions in her music, and that's why after 16 years, she's still on top.","I 've been a fan of Mary 's since 1992 , so my review is slanted in her favor .

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00110DT4C,-1,1,4,"Before I said this CD was about average. It's not. It's just different. There is a bit of hip-hip mixed with R&B here but once you get past the good tracks and to the second half of the album it's full of excellent songs that are mid-tempos and beautiful ballads. Some of the highlights of the slower songs are ""That's What Love Is"" (my favorite song), ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"",  ""Talk To Me"", ""If You Love Me"" (which sounds like it could have fit right in on her previous huge hit of a CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>) and even ""Come To Me (Peace)"" which ends the album on a slightly more upbeat and inspiring note. I think out of all of Mary's albums this is one of the most misunderstood. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Life/dp/B0000AQS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Life</a>&nbsp;some people just weren't digging this one. Honestly, L&L is one of my favorites by Mary. It was very downbeat for the most part and I think that's what people didn't like. Same thing happened here. More than half the album is slower and full of meaning and songs about relationship/self-esteem up's and down's. The production on a few of the tracks is a little more Pop/R&B than a lot of her earlier material too.

So even with certain differences I must admit that after listening again (just like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Life/dp/B0000AQS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Life</a>&nbsp;album) I find that this is a great (and once again) underrated effort by Mary J. Blige. To me it's more even than her next outing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stronger-with-Each-Tear/dp/B002UZ5G7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stronger with Each Tear</a>&nbsp;(although that album was solid and upbeat) and is pretty much as great as her previous effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>&nbsp;believe it or not. It's just more of a grower in my opinion. To me though some of these tracks are just amazing. I guess the ballads/mid-tempos actually makes this one of my favorite recent MJB efforts. I'm now not ashamed to say that. Beautiful effort.

4.4 stars.

AE9GUE3HHOX3U,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I think the biggest improvement Mary J. has made during her last 2 albums is she has remained consistant.  You can now listen to her latest cds without skipping over tracks that interrupt the flow.  Aside from ""What's the 411"" and ""My Life"", her albums were littered with junk that were just plain unlistenable.  Of course every mary J. Blige album has at least a couple of good songs on it, but ""Breakthru"" and ""Growing Pains"" are a complete journey you can play from start to finish.  I don't really like the title of the album though, ""Growing Pains"" reminds me too much of the old 80's tv show and it sounds too harsh like ""groin pains"".  I love the cover of the cd.  I love Mary's pose, it looks retro and Egyptian and she's also laying on a bunch of records which is great for me becuz I used to dj. You go with the shout out to vinyl, Mary. As for the songs on the cd, I love ""Work That"", I could listen to this song a million times, ""Just Fine"", ""Roses"", and ""Til The Mornin'"" are other standouts for me.  ""What Love Is"" and ""Fade Away"" are some of my all time faves from Mary J. ""Fade Away"" sounds a little alternative like Depeche Mode sounding, the background music is moody and deep. Towards the end of the cd, some of the songs go in that direction which is strange considering her R and B roots.  It's unique and groundbreaking, giving her music a fresh sound while remaining innovative.  The only song which doesn't do it for me is ""Grown Woman"".  It's not exactly groundbreaking material, the rap thing is so dated and played out at this point. My favourite lyric on the album where Mary really hits you with it is on ""Roses"". ""Sometimes I need a hug!""  Who doesn't.  Thanks for breaking it down Mary.","I think the biggest improvement Mary J. has made during her last 2 albums is she has remained consistant .

A3FTSMLO4972GR,B00110DT4C,-1,1,4,"This is a decent album; I personally was expecting more soul into it. What I actually got was a mixture like Geffen is trying to turn Mary J. Blige into a black Carole King. This became apparent in songs ""Smoke"" and ""Fade Away"". I did listen to the record three times consecutively on my recent trip and the first half was pretty good, what I was looking for was for Mary to hit me with something heavy like she has on all of her recent efforts (i.e. PMS, I'm Not Lookin', Changes I've Been Going Through, Not Gon' Cry) and then I heard ""Roses and personally, I'm split with the song. It's Mary but it's didn't grab me like Whoa!.
I did appreciate ""Just Fine"" a little more than when I did initially. ""Grown Woman"" I love and ""Work that"" picked up where the hidden track from her last album left off. The beat is nice, the lyrics are little B-rate. After ""Just Fine"" things start to run together and sound a bit same, then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little. Her duet with Usher ""Shake down"" is cute but a bit odd vocally. Usher is nice but I would've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary's (i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight). This album is a hit and miss with me, where only a good 3 songs are my favorites and they aren't the best of Mary.","This is a decent album ; I personally was expecting more soul into it .

After "" Just Fine "" things start to run together and sound a bit same , then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little . Her duet with Usher "" Shake down "" is cute but a bit odd vocally . Usher is nice but I would 've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary 's ( i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight ) . This album is a hit and miss with me , where only a good 3 songs are my favorites and they are n't the best of Mary ."

Mary J, though traveling some of the same roads as her previous works, branches out somewhat with ""Growing Pains"" with an album that is possibly more pop-oriented than anything that she has previously done, including ""The Breakthrough.""

""Growing Pains"" is a bit of everything that will, no doubt, increase her already large fan base.  Riding high on the strength of the first single ""Just Fine"" and its eye-popping video, the album is a well-crafted blend of R & B, funk, pop, and female angst and strength that can only be done by Miss Mary.

A1S2IY37JU93XS,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Back in 2003, someone apparently thought it was a good idea to bring the powers that were Mary J. Blige and P. Diddy back together, in hopes of re-creating the magic of their earlier works. Well, they were wrong. By no means was the result, Love & Life, a terrible album; however, almost any fan will agree that it's Mary's--for the lack of a better term--worst work to date. Yes, there were some great moments, but most of it was uninspired with some pretty lazy production, courtesy of Diddy. The disc barely went platinum, making it her lowest selling studio album by far. The ever-consistent woman who seemingly could do no wrong made a slight misstep. That's what made 2005's excellent release, The Breakthrough, such a pleasant surprise. With the huge success of ""Be Without You,"" the album's triple platinum status, its record-breaking first-week sales, and its eight Grammy nominations, it proved that Blige was on top once again and wasn't going anywhere. Two years later, she is back with Growing Pains.

From the photos, to the lyrics, to the themes and overall sound, Mary J. is definitely getting her grown woman on. Now a wife, she speaks with brutal honesty and maturity on serious relationships. They involve work, conflicts, disagreements, dependency, compromise, pain, passion, effort, and love, of course. Although it is a beautiful thing and brings much joy to people, to quote her, ""it ain't all roses."" I have read numerous reviews, from proffesionals nonetheless, that simply dismiss some of the lyrics as ""preachy,"" but I would have to disagree. Mary is a woman who has clearly been through many trials and tribulations in her life, and she just wants to share her wisdom and knowledge of the world to her large fanbase, who could most likely benefit from her viewpoints. (If these reviewers really can't hear these True-to-life statements without cringing, then it's probably time they put themselves in check!) The pictures in the album's booklet show Mary keeping it classier than ever.

The stunning back cover shows Mary sitting atop a cabinet of old vinyls. The only vinyl cover that you are able to decipher is Diana Ross' 1981 album, Why Do Fools Fall In Love. It is most likely just a plain coincidence, but it speaks volumes of Growing Pains. This album has the major crossover appeal that Ross possessed back in the day. While Pains will not alienate her solid fanbase that was built upon her original hip-hop/soul (which is still very present), each track, especially ""Come To Me (Peace),"" contains a slight change in sound that could let them be comfortable on almost any radio format, not just simply R&B. This could be due to some fresh producers and songwriters that have shown much promise recently, such as Ne-Yo, Tricky, The Dream, Jazze Pha, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, and the Neptunes, among others.

""Work That,"" as heard in the iTunes commercials, is a great choice for the second single. It is upbeat, inspirational, and infectious. The production by newcomer, Theron Otis Feemster, is simple and melodic, but it suits the song perfectly. On this, and a few other select tracks, Mary has a new swagger in her delivery that almost makes her sound like an MC. ""Grown Woman"" is another example of this. Over the hard-hitting and grungy hip-hop beat, she exudes confidence and pride in her womanhood. ""Stay Down"" speaks on marriage and how ""sometimes when we fight/ it don't seem like God's desgin/ but... I promised I would stand by you."" My favorite line appears in the chorus, when she begs her man to ""stay down/ we're almost to the very best part."" The production, by ingenious Bryan-Michael Cox, complements the emotion and triumph in Mary's strong vocals. ""Roses"" finds her nowhere near being preahcy; it's about those days when you want to be left alone and quite frankly, your lover just fans the fire. In between verses, she speaks, venting her emotions. On ""Talk To Me,"" she urges her man to communicate his feelings over an Emotions horn sample, casuing the track to have a very nostalgic, old school soul feel.

While this album is excellent, it is not flawless. Ludacris' guest appearance irritates me and almost ruins the great ""Grown Woman"" for me. His verse, while not terrible, is a bit vulgar, putting him and his supposed grown woman's bedroom business all out there. Lines like ""we some Stairmasters/ I make her get her exercise"" seem to contradict the classiness that Mary maintains throughout the rest of the track. ""Shake Down"" sounds a bit too much like something Mariah Carey would record. (I love Mariah, I just think that it's not like something Mary would do.) It's not a bad track, though. ""Just Fine,"" oddly chosen as the lead-off single, is a song I can take or leave depending on the day and my mood. ""Till the Morning,"" however, is my least favorite track. The Neptunes' production and writing has become very bland, stale, and predictable to me by this point in time. The song sounds like Kelis-lite during her Kaleidoscope era. The bridge is good, but that's pretty much all I enjoy of the track. ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"" is a musically very good, but the whole I'm-just-like-you-even-though-I'm-a-celebrity thing is getting pretty tired. ""What Love Is"" is also exceptional, but lyrics like ""it feels like joy/ it feels like pain/ it feels like sunshine/ it feels like rain"" are undeniably clich&eacute;.

The bottom line: It is not perfect, but Growing Pains is still a darn good album. Her vocals are on point, the production and songwriting is top notch, and the lyrics are mature and real. Growing Pains has a slightly new sound that will most likely lead to an even bigger crossover than The Breakthrough caused. Still, even her fans from the beginning will feel satisfied. How does she do it? It's a mystery. Mary J. Blige is a truly special and talented grown woman.

AIW5KNFD2114D,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"MJB is a force to be reckoned with. She comes out with amazing CD after amazing CD. How does she do it?!?!  She knows what her audience likes and why fix something that is not broken. She delivers and does it with 110% on `Growing Pains'.
As with everything thing May J. Blige does she puts every ounce of emotion and rawness into every song on this set.  Every song on here is a stand out that it's hard to single out any song. There is everything from classic slow Mary jams to the upbeat dance tracks to songs with a rock twinge fused into them.

My favorites on here include:
""Work That"" which has a great beat to it and promotes a good motto - to be yourself!
""Roses"" is THE cut!!  WOW!  Great melody, great lyrics and amazing vocals!
""Work In Progress (Growing Pains"" is a song that we can all relate to. Very good

I think the biggest appeal of MJB is that she is very relatable. She sings from the heart and it feels like every song was written for us; the listeners. She is your neighbor, your friend, your sister. Mary deserves every bit of success she gets and this CD is living proof of that! Amazing!!

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Let me preface this review by saying that no True Mary J. Blige fan expected Blige to return with an album that was as classic as 2005's brilliant THE BREAKTHROUGH. Blige even commented that she wasn't concerned about outdoing the success of that milestone in her career. While the exceptional GROWING PAINS doesn't trump THE BREAKTHROUGH, it is another solid album in MJB's career.  With that said, Blige does experiment more on GROWING PAINS that she has on previous albums which gives all fans a taste of what the future may hold for Blige. It is a well balanced mixed of adult contemporary styled R&B, hip-hop, and urban contemporary music.

The album starts off on the right foot with ""Work That"", which is honestly the best of the two singles released from GROWING PAINS as of yet.  The production isn't far removed from NO MORE DRAMA's ""Family Affair"" and proves to be a welcome addition to Mary's collection.  ""Grown Woman"" is one of the big surprises of GROWING PAINS in which Blige channels her hip-hop soul roots for a banger that will surely crossover to R&B purists as well as hip-hop savvy listeners.  Ludacris's guest verse is sound here, but Mary J. Blige makes sure that all eyes are on her as she shed's through this albums ""Enough Cryin'"".  The difference? Harder drums and a more spunky vocal performance from MJB.

""Just Fine"" follows and keeps the momentum moving forward.  When I first heard this track, I was actually a bit disappointed.  It took time for it to grow on me and when it did, it was hott!!! Again, ""Work That"" is still the best.  ""Feel Like a Woman"", ""Stay Down"", and ""Hurt Now""  are all strong.  ""Shakedown"" features Usher and while it isn't Usher's best collaboration (that would be ""Same Girl""), it is enjoyable.  ""Til Morning"" is this albums ""Gonna Breakthrough"" or ""You Can't Hide From Luv""  - it's nearly perfect.  ""Roses"" and ""Fade Away"" are solid, but not as exciting as the earlier tracks or the phenomenal ""What Love Is"", ""Work in Progress (Growing Pains)"", or neo-soul inflected ""Talk To Me"" with its six feel groove.  ""If You Love Me"", ""Smoke"", and ""Come To Me (Peace)"" are solid, though they aren't the best of the best of GROWING PAINS. Notably, ""Come To Me"" does features innovative production work combining the best of the adult-alternative pop with R&B/Hip-hop synths.

All quibbles aside, GROWING PAINS is destined to be another critical and commercial hit for MJB.  It may not match THE BREAKTHROUGH, but who cares.  Mary has been representing since circa 1990 and each and every album has been incredibly consistent - she can sing her butt off! Even LOVE & LIFE, weaker than her other efforts, was a shining moment because MJB can make bad material sound better than what it is and that is a gift. 4 stars Mary - Keep working that!!!","Let me preface this review by saying that no True Mary J.

A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Mary J. Blige follows ""The Breakthrough"" with ""Growing Pains"" which to me was an even stronger effort that claims the title of being one of her best, if not the best, albums of her career. She found her footing with ""The Breakthrough"" and any fears that she'd return with a cd that wasn't as strong should be put aside. ""Growing Pains"" has something for all of her fans and new ones, a sound that mirrors old R&B but also goes into territory that music seems afraid to venture into. After listening to the entire album, I found myself saying this was True quality. There isn't really a track to skip here; each song adds something to the mix and covers everything from a dance-vibe to a laid-back groove about love and loss.

Some of the standout tracks are ""Work That"" which is one of the upbeat songs, ""Grown Woman"" that could be this albums ""Enough Crying"" with Mary dishing out her good qualities and what makes her stand out at this point in her life. ""Feel Like A Woman"" is a new kind of song for Blige where she puts aside her reservations about being with someone and shows her most vulnerable of traits in this ballad-like track. ""Stay Down"" stands as my favorite, another turn for Mary J. Blige as she's asking her man to stay through the troubles and paints a picture of better days in their relationship that are to come. ""Roses"" is another track, more hard in sound, with Blige proclaiming she's all right and doesn't need people telling her what's wrong with her. ""Fade Away"" and ""What Love Is"" both are tracks that stand out for their production and the feeling she evokes. In what's perhaps one of her best closing tracks, ""Come To Me (Peace)"", is a big R&B/80s type of song that's a no-holds-barge explosion of sound and is moving and leaves you wanting more.

In all, ""Growing Pains"" is an absolute must own. Where most artist hit their peak at some point and become predictable, Mary J. Blige seems to be getting better with each year. The songs on this cd are fresh, original and yet sound different and a bit experimental for Blige as she matures into her new sound and comfort zone as an artist. Buy this cd, you will not be disappointed.","Mary J. Blige follows "" The Breakthrough "" with "" Growing Pains "" which to me was an even stronger effort that claims the title of being one of her best , if not the best , albums of her career . She found her footing with "" The Breakthrough "" and any fears that she 'd return with a cd that was n't as strong should be put aside . "" Growing Pains "" has something for all of her fans and new ones , a sound that mirrors old R&B but also goes into territory that music seems afraid to venture into .

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00113SLBA,-1,-1,3,"The quest to acquire all of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's music continues... and brings me to his fourth studio album and one of the admitted ""low points"" of Al's career.  After the phenomenal success of his first three albums, it must have been a shock for Al's fans (as well as himself) for his fourth album to be a flop in comparison.  In fact, many critics and even Al himself believed ""Polka Party"" would be his swan song and mark the end of his career.  Nearly thirty years later, of course, we know that's not True, but all the same, this album is often highlighted as a ""valley"" in his career, and most of its songs have been largely forgotten (with at least one outrageous exception).

After listening to this album, I'm inclined to agree with the critics -- while still fun, it's not Al's best, and while I enjoy a few of the songs, others are largely forgettable.

Al is best known for his parodies, and they make up about half of this album.  Of said parodies, my favorite would have to be ""Addicted to Spuds,"" his parody of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love.""  Food songs are practically a tradition for him by now, and this number takes Palmer's energetic original and turns it into an ode to the tuber.  ""Living With a Hernia,"" a parody of James Brown's ""Living In America,"" isn't quite as fun in my opinion, but it's a nice tribute to the original and shows that Al's capable of taking on a wide variety of musical styles.  The other parodies include ""Here's Johnny"" (El DeBarge's ""Who's Johnny""), a tribute to Ed McMahon of the Johnny Carson Show; ""Toothless People"" (Mick Jagger's ""Ruthless People""), which sounds curiously uninspired and without much effort put into the lyrics; and his by-now-customary polka mix in the titular ""Polka Party,"" which includes samples from various hits such as ""Harlem Shuffle,"" ""Venus,"" ""Sussidio,"" ""Rock Me Amadeus,"" and ""Papa Don't Preach.""

The originals are a mixed bag as well.  I didn't particularly care for ""Dog Eat Dog"" or ""Don't Wear Those Shoes,"" but I enjoyed the twangy country-western style of ""Good Enough For Now,"" as well as its hilarious lyrics that pay tribute to a ""just about average"" love interest.  ""One Of Those Days"" would have to be my favorite of the originals, as Al gripes about the various minor and major accidents and disasters that have befallen him today, ranging from losing a sock in the dryer to angry mobs burning crosses on his lawn -- and yes, it's the juxtaposition of the ridiculously major and hilariously minor disasters that make this song funny.

The most infamous number from this album would have to be ""Christmas At Ground Zero,"" the result of his record label requesting that he write a Christmas song -- you would really think that they would have learned their lesson about telling Al what to do from ""Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch.""  A merry and jingly tune carries some of the most disturbing lyrics of all time, detailing a Christmas celebrated after the nuclear bombs drop and reduce the world to a radioactive wasteland... and to top it off, the song ends with an air raid siren.  Even before 9/11 gave the term ""Ground Zero"" its far more tragic second meaning, it's a disturbing song... and yet weirdly hilarious at the same time.  Al may be goofy, but he also excels at black comedy.

Definitely not Al's best album, though a few hits do keep it from being a total wash.  If you're an Al completionist, go ahead and buy the album, but if you just want his best songs, I recommend you simply buy downloads of ""Addicted To Spuds"" and ""One Of Those Days,"" and maybe ""Christmas At Ground Zero"" if you don't mind some morbid humor.  Otherwise, save a full album purchase for ""Dare To Be Stupid"" or ""Mandatory Fun.""","The quest to acquire all of "" Weird Al "" Yankovic 's music continues ... and brings me to his fourth studio album and one of the admitted "" low points "" of Al 's career .

A246BU2DG7JC8I,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,3,"I agree with the reviewer who says he buys every release Rick does... I am the same way, as are most diehard Rick fans.  That said, just because I am a diehard doesnt mean I will like everything Rick does (not saying all diehards blindly love everything he does, but MANY do).  Rick is one of my all time favorite songwriters... I have no reason to be lackluster in any review unless it is how I really feel...

This is not a bad release.  Unfortunately, its not a good release either.  It's a solid ""ho hum"".  It's main problem is it and its songs is generally boring.  The songs are either slow or most are lacking in emotion.  Most are also very close to the originals in arrangement but a lesser finished product... in the way you hear when some studio band cranks out the top 40 hits ""as performed by ____"" that you used to see for $1.99 at department stores.  For me, it makes me think of the originals and why I like them better.  Broken Wings and Waiting For A Girl Like You are great songs originally... but they sound very similar here and in the case of WFAGLY, it was simply BETTER, with Lou Gramm singing it.  Unfortunately, there is not one cover here that I think is an improvement upon the original... (unlike how Rick made ""I've Done Everything For You"" and a few other covers through his career so much better than their originals).  Few here even get me remotely excited.  Here, the standout covers are Human and Baker Street (which is a lighter more heartfelt version than the one put out a few years ago by Foo Fighters).  The whole album is so lacking in intensity.  I know he intentionally chose songs that are mellow, but I just don't think that was wise and it makes for a release that is easy to file in your collection and forget.  There isn't any cover song except Baker Street that makes me want to hear it again.  Rick is a master of intensity in the right places... Shock Denial Anger Acceptance seemed to reiterate that point both to Rick and to the fans.  Had he done a cover CD with some more rocking tunes mixed in, I think it might have been at least more interesting if not downright good... this one just isn't and I can only hope this hasn't kept him from working on new songs for the next real CD.

The one gem on this release is Rick's own song Cry, and that alone really makes it worth something to the diehards (in addition to the fact that diehards will buy anything he does anyway).  It is a very good song that is emotional and has some great vocals upon it.  I find it only adds to my wish that Rick would have spent this time recording his own work than doing this!  Unless you have all other Rick albums already, you are better off putting your money into them than this album.  Especially be sure you have Shock Denial Anger Acceptance, Living In Oz, or Working Class Dog before even considering this one... those are Rick at his best.

(Again, this isn't a bad CD... but Rick's real work is so superior and an average release for Rick isn't indicative of his abilities.  I'd hate to see someone buy this as their introduction to Rick and come away thinking he isn't all that good.)","I agree with the reviewer who says he buys every release Rick does ...

A235NA61RC6YC1,B0011B6UI8,1,1,4,"The Good

There's not much to say about this release really. For the most part Springfield stays True to the original arrangements of the songs, albeit for a different guitar or piano tone here and there. With the songs I recognize, ""I'm Not in Love,"" ""Life in a Northern Town,"" ""Broken Wings,"" ""Baker Street,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" ""For No On,"" and ""Imagine,"" they sound just like the originals versions, except their being sung by Rick Springfield. All of the tracks chosen are mellow and flow nicely together. Rick is in great voice, but doesn't really challenge himself.

The Bad

It doesn't really make sense to include a new song (""Cry"") on a covers album, but at least it fits in with the rest. I would have liked to have heard a couple of slightly different versions or arrangements.

The Verdict

I know I've been a little critical of this album, but overall I like it. They're songs I know, from an artist I enjoy. The best thing about Rick Springfield staying True to the originals is that there's no room to mess them up, which happens sometimes with covers albums.","The Good

A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B0011B6UI8,1,-1,2,"The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought ""Cool...this just might work!"" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's True talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's ""I'm Not In Love."" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the ""Big boys don't cry"" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the ""I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back"" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with ""Under The Milky Way"", ""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Broken Wings."" Oh, sure, ""Under...."" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on ""....Town"" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for ""Town"", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for ""Wing""). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal ""Human."" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a True testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. ""Holding On To Yesterday"" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. ""Baker Street"" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. ""Let's Go Out Tonight"" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on ""For The One."" Much like ""Human"", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to ""Miss You Nights"" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! ""Blue Rose"" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. ""Cry"" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (""You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb""), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with ""Imagine"", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).","The whole point behind covering a song is to A ) better the original or B ) shake things up and make it different than the original .

AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,3,"Rick Springfield has been anything but bland, from his breakout ""Jessie's Girl"" to his previous release, SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE.  THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is, unfortunately, a largely bland effort.  Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker (there are some excellent guitar riffs in here), but his voice has gotten worse (worked well on SDAA, but a raspy, spoken-voiced version of ""Imagine""?  Come on).

Therefore, this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans, nor please his old ones (especially since it's a cover album, and he has only one original on here that doesn't measure up to his usual songwriting standards).  The main flaw of the record is this: Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit ""Human Touch.""  In fact, this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record, with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory.  And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality, and while a few of his performances shine (""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Miss You Nights"" specifically), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let-down.  Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield, if not in his finest vocal form, at least writing his own tunes again, and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits, or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA.","Rick Springfield has been anything but bland , from his breakout "" Jessie 's Girl "" to his previous release , SHOCK / DENIAL / ANGER / ACCEPTANCE .

A2VHYWSV7ZLZOV,B0011UKT0Y,1,1,5,"Drenched in guitars and strings, and in a minor key, ""There Is A Tree"" hooked me the minute Carrie began to sing, and from there the album never lost my interest.  Thoughtful, unusual songs yet sound familiar, and upon a second listen, feel like old friends.  The instrumentation, although relatively spare, sounds full and rich, complimenting Newcomer's lovely, alto voice perfectly, without ever stealing the spotlight.  A few tracks have gentle, sometimes driving rhythms, and there are subtle yet surprising sounds around every bend, so there's enough variety to keep THE GEOGRAPHY OF LIGHT from becoming too somber.  In fact the title and the cover art are quite apt, as the general mood of this wonderful CD does remind me of one of those days when half the sky is dark with a passing storm, yet clear enough in spaces to let shafts of golden sunlight through.

A couple of side notes: not only has Carrie written perhaps the only song ever sung about geodes, but she then ends this elegant album on an upbeat note with ""Don't Push Send,"" a highly amusing ditty about the dangers of writing and sending letters in cyber-space.  Presumably, she calls this a ""bonus track"" because it's so different from the rest of the album, but it works, and I've quickly decided that it's not a throwaway; it belongs here...

I've been listening to Carrie Newcomer's songs for many years, and have most of her albums on CD.  But it wasn't until 2000's THE AGE OF POSSIBILITY that I thought Carrie had finally done a truly solid album.  In 2002 and 2005, respectively, she released two more fine CD's, GATHERING OF SPIRITS and REGULARS AND REFUGEES.  The latter included a single from the previous release, a BEST OF collection, ""Betty's Diner"" which had been inspired by her own short story.  The subsequent album was all about the people she imagined as customers of said diner.  The conceit worked well, and I could hardly wait to hear what Newcomer would come up with next.  It would be a two-year wait, but it was worth it.  I believe Carrie Newcomer has topped herself and turned out her best album yet.  Not a False step here; this is a woman who has hit her stride.  She has always written compelling lyrics, but this time out, the the melodies, music and arrangements rise to their level in just about every instance.  If you like thoughtful, mature songs that are about something, and your taste runs toward the melodic, I can recommend this CD without reservation.","Drenched in guitars and strings , and in a minor key , "" There Is A Tree "" hooked me the minute Carrie began to sing , and from there the album never lost my interest .

So, I just finished ""Portal"" and OMG-AWESOME-SONG at the end prompted me to cruise over to Amazon and download this MP3. I'm pleased to report that this MP3 is identical to the end-game song, I was afraid that this might be a ""remix"" or some craziness when all I wanted was the actual song at the end of the game.

I've had no quality problems with this - loaded it into my MP3 player, hooked it up to the car stereo, and blasted it out the windows going down the highway and it still sounded great. Like all Amazon MP3s, there is no DRM nonsense to deal with - once you buy it, you can load it onto any device you like without having to mess with passwords or device registration.

For me personally, this is a very special song that has so much truth to it. I downloaded the words to this song from AZLyrics.com before I purchased this song from Amazon and so glad that I had all of the lyrics. Then my volunteer group went to a Senior Center and sang this song to the participants. And since there are so many kinds of love and because love is so important, this song says it all::

The song speaks of whispering love yet so loudly so that every heart will understand that love and only love joins man. And it goes on to say when we stand together, it is our finest hour--we can do anything we set our minds to do because it is love that gives us power.

This song is so inspiring to me and gives me hope and joy when I listen to it. And it keeps me so reminded that love is really all that matters at the end of the day.

Highly recommend this song!","This recording by The Judds of Love Can Build A Bridge has wonderful sound to it and The Judds sang it from their hearts , their voices sing with such passion !

A36EW68H08UOCS,B0011Y8IU8,1,1,5,"From what I gather about Jeanne Robertson, she doesn't consider herself a ""stand-up comic"" so much as ""public speaker,"" but make no mistake about it - she is as funny as anyone in the business.  She comes from a little corner of North Carolina, and if Mayberry actually existed, you wouldn't have difficulty imagining that her home must be just up the road a spell from Andy and Barney.

I recently had my first exposure to the Sirius radio network, and tracks from this ""Flat-Out Funny"" recording were prominently rotated between Bill Cosby and Jeff Foxworthy.  It is no faint praise to say that Jeanne Robertson is as funny as any of them.

Her stories are full of wry and hilarious insights into the human condition, and it appears that any obstacle in her life simply becomes ""new material"".  This also seems to mean that anyone in her life is ""fair game"" for inclusion in her routines.  We hear many details about her husband, Jerry ""Leftbrain"", including his hesitation to accompany her on a near-disastrous eight-day rafting trip through the grand canyon, which included recreational opportunities such as hanging precariously from the side of a cliff, using AARP-vintage hands that at home would have difficulty opening a jar in the kitchen.

This recording is an absolute obvious choice for that person or family or group who wants to hear ""flat-out funny"" comedy that is suitable for all ears, but the truth is that she is also as funny as the comedians who use the full spectrum of language.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

We don't laugh often enough, do we?  We don't take the time, as Jeanne has done, to actually NOTICE the things that are funny in the world.

She holds a mirror up to life and finds hilarious that which is looking back.

She has several funny, FUNNY recordings which you can get as audio or DVD recordings, but ""Southern Style"" is easily in her top 2 or 3 and includes perhaps her most famous story of all: ""Left Brain's Grocery List"" could stand toe to toe with Bill Cosby's ""Noah"" or Richard Pryor's ""Mudbone"" or Andy Griffith's ""What it was, was Football"".

You'll just have to hear the results, but as the tears roll down your cheeks with laughter the part of your soul that recognizes the truthfulness of things will know there is a little Left Brain in most of us.

Thank Heaven for BOTH of the Robertsons and for Jeanne's gift for sharing her magnificently cultivated sense of humor.

AZ, perhaps, one of the most underrated lyricists to grace hip hop, returns back to the scene by dropping his new album entitled, A.W.O.L., on his new independent Quiet Money Records label.  AZ is probably best known for his now legendary guest appearance on Life's a Bitch from Nas's classic Illmatic album.  AZ has always released quality material, but he was never been able to really blow up in the music scene.  Was it industry politics?  Bad timing?  Whatever the case is, AZ has never allowed for his lack of notoriety to effect his ability in creating quality music.

With A.W.O.L., rather than following the watered-down movement that's plagued rap for the last few years, AZ stays consistent and refuses to change up his formula.  He still has that smooth flawless delivery that's been blessing listeners since the early to mid 90's.  He's still that wise street poet who somehow is able to construct verses in a nearly flawless manner.  Plus, to further compliment the lyrics, the production on this album is top notch including beats by DJ Premier, Buckwild, and others...  The only weak spot on this album may be Envious featuring Bounty Killer, but that's only due to a clash of styles.

Top tracks include:  The Come Up, Never Change, Still Alive, City Of Gods, and Magic Hour.

There are standout tracks, such as ""Never Change"", ""Can't Stop"", ""City Of Gods"", ""The Come Up"" and the Bonustrack #2 ""Magic Hour"", but the rest of the album just seems to be randomly and unkindly put together.

AZ is one of the best MCs in the business (no doubt), but he needs to come up with a neatly organized album. I am thinking about DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Buckwild to produce it with guest appearances by Nas, CL Smooth, Common and Cormega.

A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,4,"For those of you who are familiar with the music of The Bangles, they have been called the female equivalent of the Beatles.  Their bright, sweet choral harmonies are enough to capture any listener's attention.  This was one of the bands that I had grown up with alongside Madonna, The Go Go's, and other 80's artists.  After three albums of mega smash after smash, they unfortunately imploded and took a 13 year absence.  Susanna Hoffs would create 2 solo albums, and Vicki/Debbi Peterson would create their own records under the pseudonym Continental Drifters.

So once they reunited in 2003 and released this then-new LP, it was as if The Bangles had never left.  Although their voices sounded a bit older, so has their sound matured.  This CD starts off with a fiery one-two punch of the title track sung by Susanna.  Other songs would be very energetic as well -- Debbi's ""Stealing Rosemary"", Vicki's ""Mixed Messages"", and Michael Steele's 2 very important songs (and my personal favorites as well):  ""Nickel Romeo"" and ""Between The Two"".  Check out the lyric ""a Cheshire Cat in yellow Beatle boots...""  Hint hint, anyone??

The only 2 songs I did not like were Susanna's ""I Will Take Care Of You"" and Debbi's ""Lost At Sea.""  But that is only from my personal taste and bears absolutely NO reflection on the band itself!  I was very saddened/disheartened when Michael Steele eventually left The Bangles permanently, before this decade even started.  So, in other words, you won't hear any of her tracks on the band's 2011 LP, ""Sweetheart Of The Sun.""

ADKHI1TUGAX4,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Of all the bands that I have grown up with since I was a child, The Bangles is one of the few that has stayed with me into my adult years. I recently have bought a ticket for their upcoming fall tour so in preparation I picked up a copy of the band's last studio album (when Michael Steele was still in the band) Doll Revolution (the band's first album since Everything). I used to have the cd years ago but had to sell it for some much needed cash. I am so glad I bought it again. I almost forgot how much I loved the album. I definitely can hear the maturity in the band's songwriting. Like in the '80s, the women all harmonize perfectly together as well as take turns singing lead. I enjoyed all the songs.

I am so looking forward to seeing the band later this fall.","Of all the bands that I have grown up with since I was a child , The Bangles is one of the few that has stayed with me into my adult years . I recently have bought a ticket for their upcoming fall tour so in preparation I picked up a copy of the band 's last studio album ( when Michael Steele was still in the band ) Doll Revolution ( the band 's first album since Everything ) . I used to have the cd years ago but had to sell it for some much needed cash . I am so glad I bought it again . I almost forgot how much I loved the album . I definitely can hear the maturity in the band 's songwriting . Like in the ' 80s , the women all harmonize perfectly together as well as take turns singing lead . I enjoyed all the songs .

Doll Revolution reached #23 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Charts and of the fifteen songs on it, only one of the songs charted. The group seems to be unfocused on this album. It seems that they just decided to put fifteen songs on the CD and see what the results were. Even their first album, All Over the Place, seems better then this one. Doll Revolution gets a B- from me.

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B0011XW5WQ,-1,-1,3,"I quote the first line from ""Between the Two"", the fourteenth track off the Bangles' latest album Doll Revolution, because I'm wondering if this is going to be their last album. It's been 15 years since they recorded an album together, and when I looked at the liner notes -- actually, there really aren't any, which makes you wonder if they just rushed into the studio to put this album out. Also, this album is on Koch Records, and Koch seems to be the place where everyone eventually ends up -- well, either there or TVT.
All the other three-star reviews for this album are pretty accurate, and each person seems to have a different opinion of which song(s) stands out. To me, the best song on here is the song they have out now, ""Something That You Said"" (its video also appears on the bonus DVD). And ""Mixed Messages"" is pretty catchy despite the lyrical shortcomings. But the rest of the songs aren't that great.
A lot of these songs really could have been written better. At times the lyrics go from lazy (""Ride the Ride"", ""Ask Me No Questions"") to crazy (Elvis Costello's ""Tear Off Your Own Head""). ""Grateful"" is tolerable, but it's the kind of song you'd expect to hear from them when they were still in their teens, not in their forties. And sorry, but the ballad ""I Will Take Care of You"" sounds like a watered-down version of ""Eternal Flame"".
People say a lot of the songs on here sound better live than they do on the album, and if that's the case, then you should just see them in concert. Or else if you're still feeling nostalgic about the Bangles, then just pull out their `80s albums or their Greatest Hits package. The ladies can still play and sing, but I wouldn't really call Doll Revolution a revolutionary album.

A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Al Stewart (had a big radio hit with the song Year of the Cat) said recently that he still has a great fondness for ""jangle-y bands"" -- guitar-based good time pop music that rocks, but not too hard.  What the Bangles have produced on Doll Revolution is a classic of the jangle-y genre.
When a band takes a break of over a decade and then re-forms for a new project, there is always justifiable worry that the old magic can't be captured again. The Bangles proved an exception to the rule by producing the strongest work of their career on this long-awaited new album. Granted, not every tune on Doll Revolution is a solid gold gem, but there are at least ten well-turned songs on this record, which is about the most anyone can reasonably ask.
If you liked the old Bangles, there is no reason you shouldn't be happy with the new Bangles. They can still rock, and sing beautifully produced and sincere love songs. If anything, their harmonies are sweeter and more perfect than ever. The recording does not have state-of-the-art clarity, which is a bit of a disappointment, but the fidelity is at least equivalent to their previous records from the eighties.
There is one sour note, not in the music, but in the fact that if you want the lyrics, you won't get them in the booklet. They are found only on the limited edition DVD version -- on the DVD. So you are supposed to run to your DVD player every time you want to check out the song lyrics? Not cool.
The Bangles have shown that you *can* go home again. They recorded this album on their own terms, took their time, and carefully crafted something they could be proud of. And they should be proud. This is good stuff. It isn't revolutionary, despite the title. They sing of love, loss, confusion, frustration, and loneliness. They make it rhyme, and they make us tap our feet and smile. I can't ask for more than that.","Al Stewart ( had a big radio hit with the song Year of the Cat ) said recently that he still has a great fondness for "" jangle - y bands "" -- guitar - based good time pop music that rocks , but not too hard .

A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"I have long thought of the Bangles as a second tier band, sort of the ugly stepsisters to the more enjoyable GoGo's, and nowhere near in the same league as the Cinderella of all groups, Fanny (still the premiere all-female band). I've always liked the group, I just wasn't moved by them. Too much of the time they seemed like four individuals fighting for the solo spotlight, versus a tight, together unit. Well, all that has changed with DOLL REVOLUTION, the new release from 2003's Most Improved act. Tight, cohesive and intelligent, this is a group to be reckoned with. This is clear right from the start; the disc opens with a blistering cover of Elvis Costello's ""Tear Off Your Own Head."" Susanna Hoff's opening ""HEY!"" only hints at things to come in the rest of the song...hand claps, a pounding rhythm section, tinkling piano and soaring vocals coalesce, resulting in one of the Bangles' best, hardest rocking songs to date. ""Stealing Rosemary"" has a rockin', neo-folk vibe to it, while ""Something That You Said"" has a delicate (yet fresh) techno groove behind it's hushed vocals and tender lyrics. This touching song of True love (""Showing you every weakness and feeling strong for it/I used to run from real love now I long for it/Now I know what I've been missing/Since I've been listening"") features an assured lead vocal from Hoffs, probably her best to date. The same could be said about Debbi Peterson and her aching take on ""Ask Me No Questions."" Gorgeous harmonies round out this beauty. ""The Rain Song"" has to be one of my favorite tracks. A mid-tempo rocker, it sports a gutsy lead vocal from guitarist Vicki Peterson and smart lyrics (""I don't think about us much anymore/Frankly the topic has become a bore"" and ""I don't think about us when I'm sleeping/It doesn't even cross my dreamlike mind/And I don't think I see your face through the curtains/Hell, I don't even miss you half the time""). This is an AC hit waiting to happen! Bassist Michael Steele steps into the spotlight and shines on her groovy ""Nickel Romeo."" This cut is a great example of how much the group has grown into a more unified musical unit. ""Ride The Ride"" is a rollicking group effort, while ""I Will Take Care Of You"" is another gentle Hoffs number. ""Here Right Now"" is a real gem that slowly grew on me. Drummer Debbi Peterson was always kind of ""the kid sister who has to be in the band"" to me, sort of a female Ringo, but she has SO come into her own on DOLL REVOLUTION, both as a vocalist and lyricist (""In and outta town/Time for you to settle down/Stand back, take a look around you/You're runnin' from the pressures of the restless world/Hush for a moment, baby just be still""). Captivating....simply captivating! From here we segue into another favorite, Vicki Peterson's hauntingly dark ""Single By Choice."" With it's opening chorus (""Single by choice/Never married, never ever divorced/Listen to the solitary voice/Tell you I'm single by choice""), one might think there's a bitterness to the song, but nothing could be farther from the truth...as you get deeper into the track, you see there's an intelligence and life-experience to it that's missing from much of today's music (""I know what you're thinkin'/She can't be complete/Til the right kind of man/Comes sweep her off her feet/Well I've been there before/Times four, times five/With the right kind of man/Barely made it out alive""). Brava, Ms. Peterson (kind of ironic, though, that Vicki just got engaged)! ""Lost At Sea"" is another winner from Peterson's baby sister...Debbi once again shines on this heartfelt ballad that builds and soars, with spot-on lyrics that everyone can identify with (""Can we try to salvage what we can/From the weight of water and sand/Lift us up again"", ""Well,you walk/Never ever looking back/One defends and one attacks/There's a thousand reasons to begin again""). ""Song For A Good Son"" is a great story-song from Steele. Intense and propulsive, the lyrics are stunningly visual - sort of a mini movie! - and Michael delivers them with conviction and in a strong, authoritative vocal. ""Mixed Messages"" and ""Between The Two"" are probably my two least favorite tracks on DOLL REVOLUTION, not because they're bad, just because everything else is so strong. ""Mixed Messages"" has a nice enough 60's feel to it, while ""Between The Two"" has a soaring (albeit slightly forced) intensity. The disc closes with the gorgeous ""Grateful."" Be it an ode to her children or a musical thank-you to her fellow band members for a successful second chance together, the song is delivered from Hoffs' heart and gut. Floating out of your speakers, it makes you thankful for unexpected opportunities and small surprises. Much the same could be said about DOLL REVOLUTION!","I have long thought of the Bangles as a second tier band , sort of the ugly stepsisters to the more enjoyable GoGo 's , and nowhere near in the same league as the Cinderella of all groups , Fanny ( still the premiere all - female band ) .

A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"I was so thrilled when their reunion album finally happened.  I did not, however, expect it to exceed classics such as All Over The Place and Different Light, and it doesn't, but the songs are as fresh as if hearing them for the first time ever.  After fifteen years... Wow!  Getting this prevented me from tearing off my own head, to paraphrase the leading song. Key=[lead vocalist]
After the phrase, ""One must tear off one's own head,"" comes a quick burst of snarling punkish guitar and Susanna's familiar sugary voice.  I haven't heard the original Elvis Costello version, but they really jam on ""Tear Off Your Own Head (Doll Revolution)""  This opening number makes this yet another classic in the Bangles pantheon of hits.
""Stealing Rosemary"" is a simple song of a woman doing the title action for her man.  What, without parsley, sage, and thyme?  Kidding.  [Debbi]
""Something That You Said"" is another classic, with the solid Beatles/Byrds influence heard with the guitar and the harmony vocals.  The drum machine in the background paints a modern addition.  And Susanna's voice never sounded so good!
""Ask Me No Questions"" has rhythmic overtones of the Beatles ""Rain"" without the feedback guitar.  The main chorus goes ""Oh, I'm in love with you/But I turn away when you look in my eyes/Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies."" [Debbi]
""Rain Song"" sung by Vicki is an upbeat guitar-oriented number where when it rains, she remembers her ex.  And there's a bitter taste with this line:  ""I'm doing fine as long as you stay locked up/Inside a cloud of grey""  Whoa! [Vicki]
That's quite a fancy dresser in ""Nickel Romeo"", someone who's described as ""a Cheshire cat in yellow Beatle boots"".  ""Strange desperation-you gotta cop that fix/Making every little girl is keeping you alive.""  That bad, huh?  [Michael]
""Ride The Ride"" has a similar beat but less ferocious than ""Doll Revolution"".  With signature guitar hooks, call it a close cousin to ""In Your Room"" [all]
Just what I needed, another tender ballad to melt my heart, and my favourite song here.  ""I Will Take Care Of You"" is an affirmative song of support from a loved one who will stand tall alongside through times of fear and sadness:  ""Smile, if you can now/Smile through your tears/Here where your fears are known/
Know you're safe at home.""  Magic! [Susanna, of course!]
Guitar and soundwise, the upbeat ""Here Right Now"" sounds like Green-era R.E.M. and calls for one to slow down.  ""Stand back and take a look around you/Running from the pressures of a restless world/Hush for a moment, baby, just be still/Here now./Spend a minute next to me.""  Amen to that!
The woman in bittersweet ""Single By Choice"" is affirmative of the title, adding ""Never marry, never ever divorce/Listen to the solitary voice.""  Even though she gives bad experiences she had, sad, isn't it? [Vicki]
""Lost At Sea"" details a couple who's lost so far in arguments that it's as if they are lost at sea.  The solution:  ""Take my hand, come to me/Save a life, rescue you, rescue me.""  Another Byrdsy song replete with harmonies. [Vicki]
""Song For A Good Son"" details a woman explaining to her son why she seems emotionally cold.  She is scarred by the loss of her mother, taken by the ocean current.  There are suicidal overtones:  ""Waterside so deep and wide/If I follow, maybe I will find her."" [Michael]
""Grateful"" is a lullaby to one's young son, enhanced by chorus harmonies of ""All we are and all we need is"" while Susanna's whispery sweet voice does lead.
The bonus DVD contains ""A Day In The Life Of The Bangles"" mini-documentary, which basically explains how they felt about getting back together, story behind ""TOYOH"", and their amazement at the large fan base they had, the ""Something That You Said"" video, audio and lyrics pages.
All the familiar elements are there, Susanna's sweet voice, the tight harmonies, the 60's rock influenced sound, the brand of garage pop/rock hybrid.  It's as if they never broke up.  A warm welcome back!","I was so thrilled when their reunion album finally happened .

A1TUDA3O519RYJ,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from Everything (though this is by no means All Over The Place, Volume 2).
I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's ""Nickel Romeo,"" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susanna sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (""Something That You Said"", ""I Will Take Care of You"", ""Grateful""). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on ""Ask Me No Questions"" and ""Here Right Now,"" and Vicki sounds great on ""Single by Choice,"" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's ""I Am A Rock."" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on ""Mixed Messages""? As for ""The Rain Song,"" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!
The ensemble vocals on ""Ride the Ride"" and ""Stealing Rosemary"" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.
My only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened Doll Revolution by dropping ""Lost at Sea,"" ""Song for a Good Son,"" and ""Between the Two.""
I understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to Doll Revolution. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?","Fifteen years is a long time between albums , but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien .

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B0011XW5WQ,-1,-1,3,"I think it's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd.  Their last full one was 1989's 'Everything'.  In my opinion it is hard for them to ever top their debut album (not their EP).  You had to figure U.S. record companies must have had similar thoughts since this disk has been released everywhere else since early 2003.
They still have decent songwriting abilities and continue to have great blended harmonies (""Stealing Rosemary"").  Both of these things are their saving grace.
Each member has one very good song. Debbie Peterson has ""Here Right Now"", which should have been the initial single. Susanna Hoffs has ""Something That You Said"", which is the first single and would have been a great follow-up single selection. Vicki Peterson has ""Single By Choice"" and Michael Steele has ""Between the Two"".  There are others that are certainly ok, just nothing outstanding.  Even ""Ride the Ride"" isn't as good as the version I downloaded off the internet (oops) almost 2 years ago.
Overall, Debbie Peterson and Michael Steele are the most consistent on this disk.  Steele has always been under-utilized as a lead vocalist and songwriter. Nothing changes here.  I'm really liking her  ""Song For a Good Son"".  She's at least got the most original material of the four - and always has. I always liked Vicki Peterson's stuff, but it's all just very bland on this disk (""Ask Me No Questions"").  Susanna Hoffs is astonishingly the weakest during this set (except for the aforementioned 'Something That You Said"").  ""I Will Take Care of You"" is just downright lame.
In my opinion, the album closer, 'Grateful', is possibly the worst song the Bangles have ever done.  The chorus is one step away from a bad children's chorale.  And they did nothing special to cover the Elvis Costello title tune.
Supposedly they are working towards a new release, since this has really been completed for a year.  Let's hope they get it together and deliver a stellar disk.","I think it 's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd . Their last full one was 1989 's ' Everything ' .

A1TUDA3O519RYJ,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from _Everything_ (though this is by no means _All Over The Place_, Volume 2).
I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's ""Nickel Romeo,"" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susannah sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (""Something That You Said"", ""I Will Take Care of You"", ""Grateful""). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days--for example, the two bonus tracks on this album, both sides of the Bangles' first single. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on ""Ask Me No Questions"" and ""Here Right Now,"" and Vicki sounds great on ""Single by Choice,"" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's ""I Am A Rock."" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on ""Mixed Messages""? As for ""The Rain Song,"" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better.

AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Being a massive fan of The Bangles' music since the early '80s, ""Doll Revolution"" was a long time coming for me, especially after the ""Behind the Music"" episode on them. I have been waiting for this cd for two years, let alone the past decade for new music from them in general. Now that I have the cd in my hands, it was so well worth the money and wait for the cd to arrive in my mailbox. ""Doll Revolution"" did not fail to disappoint me. There really isn't an artist or band that harmonizes as well as The Bangles do. ""Doll Revolution"" is a great reminder how well Susanna, Vicky, Debbi, and Michael's vocals sounds together. ""Mixed Messages"" is a great example the band's abilities to harmonize. On the VH1's ""Behind the Music"" episode on The Bangles, at the end the viewer was introduced to a sampling of ""Ride the Ride"" and ""Lost At Sea"" which are found on the cd, much to my delight. Overall, ""Doll Revolution"" is a mixture of ""All Over the Place"" and ""Everything"", the raw production of ""All Over the Place"" with the sweet melodies of ""Everything"". The best of both worlds if anything. Susanna, Vicky, Debbi, and Michael all sound as if the band never broke up in the late '80s. I loved every single song on the album. Not a single dud on the album. I sure hope it sees the light of day over on my side of the Atlantic.

It is the realization that maybe your partner is holding you back, keeping you in pain, and it is time for you to move on.

The chord structures and heart-felt vocals arising up from the core of the lead singer's being break through the barriers of that which we do not wish to acknowledge and allow us to recognize that pain, bringing it forth and at last allowing us to step forward in our inherent integrity and move on.

You will feel empowered, you will cry, you will move to this music in a way that will forever touch you.","This song speaks to us in a way that allows us to come to terms with who we are in these times when relationships are changing , one is becoming awakened and one is not .

A208QEPAI30Z4G,B0011Z0WQU,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

LYRICS:
Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed.
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger,
An endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
And you its only seed.

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance.
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
Who cannot seem to give,
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live.

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long,
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong,
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose.","5 - star songs are * typically * the only songs that make it into my library . With that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this , or .

In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record ""Machine Head"" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.

The song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood,"" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I recommend ""Machine Head,"" but the ""Best Hits"" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price. One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple.",""" Smoke on the Water , "" originally from the great Deep Purple album "" Machine Head , "" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat .

A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"""That girl took that song away from me."" It was the summer of 1967. Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival. What he was referring to of course was the way Aretha Franklin had turned his song ""Respect"" into one of the biggest hits of the year. His version topped out at #35 on the pop charts a couple of years earlier. But I digress. Otis Redding was just beginning to hit his stride as summer turned to autumn in 1967. This veteran performer had been around for a while. The fact is that up until this point he had made the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 19 times although his records usually ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the chart. His tunes fared much better on the Soul/R&B charts where 8 of them had made it into the Top Ten. It is really difficult to understand why the man had not had greater commercial success up until this point. After taking a few months off Otis Redding returned to the studio in early December 1967. There he recorded a song he had co-written with Steve Cropper. Everyone thought it was a mistake. His wife hated it. Three days later Otis Redding was dead at 26, a victim of a tragic plane crash in Wisconsin.

When the story appeared in the newspaper I remember thinking to myself ""Who is that?"" And although I had been collecting records for about three years I had never heard of him. Despite his enormous talent Otis Redding had just not quite connected with general audiences. Less than two months later in January of 1968, Volt records released that tune his wife and friends hated so much. ""(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay"" went all the way to #1 on the Pop charts and remained there for a month. Everyone now finally realized just how talented this man had been.  An American classic.",""" That girl took that song away from me . "" Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival .

And it was, after the usual modern rock chart-toppers they marched out one-by-one, this song is a refreshing change until... Radio drags it through the mud that is their airwaves 10 times a day. It was after a little while of that that I got more of a critical eye with the song as I came up with reasons to hate the song that was so overplayed by radio jocks. So first off, while the verses are good, the chorus, especially the last couple rounds of it in the last minute or so in the song, turns away from that, and falls flat, making it a flat love song at the end.

So overall, great verses, bad chorus. Maybe not the best of songs to win your lovers hand. But in any case, it's a good shake-up from the usual Nickelback.","When I first heard this song on the radio , I was like , ' Wow , that 's a change of pace .

It was after a little while of that that I got more of a critical eye with the song as I came up with reasons to hate the song that was so overplayed by radio jocks . So first off , while the verses are good , the chorus , especially the last couple rounds of it in the last minute or so in the song , turns away from that , and falls flat , making it a flat love song at the end . So overall , great verses , bad chorus . Maybe not the best of songs to win your lovers hand . But in any case , it 's a good shake - up from the usual Nickelback ."

The music work is great , kind of a soft rock vibe to it , and if you can find the instrumental version of the song , it 's pretty interesting to listen to . Overall , only a song you could find in the 90 's . A romantic pop - novelty classic that does n't hold anything back . Oh , and listen to New Found Glory 's cover of the song . They actually improve on some of the elements of this song , and in some ways perfect it , till you hit the chorus . Good song nevertheless ."

AV648VU7JR5D5,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.

It opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3/4 string/guitar progression accompanied by a 4/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.

My favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.

Kashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.

Most fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door. So much has been written about this song, you can find many online treatises that analyze its brilliance. I prefer to let it all wash over me like an oasis in the desert.","Kashmir is an undisputed classic . The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision .

It grew on me like a feline that keeps coming back, night after night, when at first you didn't think you even wanted a cat around! Then suddenly, you realize it's won your heart.* I love the minor key of this song. I tugs at my heart and attempts to draw my very soul out. I actually visualize the darkened rooms in the evening. Then I see a young man pleading with his girlfriend to take steps toward a commitment she isn't sure she's ready for. Looking back over my fifty years, I didn't appreciate this ballad so much as I do now. I am fortunate that I've been married more than half of my life to the same man. Yet I see so many young kids getting married and I hope that they are doing it for love, not just because they're expected to. I hope that women especially will realize that they are forever someone's daughter. Someday, God willing, they will become a mother and grandmother -- but when will they ever just be themselves?  There needs to be a year or two where they learn who they are, not what they are by how someone else defines them!

I hope that women especially will realize that they are forever someone 's daughter . Someday , God willing , they will become a mother and grandmother -- but when will they ever just be themselves ? There needs to be a year or two where they learn who they are , not what they are by how someone else defines them ! * Note , I am a cat lover . I just did n't know how else to phrase the praise for this song ."

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0011Z105C,-1,-1,1,"Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.

Overall, not a great song to say the least. It's radio-friendly (which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on), it's poorly done, and most of all, it's just flat-out boring. Sorry Rob, you've done better. A whole lot better.","Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today , and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs , and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen .

One certainly wouldn't expect a poignant, even melancholy ballad about escaping the drudgery of life... only to find oneself back where they started in the end.  And when I stopped and listened to the lyrics I was shocked at just how sad this song was... and yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life but finding herself reliving it anyhow.

It's not a happy song... yet Tracy Chapman sings it so beautifully.  Her wistful voice is never overwrought or melodramatic, conveying just the right amount of emotion to fit the theme of the song.  And the simple instrumentation keeps the song appropriately low-key.  Sometimes a beautiful song is spoiled by being overproduced or oversung, and it was nice to see the singer and producers resist that temptation here.

While a melancholy song, ""Fast Car"" is still lovely to listen to, and certainly more thoughtful than the endless parade of love songs that make up popular music nowadays.  If you like James Taylor, you might also enjoy ""Fast Car.""","With a title like "" Fast Car , "" one would probably expect an upbeat , blood - pounding song in the vein of "" Shut Up and Drive "" or even "" Life Is a Highway .

I don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.

But youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.

I guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs.","The rating I give is based on how much I like the song . My opinion

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,4,"There is no words to describe the tragic news of today that Prince had passed away at age 57. With a set of deviating deaths in R&B legends we've lost this year with Natalie Cole, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire, but honestly no death is more shocking and sad than the passing of Prince. The guy not only was brilliant, but his sound and song with R&B, funk, jazz and Rock is and will always transcend beyond boundaries in the way that David Bowie kept rolling with the tides years earlier. The guy really had so many memorable, that he had kept changing with time and everyone followed so deeply with the punches, and not bashing him at heart. When Doves Cry is one of his deepest songs from Purple Rain. The song still ignites aflame that can definitely showcase his sensuality in song, with a deep soul from his heart that really showed his sensitivity in song. There will never be a songwriter who was just as gifted, who died young. The doves are deeply crying, and that will never stop with this song.

So anyways, the song has a nice buildup. It is a little slow, and the payoff may be less than satisfying, but Linkin Park is clearly going for a soft rock sound, to go in some background somewhere. Some people may like the sound, like soft rock fans, but fans of Linkin park will be like, WTH? ""In The End"" this is not. The vocals suit the song, the lyrics are good. Are they trying to go for a love song or something?

Overall, try first, maybe buy if you like. For me, it's just another song on radio I could really care less about. And definitely not one you want to hear all the time. Maybe every once in a while, but that's it.","First off , while this song may have a close structure to a certain U2 song , it would n't be the first time a good song sounded like a good song , Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Wonderwall ?

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,4,"It is hard to believe that Seal is celebrating his 20th anniversary since his debut album right now. While he has had a lot of highs, musically and personally, the past several years have been very hard for him. With his marriage to Heidi Klum ending, and his albums not as strong as they used to be, he seems to be at a personal crossroads in his life. Nothing he has done in music has ever had the impact he made with Kiss From A Rose, from the Batman Forever soundtrack and off his second self-titled album. The song is still his biggest opus that is just as good today, as it was when it came out in 1994. It definitely is a great download if you are new to Seal's music, or if you want to hear what a real voice is like, and not something that is weighed down. Hopefully, Seal can come out with something as distinctive as he did back then.

Seal's range of vocal talent is very versatile on this one. He sings sweetly & calm, then gradually crescendos to his full range of expression.
I love the Circus sound @the intro, to a guitar solo with violins soaring & swelling to the choral part.
I believe there is a sound of a harpsicord, electronic or not, lovely.

(It starts with one)
 One thing I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To explain in due time
 (All I know)
 Time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down to the end of the day
 The clock ticks life away
 (Its so unreal)
 Didnt look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on but didn't even know
 I wasted it all just to watch you go

 I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time when...

 Remembering all the times you fought with me

 You wouldnt even recognize me anymore

If you are behind the times like I was, GET INTO THIS TRACK. It is extremely hooky and even more catchy is the bridge which goes,

""Rock and Roll, baby
Don't you know that
We're all alone now
I need something to sing about

Rock and Roll (Hey!)
Don't you know, baby
We're all alone now
I need something to sing about

Rock and Roll (Hey!)
Don't you know, baby
We're all alone now
Give me something to sing about""

Might not look like much there, but it is extremely catchy.

The video must also be spoken of because although it's not super-glamorous or anything, it makes listening to the song even better. It features Hayley and the band just jammin' out, her at the mic and them on the drums and guitars just having fun in what looks like a desert.

The song itself is about a boy that Hayley is ""crushcrushcrushing"" on, and he's not there for her. Not until the bridge does he come into the picture as more than just one-way thoughts. But the song itself, I think talks about being alone and thinking of that someone that lights your fire, even if they aren't with you.

Written by Hayley Williams (lead singer) and Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals).

""Wait a Minute. Prince.
May 6, 2011 by frmarkdwhite
In an idle moment, I busted out a few tracks from the first Batman movie soundtrack, just to re-live the time. Listening took me back to those heady days of cassette tapes, and a crystalline realization left me humbled like a man in front of Niagara Falls:

Let's reflect for a moment--

Between 1982 and 1987, Prince came out with 1999, Purple Rain, Around the World in a Day, Parade, and Sign o' the Times.

Pause. Taking it in...

Do you realize how many songs are included here that are necessary elements of the cosmos?

By my count, at least twelve.

This is the most amazing thing that has ever been done.

If the man had only produced Purple Rain, that would be the most amazing thing that has ever been done.

...Can we really doubt, you know, the Almighty Hand?

No.""

For Green Day, it also is a great time to re-introduce their classic to a new audience and that is the case with Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) from their 1997 album Nimrod. The song still absolutely stands as one of their finest works of their musical career. The song is still one of their best works from their catalog. If you haven't yet owned a Green Day song for your MP3 library, than this would be a nice place to start.

So, you could look at this as their comeback song, and it greatly tides over our thirst for everything MB20. First off, the lyrics are incredible just like they are with any MB20 song, with lyrics like, ""I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world/ but it feels just like every other morning before."" The song is catchy and well-written, and overall just well done. And even though this is a rather successful single, it doesn't really sound it. In fact, most of the best songs on their albums were singles anyhow. The bridge is also great musically, and the only thing that could get me down on this song is the chorus. While it is a great chorus for concerts, and to get you pumping, it just seems like more could have been done to it.

But overall, a great song, a great single, a great group. Here's to hoping MB20 comes back much sooner rather than later.

It really shows that Rob Thomas and the group haven't lost that luster after all those years away from the music scene, and with Rob Thomas on his own with Something To Be.

""Bad Day"" is the first major goodbye song on American Idol, and as that was the first season I really became a fan, I started noticing on message boards, and various other entertainments sits, what is the name of that song? I first heard the name on MSNBC's Reality TV questions column, before the song's monumental success. Soon after that column, the song rocketed up the charts, and while I don't think it #1, it came pretty darn close, and still remains a download favorite a couple years later.

The song itself is good, not great. The vocals match and work with the song, the lyrics are good, and the piano works very well with the song. However, it kind of gets sappy after awhile. And again, after the radio long wheres out it's welcome, you're cursing the radio to stop playing that darn song.

So overall, a nice song, but it'll where on you after awhile, but it'll stay long after it's welcome, so beware. And yes, Daniel Powter still shows no sign of follow-up success.

The song itself is good , not great . The vocals match and work with the song , the lyrics are good , and the piano works very well with the song . However , it kind of gets sappy after awhile . And again , after the radio long where s out it 's welcome , you 're cursing the radio to stop playing that darn song . So overall , a nice song , but it 'll where on you after awhile , but it 'll stay long after it 's welcome , so beware . And yes , Daniel Powter still shows no sign of follow - up success . Say hello to Right Said Fred ."

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,4,"It is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and talented passes on, it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically. That happened with Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and John Lennon because of their impacts on music from top to bottom. Now, with the deep and tragic loss of Prince, the world is feeling the same bits of sadness from beginning to end all over again. He not only transformed music with each and every album he had made, every song he recorded, but Prince honestly was one of those artists that never got older with his music, he got better with each and every song. 1999 is one of those songs that still clicks every time when you think of party anthems and celebrations in music. It is still one of those songs that really connects with celebration. Prince was definitely a gem that really transcended music at the soul, where a lot of other artists have stopped. May the Purple One's legacy live on.

Trying to address real problems (poverty apparently, but not clearly, due to oppression), Chapman's lyrics have nothing original about them. She released this as the second single of her career. Considered political aware, it offers nothing but a complaint about the obvious.

For example:

""Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion.""

She whispers ""It sounds like a whisper.""

And she fills in space by repeating ""Run Run Run Run...""

The music is sharply produced, but is stuck in a generic 1980s folk rock beat.

Tracy Chapman tried too hard on this one and delivered a weak song. She has a better catalog than this.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0011Z94XM,1,1,5,"Jason Mraz is definitely an underrated artist in the music world. It's all too easy to write him off as another John Mayer/Dave Matthews type artist. Nope, M.R.A.Z. is a whole nother breed. He has a little bit country, little bit rap, bit adult alt, bit pop, bit folk, the point is, Mraz can do it all. And this song shows all those elements, and the song writing style of Mraz. Even though this song was co-written by The Matrix song writing group, you can tell which parts are theirs, and which parts are Mraz.

First off, the opening lines are awesome, and really set the tone for the verses. They're out of the ordinary, but seem to fit, and most importantly flow. And that's what this song's got going for it the most, flow. The verses, the pre-chorus, the chorus all flow freely even though they all have their unique style. This is accomplished for the most part by Mraz's vocals. The structure is also unique in that it has the verses which are great in of themselves, then you have the pre-chorus which could be a chorus in its own right, and then you have the chorus, which is in True radio-friendly style to grab those radio people, and has the True influence of The Matrix.

In fact, the only thing you could really criticize the song about is the pre-chorus, as it may just be one chorus too many, or maybe it could be a thinly veiled reference to sex or something. In either case, it both works, and it doesn't. I personally think it should have its own song, although it does great in this song.

So overall, definitely not your everyday radio fare. It may have a few of those elements, but it has enough originality to keep you interested and tuned in. Kudos to everybody involved with song. It's well-written, well-sung, and well-structured. This song is just another in the long list of reasons to love Jason Mraz.","Jason Mraz is definitely an underrated artist in the music world .

As for Hero, it has the usually strengths of a Nickelback tune.  Strong imagery, thoughtful lyrics, and a melody you can hum in the car.

I can't imagine Nickelback fans haven't heard this one, but if you haven't, it's good but obviously done with a movie in mind.

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,"I really don't get all the hate directed at Nickelback.  I've heard that they're an obnoxious, repetitive band, that they've supposedly ""sold out"" artistically, and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger apparently gets flak for dating/marrying Avril Lavigne (what, celebrities aren't allowed to marry each other?).  I couldn't judge myself, as I hadn't listened to their music, so when I discovered that one of my favorite songs (on a mix CD given to me by a friend) happened to be a Nickelback song, I was a little surprised.  This song was by the much-hated band?  If this was an example of their usual work, why all the hatred?

I don't know if ""Hero"" is typical of all Nickelback's work or not, but it's a powerful song that gets me in the gut whenever I hear it.

""Hero"" is a rock number that first appeared on the ""Spiderman"" soundtrack, which is befitting.  It's a strong song about the difficulties of being a hero, and being strong in the face of adversity.  It's accompanied by a powerful guitar section, with my only nitpick being that the drum section can sometimes overpower the other instruments.  And it does have a soft, melancholy acoustic interlude that gives the listener a slight break from the heavier guitars.

If this is an example of all Nickelback's work, then I'm going to give the rest of the band's discography a shot.  If it's not their typical work... well, then at least there's one Nickelback song I really like.","I really do n't get all the hate directed at Nickelback .

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B0012235PW,1,1,5,"One of the key factors that made the late Ray Charles Robinson the musical icon he become in the two or three decades before his passing was the fact that,if blues came from the crossroads than Brother Ray was crossing the musical interaction. During his salad years of the late 50's/early 60's there was hard bop jazz,urban electric blues and country/western music all somehow playing on jukeboxes in black communities all over America. Ray Charles had reflected this all. Of course the foundation in all of this,if not overtly was the blues form. And considering,even on his later Atlantic days,Ray was beginning to deal with concept albums as a strong musical possibility. It would simply be the right musical choice to reflect his roots in the blues.

  ""Early In The Mornin'"" and ""I'm Movin' On"" are the two major uptempo numbers here. The melodic form is right there,smack in the center of the 12-bar blues. Yet the rhythm is right out of that Afro-Latin vibe-with Ray's electric piano all making this an extension of the uptempo,funky soul sound he'd pioneered a couple of years earlier with ""What'd I Say"". ""The Right Time"",while nostalgically conjuring up that image of Rudy Huxtable in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cosby-Show/dp/B00GOC74Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cosby Show</a>&nbsp;is an elegant,chunky number full of Fathead Newman's growling sax and the Raelette's singing at their prime. Not to even mention Ray going from his strong vocal lead to impassioned cries at a moments notice.  ""I Believe In My Soul"" starts out with a rather Oriental sounding melody on the piano while Charles own compositions ""Hard Times (No One Knows Better Than I)"",""The Midnight Hour"",""Feelin' Sad"",'Ray's Blues"",""Nobody Cares"",""Mr. Charles Blues"",""Some Day Baby"" and ""I Wonder Who"" are all mid to low tempo straight up piano based jazzy blues numbers.

  With the recent passing of Crusaders pianist/co-founder Joe Sample? I've come to think about how grateful music fans of my age group should really be that currently deceased  musical icons such as James Brown,Ray Charles and even someone as late in the game as Michael Jackson were still around during part of our lifetime. Many were musicians who played,some were masterful performs and some were both. But to people such as myself? They will not merely be a page in a history book. Even though this album was recorded almost twenty years before I was born? The strands of the new music I'd have absorbed as a child are ever present here. The really exciting part is Ray was an originator too-the key architect of the soul genre. And here he is in 1961-paying a vital musical tribute to a genre that he absorbed growing up. And so the cycle continues,and meets full circle. Pretty likely this is going to be one of the finest and most important albums you'll ever hear in your life!","One of the key factors that made the late Ray Charles Robinson the musical icon he become in the two or three decades before his passing was the fact that , if blues came from the crossroads than Brother Ray was crossing the musical interaction .

A35PPJIGPB61UF,B0012235PW,1,1,5,"This is a wonderful work of blues songs both covered and composed/arranged by Ray.
The production is tastefully spare, avoiding overly lush arrangements and remaining raw but still darn smooth.
Mr. Charles has a wonderful ability to draw out and convey seemingly contradictory feelings in the same song; a sad song will be so beautiful  that it brings joy; a song of content carries undertones of trouble and impermanence that creates an insidious edge.
I was turned onto this album when I read that Leonard Cohen played this frequently while writing on the Greek island of Hydra. If it's good enough for Cohen...
I sympathize with those who are familiar with versions of this album with better mastering (original vinyl etc.), but this is the only one I'm familiar with and ignorance is sometimes bliss.

They'd gotten caught up with technology, giving the sound a fuller feel, and the lyrical content became more mature and cynical. The Dominance/Submission roleplay of ""Master and Servant"" (which was the second single) and the sociological blast of ""Blasphemous Rumours"" picked and cut deeper than before.

This was also the album that made Depeche Mode in the states. ""People Are People"" got into the American Top 20, and according the liner notes by producer Daniel Miller, the first thing recorded for the album. Egalitarian in tone, DM apparently even tried to darken the sound of the song lest it be consTrued as too pop.

Like all the reissued back catalog of Depeche Mode, the 5.1 remix of the bonus disc is terrific. It fills the room with both the arena ready music that the Mode was growing into, but emphasizes the industrial samples the band was adding to the music. The clanging metal and factory wheezing leaps from the mix and shows just how ahead of the curve the band was. As for the mini-movie, ""You can get away with anything..."" chronicles the band working on the LP. I doubt I'll watch it more than twice. A pair of B-Sides and a remix of the lovely ""Somebody"" round out the package.

A3SI83LHXQCVS2,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"The first three DM albums are okay, but most of the time from here on, works put in perspective the band's actual potential. The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, ""Broken Frame"" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and ""Construction Time""'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.

23 years later, people can probably still identify with ""Some Great Reward."" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in ""It Doesn't Matter,"" ""Stories of Old,"" and ""Somebody."" 2 of the 3 selections are sung by Martin. ""IDM"" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on ""Stories of Old,"" possibly my favorite from the record. ""Somebody"" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track.

That doesn't mean the other 6 songs aren't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is ""Lie to Me,"" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with ""Something to Do,"" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit ""People Are People."" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen.

Then there's the awesome Wilder composition ""If You Want."" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) ""Master and Servant"" and ""Blasphemous Rumors."" ""Master"" starts with a trade-off a cappella with Martin and Dave saying ""it's a lot,"" ending it with ""like life."" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in ""Blasphemous Rumors,"" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track.

There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'80's, and rightfully so. Totatlly worth the cheap price, or if you want the re-mastered sound, you could go for the CD/DVD version.","The first three DM albums are okay , but most of the time from here on , works put in perspective the band 's actual potential .

A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"Much of Depeche Modes earlier material was more new-wave synth pop and more poppy in sound but this album is where they would become the dark depressing masters they are now. Some of the songs did stir up some controversy back when this album was released and this album was a major turning point for this amazing band.
Something to Do is a hard edged number that kicks this CD off. Lie To Me is an amazing song that I listen to many times without tiring. The dark melody, the sad sound to it is a treat for my ears. People Are People is a fabolous song with phat beats, killer bass lines and a sort of industrial feel. This song is about all people of all religions, races, etc. to get along regardless of their differences. This song has a great message. The ambience at the ending forever leaves this album in my memory. It doesn't matter doesn't have any major beats but has dingling synths and a both happy and sad sound to it. This song is great. Stories Of Old is another cool song but nto as great as the next one. This song is rather poppy. Somebody is a very sad piano ballad with simply pianos and Martin Gore on vocals. This song is truly a gem on this CD. Master And Servant stirred some controversy back during it's heyday. It's a hard-edged song with a strong industrial feel. This song from what I guess talks about S&M. This is my second favorite. If You Want is my favorite off SGR. It starts off as a creepy electronic song with creepy keyboards and with no drums for the first minute. At 1:30 the drums starts and the song becomes an industrial new wave dance number. Blasphemous Rumours is the one that caused controversy back in 1984. It's a very depressing song about religous doubt and suicide. It's a very sad closer to this amazing album.
This CD marks the turning point for Depeche Mode and all of their latter music.

A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B00122909W,1,1,4,"As a child growing up in the projects of New Jersey, Jaheim Hoagland accumulated more emotional baggage than all of JFK international airport.  Having lost his father at two years old, he spent most of his childhood doing the street thug thing, getting into all sorts of petty trouble while being raised in a single-parent household.  But when his mother passed away when he was 17, the pain of his loss inspired him to aggressively pursue a recording career, and 4 years later his debut, ""Ghetto Love,"" was released.  To be certain, that record wasn't perfect, and it had its share of filler.  But what made it worth the trip was Jaheim's voice, which had me do double-takes to make sure I wasn't listening to a Teddy Pendegrass record.  On his superior, impressive second album, ""Still Ghetto,"" the flava is r&b with a dash of hip hop, but the influences are clearly rooted in the old school.  Throughout its trip of nearly an hour, ""Still Ghetto"" is honest, rugged, and soulful.  Thematically, it's not a huge departure from his debut, as the majority of the songs pertain to relationships and the drama that sometimes comes with them.  Mary J. Blige openly gave Jaheim props in a Rolling Stone article, and she appears in the impressive duet, ""Beauty and Thug,"" in which the Queen of Hip Hop Soul's bruised voice goes hand-in-hand with his husky voice.  He glides effortlessly through the ultrasmooth slow jam ""Long As I Live,"" and I don't even need to explain what the song ""Tight Jeans"" is about.  ""Still Ghetto"" is essentially the record Tank's ""One Man"" should have been.  The latter record suffered from tired beats and half-inspired singing, but on ""Still Ghetto,"" Jaheim pulls it off with flying colors.  He may be a little rough on the edges, and some may even question his choice of words (um, ""Me and My B----,"" anyone?), but there's no denying his honesty.  Some records keep it real, and others keep it right.  This record does both.","As a child growing up in the projects of New Jersey , Jaheim Hoagland accumulated more emotional baggage than all of JFK international airport .

Although THIS CD displays his incredible voice and makes him a STAR...I'm saving my FIVE star review for his NEXT CD.  The next one SHOULD make him a SUPERSTAR...elevating him to the Luther and Teddy heights.

I miss Teddy Pendergrass...the Teddy who sang with the Blue Notes and who later had some fantastic solo albums BEFORE the accident.  Where Luther had a touch of female in his phrasing (which made his voice incredible)...Teddy's voice was ALL testosterone, without apologies.  Forceful, direct and demanding, Teddy's singing reminded me of old Southern Negro field hollers.  All due respect to David Ruffin, Eddie Levert, Dennis Edwards...even Gerald Levert (excellent ALL)...but they're urban...they're missing that ""pig feet and hot sauce"".  Teddy had the quintescential southern black, arrogant, macho, R&B song voice...and during the 70's, I'm sure it made many white people (especially women) uncomfortable in various ways.

Jaheim has the same voice...the same approach.  What played well in the 70's...continues to play.  His ""ghetto-ness"" might turn some off...but I hope he doesn't completely drop that thug affect...yet.  It took 25 years...but the torch has been passed.  On his NEXT CD...I hope he pays a tribute to Teddy by remaking a song.

Yes...I'm ol' skool...and I thank you Jaheim...now pass the corn bread.","From Marvin Junior ( The Dells ) to Teddy Pendergrass ... and now Jaheim ... the torch keeps passing !

AJK5WHV1GW941,B00122909W,1,1,5,"Jaheim shows the world that being ghetto isn't always a bad thing.  In fact, he makes ghetto look and sound damn good!  ""Still Ghetto"" is Jaheim's sophomore album.  He is a prime example that everyone's sophomore album can be just as good as the debut.  The album's tracklisting is all around great, from the order of the songs to the lyrics and instruments.

 ""Still Ghetto"" is about love and relationships for the most part.  Jaheim seduces and croons his female listeners practically the entire album.  ""Put that Woman First"" is the mid-tempo track that was released and went on to be a hit for 2003.  Jaheim explains that if a man does not make a woman feel that she is at the top of his list, she may leave him for another man who will.  A lot of women and even men like this song.  Jaheim showcases his seduction skills on the song ""Special Day"".  In this song Jaheim tells his woman it is her day and asks her what she would like to do.  It is a slow song with a beautiful message and melody.  ""Everywhere I Am is Jaheim's dedication to his late mother, Julie.  In the song he lets his mom know that whatever he does, he feels her presence, even in the biggest events of his life.  This song is truly heartfelt to anyone has either lost their mother or has a close bond with her.  Another favorite on ""Still Ghetto"" is Jaheim's duet with Mary J. Blige called ""Beauty and a Thug""  This song is about a man and a woman from different walks of life who attract each other. This is a lovely song.

 ""Still Ghetto"" is one of those CD's that anyone who gives it a complete listen is sure to love.  Jaheim takes being ghetto to a whole new level!  HE'S STILL GHETTO BABY!

A2L3WEVFOCA7OY,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Jaheim's (J.Hoaglan) sophomore album ""Still Ghetto"" (2002) is an uplifting album to enjoy. Jaheim is blessed with a wonderful, soulful voice which shines through on this release. Jaheim has shown alot love for Hip Hop so it makes sense that he have Kay Gee (formerly of Naughty by Nature) looking after alot of the production on this. The lead single is the inspirational ""Fabulous"" which is about staying positive and making it through the hardest of times. I like this track, The Rayne's guest appearance is good and having the children sing the chorus adds a different feel to the track. Next two tracks are standout, ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" and ""Put that Woman First"" are about appreciating ones lady. Other early songs like ""Me and My B****"" and ""Let's Talk About It"" follow through well. ""Long as I Live"" is about real love, marriage and commitment. Jaheim goes real deep on ""Everywhere I Am"" a beautiful tribute to his mom, a song where you can really feel his genuine love. Mary J and Jaheim drop a memorable collabration on ""Beauty and a Thug"". Slow love song ""Special Lady"" is another track I like. A few tracks particularly the ones at the end- are more filler material for me. However the majority of the tracks are memorable with good reply value. ""Still Ghetto"" is another Jaheim album to enjoy, one I recommend checking out.","Jaheim 's ( J.Hoaglan ) sophomore album "" Still Ghetto "" ( 2002 ) is an uplifting album to enjoy .

ABE14SVILZLNY,B00122909W,1,1,4,"I've always been of the mind state that the term ""ghetto"" is a derogatory word, but Jaheim has taken the word and made it his own. Within his music he celebrates the idea of ghetto, even going insofar as to title his sophomore album ""Still Ghetto"". While I respect Jaheim's allegiance to his roots, sometimes the sheer overload of the ""ghetto"" concept overpowers his musical prowess. Hailing from New Jersey, Jaheim is no doubt a talented singer capable of impressing even the most fickle with his ability. In fact his talent is so strong that it could almost make you angry that he doesn't have material - but images are made for reason and Jaheim has done well with his.
The first cut released from ""Still Ghetto"" was the hood anthem ""Fabulous"" whose catchy refrain sung by kids: ""don't hate on us, we're fabulous"", creeps into you head and seeks to take up permanent residence. From the celebratory ""Fabulous"", the album reflects on love with ""Diamond In Da Ruff"". It is on tracks like this as well as the soul-filled and passionate ""Put That Woman First"" that Jaheim shows you the depths and peaks of his voice. Since his debut, he's been compared to the legendary Teddy Pendergrass, a serious compliment that echoes in every part of Jaheim's vocals.
The album takes a slight turn with the less impressive ""Me & My B!tch"" and ""Tight Jeans"". While they all in their own way have some sort of appeal - it's here where you pity the subject matter. Jaheim has the voice of someone who should perhaps being singing ballads exclusively, but it often feels like his talent is wasted on sub par material not worthy of his voice. Sure, it's okay to appreciate the female form, but someone with this voice - you just know that he's capable of more. ""Backtight"" might have a dumb title - but it's subtlety is definitely a plus. The songwriting leaves you wanting a little more, but sound-wise it's very nice.
""Long As I Live"" is a tad overproduced, but because the vocals are so lush - it's hard to even care. On ""Everywhere I Am"", the crooner calls up the spirit of the older, fatter Luther Vandross (most of you know Luther was a much better singer when he ate Big Macs instead of lettuce). On the track, Jaheim sings out for his late mother and his talent is to be respected on the well-produced and well-sung track. ""Beauty And A Thug"", a duet with Mary J. Blige, tries to be jazzy but ends up just being not so great.
Things get a little more ""ghetto"" with ""Every Which Way"" which should be discarded in the do not put me on an album pile. ""Special Day"" is another of the moments that make you want to root for Jaheim. His voice has so many beautiful elements to it, that you want people to like him - you want him to succeed and more importantly, you want his record label to hire him better writers and producers.
- Final Thoughts -
Jahiem might not be a household name yet, but he has undeniable talent that will keep him floating for time to come. He'll definitely have to refine his talents if he wants to reach a broader audience, but for now he's happy being ""Still Ghetto""","I 've always been of the mind state that the term "" ghetto "" is a derogatory word , but Jaheim has taken the word and made it his own .

He did the same thing carl thomas did with his last cd(who is due for another one soon) by putting a new twist on old songs and beats.  The end result is one continuous mix of r+b jams to have your cd on repeat. The tight Jams:
*Diamond in da ruff
*Fabulous
*Put that woman First
*Beauty and the Beast
*Long as I live
*Everywhere I am
*Every which Way
Overall Jahiem surpassed his first one by putting that sophomore slump jinx to rest. Anyone curious to see what the hype is about?..just imagien a cross of vocies between teddy pendegrass and luther vandross and you have jahiem.

AA8HFTJIAQA4G,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Jaheim- Still Ghetto
G H E T T O! What a word. We all know where the word is derived but what does it mean today? Jaheim seems to know exactly how to relate""ghetto"" to everyday life. His first CD was great and this one picks up right from there. Jaheim captures the feeling of soul music. He is what NEO SOUL is supposed to be. I think the music we label as Neo Soul really isn't that. It's a new, fresh approach, reminiscent of the Langston Hughes age in Black America. Jaheim is the 70's revisited, not just in sound but in feelin. His lead single ""Fabulous"" is a great song. Some might tire of the kids participation in the song, but the real strength is the message. It highlights the up's and downs of ""ghetto life"" and how this community accepts it, shakes it off and keeps going. In listening to this song you are aware that it's really not talkin about white America but about our own community. For some reason we've developed a split in the black community, where affluent blacks look down on the ""ghetto"" life. As Ja put's it ""We've got love for yall but yall don't love us"". Good song. It's not being taken as seriously as it should. Jaheim really is a classic balladeer though, making True love music. Music we grew up too. that's where this CD shines. Track 5, ""Put That Woman First"" is reminiscent of Rrah's ""A Woman's Threat"" and uses the same sample that Ludacris used on ""Growing Pains"" from his Word Of Mouf CD. Great song. MJB makes and appearance on ""Beauty and The Thug"". Great song  and this duet was destiny from the moment Ja came on the same. they both embody the soul of the ""ghetto"". My favorite song on this CD has to be track 7 ""Me and My B*tch"". Now before you say anything I know that title might be offensive to some but MANNNNNNNNNN! Dude pulls this off! He makes this work. It has a smooth OJAY's ring to it. Great song. My favorite songs on this CD are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,13,14...This CD works because Jaheim reminds us the beauty in the ghetto, the love and the life. Too many of us have forgot that the ghetto is more than just gunshots and teen pregnancy.","Jaheim- Still Ghetto

AGAMDS21PJZPK,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Watching BET's Midnight Love one night, I was introduced to a r&b singer named Jaheim.  As I was watching his video, I wasn't too impressed with ""Could It Be"" at first.  I saw the song as just another new cat jumping into the r&b game.  However, as I heard the song more often, I began to like the song more and Jaheim's voice wasn't that bad, as it reminded me of the infamous Teddy P singing ""Love TKO"", ""Turn Off The Lights"", or ""Come Go With Me"".  I was still hesitant in buying ""Ghetto Love"" but everyone that had purchased the CD gave me rave reviews so I decided to purchase my own copy.  ""Ghetto Love"" turned out to be one of my favorite r&b CDs of 2001.  I liked how Jaheim used his sharp ""street"" edge to his songs.  My favorites included ""Looking For Love"", ""Ghetto Love"", ""Remarkable"" w/Terry Dexter, ""Ready, Willing & Able"", as well as the rest of his singles:  ""Just In Case"" and ""Anything"" w/Next.  With a title of ""Still Ghetto"" you would expect the same thing from his sophomore CD and ladies and gentlemen that is what you will get.  ""Still Ghetto"" starts off with Jaheim and Duganz doing what they did on a few tracks on ""Ghetto Love"" by rappin' and singin' straight from the streets.  From there, Jaheim does what he does best by lacing his fans with the street anthems and romantic melodies that he is known for now.  His 1st single, ""Fabolous"" is dedicated to the children coming up in the world today.  As Jaheim can tell you, he knows how rough it was growing up and being a hardhead so he is trying to motivate children of today to not walk in the same path that he did.  While the song may not hit you like ""Could It Be"", ""Fabolous"" gets a strong point across and was definintely the right pick for the 1st single.  The majority of the rest of the songs deal with relationships and trying to find the right woman.  The ladies will definitely be impressed with this CD.  ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" deals with a woman that Jaheim wish he would have treated better and now he realizes how much they could have had if he would have swallowed his pride and been a man about their relationship.  ""Let's Talk About It"" follows the same line as Jaheim wants to talk to someone that he dealt with in the past and try to realize where they went wrong.  He was in trouble so much that he couldn't be focused in the relationship.  ""Put That Woman First"" covers territory that has been covered by R Kelly, ""When A Woman's Fed Up"" and Joe, ""Treat Her Like A Lady"".  However, with the old school feel to the song, this will still be one of your favorites.  ""Beauty & Thug"" features the queen of r&b/hip hop, Mary J Blige and brings pleasant results.  Both singers sound very well together and Malik Pendleton, who produced Mary J. Blige's ""Seven Days"" from her ""Share My World"" CD does the production.  The fellas will be able to relate to ""Tight Jeans"", as Jaheim tells a tale about one of his good female friends always coming around him wearing tight jeans.  While he may have intentions of being a platonic friend, she is tempting him to think of her in other ways.  Jaheim also displays the same sentimental side that he showed on ""Ghetto Love"" with songs like ""Backtight"", ""Special Day"", ""Long As I Live"" and ""Everywhere I Am"".  The latter, is a powerful dedication to his mom who passed away when he was a teenager . On another song, ""Me And My B****"", Jaheim professes his loyalty for his lady, but at the same time he is saying if you try to ""get at her"", that might be the last move you make.  This may be too much for some r&b fans, but if you understand the concept, you will understand that he isn't trying to offend women, this is just his way of expressing his thoughts on this particular song.  If Jaheim would have ended ""Still Ghetto"" at track 13, I believe that he would have a 5 star CD on his hands.  However, tracks 14-16, turn out to be nothing but filler.  Especially, ""Whut You Want"", which puts a damper on 13 straight tight songs.  The majority of the production is handled by Kay Gee, formerly of Naughty By Nature and Eddie F and Darren Lighty, which provides primarily the same sound as his debut CD displayed.  Overall, Jaheim has a nice sophomore CD on his hands.  If you liked ""Ghetto Love"", you will enjoy ""Still Ghetto"" but you may enjoy the 1st CD better.

The drums and bass synthesizers begin again with a return to the opening sequence which is a reprise of the first half.

A3H3RHSUWQK5J6,B00122AB40,1,1,5,"The year was 1960 and few boy groups - with the exception of the Lettermen - were successful. Names like Frankie Avalon, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydel were considered the kings of youth music. But all of that was about to change. Before the Beach Boys, you had this foursome. The Four Seasons emerged that year 1960 with not one or two but several 45 hits. They dominated the top of the charts and took America by storm. First with ""Sherry"" quickly followed by ""Walk like a man"" and then ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" the Four Seasons brightened up sleep overs and slumber parties everywhere. Girls couldn't get enough. The 60's arrived big time in most part to the new sound coming from New Jersey and that sound would shape the decade to come. Solo acts would fall to the side. Groups would dominate.

Later, when Frankie Vali stepped out in front of the group to bask in his own glory, the shine fell off the rose and the rising star of the Four Seasons began to fall. Vali tried to go solo only to find his voice lost in the Beatles/Stones era of music, where it never really rose to its former heights. Vali's career ended by fading away into obscurity... until a little Broadway play came along four decades later.","The year was 1960 and few boy groups - with the exception of the Lettermen - were successful .

A10VZCRBK21KX7,B00122DEFI,1,1,5,"First I have to thank MIGHTY AMAZON for announcing the reissue of this splendid album on a fully remastered compact disc. I've been yearning for it for years...I purchased it the instant I was notified!.
Overall the project is well written,arranged and produced,it's just like a zepher,a cool eveling wind. Without a doubt, this is MAJOR HARRIS greatest effort!.The songs here has truly stand the rugged test of time itself and are as new as if released yesterday!!!.
This soothing effort starts with the light,bouncy yet regretful ""EACH MORNING I WAKE UP"". The ultimate song here,my most favorite, is the steamy, highly erotic and most sensual ""LOVE WONT LET ME WAIT""!!!.The yearning, the pleading, the desperation,and the reaction is as real as it can ever be. The orgasmic moans/screams by BARBARA INGRAM is as vivid as ever!!!. She is literally writhing/ranting in heat/ecstasy, nothing is left to imagine. This is surely one of the greatest lovemaking songs ever recorded!!!.
Next is the airy ""SWEET TOMORROW"" and the most sad ""SIDESHOW"",originally done by the soul group BLUE MAGIC. ""TWO WRONGS"" bouncy yet regretful. Next is the hopeful ""LOVING YOU IS MELLOW"" a favorite. ""JUST A THING I DO"" is poetry in motion, I love this work of art as well. ""AFTER LOVING YOU"" is an expression of long lost love, lively yet a tad sad. Concluding this supreme effort is his remake of the classic ""MY WAY"", with his soothing tenor voice, he makes this song his very own. I recommend this one-of-a-kind record to all fans of True soul music...A dose of life itself...You will agree as you listen...A most worthy addition to your private stock...A True treasure indeed...","First I have to thank MIGHTY AMAZON for announcing the reissue of this splendid album on a fully remastered compact disc .

A14W1VNMMYLWND,B00122DEFI,1,1,5,"Major Harris releases his debut album My Way in 1974-75.  He has a cool vibin' voice and flows easy over the melody: no wonder why the Delfonics had him join them in the early 70's after Randy Cain (R.I.P.) left.  Here, he gets some solo shine and makes a wonderful record with different tempos and styles.  The hit single: ""Love Won't Let Me Wait""  is a cool-vibin, jazzy, classy number, with some orgasmic girl moans at the end of the slow drag.  ""Sideshow"" is a mellow cover of a Blue Magic classic jam, and Major Harris handles it well.  Other slower jams include ""Just a Thing I Do"" and ""My Way.""  The other songs are more up-tempo and also are spirit and soul up-lifters.  ""Sweet Tomorrow"" is gorgeous, poetic, and romantic.  The swinging vibe of ""Loving You Is Mellow"" with the heavenly chorus chants is another mood lifter.  All the songs on My Way are great: Major Harris has a great voice.  Anyone who loves anything from Motown to Philly Soul and even softer Disco will love this wonderful album.","He has a cool vibin ' voice and flows easy over the melody : no wonder why the Delfonics had him join them in the early 70 's after Randy Cain ( R.I.P. ) left .

That being said, ""Love won't let me wait"" ranks up near the top in the category of romantic R&B/Soul ballads.  The year 1975 was a good year for romantic (black) music.  ""Love won't let me wait"" was NO exception, as it's a great song.

As this CD is an import, it's expensive ($38.99 as of 12/01/2006).  Third parties have cheaper (though not much).  This is going to force me to wait.  Oh well...(sigh)...Five stars...

Having read a little about them I'm not surprised to find out that they are an alternative band formed in the late 90's. ""C'mon, C'mon"" has all the features that attract me to alternative music (I do not claim to be an music expert and many times I do not follow bands, I simply go by what I like and my own interpretations of the music--if you listen long enough you're able to identify the rock, punk, and even some 70's sounds in  many songs that are considered or identified as alternative). For me at least, the influence of good old fashioned well known punk bands, like the Clash and American punk like the Ramones is clear even in ""C'mon, C'mon""--probably one of the reasons why I liked it and bought it.

I did not know that ""C'mon C'mon"" was used as the opening music for the TV show ""Rescue Me"" but this is besides the point. I have no idea what the lyrics mean and are beyond the scope of my review. However, they're simple enough, I've caught myself singing to this song and I usually don't sing. I love that anthem sound that is so particular of alternative music (also punk, yes?). In some crazy way, it reminds me of the Clash's ""Police on my back."" Crazy, but that's what it reminds me of.

I've given ""C'mon C'mon"" five stars because I'm very happy with my purchase. The worst I can say about this song is that when typing it out, it's an awkward contraction and spell check doesn't recognize it.","The Von Bondies and their song "" C'm on , C'm on "" is the first band and song that I researched AFTER my purchase .

A3QS1EPDZTLPWS,B00122EGAU,1,1,4,"Rob Dougan is justly best-known for his track ""Clubbed to Death,"" which first appeared when Mo'Wax was a can't-miss label. And the cinematic quality which marked that track (as well as the track itself) reappear on his debut album, _Furious Angels_. More interesting, Dougan adds his hoarse vocals to his creations, which veer more towards country-western than to pure electronic music. It's an interesting combination, if not an entirely successful one. The title track has a gospel chorus that add tension to some potentially overwrough lyrics. ""Will You Follow Me?"" sounds as if it came straight off a soundtrack -- John Williams would be proud. Not sure what Mr. Williams would think of the dirge-like ""Left Me for Dead,"" however. At times, Dougan sounds as if he's straining his voice in an attempt at emotion, and it's at odds with the elegant orchestrations. When he doesn't try as hard, as on ""There's Only Me,"" he gets across a sense of desperation and sadness much better, as does the melancholy trip-hop and warbling Falsetto of ""Nothing At All."" Not surprisingly, on the instrumental disc, the tracks in which Dougan's vocals proved problematic feel improved with just the strings, but the ones in which the vocals were an asset feel slightly empty. But the most surprising track would be ""Drinking Song,"" which has much of the simplicity and directness of the Pogues' ""Fairytale of New York.""

A3HHLQYFPJ9AQ0,B00122HPJ4,1,1,5,"Polished mosaic. A poignant description of Tantric's latest creation. Woven with layers of intricate melodies and huge, bold, rich harmonies. So crisp you could take a bite like a green apple and taste the burst of flavor! Honestly I was surprised. I was expecting something with a harder edge. This album cuts its own slice of American Pie. There are tracks with messages of social consciousness and responsibility without the element of  ""Feel Guilty bad human"" looming overhead. This troupe of musicians reminds me that there are, yes- artists who insist on putting forth their best effort. You can tell. So, what tracks stand out? Relentless is beautiful and has a very erotic rhythm to it. It's a Taqsim kind of thing. Winslow likes Change. Their rendition of Chains is indeed a compliment to Fleetwood Mac. Finesse! Chasing After- Wow, this song is like a fresh shot of double espresso. If this doesn't wake you up and get the blood going, see your doctor. This track flows into a segue with beautiful guitar and drum tracks. Falling Away- I don't think any other group can cover this song, it is truly Tantric. Can't touch this Baby! Hey Now- need I say more? Hero takes me back to an era of the `70's when life was full of California sunshine and the beach. I don't know why but that's where it takes me: San Onofre and Trestles, salty sea air and late afternoon blue skies. Rocks this ol' surfer girl. This is a very seductive album and is a must have for the True music collector. Very well worth the investment. Rich, and Winslow is never wrong! Winslow's rating:Full tail feather fan!

A2WA8R7ZNUHZMA,B00122HPJ4,1,1,5,"Tantric's sophomore effort is pure brilliance.  After hearing seeing them live, I immediately went out and bought their self-titled debut and every SECOND of the album was up to pitch, fantastic rock music.  So when I heard they were coming out with another album, I was ecstatic.  Though this album is a little more 'hard' then their first CD, it's still amazing and those acoustics made famous by Todd are still there.  Their first single 'Hey Now' is actually more like their old stuff.  My favourite song on the CD would have to be 'Hero', a brilliant done song.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac remake, the beginning doesn't really sound like Tantric but once it gets to the chorus, you can hear their signature sound.  From start to finish this album delivers and I cannot WAIT to hear more.  If you liked the first album from Days of the New, Tantric's first CD or just love rock music you won't be disappointed with this.

That was my review after the first week of having the CD, now I have a little more to say.  Tantric's 'After We Go' is a timeless album, it hasn't left my CD player since it's release.  It's one of those albums that you can put on replay for the rest of your LIFE and still want to hear more.  Each track is amazingly good, it's like a big juicy apple pie, rich and delicious.  The opener, 'Chasing After' is a fast paced starter, Hugo's vocals are extremely well done here, lyrically good as well.  'After We Go' is one of my favourites (tied with about 5 others), the background vocals surpass Hugo's...strange, no.  The talent of this band is overflowing.  'Falling Away' is musically, one of the best songs I've heard.  The guitar work is actually intelligent.  The first single 'Hey Now' is a single I actually love to listen to.  'Hero' which was my favourite song when I first got the CD has now dropped a fair bit, it's still brilliant - a somewhat sweet anthem, if that is an apology, I accept.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac cover, very well done of the classic, the chorus is hard edged, I love Hugo's vocals on the 'and if you don't love me now, you will never love me again', chills.  'Change The World' is a great song to start off if you're a new Tantric fan, it's not as experimental, still extremely well done.  'Just Once' is my favourite song, I think when I listen to it, I go into a different world, the guitars and vocals put me into this dream and I never want to wake up.  These last few songs are what I call the creme de la creme, the best damn music I've ever heard in a long time!  All of these are tied with 'After We Go' for my favourite after 'Just Once' - that didn't really make sense.  In any case, 'Relentless' is lyrically amazing, Hugo's vocals are sexy as hell.  'Alright' - what can I say, the chorus ... if you're a woman, you will get caught up in the vocals, I am telling you, there is nothing sexier than Hugo's vocals.  Todd - you are a god.  Always will be.  'Before' really, there isn't much more I can say ... if I had a thesaurus close by I would look up some more incredible words to describe it's brilliance.  Lastly, 'Awake', a great closing song but every time I get there I wish there was more.  I hit repeat for the time being and I am counting down the days for the next album!!","Tantric 's sophomore effort is pure brilliance .

The three - chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them . It 's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it . The only thing remarkable about this group and those like it is that the guys only had one hit in them ."

A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00122J05G,1,1,4,"The Spinners have a long history. Started in Detroit in 1954, as of 2015 the group was still active, with Henry Fambrough the last surviving original member. Of that early quintet, baritone Fambrough, bass Patric Jackson and tenor Billy Henderson appear on their self-titled debut 1973 ATLANTIC Records LP (SD 7256). Technically considered an original, tenor Bobby Smith replaced James Edwards only weeks after the one-time Domingoes were formed. He's here, as is tenor Phillip Wynne, co-lead with Smith and a 1971 replacement for G.C. Cameron, who chose to stay with MOTOWN when the group left for ATLANTIC.

This album was a huge seller in its day. Certified Gold, an R&B #1 and #14 on BILLBOARD's 200.
Producer, arranger, conductor Thom Bell also plays keyboards.

Originally an ""A"" side, ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" peaked at #77 on the Hot 100
and reached #14 on BILLBOARD's R&B chart. Its flip side, ""I'll Be Around"" was the group's
first ever #1 (R&B). It also was a Hot 100 #3. ""Could It Be I'm Falling in Love"" and ""One
of a Kind (Love Affair)"" also made the R&B top spot, with the former a Pop #4 and the
latter peaking at #11 on the Hot 100. Four charting singles on one LP-- not bad!

SIDE ONE

A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"It is a myth that soul was a singles medium. At least half a myth. In the 1960s, it was True. Most Motown albums were not meant to hold together as such. But when Stevie Wonder released Music Of My Mind in early 1972, he proved soul LPs could work as cohesively as any rock LP.

And so it went for Gamble and Huff and Thom Bell, the Philly Sound. Both the O'Jays with Back Stabbers and here, this first Spinners album, are just that: albums. Playing the singles on AM was AM's gain and lack of FM airplay was FMs loss.

The Spinners, the album, does not have a concept like the O'Jays Back Stabbers or Ship Ahoy.  Or does it? If love and passion can be a concept, it is best illustrated on this album

There is the Philly Sound, there is........well, easy there, let's climb one mountain at a time.  The lush horns, strings, vibes, and master vocals are wound into one massive, wonderful silk sheet of sound. I don't have to tell you, just listen. Wagner would be proud

""I'll Be Around,"" ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,"" ""One Of A Kind Love Affair."" Anyone born by 1970 or before grew up hearing these on the radio, and do you believe how stupid some of us were? We heard this music next to Daddy Dewdrop's ""Chick-A-Boom,"" or ""Have You Ever Been Mellow,"" by Oliva Newton John, and quickly ran to our King Crimson albums, unable to separate the prime rib from the beef jerky. The best soul from the worst pop. We look at ourselves now. Wagner would NOT approve.

More proof. Yeah, sure. Play part of Coltrane's Love Supreme next to Bobby Goldsboro's ""Honey,"" and run for the hills. The blimp has crashed. But take said 'Trane and then go into ""One Of A Kind Love Affair,"" and it will be the start of a one of a kind love affair--for you. Me too.

Talking jazz,  I almost forgot. There is jazz here, too. Check out the third track, ""Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You"" I needn't go into this, but it proves my point. All this wonderful music is wonderful music, some of which happened to be singles. But listen to The Spinners from start to end, like a stranger to this music, and all the richness and craft and variation, and there is a ton, holds together musically and conceptually.

A14W1VNMMYLWND,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"1972 and 1973 were the years that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success.  Now with producer/writer team Thom Bell/Linda Creed, and a deal on Atlantic, they Spinners' hard work finally paid off after years.  This joint is surely a winner, with some heavy hitting mid-tempo soul jams.  This one contains some legendary jams like the rolling funk of ""I'll Be Around"" and ""Could It Be I'm Falling in Love"" heavily laden with strings, a staple of Philly Soul.  ""I'll Be Around"" is one of my favorite soul jams of all time, and even though I am 10 years younger than the song is, I remember listening to it and loving it in junior high school (in the mid 90's) when L.A. hip-hop station Power 106 FM had time set aside time for old school jams.  Rapper Rappin' 4-Tay also made his own version of it in 1994, a wonderful hip-hop jam which took the funky rolling music and some of the hook vocals for the rap song.  Another one of my favorites here is ""Just Me and You Baby,"" a slower, ballad type jam with heavenly harmony.  ""Ghetto Child"" is heavy mid-tempo jam exploring the bad side of growing up in the `hood, very sad and timeless.  ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" is a sadder lyrically rich song laden with sitars later in the song.  Phillipe Wynne, Bobbie Smith (great singers), and company surely deliver a rich album full of lush Thom Bell production and sweet harmony and melody; the transition from Detroit to Philly surely was a lucrative one.  1974's Mighty Love is another wonderful soulful album as is 1975's Pick of the Litter.  The Spinners are definitely essential listening in order to truly experience what Philly Soul has to offer.","1972 and 1973 were the years that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success .

What makes a song a truly great song is one that moves you every time you hear it.  Iris is one of those songs.  Lyrically, it's one of the better songs from the last twenty years.  The melody, along with John Rzeznik's gravely, almost desperate vocals, makes for a hauntingly beautiful song of forbidden love.  It's ironic that the song appeared in the 1998 film City of Angels with Nicolas Cage because he has always played the guy from the wrong side of the tracks whose characters would make any potential girlfriend's family nervous.","A lot of great songs has a hook that captures your attention .

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00122KZBY,1,1,4,"It turns out the old saying is True: The family that plays together, stays together. Four siblings and their best pal make up indiepop group Eisley, whose debut EPs hinted at what they could do. And ""Room Noises"" certainly proves that their airy, whimsical pop was worth the long wait for.

Some of the songs are from those EPs, although they sound a bit tighter and smoother. For example, the heartbreaking ode to the bullied, ""Telescope Eyes,"" or the prettily whimsical ""Marvelous Things."" Despite the airy poesy of the songs, there's a distinctly melancholy streak through the album, which peaks at the very beginning: ""Memories,"" a haunting song about a woman mourning her husband's suicide.

Despite a few EP songs, they also have quite a few new songs, like the enchantingly sunny ""Golly Sandra,"" which has echoes of the Beach Boys. But the sparkling pop vibe continues in other songs, carried over in piano melodies and smooth guitar riffs. ""Still floating soft/I am dreaming and I'm glad I lost/And still with my fingers/I'm drawing circles in the water,"" the song goes, as fluid as the water it talks about.

That mixture of bittersweetness and innocent optimism is what makes Eisley so darn appealing. Nowhere are the stereotypical I-just-wanna-have-fun or my-boy/girlfriend-dumped-me-and-now-I-wanna-swim-with-the-toaster music for THIS pop band. While they have some love songs, the emphasis is on their enchanting kind of whimsy.

That whimsy carries over into just about whatever they sing about, whether it's Sherri and Staci singing about dragons in the woods, sunlight and butterflies, or metal teeth and ""telescope eyes."" Some of the lyrics seem to stray into Flaming Lips-type surrealism, but are also grounded by simple sentiments like, ""You have shining eyes, yes like those forest lights, and it makes me want to cry.""

After the past few years, with the group rapidly moving out of the teen bracket, one would wonder if Stacy and Sherri Dupree's angelic vocals would have gotten... well, not so pretty. No problem with that -- they sound a bit like younger versions of Beth Gibbons or perhaps Hope Sandoval. The two girls even interplay their vocals in on song, with remarkable skill and spine-tingling results.

At the start of one song, the line ""Congratulations, we've finally made it"" is sung. And so Eisley has -- and this promising band only shows signs of getting even better in albums to come.","It turns out the old saying is True : The family that plays together , stays together .

Eisley's debut L.P. ""Room Noises"" is a perfectly good debut record. There is more potential for greatness on this record then I have heard in some time from any band, if they only reach it occasionally.

""Memories"", the records lead off track, is the records best ssong, all minor key harmonies and a twisting, melodic as all else breakdown which is one of the coolest things I have heard this year. The next song ""Telescopic Eyes"" is another keeper, showcasing the bands darker form of melodic pop, catchy enough for radio but different enough for the rest of us.

From there the record is spotty. Or actually it's not. There really isn't a quote-unquote bad song on the record, it just gets a bit same soundy as it goes on. The group shows such potential and talent on the first handful of tunes that as the record goes on and the song remains the same you get kind of dissapointed. Maybe some changes in tone, maybe a little, just a little distortion, maybe some different types of arrangements could fix this problem. I don't know.

But I say buy this record. It is good, and this band could very easily be great a record or two from now. ""Room Noises"" is promising, even if it doesn't deliver fully on said potential. But I'll tell you one thing:

I can't wait to hear what they do next.",""" Room Noises "" is a perfectly good debut record .

It often automatically presumed that because a recording has been re-mastered, or transferred from analog to digital, that it's better.  Not so in many cases.  Re-mastering often over-compresses the original recording and results in the equivalent of a poor mix.  Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.

In the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.  Extremely disappointing.

The meaning is enigmatic but it allows many differing interpretations and I do not think that is bad.  With many lasting works of art, it will elicit different emotions and address many topics depending on the audience.  It starts with a simple , almost latin melody, and Robert comes in quietly and without hurry.  His narrative is leading and his melody makes you feel as if there is actual movement.  His matter of fact delivery is in line with his more mature sensibilities and the desperate angst of his youth is replaced with tension but not desperation.  At the end the melody continues even after the singer has completed his part.  Is it symbolic?  It is to me and that is all I can say.","It is more sophisticated and densely nuanced .

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00122KZBY,1,1,4,"5 Stars if you're new to Eisley; 4 Stars for the rest of us

Eisley has released 2 EPs in early and late 2003, the excellent ""Laughing City"" and ""Marvelous Things"". For whatever reason, it's taken over another year for the release of their debut album. The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there, and Coldplay's Chris Martin is a big fan as well (Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour).

""Room Noises"" (12 tracks, 41 min.) is full of dreamy, yet very catchy songs, not unlike, say, Sixpense None the Richer. The best songs are in the first half of the album, including the opener ""Memories"", ""I Wasn't Prepared"", ""Memories"" (the standout track of the album), and ""Brightly Wounded"" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers. Other great tracks are ""Plenty of Paper"", a great up-tempo song, and the closer ""Trolley Wood"".

What keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs (in newly recorded versions), and that's disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning. We want more new songs! Finally, the Amazon listing shows a bonus track (a remixed version of ""Lost at Sea"") but the CD I bought doesn't have it, hmmmm... Regardless, Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I can't wait to see them live! ""Room Noises"" is highly recommended!","5 Stars if you 're new to Eisley ; 4 Stars for the rest of us

I noticed that a lot of the songs are from his first album Make It Last Forever. Sure, that was his best album, but maybe he should've included a good number of songs from ALL of the albums. Oh well, there are other hits you remember, like ""Nobody"", ""Twisted"", ""I'll Give All My Love To You"", and even LSG's ""My Body"". And most hits collections contain a hard-to-find song, and here there's ""(There You Go) Tellin' Me No Again"" (from the New Jack City soundtrack).
I'm not exactly sure why the Snoop Dogg-assisted ""Come And Get With Me"" is on here, but regardless, this is still a good album to buy if all your Keith Sweat cassettes are worn out or lost.

A1D44YT0P8Q8XL,B00122MC0Q,1,1,5,"For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

With the superb instrumental skills of pianist Don Grolnick, drummer John Guerin, bassist Bob Magnusson, guitarist Bob Mann (who also played fabulously on Rod Stewart and Steve Tyrell's recordings) and the creative flair of concertmaster David Frisina, this CD offers some of the glowing moments of Ms. Ronstadt's musical career. ""Lush Life,"" ""What's New?"" and ""For Sentimental Reasons"" are three of the greatest and most beautiful albums of standards ever recorded.

Nobody sounded more expressive than Ms. Ronstadt singing ""When I Fall In Love,"" a song lamenting that love has ended even before it has begun. You can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist, Bob Mann, complementing Ms. Ronstadt's exquisite voice. Likewise, nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of ""When Your Lover Has Gone.""

""What lonely hours
The evening shadows bring
What lonely hours
With memories lingering
Like faded flowers
Life can't mean anything . . .""

In ""Skylark,"" the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition as she brings new life to this Johnny Mercer/Hoagy Carmichael classic. She also left a lasting impression to one of Sinatra's signature songs ""I'm A Fool To Want You,"" just like Ol' Blue Eyes did with his meaningful interpretation. They both did the best versions for male and female vocals, respectively.

She swings lightly on Rodgers & Hart's gem ""You Took Advantage Of Me,"" then she takes it slower in Mills/Parish/Ellington's ""Sophisticated Lady."" And picks up the light swing tempo again on ""Can't We Be Friends?""

""Sophisticated lady I know
You miss the love you had long ago
And when nobody is nigh
You cry. . . you cry.""

If you're a lover of standards like me and an admirer of beauty in all its forms, you should have this CD in your collection and take pleasure in listening to its endless beauty.

In 1968 he recorded the Grammy - award winning instrumental "" Classical Gas "" . It would become one of the biggest hits of the summer of 1968 . In an interview with Goldmine Williams described the song in this way : "" half flamenco , half Flatt & Scruggs , and half classical . "" In fact this song actually garnered 3 Grammy awards as "" Best Instrumental Arrangement "" , "" Best Contemporary - Pop Performance "" and "" Best Instrumental Theme "" . This sounds every bit as fresh today as it did when it was recorded nearly 50 years ago ."

And the songs you should've heard already, ""Going In the Right Direction"" and ""I Need More Love"", still sound excellent.
Other standouts are the funky ""Soul Refreshing"" and ""Why Should I Feel Lonely"". I even like ""Problems"", a we-are-the-world style song that doesn't sound so clichd. Actually, there's no song on here that's a waste of time. Unclassified IS classified -- as one of the best albums of last year.

In the middle of all this Grammy supergroup shanigans many in our great nation were introduced to Robert Randolph and the Family Band. ""I Need More Love"" was tight performance of what they represent. Positive, church inspired, funk music with blistering jam band talent. Very, very rare that we hear anything that sounds fresh, new or an extension upon the foundations of black music rather than a recapitulation of established norms. These guys are the real deal. The music will raise your spirits. The talent will awe you at times. Acoustic music with power, fire, technique, soul, love, heart, courage, and power.
That's we need today, and that's what you should purchase.
Support great musicians and cop this album!

A3IC5E3OFHYAZX,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"You know, I never heard of Robert Randolph until I caught a sampling of 'The Word' album on an independent radio station about a year ago. After hearing him play the pedal steel guitar on that collaboration project, I must say I was absolutely floored! EVERYTHING about his playing will bring to mind all the things that made guys like Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Duane Allman, Carlos Santana, and Stevie Ray Vaughan as revered as they are. Simply put, the brother got ""MAD SKILLZ""!!!

The same can also be said of his stellar backing unit known simply as the Family Band, whose sound I found it best to describe as being a unique hybrid of the Allman Brothers' roots-based  rock and Graham Central Station's sanctified funk. On this, their first studio-conceived album, nearly all the tracks shine from the infectiously ""gospel-delic"" groove laid down by the band as well as the industrial strength of Randolph's pedal steel work (which is a joy to behold in itself). I would've given this a 5-star rating if some of the jams were extended for greater effect, but that's just a minor complaint linked mainly to personal preference. On the other hand, I do know a good band when I hear one and something tells me that Robert Randolph & Co. aren't that far off from becoming one of the most exciting and influential bands of their generation (MY generation to be specific).

HIGHLY recommended, but also get their live album as well.

AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"Excellent followup for Robert Randolph and the Family Band's underground classic ""Live at the Wetlands."" Those who liked that CD will be pleased with this one. Most of this consists of tunes that this excellent group has been performing live over the last year, like ""Run For Your Life,"" ""Good Times,"" and ""Squeeze."" Once again, John Ginty plays the heck out of his organ and Marcus Randolph and Danyel Morgan in fine support (though it would be nice if this one had more of Danyel's soaring vocals).
Overall, this is good stuff, particularly the songs that I have just mentioned. Real get-up and go music with a positive energy not often found in tunes of recent times. ""Soul Refershing"" is simply beautiful and ""Smile"" is interesting (Robert's sister Lenesha does the vocals here). ""Calypso"" (not to be confused with the Harry belafonte tune of the same name) is an interesting novelty. A few of the songs (like ""I Need More Love"") are somewhat lacking in the right mix of melody and energy that characteris\zes this group-but a so-so song from these guys are better than the best of a lot of what's out there now!
I would suggest that those who may be interested in this start with ""Live at the Wetlands"" before going on to ""Unclassified."" That will give you a better preperation for this. Then pick up ""The Word"" (RR without the Family Band) and the ""Sacred Steel"" Cds after you listen to ""Unclassified.""

A2UR38SZPVA07I,B00122MEB8,1,1,5,"The Confessor was the title song from Joe Walsh's seventh solo album, released in 1985. It's also the most interesting single recording he has ever released as a solo artist. A two-part acoustic/electric guitar showpiece, the song is a reflection on perceiving reality and the certainty of having to pay a price for treachery and evil.

The futuristic synthesizer intro is augmented/contrasted by Joe's bluesy electric and haunting acoustic slide guitars. You can actually hear Joe's bottleneck scraping the brass-wound guitar strings as it eerily slides over them. Slow blues from the dark realm of another universe.

 Minor and major seventh chords complement Joe singing the murky philosophical lyrics of the first, and slower, half of the song.

The second half of the song features a ferocious electric guitar solo and one of Joe's most compelling vocal performances.

The Confessor:

If you look at your reflection in the bottom of a well
What you see is only on the surface
When you try to see the meaning hidden underneath
The measure of the depth can be deceiving
The bottom has a rocky reputation

You can feel it in the distance the deeper that you stare
From up above it's hard to see but you know when you're there
On the bottom words are shallow
On the surface talk is cheap
You can only judge the distance by the company you keep
In the eyes of The Confessor

In the eyes of The Confessor
There's nowhere you can hide
You can't hide from the eyes (of The Confessor)
Don't you even try

In the eyes of The Confessor
You can't tell a lie
You cannot tell a lie (to The Confessor)
Strip you down to size

Naked as the day that you were born
Naked as the day that you were born

Take all the trauma, drama, comments
The guilt and doubt and shame
The what if's and if only's
The shackles and the chains
The violence and aggression
The pettiness and scorn
The jealousy and hatred
The tempest and discord...

Remember how you convinced yourself it was OK to buy it, even though you didn't like the rest of the album? It was OK then, and it is OK now. ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" the album, has five songs you never heard of, and one song you should know. This song is the one you want. Skip the album.

In the rock-and-roll canon, that great list of songs everyone generally agrees is great, you'll find a few Elvis, Stones and Beatles tunes. Zeppelin will have their share, and you'll see the Doors, Clapton, Buddy Holly and other familiar names repeated throughout that list. Then, somewhere close to #100 or 150, you'll see 'Iron Butterfly'. Who? It doesn't matter who. It matters what. The what is ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" a 17 minute work of rock-n-roll art.

To say Iron Butterfly was a one-hit wonder is only relating half of the story. This wasn't like ""People!"" whose cover of ""I Love You,"" hit high and then was forgotten when band members split to do other things. That's a real one-hit wonder. Iron Butterfly had one hit, but it would be like if Zeppelin only gave the world ""Stairway to Heaven."" The one song is enough to seal them in rock-n-roll history.

Has anyone covered this song? No one cares, because this is the version everyone wants. Everyone else is just giving this version an homage.

Like Skynard's guitar in ""Freebird,"" the drum solo here is what everyone talks about. The physical endurance to carry it off, and the musical strength to sustain the rhythm back into the song is amazing.

I fully recommend, ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" by Iron Butterfly.

It often automatically presumed that because a recording has been re-mastered, or transferred from analog to digital, that it's better.  Not so in many cases.  Re-mastering often over-compresses the original recording and results in the equivalent of a poor mix.  Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.

In the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.  Extremely disappointing.

The introduction of grunge, rap, and other music was hard to get use to. In 1992 along come a great song from Alannah Myles, BLACK VELVET. I thought the music of the 1990's is not lost we have a winner. The reason why I love this song is the lyrics beat, and it has something for everybody. It is a song that is a blend of Pop/Country, the beat is a blend and the lyrics to me is more pop. So if U hate Pop music you will still love this song and vice-versa with those who dis-like Country music like me. I guarantee you will get attached to this song regardless with music you prefer, so enjoy.

A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B00122PIMA,1,1,4,"Robert Plant and Jimmy Page,late of Led Zeppelin,mellow out with some R&B/swing numbers like the Top 10 hit SEA OF LOVE and the Top 20 hit ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT. Joining Plant and Page in this ensemble is Nile Rodgers,who himself had chart success with his R&B band Chic. Rodgers had quite a workload with this album and Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN. It's understandable that Plant and Page declined to carry on with Led Zeppelin after the 1980 death of drummer John Bonham. SOL was made famous originally by Phil Phillips in 1959. The differences between Phillips' recording and the cover are no ""buh-buh-buh-bum"" in the cover,a key change in the cover and Plant's accenting of some of the lyrics differently than how Phillips did it. I guess that's because Plant is English(as is Page) and Phillips is American(as is Rodgers). ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT really swings. It got the lively 1940's sound that the fighting men of World War II were dancing to at clubs. After this album,Plant,whose solo career began in or around 1982,continued going solo. Page formed his third band THE FIRM and released an album in 1985. Recently,the surviving Led Zeppelin members re-formed with a new drummer and are currently on tour.","Robert Plant and Jimmy Page , late of Led Zeppelin , mellow out with some R&B / swing numbers like the Top 10 hit SEA OF LOVE and the Top 20 hit ROCKIN ' AT MIDNIGHT .

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00122PIMA,1,1,4,"The Honeydrippers consisted of two members of the collapsed band called Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. After Page and Plant added some new faces they had a new band, The Honeydrippers. Their new band does some great covers some of their songs. Unfortunately, this CD is rather short--and that disappoints me. What we do get, though, is excellent quality!

The track set begins with ""I Get A Thrill."" The band gives the arrangement a big band/swing/50s rock and roll flavor to this number; and the band harmonizes to perfection! Listen for some great piano playing; and the drums and percussion bolster ""I Get A Thrill"" very well. Love that electric guitar, too! ""Sea Of Love"" opens with a grand musical flourish from the violins; and when the band comes in they play and sing without a superfluous note! ""Sea Of Love"" gives us The Honeydrippers delivering one of their strongest, most enchanting love ballads ever. They harmonize well as they sing this nostalgic song to celebrate the joys of being in love. The musical interlude uses the electric guitar very well, too.

""I Got A Woman"" is a song written by the late great Ray Charles; The Honeydrippers pick up the tempo to perform this song at a faster than normal clip. The tempo helps to emphasize the joyfulness of this number that has a man celebrating his love for his woman. The band delivers this flawlessly; and the horn solo during the musical interlude impresses me very much. ""Young Boy Blues"" uses some great chord changes to make this number special, too.

The CD ends with the awesome track entitled ""Rockin' At Midnight."" If you really want to hear rock mixed with both big band and swing, listen for THIS ballad. The band celebrates being out on the town with their girlfriends; and the musical arrangement pulls out all the stops to make this number stun you with its power! The guitar solo bolsters the number as the horns play during the musical interlude; and the overall effect of ""Rockin' At Midnight"" packs a strong punch!

The liner notes include some great artwork and we get the song credits, too.

The Honeydrippers never developed to the extent I hoped they would; but this CD gives us excellent material from a band that lacked nothing. I only wish there were more than the paltry five songs on this CD! I have to take off a star because of this disappointment.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this playful, energetic CD put out by The Honeydrippers. Led Zeppelin fans will at the very least be intrigued by this CD; and people who thirst for that big band sound with those crooning vocals will love this one. Pop it in your CD player and enjoy!

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00122QCDY,1,1,4,"Back in 1985/86, Slash Records seemed to be on the brink of starting a whole new American Breed of Rockers. They had new albums and new bands from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Los-Lobos/dp/B000CCD0F8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Los Lobos</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blasters/dp/B000VUTP4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blasters</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodeans/dp/B00005Y1Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodeans</a>. They all got sort of lumped into the 'new wave' category, but there was something more going on here. ""Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams"" was one of the best embodiments of this group of bands, and reissue, almost 25 years after the fact, shows why.

The Bodeans were young and enthusiastic kids who wanted to make their own sound. Being from Wisconsin, they has no burning desire to be trendy or fashionable, just to make music that felt like escape to them. With the first thrilling notes of ""She's A Runaway"" and the rocking theme of breakout the song offers, it's an instant classic that should have slotted in comfortably next to the Springsteen or Mellencamp hits of the day. T-Bone Burnette heard the truth inside the songs and the vocal magic Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas made, and hauled them away to Los Angeles to make this album. ""Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams"" is a missing link of an album, the chain the runs between The Everly Brothers and The Rolling Stones (from whom the album nicked its title).

A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"Alice Cooper's 1982 ""Zipper Catches Skin"" is more straight-ahead rock and less New Wave than his two previous albums, but contains some material that seems like leftovers from ""Flush the Fashion"" and ""Special Forces"".

It's an average Alice album at best, and if you skip this one you're not missing that much.

The best cuts are the galloping opener ""Zorro's Ascent""; The fiery, clever ""Tag, You're It"" has Alice assuming the role of horror-movie director and the entire song is made up of his direction to the terrified leading lady hiding from a psycho-killer. It alone makes this album worth getting. Though the militant ""I Better Be Good"" sounds like a leftover from ""Special Forces"", it's still one of the best tracks here lyrically and musically. Patty Donahue of The Waitresses appears to take Alice to task on ""I Like Girls"" and her asides are typically amusing and make the song (""What happened? Run out of gas?"" etc).

Among the rest: ""Make That Money (Scrooge's Song)"" is nothing special except the instrumental finale sounds like something straight out of the ""Killer"" era, which should please fans of the original ACG. In the slower ""I Am the Future"", Alice forgoes the sap of earlier shamaltz for a ballad with bite--exactly like a slow Coop song should be.

Some of the lyrics get a little silly, as on ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" but it's a decent sing-a-long cut nontheless, the showy chorus reminiscent of ""Hello Hurray"". The rocking ""I'm Alive (That Was the Day My Dead Pet Returned)"" also sounds like something from B$B updated for 1982.

""Adaptable (Anything For You)"", ""Remarkably Insincere"" are actually both UNremarkable.

Although ""Zipper Catches Skin"" is not a bad album--and would be decent for any other artist, Alice is capable of much more than what's here.

In the slower "" I Am the Future "" , Alice forgoes the sap of earlier shamaltz for a ballad with bite -- exactly like a slow Coop song should be . Some of the lyrics get a little silly , as on "" No Baloney Homosapiens "" but it 's a decent sing - a - long cut nontheless , the showy chorus reminiscent of "" Hello Hurray "" . The rocking "" I 'm Alive ( That Was the Day My Dead Pet Returned ) "" also sounds like something from B$B updated for 1982 . "" Adaptable ( Anything For You ) "" , "" Remarkably Insincere "" are actually both UNremarkable . Although "" Zipper Catches Skin "" is not a bad album -- and would be decent for any other artist , Alice is capable of much more than what 's here . Three Stars -- an average Coop effort ."

A34Y1FT0MTD7C9,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"Alice Cooper-Zipper Catches Skin **1/2

The way I look at most of Alice Coopers releases from the early to mid 1980's is the same way I look at Iggy Pop's work form the same time period. None of it is really horrible (at least not completely) but none of it is really great. They both seem to have like the whole new wave thing and wanted to join in on it. It didn't work out well for either of them. But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n' roll and yet they wanted to do something...bad..? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music.

'Zorro's Ascent' 'No Baloney Homosapiens' 'I Like Girls' and 'Tag, Your It' are all decent rock tracks. They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics. Especially 'No Baloney...' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name. Though 'Remarkably Insencire' is a real gem.

The rest of the album feels trite and boring, not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music. The production for one thing is horrendous.

While not too bad and not a total waste of your money, Zipper Catches Skin is not an album worth hunting down. IF you happen to come across it yeah it makes a cool snag, but ditch the high hopes for this one.","Alice Cooper - Zipper Catches Skin * * 1/2

AKGF27HN0OF19,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"This one has to be Alice's most inconsistent albums.  It's material ranges all over the place seemingly in search of a direction, but not really finding one.  Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on ""Special Forces"".  This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long.  Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting.  I did hear ""I Like Girls"" on my local AOR station a few times, but that was about it.  Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads, I like a lot of this disc.  You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff, as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous.  Highlights include ""Zorro's Ascent"" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together ""Adaptable"", ""I Like Girls"", and ""Remarkably Insincere"".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  ""Tag You're It"" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" days.  ""It Better Be Good"" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  ""I Am The Future"" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.  ""I'm Alive"" is another clunker that closes out the album.  Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly.

Tunes I thought were good were ""Zorro's Ascent"" (it's got a great beat to it), the radio friendly ""I Like Girls"" (with guest vocalist The Waitress's Patty Donahue - R.I.P.), ""Tag,You're It"" and ""I'm Alive (That Was The Day My Dead Pet Returned to Save My Life)"". There's a cut here ""I Am The Future"" that at first I didn't remember where I've heard it before. Turns out it was part of the movie soundtrack for 'Class Of '84'. Line-up: Alice - vocals, Mike Pinera & Richard Wagner - guitars, Erik Scott - bass, Duane Hitchings - synthesizer and Jan Uvena - drums.

And you have ""I Like Girls"" and ""Remarkably Insincere"" which are fun songs about a womanizing loser. ""I Am the Future"" is actually a pretty dark song lyrically and I think is the standout song on the album. But, on the flip side you have what may be Cooper's worst song ever with ""No Baloney Homosapiens"". I am sure at the time, Cooper thought this was pretty clever, but musically it just does not flow, the lyrics are choppy, and forced into a rhyming scheme that just doesn't work. ""Make That Money"" is another forgettable ditty, with lyrics again not befitting Alice Cooper. But outside of those two songs Alice I think ""Zipper Catches Skin"" is a really good album, but still the weakest of the early 80's New Age Alice.

Bread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I appreciate how much they meant to friends and family just a bit older than me too.

I'm glad I gave them another look. It was well worth it and :""Make it with You"" is well worth 5 stars to me.

Having made the move from SoCal folk-rock band in the late 60's to Nashville-based country band by the early 80's, NGDB never fully lost its roots and is often credited with influencing the modern country-crossover movement.

You certainly hear those blended influences in ""Fishin' in the Dark"", which marries the toe-tapping twang of mid-80's Nashville country with the vocal harmonies of earlier SoCal folk-rockers like the Mamas and Papas.

A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00122X3HW,-1,-1,3,"Issued in 1980, Cheech & Chong's LET'S MAKE A NEW OPE DEAL (HS 3391) was their sixth of seven comedy albums and the first for WARNER BROS. Records. Audio quality is improved over their ODE LPs, with some nifty studio effects added, but the material isn't as strong as on their '70s releases. Side One is a suite of related tracks.

""SIDE"" NOTES --

ONE -- 1.) Spoof of the George Lucas sci-fi epic opens with un-P.C. fey humor. 2.) Redneck couple can't get served, as she's ""in drag."" 3.) Multi-tracked bit at a Chinese restaurant. 4.) Mr. Redneck can't order a drink. 5.) Song where hamburgers are a sexual experience.

""SIDE"" TWO -- 1.) Milwaukee DJ Buzz Wired makes random phone calls, trying to give away some BAM (Bumming Around Money). 2.) The same dummy (""Bob Btchin"") from 5 years earlier bungles his way through the game and wins with a wrong answer. 3.) Headache sufferer visits a Chinese physician. 4.) Record company exec suffering from a headache is hounded by a pushy, overloud producer, who demos a punk single by Ronny Rump and the Rumptones. 5.) Two foul-mouthed Brit musicians quarrel and toss a telly out their hotel room window.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00122X3D6,1,1,4,"It is honestly and absolutely so sad when someone young and talented throws their life away from all the vices in the world they can never get over. Unfortunately one of those 90's souls, Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver died early at the age of 48. He has had so many great songs on his own, as a part of Velvet Revolver with Slash of Guns N' Roses, but especially when he was with S.T.P. The songs he had back in the 90's were the catalyst of his life. Sadly though, he died of those drug and alcohol problems, and his time in prison. Interstate Love Song, one his biggest songs from the S.T.P. album Purple is one of those songs that really brought out the best in his voice, and his spirit. He definitely drove from top to bottom in the song. It was really his best song, and the groups' biggest hit. I think of when he was gifted with a brilliant and gritty voice. But to see Scott die early, just like Lane Staley of Alice IN Chains and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was no surprise. Hopefully, he has peace on the other side.

By now this disc is probably in every used store across the country , and well worth the price you could get it for . After a few listens , you 'll realize "" Space Is The Place "" ."

A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B00122Z4Y2,1,1,5,"The Mystic Knights of The Oingo Boingo have come a long was since presiding in the Devil's Chamber in that truly cult classic, THE FORBIDDEN ZONE, directed by Richard Elfman {sibling elf}, a highly entertaining venture into the vortex of utter madness. Since their innovative neo-punk beginnings, Danny Elfman has led the Knights onto many musical victories, including his own solo projects, & finally, movie scores. Such titles as BATMAN RETURNS, BEETLEJUICE, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE XMAS, NIGHTBREED & EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, are among his celebrated compositions.
The name has been put through the guillotine, severed in half to display a highly crystallized evolution. A focus on heavier rhythm guitars have been added, giving the album a sharper edge. The cover displays an interesting little clown, deformed in his composit. The back shows some aesthetic terrorism as well.
Now, this erubescent, modern-day Wolfgang brings forth a series of songs which speak from his satanic heart, of anti-assimilation in the jesting guise of conformity. Particularly noticable in the cantible ""Insatanity"". where the voices of little ones valiantly defy xian indoctrination by recognizing its unnaturalness. Also exposed is the hypocrisy of evangelists in their two-faced, money-grubbing, sexually-twisted forms.
Another favorite is ""Mary"", which is the common story of a blossoming midwestern girl breaking the apron strings to see the great-wide-world. The rub here, is that she enjoys what she feels, & for the first time, comes unto her own realizations & conclusionsnow thyat her overbearing xian family is out of the picture. It is quite an emotionally-evoking piece, especially when the syubbornness of her unfortunately xoid kin is displayed., in their unacceptance of her, when she finally finds something she really enjoys. Indulging in the pleasures of the flesh, & living a decadently hedonistic lifestyle which brings her satisfaction, & a sense of accomplishment. She was a bigger fish than they - she had ambition. I don't think it was too much of a blasphemous coincidence that the name hosen was ""Mary"", as in ""virgin"". By the way, the violins are sublime.
There's also a remake of the Beatles' ""I Am The Walrus"", a fun song that has been played at many a frat party, no doubt. SPIDER is an enjoyable diddy about he who glares from the wall. WAR AGAIN is an inspirational tune about war & the adrenalyn & tragedy of battle. It inspires pride. It is powerful in its emotional evocation, as the words are definitely felt, greatly compliments the music.
Overall, this release is an experience, which is rare in the pop-""music"" industry, with their trivial, monotonous, monosyllabic, non-music blare. Like Elman's other works, all which make an impression upon the listener, this is sure to please the discriminating, amalgamate, audial conniseur.","The Mystic Knights of The Oingo Boingo have come a long was since presiding in the Devil 's Chamber in that truly cult classic , THE FORBIDDEN ZONE , directed by Richard Elfman { sibling elf } , a highly entertaining venture into the vortex of utter madness .

AJK5WHV1GW941,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"I own most of Jaheim's music and this man never releases a bad album.  When he records an LP, he obviously brings his A-game because one can hear it in his voice: He is focused when he sings and he means every word he belts out.  He is one of the best male artists of today, easily.  Why?  Foremost, because he has a beautiful tenor singing voice and knows just how to use it.  He does not over-sing and he stays on key so well!  ""The Makings of A Man"" is one of the best albums of 2007 because it is consistent and there are some great tunes on this album.  Most of the songs are mid-tempo and about women and relationships.  Also, there are twelve songs so the album is not too short and not lengthy either.

 Jaheim will find some way to tell you that he is a reformed thug on each and every album.  I know he is serious, but it's a little funny that he feels the need to continually remind us.  This time, his thug story is found on ""Life of A Thug.""  He exposes some of the malicious things he did during that juncture in his life, and if you listen closely, he was a pretty bad guy.  This song is nicely produced; I particularly like the horns.  Also, the hook gives it replay value.  ""She Ain't You"" and ""Voice of R&B"" are great tracks.  Vocally, he does a splendid job.  The lyrics are meaningful, especially to Jaheim fanatics.  He informs his listeners that he is very important to the genre of music called R&B, and he is.  Keyshia Cole is my boo and she did well on ""I've Changed"", but that is one of the weakest songs on the album.  The song is average at best.  The hook isn't too good and neither are the lyrics or the production.  Jaheim has included quite a few songs about his mother on his albums.  Here, we have a song called ""Back Together Again.""  This heartfelt number has an emotional Jaheim singing about how his parents are united in heaven.  It's a lovely moment on the album.

 I hope I have convinced you to pick this album up, download it from iTunes, do SOMETHING!  I enjoyed it all the way through.  Be advised, this is a laid back album.  There aren't any dance tracks, just ballads and mid-tempos, but truly worth your time.  4 shining stars.

This is especially True since Ghetto Classics was just as good as its predecessors, but Jaheim didn't get the push he deserved from his label and failed to chalk up the numbers he used to get in his prime. Now with Atlantic Records as his new label home, Jaheim hopes to re-up and capture the attention of his original fan base and millions more with his new album The Makings Of A Man. He keeps the formula the same for the most part, resorting to mid-tempo grooves and slow cuts for the majority of the album. After professing his worth with the intro track ""Voice of R&B."" Jaheim lays it down with ""Hush,"" a song about keeping an affair with a homie's girl on the low. ""Have You Ever"" rides out with strong background vocals, simple piano work, and lyrics about speculating on what could have been and rethinking what has already been done. ""Lonely"" is a reworking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bobby-Womack/dp/B00004SATU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bobby Womack</a>'s ""If You Think You're Lonely Now,"" using the infamous hook for the song but changing the lyrics to reflect Jaheim's own tale of scooping up the next girl and her man is the one sitting at home all alone! ""Life of a Thug"" is a depiction of Jaheim's life in the form of an autobiographical song, describing all the trials and tribulations that he's faced over the years and his ultimate redemption from those trying times. He questions why a lover doesn't realize a good man when he's right in your face on the song ""Just Don't Have A Clue."" For the track ""She Ain't You,"" Jaheim borrows the melody and background from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Delphonics/dp/B000EMGJTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Delphonics</a>' classic ""La La Means I Love You"" for another reworking where he talks about his former girl still having his heart and wishing he could still be with her instead of anyone he's been with since losing her. Jaheim hangs up his player status for the love of his life on the album's lead-off single ""Never."" ""I've Changed"" features the dynamic rawness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keyshia-Cole/dp/B000VDDCHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keyshia Cole</a>&nbsp;alongside his ghetto bravado, but the ridiculously child-like delivery of the chorus ultimately kills the song. Jaheim gets real on ""What You Think Of That"" where he describes realizing the True essence of a woman who was disrespected and unappreciated by a fool who didn't know what he had. ""Make A Wish"" is a smooth yet simple song about giving his girl whatever she wants and dreams of having, something every woman wishes were True! The album closes with the tender cut ""Back Together Again,"" a tribute to his parents who are now reunited in Heaven. Jaheim took his time with Makings Of A Man, and it truly shows in practically every track. If this doesn't convince the masses that he is the real thing, then this will certainly prove that people don't know True R&B talent when they see it...let alone hear it.","Jaheim came out on the scene pretty strong , selling double platinum with his debut album&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Ghetto - Love / dp / B00005899K / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Ghetto Love</a>&nbsp;and then platinum with&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Still - Ghetto / dp / B00006WKYJ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Still Ghetto</a > .

"" Jaheim lays it down with "" Hush , "" a song about keeping an affair with a homie 's girl on the low . "" Have You Ever "" rides out with strong background vocals , simple piano work , and lyrics about speculating on what could have been and rethinking what has already been done . "" Lonely "" is a reworking of&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Bobby - Womack / dp / B00004SATU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Bobby Womack</a > 's "" If You Think You 're Lonely Now , "" using the infamous hook for the song but changing the lyrics to reflect Jaheim 's own tale of scooping up the next girl and her man is the one sitting at home all alone ! "" Life of a Thug "" is a depiction of Jaheim 's life in the form of an autobiographical song , describing all the trials and tribulations that he 's faced over the years and his ultimate redemption from those trying times . He questions why a lover does n't realize a good man when he 's right in your face on the song "" Just Do n't Have A Clue . "" For the track "" She Ai n't You , "" Jaheim borrows the melody and background from&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/The - Delphonics / dp / B000EMGJTK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">The Delphonics</a > ' classic "" La La Means I Love You "" for another reworking where he talks about his former girl still having his heart and wishing he could still be with her instead of anyone he 's been with since losing her . Jaheim hangs up his player status for the love of his life on the album 's lead - off single "" Never . "" "" I 've Changed "" features the dynamic rawness of&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Keyshia - Cole / dp / B000VDDCHO / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Keyshia Cole</a>&nbsp;alongside his ghetto bravado , but the ridiculously child - like delivery of the chorus ultimately kills the song . Jaheim gets real on "" What You Think Of That "" where he describes realizing the True essence of a woman who was disrespected and unappreciated by a fool who did n't know what he had . "" Make A Wish "" is a smooth yet simple song about giving his girl whatever she wants and dreams of having , something every woman wishes were True ! The album closes with the tender cut "" Back Together Again , "" a tribute to his parents who are now reunited in Heaven . Jaheim took his time with Makings Of A Man , and it truly shows in practically every track . If this does n't convince the masses that he is the real thing , then this will certainly prove that people do n't know True R&B talent when they see it ... let alone hear it ."

AGAMDS21PJZPK,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"It took awhile for Jaheim's 1st video to grow on me.  I would see ""Could It Be"" quite often on BET and finally after awhile the track began to grow on me.  Eventually, I picked up Jaheim's 1st CD entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghetto-Love/dp/B00005899K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghetto Love</a>.  My favorite tracks included ""Looking For Love"", ""Ghetto Love"", ""Just In Case"", ""Anything"" w/Next and ""Ready Willing & Able"".  His debut was definitely strong despite there being some filler amongst the 21 tracks.  His 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Still-Ghetto/dp/B00006WKYJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Still Ghetto</a>&nbsp;got a tremendous push because of the 1st single ""Fabolous"" that was an anthem dedicated to the young kids that are growing up in this crazy world.  My favorite tracks ended up being ""Diamond In Da Ruff"", ""Let's Talk About It"", ""Beauty & Thug"" w/Mary J. Blige, ""Long As I Live"" and ""Me & My B____"".  In 2006 Jaheim released his 3rd disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghetto-Classics/dp/B000BJ7CCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghetto Classics</a>.  The 1st single was ""Everytime I Think About Her"" w/Jadakiss and my other favorites included ""The Chosen One"", ""Like A DJ"", ""Masterpiece"", ""Conversation"" and ""Come Over"".

Just as review ""Musac Critic"" stated, Jaheim's 4th release, ""The Makings Of A Man"" has Jaheim playing it safe for the most part.  The 1st track ""Voice Of R&B"" is an introduction to r&b listeners who may not be too familiar with Jaheim's work outside of the singles that everyone has heard.  The track clocks in at less than 3 minutes and is a short but sweet track for Jaheim fans.  ""Hush"" is produced by R Kelly and has Jaheim describing a situation where he unintentionally started messin' around with a female that he knew was with a guy that he knew.  Jaheim blames it on having a couple of drinks but now that the 1st time was so good, he is trying to figure out how they can keep things going without the guy finding out.  ""Have You Ever"" is right along the lines of ""Fabolous"" as Jaheim is reminiscing to events that happened in the past when he was younger.  You hear the familiar Kaygee sound that you heard on ""Ghetto Love"" as well.  ""Lonely"" has Jaheim employing his own concept to the Bobby Womack classic ""If You Think You're Lonely Now"".  The chrous stays the same but Jaheim adds his own lyrics to the verses and the other parts of the song.  This is definitely one of my favorite tracks on this CD.  ""Life Of A Thug"" will be one of those songs that if you heard Jaheim's 1st 3 CDs that you have heard before.  However, you will still want to listen to the track in its entirety.  He talks about how his dad passed when he was 2 so all that he knew were the streets growing up despite having the guidance of his mom.  My personal favorite track on ""The Makings Of A Man"" is ""Just Don't Have A Clue"".  Babyface shows up to produce a nice midtempo jam using acoustic guitars and various other elements.  Jaheim is trying to tell the lady that he is with that she has no idea about the plans that he has for her in the future as long as she realzies that he should be the one and only one for her.  He states that he is better than the guys that she is use to so she shouldn't be afraid to give her all in the relationship.  ""She Ain't You"" has Jaheim talking about a woman that isn't girlfriend that treats him better than his actual girlfriend does.  He even says that the particular girl's love is like a Bentley Coup and his girlfriend's love is like a Mercedes Benz that's been used.  OUCH!..lol  ""She Ain't You"" is another nice midtempo jam.  ""Never"" is the lead single and serves that purpose well.  Jaheim talks about resisting the temptation of love before because he didn't want to turn in his player card.  However, after meeting this particular woman, that he is ready to burn the infamous black book.  Keyshia Cole, who is 3 singles into her sophomore disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Like-You/dp/B000VDDCHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Like You</a>, joins Jaheim on ""I've Changed"".  Kaygee employs a nice sample in Atlantic Starr's ""Let's Get Closer"" and creates a nice uptempo jam for the prince and princess of ""ghetto love r&b.""  If you are a fan of either artist then this just might be your favorite track on this CD.  ""What You Think Of That"" is another one of my favorites as Jaheim talks about how his ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" is making him feel.  He's not really caring about what the world thinks about the relationship and he is happy to have her in his life.  ""Make A Wish"" is a midtempo jam that has Jaheim wanting to treat his woman to a nice time since it's her birthday and ""Back Together Again"" is a nice song that talks about how his dad and mom are together again in heaven since they both left the Earth to soon.

If your purchased ""The Makings Of A Man"" at Circuit City then you were blessed with 2 bonus tracks in ""Roster"" and ""Keep It 100"".  ""Roster"" is the better track as the Kaygee produced track will remind you of ""Just In Case"" from ""Ghetto Love"" and ""Like A DJ"" from ""Ghetto Classics"".  ""Keep It 100"" isn't a bad track, but you will clearly be able to tell why it was a bonus track.

Overall, if this is your 1st introduction to a Jaheim CD, I wouldn't expect you to be a big fan of this CD.  However, if you have followed Jaheim since ""Ghetto Love"" then you will enjoy Volume 4 of Jaheim's ghetto classic series.  He has a nice voice and you already know the type of songs that you are going to get from Jaheim so you shouldn't be surprised by the material.  If you liked ""Ghetto Love"", ""Still Ghetto"" and ""Ghetto Classics"", then you should also own ""The Makings Of A Man"".

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"First of all, I consider Jaheim to be one of the standout male R&B singers of our time.  Unfortunately for Ja, he hasn't found commercial success easily. Sure, GHETTO LOVE and STILL GHETTO went platinum, but it took time and airplay. Last year's GHETTO CLASSICS landed Jaheim in the top spot of the Billboard Chart yet it only went gold (and its chart stay was brief as well)and none of his excellent singles made a splash at radio.  Sad considering ""Everytime I Think About Her"" and ""The Chosen One"" were both fine songs, among Jaheim's most soulful. This time around, Jaheim lands at Atlantic and the difference is noticeable.  Sure, Jaheim sounds as refined yet soulful at the same time, but the production doesn't feel as bombastic or bright as it did on last year's GHETTO CLASSICS.  It's not a bad thing, but despite this album being as consistent as any Jaheim album, it at times feels too safe and reserved. Vocally Jaheim is refined and never overdoes melisma, but you sometimes wish Jaheim would give just a bit more.

The material is overall fine, but a bit safe. The opening ""Voice of R&B"" has a nice vintage soul feel to it with the horns and 1970s feeling production. Jaheim still possesses his street-savvy persona here despite the soulful underlying production.  On ""Hush"", Jaheim gets his R. Kelly on (literally), though it isn't a complete successin my eyes.  Sure, Ja pulls it off pretty good, but I think Jaheim is better suited with soul-samples and vintage production work - nothing against Kells. It's not bad though, just different. ""Have You Ever"" and ""Lonely"" start to really heat things up while ""Life of a Thug"" truly brings the heat with its wah-wah clavinets, strings, and synthesized horn production.

""You Just Don't Get It"" isn't bad, though the highlights that follow are incredible.  ""She Ain't You"" is absolutely beautiful and is my personal favorite.  ""Never"" is a bit subtle, but maybe it is the subtlety that makes it so great. Jaheim vocal control is phenomenal here.  ""I've Changed"" features an as of late ubiquitous Keyshia Cole and proves to be solid as does ""What You Think of That"".  ""Make A Wish"" and ""Back Together Again"" are solid as well, if not as exceptional as the aforementioned best (""Have You Ever"", ""Life of a Thug"", ""She Ain't You"", ""Never"", and ""You've Changed"".

Overall, THE MAKINGS OF A MAN is Ja's fourth consistent effort.  Again, the material is good but safe in a couple of cases.  This isn't a bland effort, but it is even less ornate than GHETTO CLASSICS and there is no ""Could It Be"" this time around.  With that said, there are enough solid numbers to make this album overall enjoyable. 4 stars Ja.","First of all , I consider Jaheim to be one of the standout male R&B singers of our time .

A9Q28YTLYREO7,B001232NP4,-1,-1,2,"Jaheim is a Cat with a top tier strong voice, problem is the lyrical content and the fact he doesn't have anybody to push his vocal boundarys. he aspires to be the Teddy Pendergrass/Luther Vandross, Johnny Gill  of his Generation, but alot of the material he gets is making him more closer to Christopher Wiliams a vocalist who had a good range,but was stuck doing generic watered down takes on songs that were out or just doing hooks. I like the R.Kelly Produced ""Hush"" and a Jaheim vocally brings it, but the material he gets is hurting him and he seems to be headed toward the same path as Dave Holister another strong Voice Soul Brother who never got the right songs to compliment his overall range.","Jaheim is a Cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the lyrical content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal boundarys . he aspires to be the Teddy Pendergrass / Luther Vandross , Johnny Gill   of his Generation , but alot of the material he gets is making him more closer to Christopher Wiliams a vocalist who had a good range , but was stuck doing generic watered down takes on songs that were out or just doing hooks .

A17814AD8EWTN4,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"See with Jaheim, ive noticed the man can not make bad music. Every album he has put out has been at least good, and excellent at his best. And that continues with Makings of A Man. I think Ja made a good choice in switching record labels and going to Atlantic, because at Warner he wasn't getting any promotion. This was the first time i had to go to 2 different stores to find the damn album, because they were sold out at the first store. Jaheim is a breath of fresh air in the state of R&B right now. Because most of the R&B being put out right now revolves around Sex, partying, and drugs. And some of that is ok in small doses but to make a whole album around that gets old real fast. But Ja knows how to balance his albums between Love & Sex. He doesnt over do it on this album, along with any of his other albums. But the biggest thing that i think helped him in the move to Atlantic, was that it introduced him to some new and better producers. This is the first time a Ja album has actually had a more contempary feel to it. Like the stellar Babyface written ""Just Don't Get It"", this is totally different than the Ja we are used to. This song totally sounds like it could be on the radio. Excellent track. Like on the R. Kelly produced ""Hush"" where Ja reminices about how he had an affair with his best friends girl. This album is alot different sounding than his previous albums, but its a good thing. While ""Never"" could possibly be played at weddings, he can still do songs that the thugs can feel to like ""Life of a Thug"". And the other thing that i really like about this album (This might sound weird), is that he released it in December. Which in my opinion is the perfect time for him to release an album because in winter, i always find myself listening to his albums. I don't know what it is but during the winter his music just does it for me when i am driving around. Not that during the summer or whatever i don't like him, but during the winter i always make sure to have at least one of his albums in the car with me at all times. I think it could be his just smooth but jagged vocals that just warms the air during the winter that makes his music so attractive during the winter season. And we all know Ja can blow, unless you are new to Ja, now is the perfect time to introduce yourself. And this album will be in heavy rotation for quite some time because it is just as good as his previous albums, if not better. Another hit for Jaheim... as usual!

You've heard about Christmas trees, Christmas presents, Christmas breakups, Christmas chaos, and in fact, you've heard just about everything, until now. A charity single, and Rob Thomas' first solo work (a whole lot better than most of his later stuff), this song sings a hymn for peace and goodwill toward men, that's not up in your face, unlike Mr. Lennon, and also unlike Lennon, there's no anti-war message! Nope, this song is a sincere piece of work, and one of Thomas' best. And unlike his later work, it builds toward something grand, and when it comes to the chorus, it soars in a magical fashion that can only happen at Christmas.

A3G10NPD661EQD,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"""Saturate Before Using"", ""Late For The Sky"" and this album (and I suppose ""Runnin' On Empty"" too although I've yet to hear it - I can't imagine it would be bad, though) are ESSENTIAL albums to ANY music fan. EVERYTHING about these albums is perfect - the production, lyrics, musicianship, singing...etc. This makes perfect sense as Jackson was notoriously worried about getting everything perfect in the studio (and his producers rightfully got annoyed at him for that). This paid off in spades, however, as everything is crystal clear and perfect even though this was recorded in the late 60's! A cool little addition is that the first and second as well as the 9th and 10th songs flow into one another (very cool). The lyrics, as always, are extremely quotable, deep and meaningful - pretty much second only to Bob Dylan. Unlike Dylan, though, the lyrics are, like title of the album, ""For Everyman"". As opposed to ""Saturate Before Using"" and ""Late For The Sky"", ""For Everyman"" is the more consistent album - there aren't any ""bad"" songs (not that the other two had bad songs, a bunch just weren't as good as the highlights). Another cool addition is the first track, ""Take It Easy"", which is the original song which The Eagles then made into a monster hit with their cover version. If you were unsure whether you liked Jackson before, buy this album and you'll become a fan! For $9.00 this is a STEAL! Absolutely recommended!

ALR35EFI69S5R,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"This is an album for `everyman"", the definitive statement by Jackson Browne of his disturbing and apocalyptic view of contemporary society, and his hopes and fears for its future. It is also a lovely, stirring, and  evocative song cycle that illuminates Jackson Browne's unique vocal and  instrumental arrangements, and sends one running for the door to buy more  of the albums of the early ""JB"" variety. My personal favorites on this  wonderful album are ""Our Lady of the Well"", a interesting and fetching  suggestion of Browne's social and political concerns blended with a  celebration of the common rural peasantry of Latin America, ""Take It Easy""  written with Glenn Frye of the Eagles and recorded by both Browne and the  Eagles, ""These Times You've Come"" about an old pair of lovers who still see  each other romantically after parting, and of course, the combination song  cycle of ""Sing My Songs"" and ""For Everyman"", which like ""The Deluge"" on  another album, sets out Browne's fear of a pending eco-disaster and  apocalypse. Browne is still around, still creative, and still as socially  and politically outspoken, but this is one of his best early albums, when  he was one of the most talented and creative young folk-rock luminaries on  the popular scene, a superstar a long time in the making.  This is a  `must-have' album for any real fan of Browne's music and for anyone just  interested in top-shelf folk-rock music by one of the seventies and  eighties greatest popular artists.","This is an album for ` everyman "" , the definitive statement by Jackson Browne of his disturbing and apocalyptic view of contemporary society , and his hopes and fears for its future .

A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.

1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  ""Reach"" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.
2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.
3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.
4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.
5) 2 Find U: Weak.
6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.
7) Doin' Fine: ""We are what everyone wants to be.""  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.
8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is ""spells"" the song title...).
9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.
10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.
11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.
12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.
13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).
14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own ""becoming"" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.

As you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to ""This Way"") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.","I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel ... and how would that work out ?

A3NPBG9YE84S63,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Jewel was at the very tail end of her 20s in 2003 when her fourth album ""0304"" was released.  But the photos that adorn the CD's layout -- oh my!  She is more gorgeous and youthful in them than girls 10 years her minor.  She has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world in fact.  She is the living definition of ""young and smart and sexy,"" to use the catchphrase she coined for this album.

OK, so I've just now been open about my admiration for Jewel's looks, but the question is, does she have the music to back it up?  The answer is an unequivocal ""yes.""

Some reviewers considered ""0304"" to be something of a misstep for the Alaskan born singer/songwriter, but I believe this to be one of her best albums.  The opener ""Stand"" is a classic.  It always brings me back to the first times that I heard this CD.  One of her best ever.  It and the other songs here demonstrate Jewel's knack for making odd references in her lyrics (see also the one to Charlie Sheen in ""Intuition"") that put a smile on the listener's face and make for memorable songs.  Beyond that, I love ""Leave the Lights On,"" a slower and more laid back track.  One thing that was new to Jewel's sound on this release was the use of electronica to create numbers tailor-made for any dance hall, something some fans of her past, more folkish tunes didn't take well to.  I for one love it.  Some of my favorite tracks here are the lesser known ones stacked at the end that are great for dancing or exercising to.  I mean, you just can't get more catchy than songs like ""Yes U Can,"" ""U & Me = Love,"" and the rousing track where Jewel demonstrates her love for her home country, ""America.""  Excellent stuff.

There is actually not one weak track or moment of filler here though and Jewel sustains the listener's interest for the 53 minute duration of the CD, as only Jewel can, all the while proudly wearing her femininity and sex appeal on her sleeve.  The only reason I'm rating this album just shy of five stars is I liked the 2006 follow-up ""Goodbye Alice in Wonderland"" even slightly better.  Still, if you want to feel young and smart and sexy no matter what age you are, Jewel will show you how on ""0304.""  Highly recommended.","Jewel was at the very tail end of her 20s in 2003 when her fourth album "" 0304 "" was released .

Standout tracks include: the gorgeous, Sweet Temptation, the rock-out anthem, America, the sensitive, 2 Find U, and the first single, Intuition. Some of the tracks obviously do not measure up like U plus me equals love, very silly and repetitive, Stand is awkward but has cool lyrics, and the closing song Becoming is just plain boring. But i still give this album a high rating because i love Jewel, her writing, and her raspy and lovely voice. The best song of the whole bunch is track number nine, Haunted.

""Stand"" (take a stand) is like some time tunnel idea from when music counted for something, set to a sleazy bar beat that holds the counterbalancing darkness.  We haven't had an artist who could popularize stuff like this in a while.

And there hasn't been so much hidden in lyrics since people tried playing Beatles records backwards.  Consider that ""Intuition,"" seems to be ""follow your heart"" inspiration, all mushy stuff you'd be proud to sing in church, when suddenly a stacatto vocal riff breaks in with ""just cash in, sell yourself.""

There are two striking examples of subliminal change of the apparent message by the silencing of a ""t"" at the end of a word.  In ""Leave The Lights On"" the rhythm makes it impossible to pronounce the ""t"" in ""can't"" so what we actually hear is ""you can try my love, you can buy my love"" instead of ""you can't buy my love.""

The second one is in ""Yes U Can.""  The first time the ""t"" in ""boots"" does come through, but after that it sounds like ""b"".  This one will get my review censored if I spell it out here, and maybe that's why she wrote the lyrics that way, to get past the WalMart censors?  The albumn does NOT have an explicit lyrics rating.  But the ""boots"" are bumpin'.  Apparently it worked.

A2HIL1IWWD2WEA,B001237HCI,-1,-1,2,Very slick pop album. One notable exception is a great song about a stalker called Haunted. This song is a keeper. It's nice to finally have a CD burner.,Very slick pop album . One notable exception is a great song about a stalker called Haunted . It 's nice to finally have a CD burner .
A24P8BEJ26FU01,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"Jewel Kilcher was always known for her meaningful lyrics and acoustic song stylings so it was no surprise that she would be labeled a ""sell-out"" once she switched things up at all. No one knows quite why Jewel decided to switch styles though many assume it was to crossover to the mainstream and sell more. Jewel's fourth album ""0304"" takes a more electronica/dance approach than its guitar-driven predecessors though the lyrical quality is still there. The even weirder thing was that at the time of this album's release, June 2003, the big dance-pop bang from the late 90's and even 2000/2001 was over which suggests that this wasn't exactly an attempt to ride the latest trends. Jewel was never known for doing what was trendy and this is no exception.

The album starts off with the social commentary song entitled ""Stand"". The song comments on numerous topics including policemen stealing and the mayor having no money because he spent it on ""hookers and hash"". The lyrics seem to be trying to say that we can make a stand against all these problems. Next up is the first evidence of Jewel's new style, ""Run 2 U"". Everything from the internet-style writing in the title (numbers instead of words) to the dance beat in the background takes listeners away from what they thought a Jewel song should be but to me, it still works. The song is catchy enough that it will stick in your head but still maintains Jewel's usual meaningful lyrics (""I need you for dark reasons, for greed and lust...""). Thirdly. We have the first single ""Intuition"" which seems to almost be a parody of the pop music scene. The lyrics are not quite as deep as people are used to from Jewel however it is one of those meaningful yet catchy songs that gives its message as it gets stuck in your head. While it is good to dance to, it still maintains the positive message of following your heart.

Next is ""Leave The Lights On"" which is the first lyrically poor song on the album. I love the way Jewel's voice sounds in the verses of the songs but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired especially since we know Jewel can do much better. (""If you want my love, you can try my love, you can't buy my love""). It's catchy and Jewel sounds good in it, but she can do better. The song after, ""2 Find U"" reminds me of ""Standing Still"" (especially in the chorus) but that is not really a bad thing. The chorus is vocally good but lyrically weak. The verses are lyrically much better. Next is ""Fragile Heart"", another love-themed song. It is probably closest to Jewel's former style, but while it is a nice song on its own, it seems very out of place on this album. Maybe it would have sounded better on an album with more songs of a similar style.  After that is ""Doin' Fine"" which is also quite poor lyrically as well as a somewhat clichd theme (that her and her man are doing fine). This song is average at best and fails to really stand out.

Then comes ""2 Become 1"", and it is quite obvious what this song is about. Lyrically, it is mediocre and could have been much better. Jewel sounds very sweet in this song and this is probably my favourite song vocally, however in the grand scheme of things it is mostly average. Next up is ""Haunted"" which is told from the point of view of a stalker (similar to Sarah Mclachlan's ""Possesion""). This song returns to the lyrical quality that listeners expect from Jewel though vocally it reminds me of Tori Amos. It is an essentially eerie-sounding song that is bound to creep out some listeners. Afterwards is ""Sweet Temptation"" which seems like a better version of ""2 Become 1"". They both talk about the same subject however ""Sweet Temptation"" is much better both vocally and lyrically. This song is also much more catchy and memorable than ""2 Become 1"".

The next song, ""Yes U Can"" is probably one of the weakest on the album and is merely a typical dance track that nearly any singer could have done. Lyrically, it is not even up to Jewel's usual standards (""Would you like to come along? Then shut up and sing this song""). While it is a catchy, danceable song, it does not seem like a song that Jewel would or should be doing. ""U & Me = Love"" is no better, either vocally or lyrically. I understand that Jewel is trying to branch out to a different style however she would be better off with quality songs like ""Intuition"" and ""Stand"" than this song or the one before it. After that is ""America"", which is obviously another social commentary. Unfortunately, while I appreciate what Jewel was trying to do with this song, it did not work out too well. The lyrics are quite weak (""The Osbournes and Anna Nicole are too freaky to tell"") and the vocals are fairly standard. Lastly is ""Becoming"" which has better lyrics but really does not stand out too much. It is not in any way bad except maybe it was poorly placed.

Overall Mark: 3/5

While most fans were outraged when Jewel released this album, she actually has some decent dance songs that prove she's capable of other styles. This album could have been really great if Jewel had stuck with infusing meaningful lyrics to dance beats (as with ""Stand"" and ""Intuition""). Unfortunately, towards the second half of the album, Jewel ends up using mediocre lyrics that any dance artist could have done. Up until ""Fragile Heart"", the album was exceptionally well done for what it was supposed to be (meaningful dance music) though it faltered in a lot of places after that. Generally though, it is a pretty good dance album and much catchier than anything Jewel's done before.","Jewel Kilcher was always known for her meaningful lyrics and acoustic song stylings so it was no surprise that she would be labeled a "" sell - out "" once she switched things up at all .

AO3VO3TW1CCJP,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"I was hesitant to buy this album because I hadn't heard too many good things about it. For one, the Amazon.com review said, ""Why pick on a girl for taking a chance?"" Why would anyone pick on her? This is a great album that takes her Jewelness to a new level. Her lyrics, while mostly pertaining to love, are still hers in the sense that she puts poetic thought into them. She also has some great message-bearing songs, and then just some fun ones with no need for substance!
""Stand"" is the first song and is a great way to kick off the album. It talks about the sadness of the world we live in, how some poor people spend money on drugs and alcohol, there's a lot of violence, and other horrible things. She also mentions how we can come together and make a change!
I really liked ""2 Find U"" because it talked about the problems of relationships. Though there are mistakes that we make with our boyfriend or girlfriend, we have two choices when fights or things like that happen: 1) we can let the pain win and walk away forever, or 2) we can give eachother a clean slate & start over. Jewel asks for a clean slate in this song, it's very bittersweet.
Her voice is so cutesy in ""Fragile Heart,"" it's funny! She uses simple sentences and the childlike sound of her voice makes it amusing to me: ""If you want my heart, you have to promise not to tear it apart, 'cause my heart has been hurt a lot."" It's a cautionary song letting someone know she's had lots of pain in the past and doesn't want that now.
I must say that ""Haunted"" gave me goosebumps when I first heard it, and still does!!! Though Jewel's liner notes say it's about a stalker (which makes sense if you look at the lyrics), I like to think it's a very dark song about someone who Jewel wants revenge against. She describes how she will ""come to you in the still of the night"" and ""crush you with the burden of sight."" The music is very creepy and slick, adding to the frightful feel of the song. There's also a little clock ticking in the background, making it all the more paranoid and intense! Remind me not to make her mad! :-)
""Yes U Can"" is a song that really doesn't have much meat to it lyrically, but is very fun to listen to! It describes a club scene with cowboys and 'naughty girls.' It's tongue-in-cheek I think, kind of playing on words and stuff. Very good song!
I think ""America"" might be my favorite song on this album. It talks about the imperfections of our country, from the fact that our president wants us to 'shed blood in the name of liberty' to the deteriorating quality of TV shows. She doesn't just blast America, though, she admits that although she wants to change it she wouldn't leave it if she could.
Yes, Jewel's sound is altered here on this electronic album. But don't think it's crap because of that; like I said, in my opinion it enhances her greatness. Though there are some very computerized songs, there are also ones that are closer to her acoustic style on ""This Way."" I would strongly encourage every Jewel fan to give this album an honest listen! I think it'll be worth it!","I was hesitant to buy this album because I had n't heard too many good things about it .

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"Jewel Kilcher's recent musical and style change is perhaps the biggest public makeover in years. Once she was a guitar-strumming folk girl. Now she's reinvented herself as the American Kylie Minogue with ""0304,"" a catchy but overpolished collection of dance-pop songs.
The more philosophical side of Jewel seems to linger in the slow-paced ""Stand"" (""It's a shame there's no one to blame/for all the pain that life brings...""). But that vanishes with the wispy ""Run 2 U"" and pale ""2 Find U,"" both colorless dance tunes. Some of the necessary verve and power reappears with the catchy ""Intuition,"" bouncy USA-themed song ""America,"" and shimmying ""Yes U Can."" A more gothic sensibility surfaces in the distorted, ominous ""Haunted.""
Nobody expects dance-pop to be deep -- all it has to be is catchy. And ""0304"" isn't deep. It's just a collection of mid-level dance music, with mediocre lyrics, acceptable vocals and packaged electronic pop music. We've seen it all before, but Jewel's offering isn't bad. Instead, it just fails to be really good.
When you hear Jewel's voice, you can tell that all the flaws have been scrupulously polished out. In past albums, her voice had minor imperfections. No more. It's not an exceptional voice, but neither is it bad; it's suited for the dance music she produces here, which isn' too taxing.  Musically, it can't be denied that ""0304"" is very catchy. Jewel flavors the dance-pop with hints of jazz (the accordion in ""Intuition"") and replaces her acoustic guitars with electric and bass. Okay, the acoustic guitars are still there, but good luck finding them.
Unfortunately the songs are essentially empty. Jewel has a good ear for rhythm and rhyme, but there's nothing really interesting about these songs. They're just ordinary dance-pop. (""If u want my love/u can try my love/u can't buy my love/just take my hand"") The only exceptions to this are ""Stand"" and the sinister, stalker theme song ""Haunted."" Ironically, these two are the best of this album.
""0304"" may prove to be a mixed blessing for Jewel. It's catchy and danceable but essentially empty.

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"So I approached Jewel's ""0304"" album with an open mind, knowing full well that the days of ""Who Will Save Your Soul"" are long behind us. It's not the out-right ""bad"" album that I had feared, but it's also not a ""classic"" by any stretch of the imagination.
""0304"" (14 tracks, 53 min.) starts of nicely with ""Stand"", with its light-beat dance rhythms. ""Run 2 U"" and ""Intuition"" follow along the same vein, and then it starts to set it: the songs all sound pretty much the same! Oh no! That's the trouble with an album that goes on WAY too long, it all starts sounding the same. Admittedly, there are a couple of outstanding tracks: the dramatic (and non-dance) ""Haunted"", and the name-dropping and culture-referencing ""America"".
Overall, this is an average, somewhat bland album. What surprises me is that in the liner notes, Jewel writes that this album is ""the first record I enjoy listening to"", which in a way is a put-down to all the fans that have loved her earlier albums.

A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"Firstly, I am a huge Jewel fan.  She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever.  At first, I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering.  The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general.  But let's not give up on Jewel so quickly.  I admit, I don't like the first single from 0304 ""Intuition"" because it is rather forgetful pop (and won't go down as a classic), but you cannot deny that it appealed to many younger people.  The second single ""Stand"" really appeals to me, on the other hand.  It is a very catchy song, and while it is not traditional Jewel, it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there. And at the end of the day, isn't that what is important about a singer?  To be able to re-invent themself from time to time?  Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it.  I consider ""0304"" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different.  She never said she wouldn't go back to her traditional style in the future.  Unfortunately at the moment, folk type music isn't that popular ... so that's another reason why Jewel is trying something different.

""0304"" is Jewel in 2003.  It's not the classic of ""pieces of you"" or ""Spirit"", but it's not as vile as many reviewers have stated.","Firstly , I am a huge Jewel fan . She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever . At first , I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering . The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general .   But let 's not give up on Jewel so quickly . I admit , I do n't like the first single from 0304 "" Intuition "" because it is rather forgetful pop ( and wo n't go down as a classic ) , but you can not deny that it appealed to many younger people . The second single "" Stand "" really appeals to me , on the other hand . It is a very catchy song , and while it is not traditional Jewel , it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there . And at the end of the day , is n't that what is important about a singer ? To be able to re - invent themself from time to time ? Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it . I consider "" 0304 "" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different . She never said she would n't go back to her traditional style in the future . Unfortunately at the moment , folk type music is n't that popular ... so that 's another reason why Jewel is trying something different .

A37T9RGKM9RF37,B001237HCI,1,-1,1,"so i read the reviews on here, which i rarely trust anyways, and i decided to get the cd.  (even though i HATE intuition) Lyrically, this IS a bit like her previous albums.  They COMPLETELY butchured her voice though, and made most of it a Dance album...that's what REALLY pissed me off about this album.  Jewel was PERFECT the way she was. and she sounds WAY better on her previous albums, and live.  what was ORIGINAL about her was how u could hear her putting feel into her songs with her vocal capacity.  this all sounds the same and no vocal range at all.  PLEASE all you newcomer jewel fans, pick up one of her EARLIER albums and you will see why us REAL jewel fans hate this cd so much.  she's throwing away good talent, and good looks.  i liked her look before, now she just looks like a hooker.
but all in all let's pray that jewel went through a phase, and will go back to her original stuff on her next album.  She is still the same old Jewel in concert though, which is good. so maybe there's hope after all!","so i read the reviews on here , which i rarely trust anyways , and i decided to get the cd .

A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"I admit I was among those that were struck as if by a lighting when I saw the video for ""Intuition"" a while back: ""She sold out!"" thoughts crossed my mind... ""I'm so dissapointed!"" I thought, until a friend told me I had to really listen to the album, so I just did.
Though I am not terribly in love with the whole album (it's sure more pop than most of her past efforts, and it has no shortage of 'catchy' tunes), the nonconventional lyrics are still there, at times, hiding disguised behind songs with teenage-like names, such as ""2 Find U"". The truth is that after the fact, the whole album makes you think twice as to her original purpose with ""Intuition"", the song/video that has stigmatized her so much.
But yes! As a whole, it's not tough to see that most of the songs are geared toward a more teenage audience, rather than the one that grew through College listening to her earlier work, but there's a few songs for those of us that are in the latter category, such as the very Alanis-like ""Haunted"" (in fact, it's such an appropriate song to play out loud on a Halloween night like tonight) and the clever ""America"". Falling somewhere in between the preferences of the two groups lies the closing track, ""Becoming"" which I particularly loved.

It's not really all that different from the direction she had seemed to be taking with ""This Way."" Remember ""Serve the Ego?"" Remember ""Standing Still?"" The tracks from ""0304"" aren't all that different. The production is just taken up a notch. Obviously Jewel has done something right because of the first single ""Intuition"" has become her biggest radio hit since ""Hands"" back in '98.
""Inuition"" is definitely one of the star tracks of the album. Jewel has taken her lyrics and put them to a great pop beat and sound. ""Run 2 U"" is a stand-out also and is very catchy. My personal favorite *at least as of now* is ""Fragile Heart."" It's a light-hearted ballad and would make a great single. This is the Jewel I love! *who couldn't love that whistle?* ""Leave the Lights On"" and ""Haunted"" are the most unique songs and have a love/hate style about them. If you liked ""Standing still"" from ""This Way"" then you'll probably like ""Doin' Fine."" ""Yes U Can"" is definitely another potential single. Like ""Intuition,"" it's a dance track *originally written for Santana* but I'm glad Jewel got to do it. This would be a great club single. ""2 Become 1"" is a love song similar to the title track from ""This Way."" It's a beautiful song as are all of Jewel's love songs. ""Yes U Can"" is another fun dance track. ""America"" is a more serious track with some ear-catching lyrics.
Don't knock Jewel for wanting to lighten up and experiment with her music. True fans would respect her for wanting to try different styles. And who cares about her image change? So she's wearing a dress...get over it! She's hot, let her have her fun. The music's great.

AQ75S7221N12Z,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Overall this is a good album, not superb or great, but very good. INTUITION the single is excellent, and the remix CD Single is also recommended. Being at the top of the dance chart means the majority think the same way.
The other cuts such as ""Stand"" and ""America"" are also very good.
For those that think (or don't think at all), that this is a ""sudden"" change obviously have not heard 'Serve The Ego' or its remixes from about a year ago. Another dance chart topper, this album CONTINUES the trend that was already beginning on her last album. Check out the ""Serve The Ego"" mixes, those are excellent.
I love to hear people say ""she sold out"", ""she has changed"" and other assorted basic critical comments. Does that sound familiar? Remember the Bob Dylan as he went electric? The Beatles going Sgt Pepper? Sheena Easton doing ""Strut"". Are we saying Madonna did not change???Toni Braxton? The list goes on and on. Even Nsync changed! Those who refuse to change or cannot accept change are living in the past.
I can accept opinions of those who just don't like the music, that is fine, ok, and thats an example of how people have differing tastes, but just to say 'Sell out sell out"" to me  means  ""Grow...change..that is life"". The only acts and artists that sound the same always are at oldie shows. I applaud her willingness to try to stretch her considerable range and talent. Its still there and shows on this CD,
The album is good, has a few outstanding songs, 1 great song in ""Intuition"", and is a 3 to 4 star CD.  Its is not ""Hands"" or ""Pieces of You"" but is not supposed to be. I think its worth a listen, and the opinion of how good it is is yours. Do not be steered by people who do not like change. Treat it as a ""new"" sound and listen. Its your money, and the choice is yours. Like art, there is no ""absolute"" just opinions. Good Listening!","Overall this is a good album , not superb or great , but very good .

Another dance chart topper , this album CONTINUES the trend that was already beginning on her last album . Check out the "" Serve The Ego "" mixes , those are excellent . I love to hear people say "" she sold out "" , "" she has changed "" and other assorted basic critical comments . Does that sound familiar ? Remember the Bob Dylan as he went electric ? Sheena Easton doing "" Strut "" . Are we saying Madonna did not change???Toni Braxton ? Even Nsync changed ! Those who refuse to change or can not accept change are living in the past . I can accept opinions of those who just do n't like the music , that is fine , ok , and that s an example of how people have differing tastes , but just to say ' Sell out sell out "" to me   means   "" Grow ... change .. The only acts and artists that sound the same always are at oldie shows . I applaud her willingness to try to stretch her considerable range and talent . Its still there and shows on this CD , 
 The album is good , has a few outstanding songs , 1 great song in "" Intuition "" , and is a 3 to 4 star CD . Its is not "" Hands "" or "" Pieces of You "" but is not supposed to be . I think its worth a listen , and the opinion of how good it is is yours . Do not be steered by people who do not like change . Treat it as a "" new "" sound and listen . Like art , there is no "" absolute "" just opinions . Good Listening !"
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"Enough with the negative reviews on this cd. It's too different for the hardcore fans, etc., etc. It's too much like Christina Aguilera or Britany Spears, which is inaccurrate. You know, there was a time when a female artist could jump genres of music and receive accolades instead of dismissals. Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner, Cher, Madonna, Annie Lennox, Sinead O'Connor--all were able to shift gears musically, and to me that's a sign of talent, not selling out. Sure, Jewel is finely airbrushed on the cover, the titles are written like Prince tunes (U & Me= Love, Run 2 U, Yes U Can), and the songs are polished to fine pop bliss. I, for one, find this cd to be one of Jewel's finest. She forgoes all the pseudo-serious folk preaching and gets down to business with a cd filled with upbeat tracks instead of her serious ballads. However, she is still writing about serious topics such as social issues in ""Stand"" and ""America"" along with other familiar themes of love such as ""Run 2 U"", ""Fragile Heart"" and ""2 Become 1"". She also deals with letting go and trying new things such as the first single ""Intuition"", which probably flew over most Jewel fans' heads. She even deals with lust on ""Sweet Temptation"", ""U & Me= Love"" and ""Yes U Can"". In fact, there are a number of hits on this disc: ""Stand"", ""Run 2 U"", ""Intuition"", ""Leave The Lights On"", ""2 Find U"", ""Fragile Heart"", ""Sweet Temptation"", ""Yes U Can"", ""America"" & ""Becoming"". The only True miss is the overlong ""Haunted"", which seemed out of place. This new direction is great--a breath of fresh air for Jewel. She sounds like she's having fun and the music represents that spirit. Too many reviewers are taking this cd too seriously. This could be Jewel's ""Thriller"" or ""Hysteria"" or ""No Jacket Required"". If you're looking for intelligent pop (which Aguilera and Spears are not), then pick this up (also if you like the 80's).","Enough with the negative reviews on this cd .

This really depresses me. And this is coming from someone who was never into Jewel in the first place. Has the music industry really come to this?

Granted, this isn't the out-and-out club record that some seem to be mistaking it for--it's not even nearly as cutting edge as the forward-thinking remixes of 'Serve The Ego' that she so effortlessly breezed through.

new members of this club include indie-goddess turned power popster Liz Phair, but that's for another review).  Which is too bad, because this is indeed Jewel's best album--in fact, it's probably the best album Madonna DIDN'T make(and boy, she REALLY didn't make it with that folk-styled drink coaster otherwise known as AMERICAN LIFE).  First single 'Intuition' hints at things to come throughout the set, with a helping hand from Shakira producer Lester Mendez.  'Stand', 'Fragile Heart' and the future club smash 'Run 2 U' all bounce along with enough addictive melodies to forgive the singer for her still overwrought lyrical approach.  And even if she falters somewhat by placing identical-sounding songs in slots ten through thirteen, it overall remains a more than solid musical treat.","Jewel continues to exist in that very small sector of recording artists who manage to musically better themselves with each new release .

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B001237HCI,-1,-1,2,"For some reason, all of Jewel's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews. I actually liked her first three albums, but I wish I could say the same for her latest album, 0304.
I have no idea what's going on with this album. It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying, because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club. Such tracks include ""Run 2 U"" and especially the leadoff single, the R&B-ish ""Intuition"". The music on these songs isn't bad, but it just doesn't sound like Jewel. If she's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once, it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example.
And when I listened to the rest of tracks on here, I noticed they don't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other, thus making you almost wonder if you're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album. ""Becoming"" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first: you or Jewel, and I don't know what possessed her to come up with ""Haunted"". ""2 Find U"" is okay, but I liked it better the first time I heard it, when it was called ""Standing Still"" (or the second time, when it was called ""This Way"").
Another problem here is the lyrics. Songs like ""Fragile Heart"" and especially ""U & Me = Love"" could have been rewritten a few times. I don't know how a party joint got on this album, but ""Yes U Can"" deserves some serious fast-forward button pushing. And can anyone make any sense out of ""Stand""?
I don't know what Jewel was trying to do here, because the album is 54 minutes of confusion. Even the album title is confusing, considering it came out on 0603. Maybe that's not what it means, but regardless, Jewel dropped a major brick with this album.

A1FML9FCUPV6TI,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"So this is Jewel. I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago. Slowly but surely ""Intuition"" grew on me, it's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism. I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to encorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music, showing that it is possible. It's not a sell out either, since this music isn't popular like it was a few years ago. Not to say it's bad by any means. The best track for me is ""2 Find U"", a nice love song. ""Run 2 U"" is another favorite. ""Leave The Lights On"" has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado. ""Haunted"" is another great track here. ""2 Become 1"" is a great love song. The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow's second album, picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics, and including odd pop-culture references and name-dropping along the songs. This is still the same Jewel, just with dance beats. And it is her most enjoyable album yet. Overall fans might be taken aback but with an open mind, people will be sure to enjoy this CD.","So this is Jewel . I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago . Slowly but surely "" Intuition "" grew on me , it 's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism . I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to encorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music , showing that it is possible . It 's not a sell out either , since this music is n't popular like it was a few years ago . Not to say it 's bad by any means . The best track for me is "" 2 Find U "" , a nice love song .

A1NVEW628JUS2Y,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"Move over Britney, now there's something meatier - and I mean that in a good, tasteful way!!!  This album is HOT, plain and simple.  I heard Jewel's new and unique ""Intuition"" on the radio today, and my ears are still trying to adapt!!  Was that really a hip-hop drumbeat I heard?  And is Jewel trying to go the way of Britney, totally cool, totally dance and TOTALLY pop?  Looks like it!!  And I, for one, am enthralled that Jewel is maturing and reaching out to be different.  Let's face it, people, this is a pop world, and to not be pop is to not be cool.  Like the Spice Girls and Madonna of a different age, Jewel is coming to grips with herself and her music through pop, and I, for one....oops, sorry - I just said that...
Well, as I mentioned before, it takes True courage to be yourself and try a different sound.  From what I've heard of this album so far, there's lots of trip-hop, lots of dance, and totally lots of fun POP!!  I'm glad Jewel is no longer an Alaskan hippie, and is instead a girl with a new attitude!!
You go, girl.....the days of your white van are loooong gone!!!!

STAND is the ultimate Jewel song, very reminiscent of WHO WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL? from those early days. RUN 2 U is a really cool upbeat dance track. INTUITION is that cool top 30 hit you've heard lately. Read the lyrics. It's classic Jewel. (I love Ms. J's big butt is boss-who do you think this is about :) LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON is a cool jazz-infused song. Ooh so good and Jewel-like! 2 FIND U is a beautiful poetic ballad. A great new kind of song for Jewel, she sings a beautiful ballad like Celine would only she writes her own. FRAGILE HEART is another beautiful poetic ballad more Jewel-like in the vocal area. DOIN' FINE is a cool upbeat dance record that uses the guitar in a really odd that's different and very interesting. 2 BECOME 1 is an excellent song very beautiful even better done live acoustic but excellent on the album; almost a sequel to 2 FIND U. HAUNTED is easily the coolest song she's ever written. It's truly haunting. I feel like I'm stalking Jewel as I hear it and I feel bad for her, but I can't help myself. SWEET TEMPTATION is a really excellent track, more a rock 'n roll record than a dance record. YES U CAN is a cool upbeat rock record she originally wrote for Santana but he decided not to keep. I'm glad he didn't, her performance is great. Such a cool song! YOU & ME=LOVE is another cool upbeat song. The title is the theme of the song. AMERICA is a thought-provoking dance record about what we do in America, whether it be good things or bad things. She mentions plenty of both, and quite skillfully. BECOMING is a great ballad about Jewel becoming, as she constantly becoming other things. She is young, and she is still a work in progress, and she intends to keep acknowledging that truth.
This is definitely her second best album to PIECES OF YOU. It is better than THIS WAY and SPIRIT only by a little but nevertheless if you get an album better than those two albums that's really saying something. Folks, Jewel is hear to stay, and so is the ever-present guitar on this album. She is blossoming and you can see it in this CD, and she still has her guitar at her side as she's blossoming. It's beautiful to see her blossoming! Get your copy of 0304 and experience the beauty of this CD and a glimpse at a special artist ever-evolving!","I was so excited when I finished this album !

A1XPTVJC8OMM3I,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"There's gonna be some mighty fierce debating going on about this album! The most important thing is to keep an open mind. Indeed, Jewel has traded in her acoustic guitar for a new dance floor sound. Indeed, she looks like an 80's Cyndi Lauper on the cd cover. Yet, the biggest thing Jewel has NOT done is sell out. She may look and sound different, but Jewel has remained True to her heart. She has proven that one doesn't need an acoustic guitar to make meaningful music. At the same time, she proves that rhythmic music can be very meaningful as well. Anyone who has listened to the lyrics of 'Intuition' carefully has already figured this out. Jewel is mocking commercialism and materialism! Or, making political and societal statements (if you will). Is this really so different from what she has done in the past? The 'Intuition' video is the biggest mockery of all! The video displays Jewel: The Actress. The songs 'U & Me = Love' and '2 Become 1' follow, lyrically, in the tradition of Jewel's 1996 mega hit 'You were meant for me.' 'America' is yet another song where Jewel discusses the many aspects of American society and makes poilitcal statements. Gosh, this sounds like the same girl to me! Although, despite keeping her lyrics True to heart, the dance beats heard throughout make this cd Jewel's most fun project to date. Heck, it's dance music! Meaningful lyrics or not, it's still fun to listen to! Be sure to listen to the lyrics of each song carefully. You'll discover that Jewel has not, in any way, created fluffy, mindless pop (which some people are accussing her of doing). It's rare to find dance music with a purpose beyond just making people feel energized and relaxed. This album proves that the very essence of Jewel will never change (even though the music has).","There 's gon na be some mighty fierce debating going on about this album !

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B00123BCKQ,1,1,4,"Paolo Nutini is yet another person that I was introduced to as a VH1 You Oughta Know artist, and I was surprised to learn that a strong voice like that was coming from a guy that's only nineteen years old (well, he was when the album was recorded). Yes, I also didn't realize that this album, These Streets, was released over a year ago, but I'm glad I finally discovered it.

Most people are probably only familiar with ""New Shoes"", but there are plenty of other highlights as well, like ""Last Request"" and the title track. There are also some good acoustic selections, whether it be piano (""Autumn"") or guitar (""White Lies""). And ""Jenny Don't Be Hasty"" has some pretty interesting lyrics.

Even though the second (acoustic) version of ""Last Request"" (the hidden track after the hidden track) is unnecessary, Paolo Nutini still has the skills, so you shouldn't mind taking a drive down these streets.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00123BCKQ,1,1,5,"Paolo Nutini makes a huge splash with his debut album, These Streets. Paolo displays a natural talent for singing and songwriting; and his voice is rich and full of masculine warmth. Just one listen to this CD proves it!

The track set begins with ""Jenny Don't Be Hasty."" Paolo sings with the style of a seasoned pro; this number about a woman he wants makes a strong start for this album! The electric guitar, drums and percussion make a good musical arrangement. ""Last Request,"" another highlight of this fantastic album; lets Paolo sing with great sensitivity of how he wants one last time alone with a woman who doesn't love him anymore. The melody charms me with its beauty; and I predict that you will enjoy ""Last Request"" very, very much.

""These Streets,"" the title track of this album, begins with some pretty awesome guitar; and when Paolo comes in this number takes off like a jet! Paolo laments losing his childhood because in retrospect he realizes things were simpler for him back then. The guitar works wonders for this number; and the guitar alone with Paolo's voice makes ""These Streets"" a True masterpiece!

""White Lies"" has another beautiful arrangement for the guitar; and ""Loving You"" lets Paolo sing happily of finding his one True love. Paolo also shows off his wide vocal range, sometimes singing a few words in Falsetto--flawless!

The album ends with ""Alloway Grove."" This number starts with the drums and guitar; and when Paolo comes in he sings this perfectly! Paolo sings of his disappointment that the girl he loves is no longer there for him. The upbeat melody belies the sadness of the lyrics; but it all works well for Paolo and his musicians. The lengthy number works well.

The liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs except for some of the lyrics to ""Alloway Grove;"" and the artwork impresses me. We get some good shots of Paolo, too.

Paolo Nutini's first album sounds like a tour de force of a very seasoned talent--which is truly phenomenal since he's still rather young and this is only his first CD. I highly recommend this CD for fans of comparatively mellow rock and pop vocals.

A1ALPL858XSDE,B00123G6YI,-1,1,4,"From his debut hit ""Life's A Dance"" in late 1992 through the rest of the '90s, John Michael Montgomery (with his easy going baritone) was one of country music's most reliable hitmakers.  Over the past four years, however, he's had but one top ten hit, the chart topping heart tugger ""The Little Girl.""  With his recent singles struggling, a hits collection was the logical choice for Montgomery's next release.  A sequel to 1997's GREATEST HITS made the most sense, as Montgomery has ten top 20 hits not included on that first set.  Instead, Warner Brothers went with this career encompassing VERY BEST OF that contains 11 of the 14 recordings already found on the strong selling GREATEST HITS.
Among the hits not included on either collection are the engaging ""Ain't Got Nothin' On Us,"" ""Love Working On You,"" and ""Hello L.O.V.E.""  All are uptempo romps that would have contributed nicely to the ballad-heavy VERY BEST OF.  The sequencing on VERY BEST OF distorts the musical nonbalance even more, with three fast tunes leading off, followed by a slew of slow stuff.  The collection concludes with two new ballads: the paternal reflection ""Cool"" and the pledge of devotion ""One Day Less.""  While pleasant, neither track seems likely to reverse Montgomery's recent chart struggles.  Ultimately, while it contains more tracks and covers a longer period of Montgomery's recording career, this VERY BEST OF is not as enjoyable to listen to as his earlier GREATEST HITS.","From his debut hit "" Life 's A Dance "" in late 1992 through the rest of the ' 90s , John Michael Montgomery ( with his easy going baritone ) was one of country music 's most reliable hitmakers .

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00123G6YI,1,1,4,"The son of a Kentucky musician whose own Nashville dreams never came True, John Michael Montgomery kept a bit of his daddy's hometown grit, even as he put together an impressive string of Nashville-produced hit albums and singles. This generous compilation offers twenty tracks, and collects nearly every significant hit single that Montgomery's had in his twelve year recording career.

Montgomery's first hits, the ballads ""Life's a Dance"" and ""I Love the Way You Love Me,"" had a middle-of-the-road sweetness that hit an emotional chord with both record buyers and award givers -- the second single was the ACM song-of-the-year for 1993. The love songs continued in 1994 with, ""I Swear,"" as did the awards (ACM song-of-the-year and single-of-the-year). As with most of Montgomery's ballads, the country flavor is to be found almost entirely in his vocals. There's a hint of steel, but the drums-guitars-bass-keyboard backing could just as easily host a pop vocalist (in fact, the song was covered by the R&B group All-4-One and netted a grammy). It's the slight edge in Montgomery's voice, the phrasings, and the down-home sentimentality of the lyrics that brings his slow songs into the country arena.

Later in 1994 his singles began to capitalize on Montgomery's uptempo numbers, charting with the rowdy country-rocker ""Be My Baby Tonight"" and the mid-tempo ""If You've Got Love."" Both tracks kick up the twangy guitars and fiddle of a honky-tonk bred backing. His releases continued mix ballads and up-tempo tunes, including the lightning-quick auctioneer's cadence of ""Sold (The Grundy Country Auction Incident)"" and the contemplation of his father's death, ""I Miss You a Little."" The latter, unfortunately, is missing from this collection.

By 1996 Montgomery was mostly charting ballads, variously edging more towards the center and bringing a bigger dose of his country sound down-tempo. ""Angel in My Eyes"" is more contemporary pop than country, but 1998's ""Cover You in Kisses"" has a superb melody anchored by a strong underline of steel and fiddle. Montgomery's last #1 single, 2000's ""The Little Girl"" features Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski on harmony vocals.

In addition to seven #1s (seventeen top-5s!), this collection adds ""'Til Nothing Comes Between Us"" from the ""Pictures"" album, and a pair of newly recorded tracks: the waltz-time generation gap tale ""Cool,"" and the romantic ""One Less Day."" This is a terrific overview and introduction to Montgomery's hitmaking career. Though it's missing the top-5 ""Cowboy Love"" and top-10 ""I Miss You a Little,"" it's probably the more complete pick over his 1997 ""Greatest Hits"" LP.","The son of a Kentucky musician whose own Nashville dreams never came True , John Michael Montgomery kept a bit of his daddy 's hometown grit , even as he put together an impressive string of Nashville - produced hit albums and singles .

A1JMR6MVOIC38K,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Cher's follow-up release to her blockbuster album ""Believe"" was ""Living Proof.""  It is another album in the dance/club music vein, though it is a darker and much more cynical collection than ""Believe.""  Cher pulls it off beautifully though.

Right before this album came out, 9/11 happened.  Cher dedicates the tribute song ""A Song For the Lonely"" to the ""Courageous People of New York"" who endured through the horrible event. When I last saw her in concert (Farewell Tour, 2005, Glendale AZ) and this video was shown in the ampitheater, I was struck by the WTC symbolism and how moving the song was.  This CD has a link to the video and it is definitely worth watching.

I think ""Believe"" was a much-more commercially viable disc than ""Living Proof,"" though I think that ""Living Proof"" is a more powerful recording. It also took me a few listenings for me to really start to like it.  It's packed with great songs.  I always thought that Diane Warren's ""Body to Body, Heart to Heart"" should have been released as a single.

The record company antics of releasing different versions of the disc in the U.S. and Europe are a bit tiresome: the European versions contained additional songs and short-changed U.S. fans.  The same company did the same thing with the ""It's A Man's World"" disc in the mid-90s.  It's all about the bucks, I know, but enough is enough.","Cher 's follow - up release to her blockbuster album "" Believe "" was "" Living Proof .

The album is jam packed with great songs, including four hit singles that were released. Read on to find out more.

SONG FOR THE LONELY

  The first single from the album. When I first heard this song, I was really amazed. I could not believe how incredible this song was. The lyrics are so strong and motivating, as Cher's voice is strong and powerful. I strongly recommend that you all listen to this song first because 1) It is the first song on the album, and 2) Cher has dedicated this song to, and I quote from her album thanks, ""...The courageous people of New York, Mayor Gulianni, Governor Pataki, and my friend Liz...""

A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG

  The third single from the album. This is a song that would be most popular on the dance floors at clubs and other get-together parties. This is definitely a kick-a** tune.

ALIVE AGAIN

  The fourth & final single from the album. Awesome tune.

THE MUSIC'S NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU

  The second single from the album. ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"" is not the only song that should be played in clubs; this song would also fit into that of clubs, where people can immediately get their groove on. This song has an edgier groove for anyone who wants to shake their a** on the dance floor.

RAIN, RAIN

  Not bad.

REAL LOVE

  Not bad.

LOVE SO HIGH

  Incredible

BODY TO BODY, HEART TO HEART

  Diane Warren has written so many songs for so many solo artists since I can remember. She has written such songs as, ""Who Will You Run To"" for Heart, ""Love Can Move Mountains"" for Celine Dion, & ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" for Cher. This was another one of Diane Warren's songs and Cher was happy enough to grace Diane's lyrics with her music and voice.

LOVE IS A LONELY PLACE WITHOUT YOU

  Great.

LOVE ONE ANOTHER

  Back in 2000, when Amber released her self-titled album, she had originally recorded this song. Cher took the courage to cover the song. The song is amazing in every way and I think Amber would be most proud of this version, even though her version kicked a** as well. If you listen to both versions, you'll notice that Cher had re-written the second verse for her version, as well as re-writing the last two lines of the song's bridge.

WHEN YOU WALK AWAY

  Not bad.

WHEN THE MONEY'S GONE

  Not bad.

A2JAKHFYI88ZX0,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"This album was released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. The main difference is the US version has a track called ""When You Walk Away"", and the UK/Canadian printings have a great song called ""You Take It All"" instead of ""When You Walk Away"", and vice versa for the US. LIVING PROOF is a great album that builds on the strength of BELIEVE, however this album never really lived to its potential, it didn't catch on as much as BELIEVE did to listeners. ""Song For The Lonely"" was a song that really resonated with a lot of people, with it's universal theme. In fact, a lot of the songs were like the ones on BELIEVE, with a message of strength and survival through life's difficult stages. As a whole, this album is better than BELIEVE. The only tracks I could have done without is the R&B tinged ""Rain Rain"" and the Diane Warren latin infused ""Body To Body, Heart To Heart"". The rest of the album is just great. I actually like Cher's version of Amber's ""Love One Another"", more than Amber's version. ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"" is like an epic ballad dance song, should have been a single. ""Real Love"" is a really funky Daft Punk sounding song, very european. ""Alive Again"" and ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"" are other highlights, with great positive messages. Other highlights include ""You Take It All"" (one of the best on the album) and ""When The Money's Gone"". Overall a really strong album from Cher! Can't wait to see what she does next.","This album was released in the UK and Canada in late 2001 , and in the US in early 2002 . The main difference is the US version has a track called "" When You Walk Away "" , and the UK / Canadian printings have a great song called "" You Take It All "" instead of "" When You Walk Away "" , and vice versa for the US . LIVING PROOF is a great album that builds on the strength of BELIEVE , however this album never really lived to its potential , it did n't catch on as much as BELIEVE did to listeners . "" Song For The Lonely "" was a song that really resonated with a lot of people , with it 's universal theme . In fact , a lot of the songs were like the ones on BELIEVE , with a message of strength and survival through life 's difficult stages . As a whole , this album is better than BELIEVE .

A3RC3AK8UN89I9,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Cher's newest offering is 2001's LIVING PROOF, this is the version that was released in the UK before the US got a copy. The UK version features ""You Take It All"", which in my opinion, is the best track of the album. Instead the US version has ""When You Walk Away"", which is not available on this UK version. Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength, like ""Alive Again"", ""Song For The Lonely"", ""Love One Another"", which all have messages of love and acceptance and moving on. Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"". The only songs I couldn't get into are the latin influenced ""Body To Body, Heart To Heart"", and ""Rain, Rain"". The rest of the tracks are winners, however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than ""When The Money's Gone"". I love her version of ""The Music's No Good Without You"", which was the first UK single, a nice dark trance type track. ""Real Love"" stands out, it has a nice Daft Punk-ish sound to it.

UK and Canada had ""The Music's No Good Without You"" as a first single, whereas the US had ""A Song For The Lonely"" as the first single. LIVING PROOF continues the trend started by BELIEVE, her comeback album. ""A Song For The Lonely"" has a very upbeat message in it, many have used it to cope with the tragedies of 9-11, it's a universal song of acceptance that we've come to expect from Cher. There are other songs in this vein as well, ""Alive Again"" sort of mirrors the message of ""Believe"", just a song about survival and the desire to feel alive again. I really like ""Real Love"" which has a almost retro sound to it. The second single in the US is ""A Different Kind of Love Song"", which is also similar to ""A Song For The Lonely"", just a song of acceptance. She continues the trend with electronica. ""You Take It All"" is another highlight here. Other highlights include ""Rain, Rain"", and ""Love Is Lonely Place Without You"".

For my brother and sister-in-law ""If"" is more than other Bread songs they like ""their"" song. Just listening she can't help but let loose a tear. This makes it even more special to me and I'm certain it brings up special feelings for many.

Bread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I like how much their music means to friends and family just a bit older than me too.

I'm glad I gave them another look. It was well worth it and ""If"" is well worth 5 stars to me.

But ... that does nt means it get old ! The pitch machine makes every song inredibally easy to remember with solid beats and on - time voice alterations . If anyone but Cher had done this album it would go down as the greatest of all time . Unfortunetly , because people want Cher to die for some reason , they ignore her . It 's sad that someone who the great Madonna models herself after can be ignored . Living Proof is the greatest album of Cher 's career ... which is tough to say about a diva with albums such as "" Believe "" , "" It 's a Mans World "" , "" Cher "" , "" Heart of Stone "" , "" Take Me Home "" , and "" Half Breed "" . Cher said it herself ... ""at the end of the nuclear hollucost they 'll be cocaroaches .... and Cher"" ... ""So i think that pretty much sums it up "" . Long live the great one ... remember ... Her Farewell tour hits ... soon ."

Being in Canada, I bought the international version of Living Proof with 'You take it all' instead of 'When you walk away' last November from a local retailer. It has been in my stereo ever since! 'Real Love' 'Song for the Lonely' and 'When the money's gone' are the best of the best. High energy, fun, and radio-ready cuts to say the least. Cher has changed with the times, that is why she had such a long-standing career. Sometimes the computer effects on the tracks get to be a bit much, but I love every song nontheless. Be sure to listen to this disc from start to finish. I can honestly say that there is not one track that could be considered the 'worst' song on the album. Some are stronger than others, but each one is worthy of being a single. Cher, keep up the awesome work. Your fans want to hear more from you for years to come.

The American version of Cher's ""Living Proof"" contains quite a few danceable little ditties and a lot of smooth production.  It also contains Cher's curious choice of song lyrics (she only wrote one of the songs) and her somewhat annoying singing voice (only topped (again! haha!!) by her annoying speaking voice and the insipid things she says).  The problem with that particular album is she sings in a language Hoppy can understand (English!).  This Japanese version is much much better.  I can't understand a thing the crone is saying, but I can still dance dance dance my pants off!  For those who love Cher's new dance beat, but don't like listening to her silly platitudes, this is the choice for you.  Well worth the extra expense.

A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Cher's new CD masters what ""Believe"" promised in 1998.  Cher's singing is confident and powerful; and the songs are consistently excellent.  This CD follows Cher's 2000 internet-only CD of self-penned tunes, ""not.commercial,"" that Cher released on her own Isis label.  For that CD, she lived in a castle in France and wrote some good songs like ""The Fall"" dedicated to Kurt Cobain and ""Sisters of Mercy"" that expressed her opinions on Catholic school.  While we don't see any saucy lyrics as Cher's classic, ""You're about as useless as Bob Dole's... arm,"" we do get the best commercial polish on ""Living Proof.""
""Song for the Lonely"" is a hot rocker, timely in the wake of the World Trade Towers & Pentagon terrorist acts, ""When heroes fall in love or war, they live forever.""  The drums fall hard on this comforting opener; and when Cher sings ""It'll be all right,"" her vocals fly angelically.  ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" is a cosmic rocker with a driving techno beat, ""We have living proof there's some kind of light that flows through everything.""  ""Alive Again"" is a pulsating midtempo song of renewal, ""I only want to learn to freeze the flame.""  Throbbing echo chamber vocals resound through the excellent ""The Music's No Good Without You.""  One of my favorite tracks, #1 on my own personal top ten, is ""Rain Rain,"" an addictive soulful track.  Keyboards and hot rhythm guitar lace ""Real Love,"" ""Time after time, you're bringing me up when I'm down.""  ""Love So High"" has more soaring vocals on this throbbing rocker.  ""Body to Body Heart to Heart"" is an amorous full-throated rocker where Cher uses a taste of Spanish guitar that she employed so prominently on one of my favorite songs from the ""not.commercial"" CD, the gorgeous ballad ""Still.""  ""I'll never love this way again,"" Cher sings passionately as the pace slows a tad on the beautiful ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You.""  ""Love One Another"" is great cosmic pop with pulsing rhythms, ""Try to understand, open up your heart, a fist is just a hand, it can come apart.""  Keyboards wash defiantly on ""When You Walk Away.""  The CD closes with Bruce Roberts' and Donna Weiss' ""When the Money's Gone,"" a funky rocker that is so endearing.  Cher's voice floats as she sings, ""What a fine life I give to you.""

So Cher shows in ""Living Proof"" that you don't mess with success and use the same formula as ""Believe"".  Though ""Believe"" was a good dance album, it also got tiring very quicky as does ""Living Proof"".
The songs are good dance songs my favorite is ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" which is definitely the strongest song on the album and should of been released as the first single in stead of the dismal been believed and done that before ""Song for the Lonely"".
However all the songs sound like the same vain of ""Believe"", and just get tired with the same dancebeats over and over.
I don't want to sound contradicting here, Cher is good, ""Living Proof"" is a well produced dance piece, however it would do better as a 12 inch vinyl single than 12 different songs.
The other strong cuts include ""Rain, Rain"" and ""Love One Another"" which sounds a lot like ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" which is a faster version of ""Song for the Lonely"" which is a slower version of ""Believe""....Get the picture?
There is no new trails taken here, no new ideas, or sounds.  Chers voice always the classic sound that Cher has is always in good form, and Cher is one of the best entertainers of all time, however ""Living Proof"" is just the same old ""Beliefs"".

The songs that scream perfection are The Song for the lonely, as well as Alive again,Love is a lonely place without you.. Cher is really expressive and gets these anthemic songs to where no other woman singer could.

""The Music's No Good Without You"" ~ The First European single, and the most unlike Cher song on the cd.  I you didn't know it was Cher you wouldnt know who it was.
""Alive Again"" ~ Cher goes from super vocoded in track 1 to a super powerful voice in track 2.  So powerful that a radio station in Germany has chosen it for their Olympic theme song.
""Song for the Lonely"" ~ The first Amerian single and the most meaningful song is also very powerful and unlike Believe has no vocodor (cherbot) recrdings o her voice.
""Different Kind of Love Song"" ~ Cher said it herself...its ""Vocoded to DEATH!"" haha...its awesome super dancy..will be big in clubs
""Rain Rain"" ~ Smooth Ballad...cuts the dance theme a little,but still miraculousely is dancy?!?!?! Only cher!
""Love so High"" ~ Excellent song...has to be heard
""Body to Body, Heart to Heart"" ~ Kinda like Dov'e La'`more.  Very latin and very upbeat
""Love is a Lonely Place Without You"" ~ Great Vocals, Cher!! Super good song.
""Real Love"" ~ Kinda like Believe...very vocoded...excellent
""Love One Another ~ Remake of Amber's dance song...very good.  Cher's is far better
""You Take it All"" ~ Very slow yet very well produced
""When the Moneys Gone"" ~ Great way to end the cd..one of the best songs on Living Proof.

A3I7P0TSJHGOVK,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Frankly, I expected nothing like this cd. Actually, I didn't know what to expect after ""Believe"". I was on of those that had a ""wee"" problem with Cher going 'dance'. I wanted another ""Heart Of Stone"" or ""It's A Man's World. Believe showed Cher in great vocal form from previous recordings. The songs suited her to a tee (with the exception of ""We All Sleep Alone"", a real nightmare!) and the production was quite good.
My big surprise was the amount of careful work that went into this followup. The only reason this cd doesn't rate a ""5"" in my opinion is that she could have done it entirely without vocoder effects and it would have still been great. After all, I buy her music to hear HER.
""Song For The Lonely"" will be as big, if not bigger, than Believe. And there are several potentials for Top 10 to follow. Check out the infectious ""Different Kind Of Love Song"", the haunting ""Rain Rain"", anthemic ""Alive Again"", the 70's  disco ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"", and a great cover of ""Love One Another"". This cd tops Believe without taking away from it. If you haven't got it yet, wait for the february release of the US version which will contain an additional track (13). Yep, she's back, big time!","Frankly , I expected nothing like this cd . Actually , I did n't know what to expect after "" Believe "" .

I was not willing to wait until spring of 2002 for the US release of ""Living Proof"". I was happy to shell out the big bucks for her new album. Needless to say, the results were positive. ""Living Proof"" is ten times better than ""Believe"". The material she chose to record is far better than most of the songs off its predecessor. Although I do think Cher overdoes it on the vocoder sounds on this cd, I was able to forgive her for that since every song on this cd is a winner in my book. I immediately fell in love with ""Alive Again"" which is one of my favorite tracks off this cd. I was completely surprised when I heard Cher cover one of my favorite songs from another dance diva Amber. Cher does a swell job at ""Love One Another"". Unlike ""Believe"", ""Living Proof"" is a stronger dance album. The songs are tight and the material was just right for Cher.

 ON Believe Cher seemed to be more passive to the producers. Her involvement on this cd is very evident. She is there for multiple background choruses, and works all the vocals superbly. It's great to hear a girl singer with a lower register, and a way with a lyric. The work is there and the power of the singer is up front. I personally find a few of the tracks her highest achieving artistially ever! ""When the Money's Gone"" is a wonderful rocking dance rock track that finds Cher earnestly questioning the fidelity of her partner when the riches fall! It is a terrific track. ""This is a song(for the lonely"" is an anthem dedicated to the Sept . 11th victims and families, and she shouts it in plaintive cry, in the feel of a real rocker. It is full of emotion and conviction.""Rain Rain"", has a hook that stays after one listen, and the depth that makes you glad you remembered it!
Cher's cover of Amber's hit, ""Love One Another"" does not become a brides-maid to Amber. She brings a low decible sincerity that only a mature woman can pull off. ""A different Kind of Love ""Song, is just that! AND....Cher universally dedicates it to everyone, acknowledging love in a universal way! Cher is no stranger to fame, and this cd will only add to her roster!!! I love it, and so will you.

A29TNAVMPYFRDF,B00123G5ZI,-1,1,4,"After staging arguably the biggest musical comeback this side of Tina Turner with her dance-driven project BELIEVE, Cher's back three years on to offer up more of the same with LIVING PROOF.Utitlizing many of the same producers, she attempts to build on the momentum experienced with the previous set, and the end result is an overall more consistent album.  Granted, there's nothing here that matches the instant pleasure of 'Believe' or 'All or Nothing', but there's also nothing here that matches the abundance of filler found on BELIEVE either. Lyrically, the tracks follow similarly in the vein of her eighties' corporate-rock albums than her more recent output. The set's first international single, 'The Music's No Good Without You',seems an odd choice, if only because it isn't one of the albums more ingratiating tunes.  Far better is 'Alive Again', as well as 'A Different Kind Of Love Song' and 'Real Love'. Also interesting is 'You Take It All', an electronica-driven track that sounds like Cher trying to channel Olive or Dido.  Among the very few missteps are the sole ballad 'Rain Rain', which is just plain dull, as well as a pedestrian remake of 'When The Money's Gone'. The only other minor quibble is the use of the dreaded vocoder on nearly all the tracks--it sounded cool the first thousand times we heard 'Believe', but has since been rendered just another tired, over-utilitzed gimmick--her voice is better than ever, and the heavy reliance on vocal effects just detracts from the album's overall impact after several listens. Though it doesn't match her underrated nineties opus IT'S A MAN'S WORLD as her best, it is a superior album to BELIEVE and reinforces the notion that Cher sounds best when she supresses the rock chick and unleashes her inner dance diva.","After staging arguably the biggest musical comeback this side of Tina Turner with her dance - driven project BELIEVE , Cher 's back three years on to offer up more of the same with LIVING PROOF.Utitlizing many of the same producers , she attempts to build on the momentum experienced with the previous set , and the end result is an overall more consistent album .

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00123IAVK,1,1,5,"History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60's. Much of it heavily based in fact. Most of this is of the psychedelic rock scene of that city. But there were some important hybrids too. For Frisco it was Santana. For Oakland it was Tower Of Power. A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that,especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk. Based heavily in what James Brown was doing at the time,they had an approch that couldn't be more different if it tried.

  Right off the bat the album kicks off with ""Knock Yourself Out"". This along with the witty ""Social Lubrication"" and ""The Price"",""Back On The Streets Again"" and ""The Skunk,The Goose And The Fly"",with almost goofy lyrical exchanges are TOP before they were even closed to slick. The rhythm section is right out in your face,the horns are blaring right out and the vocals are as raw and unrefined as you'd hear on any Kool & The Gang and James Brown album you'd find during the period. Somehow or other though,there's a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing. Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs.

  The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer ""Sparkling In The Sand"". This is a very slow 9+ minute ballad that has much more of a jazz flavor with more prominant reed solos than anything else. It's surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970-with Sly Stone,Santana,War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions,that the music didn't overburden itself before it really got going. It's a testement to the enduring power and stylistic elasticity of funk that that never happened. This and all of those bands prospered greatly during the era. And laid the groundwork for what is sometimes called ""united funk"".","History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60 's .

Nevertheless, ""Hit By a Train"" is an entertaining listen from start to finish. In that sense, this is more of a sampler than a collection of their best hits.

Miller has a tendency toward song-title puns that don't do justice to the songs themselves (""Cryin' Drunk,"" ""Crash on the Barrelhead"" - not included here), but this only points out his self-consciously clever way with a phrase. The band has obviously mastered the two-step `train beat' (3 tracks here) and the hard-bouncing ""Texas shuffle"" (which accounts for eight of the CD's eighteen tracks), but it's Miller's lyrics that keep you coming back for more, even after repeated listens.

Fresh from a dramatic weight loss and looking like a million bucks, Peggy Lee was ready to go when she signed Atlantic Records to record a soulful set of great contemporary songs.  Peggy Lee went deep inside, laid down a stunning vocal on the great ""Let's Love"" which should have been a huge hit but shamefully received no airplay upon its release. Next is a spirited soulful version of Melissa Manchester's ""He Is The One"" with a thrilling background gospel chorus with Peggy leading the way with a superb vocal.  Sensuous and funky on a playful ""Easy Evil"", torchy and illuminating ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight"", clearly Miss Lee is in peak form and very inspired!  A fresh funky arrangement make evergreen ""Always"" a delight while ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" becomes a tour-de-force, making this the definitive version of this timeless soulful classic. Hot rhythm track sets gospel spiritual ""Sweet Lov'liness"" on fire while a haunting Peggy Lee original ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter"" is simply gorgeous.  Soulful seduction make ""Sweet Talk"" a quiet storm classic which should have been a huge hit and mesmerizing achingly gorgeous Henry Mancini ""Sometimes"" is a sentimental classic having a special feel all its own.  Bonus tracks are wonderful discoveries with ""I Am His Lady"" the best ever version of this soft-jazz treat.  A ragtime arrangement make the Peggy Lee original ""I Wanna Be Seduced"" great fun and another Peggy original ""The Nickel Ride"" is a stunning classic that is naked and haunting.  This unique original has Peggy brilliantly accompanied by piano only and the result is another great song that echos  Grammy Winner ""Is That All There Is?"". Peggy must have wondered ""Is That All There Is?"" when this great release was received with such shocking indifference, robbing public exposure to a great work and Peggy acclaim she clearly deserved. Closing is a great circus like arrangement for a stirring ""Let's Keep Dancing"" which was to be Peggy's last major studio production and a winner it is!  This great song featured in ""Sharky's Machine"" soundtrack should have been a big hit and would have been in better musical times than the musically directionless early eighties!.  Now if only Capitol Records would release the great 70's ""Where Did They Go"" and the classic ""Norma Delores Egstrom"", both featuring the iconic Peggy Lee in peak form, fans will be happy this legendary singer is finally given some justice for her great but sadly overlooked 70's work.

While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic ""90 Degrees and Freezing"", a Motown-inspired, horn driven ""Come to Me Do"" and a catchy and powerful pop gem ""Feel"" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.
I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite ""King of Might Have Been"" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.
I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on ""XXX"". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on ""XXX"".
Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.

A1TKJ3L7FMZ01Y,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,2,"I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue, but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right. Now this is not a comparison about old 70's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste, but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly. If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago, you might want to check this out, but I was dissapointed. There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album, but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs.  There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd.  I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on, but not that much.  I did not like the producer on this album.  Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards, drums, guitar, vocals etc that I felt cheated. I did not know who played on what track.  My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced.  It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious.  I don't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm, but it was way over the top!  The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance.  The back vocals on the song ""Caroline"" sounded like a straight keyboard sample.  Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop-machine?  They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it's painfully obvious.  I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person's voice.  Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with.  These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets.  I do not mind the loops, midi, sequencing, samples etc, cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster, and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine, but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed.","I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue , but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right .

Full-length new material release from Chicago. I am not sure under what counting method could this one be their thirtieth. Probably including compilations and Christmas albums. I lost track of Chicago since Night and Day album in mid 90s(22nd release). But that one is sort of tribute. So the last album I FEEL Chicago is Twenty One in 1991. Yeah indeed listening to XXX is like meeting a LONG LOST FRIEND.

FEEL the first single from this album is static at first but from the mid section it turns dynamic. Reminding me of the Chicago during ""18"" album.

KING OF MIGHT HAVE BEEN is tried-and-Trued style of Chicago ballad during 80s. WHY CAN'T WE tries duet but unmistakably typical of Chicago styled ballad. Most surprising one is 90 DEGREES AND FREEZING. Just like Earth Wind and Fire and groovy and I hope Maroon 5 cover this one. So thrilling and my best song of the year so far.

Verdict: My favorite band returns stronger than ever.

Rating: 95 out of 100. One of the finest comeback efforts.

A1EYSN1T55SV7U,B00123IBSC,1,1,4,"I love this band and have for nearly 25 years (since I was in junior high school in 1982--when ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"" hit the airwaves).  While most artists get some criticism from me if they have too many ballads, this is one band that has been above that because they do the ballad so well.  I love all of their ""second career"" stuff from the 1980s.  I also have gone back to visit their earliest stuff--including listening to and enjoying their debut ""Chicago Transit Authority"" album.  Suffice it to say, I am a fan of all eras of this band.

So where to place this comeback effort?  After listening to it numerous times, my conclusion is that it nearly stands up to previous material.  I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that a couple of the ballads are a bit sappy even for them, and for sure the song order is strange with having all ballads followed by all uptempo numbers.  I also see no point to having two versions of ""Feel"" on the album--just stick with the trademark horns version.  Still, I am overall very pleased with the release of this album.

""Feel"" is an enjoyable track (whichever version you listen too)--very familiar but with a sound of modern production.  Good single, although I don't think it did too well chart-wise.  Ballads like ""King of Might Have Been"" and ""Caroline"" would fit right on such Chicago albums as 17-21 with their beautiful vocals and overall melodic sound.  Even the guest vocals on ""Why Can't We"" and ""Love Will Come Back"" are somewhat enjoyable and an interesting direction to take.  ""Long Lost Friend"" is a bit sappy but for sure very pretty.

I agree with those who say the second half of the album comes as a nice surprise in returning to the ""roots"" of the band a bit.  ""90 Degrees and Freezing"" is a catchy, fun uptempo number, and ""Come To Me, Do"" is a vintage-sounding Robert Lamm-sung track.  ""Already Gone"" has some cool harmonies that are not so typically straight-ahead as so many Chicago melodies are.  ""Where Were You"", ""Lovin' Chains"", and ""Better"" are also refreshingly uptempo and a lot of fun to listen to.

Some have called this a ""safe"" Chicago album, and to a degree I agree with that.  Many of the ballads in the beginning certainly fall into a familiar territory we have heard before.  While I have never heard a note of it, I am further intrigued by people's descriptions of the unreleased ""Stone of Sisyphus"" album and would love to have it see the light of day.  I also think of such albums as the amazing one that Toto put out this year and wonder what a Chicago album made in the same vein (i.e., totally doing what they want to do instead of perhaps pining too hard for a return to radio single ""glory days"") might sound like.  All that being said, for me this is overall a very satisfying release.  I have enough criticism here with the song order and ""safeness"" of the album that I can't quite give it a 5-star rating, but it is close.  Call my rating 4 1/2 stars for an album that should be very satisfying to '80s Chicago fans and also to plenty of career-spanning fans of this legendary band.","I love this band and have for nearly 25 years ( since I was in junior high school in 1982 - -when "" Hard To Say I 'm Sorry "" hit the airwaves ) .

A235NA61RC6YC1,B00123IBSC,1,1,5,"The Good

Hypnotic drum beats lead the charge on ""Feel."" A catchy melodic chorus and subtle guitar riffs will take you the rest of the way. Soulful and emotional vocals dominate the piano laden ballad ""King of Might Have Been."" You may make comparisons to ""Hard Habit to Break"" here, but the song does a great job of standing alone. It's the multi-part harmonies and warm brass that really draw you into ""Caroline."" When you read the lyrics the song seems a little cheesy, but when you here how Chicago presents it, it's quite encompassing. Rascal Flatts makes an appearance on the optimistic ballad ""Love Will Come Back."" ""90 Degrees and Freezing"" echoes the group's 80s high-end production and sound. ""Already Gone"" is loaded with plenty of pop-rock melodies and signature Chicago horns.

The Bad

I thought that the remixed version of ""Feel"" was unnecessary. I didn't really care for the blandness of ""Come to Me, Do"" either.

The Verdict

I really didn't expect this album to be so good. Chicago returns with their thirtieth album, after a ten year break, and shows that there's no rust on them. XXX is a powerful and melodic pop-rock experience. I never really wanted to listen to Chicago post-Peter Cetera, but after hearing this, I've had a change of heart.","The Good 

 Hypnotic drum beats lead the charge on "" Feel . "" A catchy melodic chorus and subtle guitar riffs will take you the rest of the way . Soulful and emotional vocals dominate the piano laden ballad "" King of Might Have Been . "" You may make comparisons to "" Hard Habit to Break "" here , but the song does a great job of standing alone . It 's the multi - part harmonies and warm brass that really draw you into "" Caroline . "" When you read the lyrics the song seems a little cheesy , but when you here how Chicago presents it , it 's quite encompassing . Rascal Flatts makes an appearance on the optimistic ballad "" Love Will Come Back . "" "" 90 Degrees and Freezing "" echoes the group 's 80s high - end production and sound . "" Already Gone "" is loaded with plenty of pop - rock melodies and signature Chicago horns . The Bad 

 I thought that the remixed version of "" Feel "" was unnecessary . I did n't really care for the blandness of "" Come to Me , Do "" either . The Verdict

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,3,"The one very noticeable feature of ""XXX"" is that Chicago seem frozen in time. To me, their last album was ""Twenty One"" back in 1991. ""XXX"" could easily be the follow up judging by the musical direction the band takes here. I'd say this album is most identical to Chicago 16 through 21. It has the streamlined, by the book, paint by numbers, manufactured syrupy saccharine assembly line power ballads and lite funk/jazz pieces you'd expect from 1980's era Chicago. What happened? It's as if the boys missed grunge/rap/hip-hop/hip-pop and have released an extremely American Idol friendly album.

That being said, the 12 songs are fairly homogenous and melodic. I don't hear any hits here because all the songs sound like they could be made by any MOR/AOR band right now. The guest musicians don't really add anything original to the Chicago sound. The horns seem more present with less keyboards. There isn't a truly awful song on ""XXX"", but it's just bland and banal pop, and nothing that could match Chicago 16-19. I don't believe ""XXX"" has anything that really resembles their 1970's output, which is a shame, because there are still fans waiting for Chicago to really kick out the jams like they used to and sideline this David Foster-cursed pop they've been producing for the past 24 years.

I also felt it a waste of space to have two versions of their first single ""Feel"". I listened to both and there wasn't any major difference between the two, so I'd go with the ""Hot Single Mix"" version.

It just seems to me that after nearly 40 years Chicago should be taking more chances with their music. They have absolutely nothing to lose at this point.","The one very noticeable feature of "" XXX "" is that Chicago seem frozen in time . To me , their last album was "" Twenty One "" back in 1991 .

A1PG0IQB3CP9II,B00123IBSC,1,1,5,"Have had this CD for less than 3 days, mind made up, best of this genre that I have heard this year.

Some die-hard Chi fans are berating this effort because it doesn't duplicate the sounds of CTA-II-V-VII-VII (Guercio) or the 17-21 (Foster) sounds.  I knew that Scheff and Champlin had the makings of giving this band new life, given the right production and management.

This band has finally, (under Jay DeMarcus production) with XXX, come into their own. Of note, checking the Rascall Flatts website, DeMarcus profile shows that Chicago and David Foster were two of his major influences.  It shows on this production.

The STRONG voices of Lamm, Champlin and Scheff, with the addition of TOTO members Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams, and the Rascal Flatts singers makes for as strong a vocal production they have done since Cetera's departure, breaking new ground for the band.  Instrumentally, the bands already strong skills are supplanted by  some of Nashville's best hired guns on guitar and drums.

Stylistically, they cover Trip-Hop-Pop, Power Ballads, Power Pop, New Country, Jazz Fusion, and Blues Rock.  This kind of diversity is unheard of in todays' music scene.

""Love Will Come Back"" with Rascal Flatts on vocals has the makings of a new country hit. Expect it to be the most added song to New Country playlists

""Caroline"" as the makings of a Power Pop anthem. Renegade rock stations stand the best chance of adding this to playlists.

""King of Might Have Been"" is another stand-out, Scheff power ballad.

""Feel"", the first single, has the best chance on the Adult Contemporary scene, with its updated beat and production values.

""90 Degrees and Freezing"" is a Lamm Jazz-Fusion piece which reminds you of the roots of the band back inthe 60's and early 70's. Maybe Jazz and Public stations will play this, too complex and tight for AAA, too hip and edgy for AC.

Other material is very good, not just ""filler"" but it's doubtful any of it will ever get airplay.

All in all, a very pleasant surprise to critical listeners.  No corners were cut on this production, and Warner/Rhino seems to be doing a good job at promoting it.  Just hope they can break them back into the spotlight.","Have had this CD for less than 3 days , mind made up , best of this genre that I have heard this year .

A4OSXRZR2BMX8,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,2,"(2 & 1/2 stars) In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure.  When I played trumpet back then, I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like ""Questions 67 and 68.""  I even enjoyed their more ""lite rock"" phase of the '80s.  But all of that was then and this is now.  Their new ""XXX"" is not so hot.  The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD, ""King of Might Have Been.""  It's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of ""You're The Inspiration.""  The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now.  ""Inspiration"" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera (no longer in the band); ""King"" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing.  The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus (who?); ""Inspiration"" was filled with shimmering, subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster.  ""King"" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune; ""Inspiration"" is a classic that was co-written by Cetera and Foster.  And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole.  It's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago's glory days, but the fact remains that it's a pale imitation.

A couple of thoughts regarding the CD's title.  First, the album count has gotten shakier over the years.  I don't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection (ex., ""Chicago Love Songs"") should count toward the total.  So really they are nowhere near 30 albums.  Second, the movie rating implications of ""XXX"" seem to have completely escaped them, as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art.","In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure .

A30RI0AJ4CQBU1,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"Randy Newman has written many brilliant songs, but SAIL AWAY may well be his finest album.  The 2-minute ""Political Science"" is certainly one of his greatest achievements, and the song is just as timely now as it was in 1973.  What makes the lyric so great is that it distills exactly what so many Americans think about the world.  It could be your friendly next-door neighbor, who seems like a perfectly nice person until you stumble into a  political discussion, and then you realize that he is an immoral monster.  It seems to me that ""Political Science"" should be the national anthem -- it's what large numbers of Americans  really think, and if they disagree then they should be forced to change the attitude as well as the policies before they change the song.

 I would like to include the entire lyric, but here is a sample:

 ""We give them money, but are they grateful, no they're spiteful and they're hateful.  They don't respect us, so let's surprise 'em, let's drop The Big One and pulverize 'em.""

 ""Boom goes London, and boom Pay-ree, more room for you and more room for me.  Every city the whole world round will just be another American town, oh how peaceful it will be, we'll set everybody free ... They all hate us anyhow, so let's drop The Big One now.""

 Is Randy Newman being too sarcastic, too harsh?  Just look at the anti-French movement among the republicanus neanderthalis recently -- ""nuke France and gimme some Freedom Fries with my burger"" -- and it seems clear that if anything he is too kind.

 Thank goodness for Randy Newman in times like these.  Along with Mose Allison, Stan Ridgway (see my 7/29/04 review of his brilliant latest, SNAKEBITE), and a few other mavericks, he understands America's dark side well enough to deflate its pretensions and hypocrisy  with humor, from the inside.","Randy Newman has written many brilliant songs , but SAIL AWAY may well be his finest album .

A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"After a few albums of searching for a sound, Newman experimented and finally found his sound on ""Sail Away"". He experimented so much, in fact, that ""Randy Newman Live"" was released as a stopgap in 1971;it also previewed 2 songs from this album in stripped-down piano-only versions. The ""alternate"" take of the title track on this reissue shows just how much Newman experimented. Pounding anthemic rhythyms gave way to more lush but not overstated arrangements. The final release was very much worth the wait. Newman brings orchestra back into the fray after completely abandoning it on ""12 Songs"" (most likely the abandonment came as a result of the use - and sometimes abuse - of orchestra on his debut album). Newman's piano and the orchestra meld wonderfully in the mix. Some of the arrangements are downright amazing (especially on the title track and ""He Gives Us All His Love""). Thematically the album could not be more diverse: God, death, politics, satire at a Swiftian level, sex, and success. Newman's ability to communicate cynical satire in a way that takes itself seriously without seeming self-righteous is displayed all over this album. When he's funny he's also profound. ""God's Song"" is hilarious while at the same time chilling. The same could be said for the sadly still all too relevant ""Political Science"". In the midst of these songs, the serious numbers are almost shocking. There probably hasn't been a more candid song about death and belief than ""Old Man"". Newman claims that audiences have walked out on this one, so he's stopped playing it. It's a great song, but yes, an absolute downer. ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" evokes the era the song is set in complete with breeze and front porch swing. ""Memo to My Son"" is an absolutely hilarious song about parenting; the character in the song promises to show his son how smart he is, and then rattles off clich after clich. ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" has become a very recognizable song, maybe one of Newman's best known songs (even for people who have no idea who Randy Newman is).
The bonus tracks on the reissue are interesting: ""Let It Shine"" is an upbeat and happy song more akin to Newman's movie soundtracks of late. It was written for a sitcom that apparently never aired, which explains the mood. ""Maybe I'm Doing it Wrong"" was included on ""Randy Newman Live""; this is the studio version complete with orchestration. The rest are demos of songs on ""Sail Away"". All are good tracks that complement the album well.
It's no surprise that this album is considered a classic by many critics. It's one of Newman's best, and one of his best-sellers. A good album to introduce someone to Newman's music. It was the first Newman album I heard, and I've been a voracious fan ever since.","After a few albums of searching for a sound , Newman experimented and finally found his sound on "" Sail Away "" .

Randy's use of major and minor keys enhances the songs all the more, especially in stellar numbers like ""Lonely at the Top"" which discusses quite frankly the price of celebrity; ""Sail Away"" about slavery in America from the point of view of a slave trader in Africa during the time of slavery; deep thoughts about God heard in both ""He Gives Us All His Love"" and ""God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind);"" the evils of potential nuclear warfare in ""Political Science"" while pointing out that the people dropping the bombs would be too ignorant to realize that they're ruining the world instead of making it a better place; sex in ""You Can Leave Your Hat On;"" ""Memo to My Son"" which shows how an older man really doesn't know all that much about life; the memorable ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" and more. Several of the songs are also quite amusing such as ""Memo to My Son"" and ""Political Science.""

Another thing I like about this edition of ""Sail Away"" is that we get some fine bonus tracks not found on the original CD release (and they certainly weren't on the original record album release, either).

The opening five acoustic tracks are warm and intimate if not overly spectacular. The Pig Pen sung Katie Mae stands out a bit from the rest. The Smokestack Lightning jams are a bit excessive even though they can be a bit mesmerizing if you merely have them on in the background. However, the highlights of this disc are Pig Pen's stylish singing on Big Boss Man and Hard To Handle. Old Piggie sure knew how to sing the blues.
Anyway, definitely like Jerry Garcia's interpretation of Sitting On Top Of The World. Again, Good Lovin' is another bonus track on this CD as it was on Europe 72. The jam is somewhat excessive although the drum solo is pretty captivating.
Again like Europe 72, several good moments and I like the idea of both acoustic and electric sides of the Grateful Dead. However some of the jamming certainly goes off the deep end.

Written by Stevie Nicks, it became the only U.S. number one hit for the group, and even today, so many years later, it remains one of their best known songs. That first LP went it's own way years later, but was replaced with a CD copy. That one still surfaces in my untidy collection now and then, but when I saw the MP3 version here, it was an instant no brainer to grab it.

That classic classic disc was the number-one album on the charts for over 30 weeks, and Rolling Stone named ""Rumours"" as the 25th greatest album of all time. Today it ranks as the 10th best-selling album ever, with more than 40 million copies sold to date, and it features four top 10 singles. ""Rumors"" won the 1977 best album Grammy, and even 35 years later, it today remains remains the band's most successful effort, and ready to be shared with yet another generation.

These are the album tracks on the MP3 version here:

1. Second Hand News (LP Version); 2:53
2. Dreams (LP Version); 4:13
3. Never Going Back Again (LP Version); 2:15
4. Don't Stop (LP Version); 3:13
5. Go Your Own Way (LP Version); 3:35
6. Songbird (LP Version); 3:23
7. The Chain (LP Version); 4:31
8. You Make Loving Fun (LP Version); 3:29
9. I Don't Want To Know (LP Version); 3:15
10. Oh Daddy (LP Version); 3:57
11. Gold Dust Woman (LP Version); 5:02

For this listener, the only other song that I would have liked included here is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Springs-Live-Album-Version/dp/B0027FZ1X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Springs (Live Album Version)</a>&nbsp;as it was on the 2004 remastered reissue of the album, but luckily for us, it's still available here as a single. The quality of the recordings in this MP3 version are excellent, and the carryover from the LP versions are excellent. Listen to the vocals and instrumentation and you'll see for yourself.

For newcomers to Fleetwood Mac, the group consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. This was their eleventh studio album, and the recording sessions were marked by quite a bit of interpersonal strife between members of the group; and these experiences showed up in some of the album's lyrics. There are plenty of postings out there on the 'Net about the background behind this album, so I won't add to them here. Needless to say, ""Rumors""  remains the group's most successful effort, and for many it's the best album they made.

As a side note, the front cover of album featured a stylized shot of drummer Mick Fleetwood and vocalist Stevie Nicks dressed in her ""Rhiannon"" stage persona. The photograph was taken by Herbert Worthington, a friend of Stevie Nicks for over 30 years, and he and Stevie have collaborated on thousands of her best photographs over the years.

A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B00123NC8G,1,1,5,"""Rumours"" probably forever ruined the old tried and True maxim ""no dating in the band!"" Anyone fed that line today can simply respond, ""yeah, that so didn't work for Fleetwood Mac."" Arguably, dating, not to mention other things, in the band likely gave Fleetwood Mac an ineffable edge to help them attain unimaginable heights of popular music. An unanswerable question lingers as to how the album would have turned out had the band's relationships not gone sour. No one will ever know, of course. And that's very much OK. Because regardless of the emotional miasma, drama, drugs and whatever else went on, the late 1970s line up of the then nearly 10 year old Fleetwood Mac released a hugely acclaimed, and not often disputed, classic rock/pop album.

No doubt the ""real"" rumors in the press and subsequent documentaries detailing the band members' intimacies and the undoubtedly uncomfortable situation surrounding the recording of the album have contributed to this album's staying power. Everyone likes a good drama, after all, especially from a distance. This may have led to the creation of a new recording industy marketing strategy: take a collection of great songs, add interpersonal drama and a mega-hit will result. Struggling band managers may have started complaining ""Hey! Why is no one dating in this band?!? Come on! Start kissing!"" The trick, of course, remains writing a collection of great songs. And without the unquestionably great songs the drama behind the classic ""Rumours"" (spelled in the British manner for obvious reasons) probably wouldn't hold anyone's interest for too long. Many may have come to this album titillated by the drama or mesmerized by the sales figures and ended up staying for a direct emotional connection to the music.

And this much hyperbolized, mega-selling, nearly ubiquitous and archetypal album definitely includes plenty of great songs. They mostly speak for themselves. And surprisingly they don't sound bitter or vindictive apart from a lyric here and there. Almost anyone alive and within ear distance of rock and pop radio from 1977 to the present has very likely heard many of these songs willingly or unwillingly. The generations born after the 1960s probably didn't even know that they've actually heard most of this album until they put it on. Likely they repeat, ""Oh yeah, I've heard that one! That's Fleetwood Mac?"" throughout the first listen.

The album's galloping fade up beginning, ""Second Hand News,"" pulls in helpless cochleas with the distinctive layering of Lindsey Buckingham's vocals and the nearly addictive hooks and catches between the vocals. The brain almost doesn't have time to respond before the vocals begin. The beautiful contrast of ""Dreams"" lets hungry brains know that this album isn't blandly homogenous, but unpredictable and adventurous. And the folk-rocky mostly finger-picked acoustic ""Never Going Back Again"" just adds to the sonorous intrigue. ""Don't Stop"" picks up the pace again which continues through the grinding and angry-without-being-angry ""Go Your Own Way."" An interlude with ""Songbird"" (the only track recorded in an arena) sets the stage for the poignant and hopeful ""The Chain,"" one of the album's highlights. And that's only the first song of side two, in the language of 33 1/3 LPs. The rest of the album maintains the momentum, ending with the intense and brooding ""Gold Dust Woman,"" supposedly about the lure of the snort. Only ""I Don't Want To Know"" and ""Oh Daddy"" come close to subpar songs, but only in contrast with the rest of the album.

""Rumours"" will likely stand for quite some time as one of the pinnacles of 1970s rock/pop. It still hasn't gone away. Whether future generations not yet emerged from birth canals also fervently embrace it remains to be seen. But rumor has it that they just might.",""" Rumours "" probably forever ruined the old tried and True maxim "" no dating in the band !

A1RUBF0FK78E5Y,B00123KEGO,1,1,4,"I got this CD a few years back. My favorite track by far is Jolly Old Saint Nicholas, a song you don't hear that often. Chicago takes it and rocks it to perfection. God Rest Ye Marry Gentlemen is also a favorite of mine. Chicago has taken their trademark horn riffs and harmonies and have put out one heck of a rockin' holiday album. There are slow tempo songs too that sound just as great. This is a CD to get if you want a rockin' Christmas.","I got this CD a few years back .

A11GY1G10WSE8,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,"Rhino Records which has already released a dozen of Chicago's first albums as enhanced re-issues, has put out this 20 song offering.  Chicago : What's It Gonna Be Santa"" is a re-issue of ""Chicago XXV"" , a superb contemporary collection of Christmas classics with a Chicago original mixed in. This new release however, adds six newly recorded tracks to the 14 on Chicago XXV, making an already good thing even better.

The original selection of Christmas tunes is simply terrific. Chicago, following in the approach of ""Night and Day Big Band"" wherein the American supergroup re-arranged big band classics with an inventive and fresh variety of styles, tempos and grooves, takes a similar artistic path with their Christmas release.

Such holiday standards as ""White Christmas"" and ""The Christmas Song"" are done in an uptempo pop-funk style while ""Let It Snow!"" shows off Chicago's ability to really rock in a blues shuffle groove. Bill Champlin's soulful ""Have Yourself a Merry Little"" Christmas"" gives this moody classic a wonderfully original blues treatment. And, throughout the disc, the legendary Chicago horns play through trombonist Jimmy Pankow's melodic arrangements in their unique, warm and fat style.

The six new tracks really compliment the original CD, adding even more new styles and sounds. The disc's opener, Bobby Lamm's ""Winter Wonderland"" lays down an infectious rock groove with excellent vocal arrangements making great use of Chicago's arsenal of superb vocalists. Lead guitarist Keith Howland who covers some tunes in concert, shows off his first studio lead vocal with a quick tempo pop rock version of ""Jolly Old Saint Nicholas"". Bassist Jason Scheff's tenor has never sounded better than on ""This Christmas"", which has a wonderful 70's soul retro sound with the Chicago horns propelling the arrangement. Bill Champlin again shows why he is probably the greatest blue-eyed soul singer around with a gutsy, funky ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"". It sounds like an odd combination, but this track really works.

Following up to his terrific arrangement of ""Let It Snow!"", trumpeter Lee Loughnane pens a superb shuffle version of ""Sleigh Ride"". Again, he steps behind the microphone to tackle lead vocal duties and his deep voice, reminiscent of the late Terry Kath's depth and timbre lends itself perfectly to this classic.

""Chicago: What's It Gonna Be Santa"" is just terrific and certainly one of the most inventive and eclectic holiday CD's by any artist. There's something for everyone here to enjoy.

Essential holiday listening as well as essential Chicago.","Rhino Records which has already released a dozen of Chicago 's first albums as enhanced re - issues , has put out this 20 song offering .

AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,"I hadn't even realized that the powerhouse group Chicago had done a Christmas album.  This is a great album by one of the best bands in the world.  Their treatment of some of the classic Christmas songs is typical Chicago style.  Their muscial stylings are not at all hampered by limitations of the seasonal music as one reviewer suggests.  Track #18 ""A Childs Prayer"" is so sweetly performed.  You'd think a band like this wouldn't be able to play something like it without overdoing it.  The songs that Chicago chose to place on this album tell me that this is not just a performance album.  Rather, Christmas has a certain meaning to the members of Chicago.

I believe this should definately become part of your holiday music library.  It's Christmas music with a jolt.  Please treat yourself!","I had n't even realized that the powerhouse group Chicago had done a Christmas album . This is a great album by one of the best bands in the world .
