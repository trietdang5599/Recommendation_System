AOTI3CIX0ORAW,B001V7K5I8,-1,1,5,"Already Gone is one of Kelly Clarkson's most haunting songs ever.

A little precursor.
Kelly had originally wrote the song ALREADY GONE.  Producer Ryan Tedder, from One Republic, helped polish the song with Clarkson and then produced it.  Unfortunately for Kelly, after Ryan had finished work with Kelly on her album (with about 6 or so songs) he went to work with Beyonce on her new album.  Ryan used a similar, BUT NOT THE SAME, backing track for Beyonce's HALO. (Essentially a similar backing drum beat)

Be it Beyonce's label or management, knowingly or unknowingly, put a rush to release HALO before Clarkson's camp had time to release ALREADY GONE.

Since Halo was released to radio first, most listeners draw comparisions from Halo to Already Gone.  Kelly has been ridiculed for the similarities when it wasn't even her fault the situation occured.  She worked with Tedder first, and her song Already Gone was written and produced first.  After the fact, she heard Halo and called Ryan to voice her displeasure.

Kelly fought with her label to not release Already Gone as her third single. Not for the fact she doesn't like the song, but out of respect for Beyonce.  Since Halo was still on the charts, Kelly felt it would be disrepectful to Beyonce to release the song. Her label defied her wishes and released the song anyway.  Kelly has since changed the production of the song during her live performances on television and on her ALL I EVER WANTED TOUR to discourage any similarities from her song ALREADY GONE to HALO.

NOW.
Already Gone ranks right up there with Because of You as one of her songs that you can feel the depth, the soul, the lyrics, and the emotion.  Kelly can sing anything and make it sound good, but she strikes it home with the haunting and gut wrenching ballads she so skillfully and masterfully performs.

THE VIDEO.
Joseph Kahn was a little perturbed about the video to ALREADY GONE.  IF you will notice the song is actually well over 4 minutes long on the album.  The video is only about 3:30.  The video was shot to incorporate the entire song, but RCA feeling the video was too dark, edited a large majority.  The video that was left is centered around Clarkson with subtle hints that she is a ghost.  What the viewers are missing is some sort of death/suicide scene which RCA felt would revert Kelly back into the My December ages.  Viewers and fans alike feel differently as a final conclusion would have made the music video complete.

Kelly is a True gem who is completely underrated.  This girl can sing anything.

Anyone that denies her of her talent needs to see her live.

I challenge anyone with a negative image of this girl go to a concert and come out feeling the same.

Its okay if you don't like her music, but don't hate the girl.  She has threw away the typical Hollywood celebrity image and made her own.

As Kelly has said ALL SHE EVER WANTED is to make good music.","Already Gone is one of Kelly Clarkson 's most haunting songs ever . A little precursor .

To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.","To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time , and it has a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw .

A39H5ZCKFUMO2K,B00299CER2,-1,1,5,"I watched Green Day with more scrutiny than ever last night on SNL as I wanted to see if selections from the new album produced the continuity emanating from American Idiot that I was rooting for. The last set was an emotionally tearing selection entitled 21 Guns. The song was masterfully weaved by Billy Joe with his inimitable vocals and guitar playing and I saw the content as something that will be very big in these days of disillusionment and an unknown future. In other words, these are the times of Green Day input. Undoubtedly this was protest, not punk. I did download the MP3 from this site but not to cherry pick. This album from Green Day, 21 Century Breakdown from what I have read is another memorable offering from the Oakland generational heroes and as soon as my backlog shrinks somewhat I will purchase the CD.

A1LBIZLET9CW1I,B0029KY8WU,1,-1,3,"For the past few years, Gregory Alan Isakov has been making welcome appearances on my Pandora stations. His songs are pleasant, melodic, sad. They make for good, almost sleepy background listening. They are as pleasant as anything you will find on the market, but my criticism is that except for a couple of songs (""Master & A Hound"", and maybe ""The Moon Song"") they aren't much more than pleasant. They don't make me want to put down what I'm doing. They don't make me want to close my eyes. They are just Pleasant.

The songs' emotion feels real but restrained. In most songs, he sounds like he's singing out of the back of his throat, with his mouth barely open. I haven't seen him sing, but I suspect that he rarely opens his mouth wide enough to see his teeth. He sounds restrained, hesitant, unwilling to quite come out.

With that said, Isakov has shown flashes. Master & A Hound is much better than pleasant, but still has a frustrating current of restraint. The guy is a brick wall away from being really good.","For the past few years , Gregory Alan Isakov has been making welcome appearances on my Pandora stations .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0029Q19M6,1,-1,3,"When it has came down to rarp music, controversy and all, it has been over a decade since Eminem came out swinging with My Name Is. While he has his share of public and personal heartbreak, he has had songs with amusing videos that would make you laugh, and deeper songs that stood still. That honestly is the same with Beautiful, the second single from his returning album Relapse. the song is very dark, but does state well with a hard core stand still, whether you can't get out of a jam, or dealing with heartbreak. While the song isn't as driven as was the case with his Oscar-winning Lose Yourself, Eminem holds his own fairly well. While he has been lately making a bit more news on his war of words with Mariah Carey, he still knows how to rap. I do hope his next single from Relapse though, can have a bit more from what I had heard from what Slim Shady made to be.

AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002M9RCIU,1,-1,3,"THE BLUE RIDGE RANGERS RIDES AGAIN has quite a few flaws (starting with the tongue-twisting, grammar-defying title): much of the song selection is ho-hum (John Denver?  Really?); the arrangements are often uninspired (""Never Ending Song of Love"" sounds just like every other country-tinged bluegrass love song); and even Fogerty himself tends to slack off a bit here and there.

But you should still listen to this album.  Why?  Because, despite its flaws, there are still a few career-defining moments here.  Fogerty's take on ""Haunted House"" is truly inspired; as is his collaboration with the Boss on ""When Will I Be Loved"" (talk about a final double-whammy).  His duet (can I call it that?) with Don Henley and Timothy Schmidt on ""Garden Party"" plays out like a sixties/seventies country-rock wet dream (the Eagles and CCR collide; it's just as amazing as you would expect).

The problem is, Fogerty never really sounds like himself.  I have yet to hear the original BLUE RIDGE RANGERS album; it was on my shopping list at one point, but got knocked aside for whatever reasons.  I still intend to purchase it; John Fogerty is a musical icon, a True rock/country legend who deserves every bit of respect (and, yes, disrespect) he's garnered.  But THE BLUE RIDGE RANGERS RIDES AGAIN just doesn't sound much like a Fogerty record; we get the lovable, happily-married guy on a few tracks, and he sounds genuinely blissful (bliss is boring, as the rock adage goes), but we don't get much of the angry rocker; he comes close on John Prine's ""Paradise,"" though he gives the tune a more up-tempo melody than it necessitates (check out Johnny Cash's PERSONAL FILE for a very haunting version of the tune).  Still, it's nice to hear Fogerty's take on the classic; and it's nice to hear his interpretations of all these songs.  The record is heavily flawed in spots, but when it shines, it's blinding.  If you're a fan of Fogerty or CCR, you need to pick up a copy of this album.

A1XP7P3X9MRE5H,B002M9RCIU,1,-1,3,"This second round with the Blue Ridge Rangers / John Fogerty is probably largely as one would expect it. Very accomplished and well-played! What it needs is perhaps a few more surprises. The traditional country are largely allowed to draw the picture. The song choice is probably okay; a mixture of well-known standards and a few more obscure country songs, but in either case the arrangements contain few surprises.

The album opens well with John Prine's ""Paradise"", which probably has all a good classic country song should.  Among the following songs Rick Nelson's ""Garden Party"" definitely is a number that deserves to be revisited; unfortunately the arrangement is so faithfull to Nelson's original that experiment almost seems superfluous.

Actually I first really woke up when the tones of track 7th were to be heard. Where was it I'd heard this song before?? - Oh, yes. . It was Fogerty's own ""Change in the Weather"" from the overlooked album ""Eye of the Zombie"". Definitely one of this album's highlights and more ""CCR"" than the original version, which is also very good.

""Moody River"" was a nice beat, and it is altogether a fine melancholy tune.

The final track is Everly Brothers' ""When Will I Be Loved"", which is one of the few songs which has really been given a different treatment - a more rocking arrangement, and with a surprise guest vocal by Bruce Springsteen.

All in all a solid album from Fogerty, which however, contains only few surprises.","This second round with the Blue Ridge Rangers / John Fogerty is probably largely as one would expect it .

Actually I first really woke up when the tones of track 7th were to be heard . Where was it I 'd heard this song before ? ? Oh , yes . . It was Fogerty 's own "" Change in the Weather "" from the overlooked album "" Eye of the Zombie "" . Definitely one of this album 's highlights and more "" CCR "" than the original version , which is also very good . "" Moody River "" was a nice beat , and it is altogether a fine melancholy tune . The final track is Everly Brothers ' "" When Will I Be Loved "" , which is one of the few songs which has really been given a different treatment - a more rocking arrangement , and with a surprise guest vocal by Bruce Springsteen . All in all a solid album from Fogerty , which however , contains only few surprises ."
AKG9D4CL5MIS9,B002M9RCIU,1,-1,3,"This outing is well-sung and well-played.  It is certainly cool to hear Fogerty and Springsteen singing together.  The song selection is solid.  But, it lacks excitement and surprise.  Fogerty does not push himself on this one, and that's too bad.","This outing is well - sung and well - played .

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B002M9RCIU,1,-1,3,"I have never been a fan of country music, and I suppose John Fogerty isn't considered country. No, he's more country rock--a genre that has all but died out with the 70's. Yet it is Fogerty and Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) that hooked me into anything resembling country or country rock music along with The Eagles. Each Fogerty album is an experiment with something new. I have no expectations for history repeating when I listen to Fogerty, and there's just something about his music that's always solid.

""The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again"" introduced some new songs and artists that I otherwise would have never listened to. Now I know John Prine has been around since 1971, but I had never listened to anything from him, and I could not for the life of me name any songs from him either. ""Paradise"" is a well written song, and I like how Fogerty plays it. I also had heard the name Bonnie & Delany but never listened to them either. I can't say that I am a big fan of ""Never Ending Song Of Love"". It seemed rather one note to me. I am familiar with Rick Nelson's 1972 hit ""Garden Party"" and I think this is one of Fogerty's finest interpretations here. Superbly performed with Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmidt. I might even like it better than Rick Nelson's version! I had never heard of Buck Owens, nor had I heard ""I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me)"". I can't say that I am a fan. Again, a rather one note song. I am very familiar with John Denver's ""Back Home Again"", and try as I might, I found Fogerty's version lacking. You really can't touch John Denver. He brought something very special to his music, and he was one of a kind. Fogerty does a serviceable job with it, it's just nothing special. I had never heard of Ray Price or ""I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)"", and I must say that I like Fogerty's choice, and it piqued my interest in Price.

I don't know what to make of Fogerty doing Fogerty on a revision of ""Change In The Weather"" from his 1986 ""Eye Of The Zombie"" album. I've always liked the song to begin with, and this new version didn't really add or subtract anything from the original version. I like the original better. I know who Pat Boone is, but I never listened to his music, but ""Moody River"" is one of the highlights here. Fogerty does a great job with this song, and it's a well written piece. It's surprising to me that in 1961 this song was a hit considering the subject matter. I had never heard of The Kendalls or their 1977 song ""Heaven's Just A Sin Away"", and I thought it was pleasant, but nothing special here. Another Ray Price song, ""Falling Falling Falling"" was okay, not great. Jumpin' Gene Simmons' 1964 hit ""Haunted House"" was just okay. I know Fogerty and Springsteen singing together for the first time on The Everly Brothers 1960 hit ""When Will I Be Loved"" was supposed to be a main draw here, and I like all three artists, but this comes across overdone.

So, a three and a half star album. Above average, but not quite great. Here's how this compares to Fogerty's back catalog:

1968 Creedence Clearwater Revival: Three Stars
1969 Born On The Bayou: Three and a Half Stars
1969 Green River: Five Stars
1969 Willie And The Poor Boys: Five Stars
1970 Cosmo's Factory: Four Stars

1973 The Blue Ridge Rangers: Three and a Half Stars

1976 Hoodoo: Unreleased--find the master tapes and put it on the market please!
1985 Centerfield: Five Stars
1986 Eye Of The Zombie: Four Stars (yes, four stars, it's a solid album)
1997 Blue Moon Swamp: Three Stars
2004 Deja Vu All Over Again: Three and a Half Stars
2007 Revival: Three and a Half Stars

A12M96JJHEOYMT,B002M9RCIU,1,-1,3,"John Fogerty's first incarnation of his alter-ego ache to record the songs that influenced him, ""Blue Ridge Mountain Rangers"" was a surprising hit in 1972/73. Creedence Clearwater had broke up, and John recorded that LP on his own, C/W R/B Gospel songs that he loved and glory be! a couple of top 50 hits,""Jambalaya"" and ""Hearts of Stone"".

Now, Blue Ridge Mt. Rangers redux. The songs on this CD has the feeling that JF really liked and listened to mid 70's contempory singer/songwriters John Prine's ""Paradise"", John Denver (!)""Back Home Again"". Who knew?

This collection of apparently his newer/older fave songs is bunches of fun.
1) Paradise  the John Prine song sounds fine  the vocals are near the CCR growl
2) Never Ending Song  Delaney and Bonnie had a Top 10 hit with this laid back so-called motel shot  John's version is almost exact from the background yelps of the girls. Nice tribute to D/B!! But, still D/B's version better..
3)Garden Party  Rick Nelson's version is the Classic  Don Henley (Eagles) assists on vocals  sounds like karoke  makes Rick's version sound even more important
4)  Just as Long as You Love Me  A Buck Owens song that John sings as easy as taking a tiger by the tail
5) Back Home Again  John Denver had a previous life as a folk singer/w/ '60s friends  No one would dispute his talent for writing a fine melody/lyric  John F. found it with this version
6) I'll be There  a Ray Price rave-up  this song could have been standard on the First Rangers LP  great fun
7) Change in the Weather  A CCR bonus cut  maybe not  but still a perfect song fitted to ""Bayou Country""  maybe the best cut on the CD
8) Moody River  Pat Boone would NEVER be considered an influence.. or maybe John liked Pat's 1961 #1 hit about the dark river death that took his baby's life. This song with it's bumping bass line and the disquiet pain led to John's vocal ability to tell a story
9) Heavens Just a Sin Away  John's gospel voice pure and sweet.
10) Fallin' Fallin' Fallin""  Rockabilly as good as it gets
11) Haunted House  A fun version of Gene Simmons 1961 hit
12) When Will I be Loved  Not maybe can compete with the Everly Bros. Linda Ronstadt had a hit w/this (ugh)  others tried  mostly awful
  this version with Bruce Springsteen on accompaning vocals id the prize of the CD.
  This should be released as a single on Country/Adult Comtempory radio A great hit awaits

This was my first taste of Manowar back in the day, and I was a little confused about it at first.  I wasn't sure if they were trying to be funny or not.  Well, since I got more into them over the years I know that these guys are dead serious about what they're doing.  They're music and image is extremely cornball, I would hope even the most hardcore fan could admit to seeing a bit of humor in it all.  But to me, that's all a part of what makes Manowar Manowar.  These guys are the epitome of male ma-cheese-mo;  I mean, they're the total embodiment of tough guy-Conan-badass-motorcycle riding-sexist-violent maleness taken to it's most extreme.  It makes you want to strip down to your undies and run about the house wielding an invisible sword while munching on a giant turkey leg.  And that's just the way they portray themselves.  But, for all of this braggadocio these guys really do know how to play, they're not all about image.  Eric Adams has one helluva voice though it sounds like he's straining too hard on the high notes.  When you listen to his raspy high pitched scream, you can just envision him with a blue face, veins bulging, on the verge of his head exploding.  That's a singer.  So, say what you want about them, but there's only one Manowar.  If you're curious, it wouldn't hurt to give this album a spin.  I would think most heavy metal fans will get something out of Manowar, even if it is only a good laugh.  I think you'd have to be a real stiff to wholeheartedly say that you ""hate"" them, but there are certainly many out there who do.  However, there isn't one group in existence that isn't hated by someone somewhere.

While one was exciting (the former), the other was a little disheartening (the latter). Being that Dr. Dre is a bit of a nitpicker, he has a tendency to shelve albums...just ask King Tee, Rakim, and Stat Quo. So, when months and even years passed by, this album started to become existent in name only. It was scheduled for a late 2008 release, but Dr. Dre wasn't happy with the results. Also, the album's executive producer (and Raekwon's labelmate) Busta Rhymes had left Aftermath, which put the project into limbo. So, Raekwon took the masters and left for EMI Records to put out ""Only Built For Cuban Linx, Part II"".

Production on this album is almost flawless, with production from Marley Marl, Pete Rock, The RZA, The Alchemist and the late J. Dilla.

It was easy to imagine putting various CDs into a stereo and hitting the shuffle button only to guess which group was blaring through the speakers. A few tracks share this on new sophomore set ""Love Drunk,"" but the majority retain distinct flavor.

The verses surrounding the chorus of the Top 40 title track are probing and intriguing, and the jagged, fluctuating ear candy chorus of opening cut ""Heart Heart Heartbreak,"" another potential hit single, indicates that the band has grown stronger. ""The Real Thing,"" which smacks of Bon Jovi (in this case, a good thing) has an awesome lyric which works in all the right spots - relatable sans cliches, stream-of-conscious without being offbeat - as well as a winning, bombastic melody and awesome guitar riffs.

These are the kinds of songs that stick around in the minds of listeners upon repeated plays without wearing out their welcome prematurely, and they make merely adequate tracks like ""Shot Heard 'Round the World"" and the cute but less interesting ""Contagious"" sound better by rubbing against them.

Of particular interest are the ballads, the best of which find the band hitting a particular stride and threshold of quality. It is a lyrically banal coming-of-age tune, but ""Someone Like You,"" with its solid, memorable melody and soul-searching, emotionally sincere vocal performance from frontman Martin Johnson elevate it to a stone cold winner. The lo-fi closer ""Go"" has beauty and bite,  and ""Two Is Better Than One,"" which is aided more by Taylor Swift's big-thing-of-the-moment star power than quality vocals (she does fine, but technically she is not ideal), is a potential monster hit with its sweeping arrangements and over-the-top romantic idealism. It is precision-tooled to win over legions of young women and annoy their boyfriends for extended lengths of time.

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B002MUV9NI,1,-1,3,"In the span of time from their debut to their second album, ""Love Drunk,"" Boys Like Girls jump from punk-pop emo band to all out boy band power pop. This is not a completely bad thing, as the super sugar choruses and duet with Taylor Swift show. But the evolution is not without some speed bumps.

First off, the good stuff. The lead off track, ""Heart Heart Heartbreak"" is pure adrenaline hormonal rush. The repetitive title kills it in the chorus, making for a great little earworm. Then the title track revisits the zing of their debut. Then comes the head scratcher. ""Two Is Better Than One"" is a ballad, but strip some of the electricity out of it and factor in Taylor Swift, and you have a country tune that would have fit just as nicely on one of Swift's albums than it does here. It also shows that lead singer/guitarist Martin Johnson can work his way around a sappy ballad with the best of them. It's the hookier tunes that play to the band's punkier roots, like ""Contagious"" that work the best.

That's where things go somewhat awry. Propulsive emo-pop and power pop are great for the guys that need girls and the girls that break their hearts. But the new addition of strings and syrup (like the closer, ""Go,"" which limps the album to its end) make for the kind of song the band isn't quite up to yet. Add a southern accent and ditch the auto-tune, and these would be country ballads. While they make this country pop hybrid work much better on the follow-up, ""Crazy World,"" it's a tough sell on ""Love Drunk."" It's as if Boys Like Girls suddenly took on a split personality and couldn't decide it they wanted to stay True to their Boston Emo roots or just pack up the cats and relocate to Nashville.

That's the issue with ""Love Drunk."" You get two distinct bands on this album, the whiz-bang pop of the debut, and the country-pop that would dominate the next album. Boys Like Girls were in transition, and while ""Love Drunk"" did debut in the top ten, their three albums are essentially the work in progress of differing mindsets. There's plenty to like on the album. What there isn't? Consistency. Hence the solid C grade.","In the span of time from their debut to their second album , "" Love Drunk , "" Boys Like Girls jump from punk - pop emo band to all out boy band power pop .

That 's the issue with "" Love Drunk . "" You get two distinct bands on this album , the whiz - bang pop of the debut , and the country - pop that would dominate the next album . Boys Like Girls were in transition , and while "" Love Drunk "" did debut in the top ten , their three albums are essentially the work in progress of differing mindsets . There 's plenty to like on the album . What there is n't ? Hence the solid C grade ."

But at the same time, even with the cool snaps and the extremely powerful high note at the end, this song is missing lyrics. Probably a verse and a couple of choruses. And this is due to the fact that these days you need to have the song fit into a 3 minute length quota which is stupid. Some of the best R&B songs are longer, more subdued tracks.

But anyway, this remake isn't bad like some say it is but it's not as stunning as the original. It does however, have enough originality and Mariah imprint on it to be likeable.

All in all, a decent remake but she's done better.

My biggest qualm is that it was too short. Somehow, if she could have made it a 4 minute affair then this song would probably have scored higher for me.

3.5 stars.

end note: Get Mariah's latest album if you don't already have it. If you are a Mariah fan, and you liked her E=MC2, Emancipation of Mimi and Rainbow albums, then I think this album will be right up your alley.

Other tunes collected here are enjoyable, if not truly great: ""Wild West Show,"" ""Kick My A**,"" and ""Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace"" especially.

It's odd that they've released a GREATEST HITS almost completely full of album tracks.  Some (""Loud"" and ""Jalepeno"" specifically"") could've been replaced with far better selections (""I Pray for You"" ""Real World,"" and ""Deadwood Mountain"" come immediately to mind); others, such as ""Rollin' (The Ballad of Big & Rich)"" are perfect examples of why the boys have made such an impact: their ability to shirk the rules, to create country music that bends (and even redefines) genres.  Their debut album remains unashamedly one of my favorites; the follow-ups have decreased in quality, resulting in a GREATEST HITS that offers nothing new of note, and features some (let's face it) lackluster material.

A25JHXYK10F0A6,B002R4K6AG,1,-1,3,"I'm breaking a personal rule of mine with this review. I swore that I would never review anything before listening to it completely, with near-full attention - for at least two passes. The very existence of this disk scares such fear into me that I feel that I could never commit to two full listens without developing an intractable opinion, and I admit that my anticipation borders much more closely to fear than holiday cheer. This is Bob Dylan.... (pause required)... Old. Cranky. ""Legendary."" Impossibly inscrutable...(another pause required)... Bob Dylan. He's been with us - ALL of us - for over forty years. The guy's a Jew, fer Crissakes....(most of the time, anyway) and in the middle of a nearly miraculous career rebirth, he offers us a Christmas album?
 The first track is ""Here Comes Santa Claus."" I haven't even started to play the CD yet, but if you were me, what would you expect? Do you need to think about it? As I already pointed out, this is Dylan. I haven't played a single note of this disk yet, but a) I'm showing an obvious tendency toward prejudgment, and b) I feel drawn in, like a moth circling a gas lamp. I can't help but wonder how relevant it would be if I were to actually `expose' some of the lyrics. Let's try it:
 "" Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,
  Right down Santa Claus lane...""
 Wow. (Another pause is DEFINITELY required now...). As I type this, I'm hearing it for the first time, and I'm dumbfounded. This album's very existence is as improbable as monkeys on the moon. OK, the heck with it. I admit it, I'm suckered in. ""How would/could Dylan possibly sing this?"", I ask myself. The answer, I'm feeling, is ""Quite well"". Maybe I'm enjoying WAY too much holiday cheer at this exact moment, but Dylan just sang ""Winter Wonderland"" and I felt like drinking egg nog. He sounds forced as he croaks/sings, ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,"" but as I listen, I wonder if his interpretation may have value for breaking down religious barriers. Our culture has thoroughly analyzed every syllable that Bob has ever uttered, right? Maybe non-Christians will finally be able to ""interpret"" Christmas songs and apply totally new meanings to them. Or, maybe that's crazy. This album is simply too weird for me to predict how any individual person might react.
 In terms of quantity, it's generous, with fifteen tracks. One of them is ""Little Drummer Boy"". Another is ""Must Be Santa (!!), "" but there's authentic stuff here, too, like ""Adeste Fidelis"" and ""The First Noel."" The packaging conveys the dichotomy as well as anything possibly could. The cover shot is pure Currier and Ives, but inside is a shot that looks like vintage pin-up girl Betty Page. The music walks the same crooked path. It teases me with flashes of relevance, but then succumbs to stereotypes that border on the psychopathic. ""The Christmas Blues"" is easy to appreciate. ""O Little Town of Bethlehem,"" on the other hand, definitely is not. Once again, for the 50th time, we can't tell if Dylan is toying with us, or if he's simply following some extravagant muse. No Matter. Fifty years from now, my kids will try to capture the spirit of Christmas for their own grandkids. Doing so, they will be armed with Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Phil Spector....and perhaps Bob Dylan. Christmas albums come and Christmas albums go. Despite everything we throw at it, I believe that the spirit of Christmas will nevertheless survive. As Bob sings, ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" `B'...or maybe `C', or maybe even `A'. You figure it out.  Tom Ryan","I 'm breaking a personal rule of mine with this review .

Fifty years from now , my kids will try to capture the spirit of Christmas for their own grandkids . Doing so , they will be armed with Nat King Cole , Frank Sinatra , Phil Spector .... and perhaps Bob Dylan .

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B002R4K6AG,1,-1,3,"Almost 50 years into his musical career, and Bob Dylan still finds ways to enter unchartered territory (sort of) for him. Yes indeed, only 6 months after releasing the okay-but-not-super ""Together Through Life"" album now comes Bob Dylan's first Christmas album ever.

""Christmas In the Heart"" (15 tracks; 43 min.) is a collection of traditional Christmas songs, no new Dylan-penned material here. And that is not a slight, as Dylan has shown us that he loves bringing us the tradition of American music (Dylan-style Americana). But how do you bring Christmas songs into Americana without destroying the very psyche of these Christmas tunes? And that's where the problem arises. When listening to this, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or to cry, and instead simply scratched my head, incredulous at what I was hearing. Not helpful in this context is Bob's voice. While his low-fi singing doesn't deter (and in fact enhances) his last couple of studio albums, it simply doesn't work on here, as Bob's voice has the finesse of a bull in a china shop.

If I had to point to some highlights on here, I'll go with ""Here Comes Santa Claus"", ""Hark The Herald Angels Sing"", and best of all ""O' Come All Ye Faithfull (Adeste Fideles)"", with Bob singing the first few lines in the original Latin words. Worst of all on here for me is """"Must Be Santa"", with is brought at breakneck speed, sort of like a freightrain barrelling down the tracks. Bottom line, I have no idea what Dylan really expected to bring with this album. Far superior to this album instead was Dylan's 2006 Christmas special on his XM radio show called ""Dylan's Rockin' Xmas"", in which Dylan brought a fantastic mix of Christmas trivia, stories, jokes and a whole bunch of Christmas-related r&b, ska, garage rock and tex-mex tunes.","Almost 50 years into his musical career , and Bob Dylan still finds ways to enter unchartered territory ( sort of ) for him .

In one of the most awkward love triangles since Twilight, meet the key players:

YOU are the guy Orianthi is hung up on. You are a Grade A hole.

I is for Orianthi, the gifted singer and guitar goddess who is most popular for standing next to famous people (Michael Jackson, Carrie Underwood, Alice Cooper).

HIM is the guy who sees I for everything she is worth.

According to YOU, I'm stupid, worthless, can't do anything right, a mess in a dress, boring, moody, can't get anywhere on time (since this last point isn't subjective and can be proved or disproved by fact, I, as in me not her, bet he, as in YOU, has her, Orianthi, pegged).

According to HIM, I'm beautiful, incredible, funny, irresistible - so naturally WE (me and you, the reader of this essay, and YOU, the jerk she is hung up on since she just told him a verse ago) can deduct that I has no interest in dating HIM.

Never once in this song do we hear what I thinks about herself. Never once does she utter the words, ""According to ME, I'm fabulous, smart, intelligent, well-read, talented...""

So the message is - Girls, your self-worth is totally defined by what men think about you. Good or bad.

Nice message. Wait, it gets worse.

Fine, I doesn't like HIM; he's probably a bit too clingy anyway. So what does she do? Hold her head high enough to find someone worthwhile of her companionship? No. Define herself on her own by not needing someone to complete her? No chance. I uses HIS opinion of her to beg YOU to come back.

Kid you not, she says, ""Why can't YOU see me through HIS eyes? Why are you making me decide?"" Um, decide WHAT? Stay in an abusive relationship with YOU, the guy who I just told us that he just told you that ""he can't take you anyplace?"" YOU have moved on. I should too.

To be fair, I didn't write this song, THEY (Steve Diamond and Andrew Frampton) did. Perhaps it would be best for Orianthi to speak for herself from now on.","If you ignore the lyrics , this is a great song .

A1IIUCG9TJFUWS,B002TA4MSU,-1,1,4,"It's a bit disappointing to see a recording artist do this kind of thing -- Bad Romance is obviously a re-worked version of Poker Face -- I really would have liked to hear something truly new.

A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B002TA2CM8,1,-1,3,"Like many metal fans, my TSO fandom is deeply rooted in their association to the criminally underrated band Savatage.  TSO is the remaining Savatage members, the producer/main songwriter, Paul O'Neill, along with a bunch of additional musicians and of course, an orchestra.  The music and story concepts are basically in the same vein as they were in Savatage, but a bit more orchestral with the metal toned down a bit.  Basically TSO is Savatage-lite.  Paul O'Neill basically started TSO on a kind of whim in order to deliver a holiday themed album based on the success of a Savatage song.  While a very musically talented group, it always seemed like a halfassed project that got lucky(Jon Oliva has even said himself that he does this band to basically pay the bills.  His role anymore in TSO is basically just playing keyboards).  Now, Paul devotes all his time to TSO and basically left Savatage to more or less fade away to a footnote in heavy metal history.  Doesn't seem quite fair, but at least Savatage lives on to a certain degree.  TSO has always been looked at as a seasonal kind of event, an annual tradition to take the family to when they swing through your hometown.  So, TSO has been a holiday household name ever since.  I'm not sure how well Beethoven's Last Night sold, but it was very refreshing to see a TSO album on the shelves that wasn't Christmas themed.  Not that I have anything against the Christmas albums, but who throws The Christmas Attic in their cd player in mid July?  It was cool to see TSO become a band that wasn't strictly associated with one specific time of the year.
That brings us to Night Castle, an album which has been in the works for what seems like 800 years now(they played songs from it when I saw them in 2004!).  All this anticipation will undoubtedly create high expectations, which is kind of a curse coz you really can't live up to it(Phantom Menace anyone?).
Well, Night Castle's sound is what you pretty much expect it to be.  But honestly, I find myself getting kinda bored of it after awhile.  I love orchestral and progressive rock/metal, but there's too much of a sameness to this.  The story isn't bad, but it's a little lacking, especially when compared to O'Neill's previous stories. I can't honestly say it's bad musically-it's actually very good-it's just a bit monotonous, not much variance at all.  It's missing something.  Also, as many have said before, a bunch of Savatage tunes are used here as well, mostly instrumental.  I suppose I don't have too much of an issue with this, after all they are O'Neill's songs, but it just seems a bit cheap to fill space with songs that have been done before, especially for an album that has been in the works this long.  This is a bit irritating to me on Disc 2 with the bonus track, ""Believe"", one of the most cherished of Savatage songs from the album Streets.  I'm not sure why this was done at all coz most would agree that you simply cannot touch that song.  As far as ""Believe"" goes, Savatage vocalist Jon Oliva is what made a great song a friggin phenomenal and unforgettable song.  Oliva's performance will damn near make your eyes tear up.  No disrespect to vocalist Tim Hockenberry, who does the TSO version, but he just doesn't hold a candle to Oliva.  It actually sounds alot like Joe Cocker singing ""Believe"".  TSO's vocalists have never been all that great.  Not bad singers by any means(at least they sing, a rare thing anymore), but they've always sounded(to me anyway) like weaker and clumsier versions of Zak Stevens.
In all honesty, it seriously pains me to have to say anything negative about this album, especially considering that in today's music mainstream, ""music"" is more or less a four letter word.  But on the other hand, because of this rarity and also my fandom, I can't just simply give the album nothing but praise and say it's a masterpiece.  That wouldn't be honest.  And yes, there are good songs to be found here.  I'm not giving up on this band, and I'll continue to support them.
Paul O'Neill was really onto something with Savatage.  There was some real magic there, and I can only hope that in the future Paul will be able to tap back into that.","Like many metal fans , my TSO fandom is deeply rooted in their association to the criminally underrated band Savatage .

His role anymore in TSO is basically just playing keyboards ) . Now , Paul devotes all his time to TSO and basically left Savatage to more or less fade away to a footnote in heavy metal history . Does n't seem quite fair , but at least Savatage lives on to a certain degree . TSO has always been looked at as a seasonal kind of event , an annual tradition to take the family to when they swing through your hometown . So , TSO has been a holiday household name ever since . I 'm not sure how well Beethoven 's Last Night sold , but it was very refreshing to see a TSO album on the shelves that was n't Christmas themed . Not that I have anything against the Christmas albums , but who throws The Christmas Attic in their cd player in mid July ? It was cool to see TSO become a band that was n't strictly associated with one specific time of the year . That brings us to Night Castle , an album which has been in the works for what seems like 800 years now(they played songs from it when I saw them in 2004 ! ) . All this anticipation will undoubtedly create high expectations , which is kind of a curse coz you really ca n't live up to it(Phantom Menace anyone ? ) . Well , Night Castle 's sound is what you pretty much expect it to be . But honestly , I find myself getting kinda bored of it after awhile . I love orchestral and progressive rock / metal , but there 's too much of a sameness to this . The story is n't bad , but it 's a little lacking , especially when compared to O'Neill 's previous stories . I ca n't honestly say it 's bad musically - it 's actually very good - it 's just a bit monotonous , not much variance at all . It 's missing something . Also , as many have said before , a bunch of Savatage tunes are used here as well , mostly instrumental . I suppose I do n't have too much of an issue with this , after all they are O'Neill 's songs , but it just seems a bit cheap to fill space with songs that have been done before , especially for an album that has been in the works this long . This is a bit irritating to me on Disc 2 with the bonus track , "" Believe "" , one of the most cherished of Savatage songs from the album Streets . I 'm not sure why this was done at all coz most would agree that you simply can not touch that song . As far as "" Believe "" goes , Savatage vocalist Jon Oliva is what made a great song a friggin phenomenal and unforgettable song . Oliva 's performance will damn near make your eyes tear up . No disrespect to vocalist Tim Hockenberry , who does the TSO version , but he just does n't hold a candle to Oliva . It actually sounds alot like Joe Cocker singing "" Believe "" . TSO 's vocalists have never been all that great . Not bad singers by any means(at least they sing , a rare thing anymore ) , but they 've always sounded(to me anyway ) like weaker and clumsier versions of Zak Stevens . In all honesty , it seriously pains me to have to say anything negative about this album , especially considering that in today 's music mainstream , "" music "" is more or less a four letter word . But on the other hand , because of this rarity and also my fandom , I ca n't just simply give the album nothing but praise and say it 's a masterpiece . That would n't be honest . And yes , there are good songs to be found here . I 'm not giving up on this band , and I 'll continue to support them . Paul O'Neill was really onto something with Savatage . There was some real magic there , and I can only hope that in the future Paul will be able to tap back into that ."
A1URYPVG5DLLZZ,B002TA2CM8,-1,1,5,"I liked the album, but let's be honest here. Most of the Instrumentals are taken from Savatage's albums (especially Dead Winter Dead) I mean.. ok.. maybe TSO were more commercially successful than Savatage but they already have all Savatage members! Why not do new stuff? Why record ""Believe"" using another vocalist? Why not including Jon Oliva or Zack Stevens in any song ?
The songs are nice but I didn't feel them.. I will give them more time, but am giving the 5 stars for the sake of Savatage members.","I liked the album , but let 's be honest here .

A92F571Y9MTW6,B002TYNSY0,-1,1,4,"Ryan Leslie released ""Transition"", the follow-up to his self-titled debut. On his first album, he was heavily inspired by the sounds of the 80's. Now, on his new album while his songwriting has improved, other things have not. He has tried to establish a distinctive sound on his debut as well as Cassie's album, which he wrote and produced.

Not helping is the song ""Something That I Like"" which features Pusha T of the Clipse, who are The Neptunes' longtime collaborators.

This is the kind of album to put on when you want classical music to listen to without making a decision, which composer, which piece, which album, etc. Unfortunately, the quality of the performances on this album ranges from good to almost unacceptable. The ""Ride of the Valkyries"" reminds me of an impatient person jangling his keys as he waits for the next train to pull up to the station. The ""Blue Danube"" is fine, until the percussion section weighs in, sounding like a high school marching band, only not as good. The Brandenburg #3 is sure in a choppy hurry. Who swallowed a metronome?

Some of the other performances are adequate, even good. The 2nd Movement (The ""Elvira Madigan"") of the Mozart Concerto, the Barber Adagio, are fine. This is studio music, and it seems as if some of the more familiar pieces were fobbed off in a hurry to get them onto a recording. I used to sing choral music with the occasional orchestra, and when musicians are on the clock, sometimes you don't rehearse a more familiar piece and just show up to the performance and have at it. Perhaps that's what happened here. Ok, people, you all know Beethoven's Fifth. Let's go.

However, it's five dollars, in fact, not even, so it's worth putting up with some of the pieces sounding awful in exchange for a lot of good listening.

Although Clipse created crazy anticipation for Til The Casket Drops with absolutely excellent singles such as I'm Good and it's remix ft. Rick Ross (mysteriously missing from the release) as well as Kinda Like A Big Deal ft. Kanye West, the album ultimately falls flat.  Malice & Pusha T are still as potent as ever behind the mic with many quotables, but it is the production (DJ Khalil, Sean C, Neptunes) that surprisingly fails to keep up with their sharp wit and flows.

The album starts out sizzling with 5 straight bangers in Freedom, Popular Demand, Showing Out, I'm Good, and Kinda Like A Big Deal.  However from that point on the album fizzles fast.  There Was A Murder, Never Will It Stop and All Eyes On Me are just simply too wack to listen to.  Counseling is decent at best.  Those 4 songs (on a 13 track album) disrupt the flow of the album and make it feel uneven and thrown together.  To make it worse is that they are all grouped together with only DOORMAN to save the mediocrity of the middle of the album.  The album ends strongly with Footsteps, Life Change, and Champion.

Til The Casket Drops is quite an underwhelming cd.  I wouldn't go as far as to call it a disappointment because there are a couple bonafide bangers.  It's a good album just not the album people were expecting especially after Hell Hath No Fury and Lord Willin.

This album comes three years after their previous album ""Hell Hath No Fury"", an album that was the hip hop equivalent to Weezer's ""Pinkerton""- a sophomore album that was superior to its predecessor, but had less than stellar sales. This time around, they are doing things a little different. For starters, The Neptunes, who produced all of their first two albums do eight of thirteen tracks. The remaining five songs are handled by Sean C & LV (""Freedom"" and ""Never Will It Stop"") and Self Scientific member DJ Khalil (""There Was A Murder"", ""Footsteps"" and the first single ""Kinda Like A Big Deal""). Guests on this album are a little odd with Keri Hilson on ""All Eyes On Me"", Yo Gotti on ""Showing Out"" and Kenna (remember, he's a Neptunes affiliate) on ""Life Change"". The biggest WTF moment, however, is when the song ""Counseling"" comes on, it uses the refrain of...wait for it...Laura Branigan's ""Self Control""!!??

Guests on this album are a little odd with Keri Hilson on "" All Eyes On Me "" , Yo Gotti on "" Showing Out "" and Kenna ( remember , he 's a Neptunes affiliate ) on "" Life Change "" . The biggest WTF moment , however , is when the song "" Counseling "" comes on , it uses the refrain of ... wait for it ... It 's a great but overly commercial effort from The Clipse , something I would n't have expected from them ."

We all know that Cher has made herself a star, when she and Sonny were a recording duo, as well as the stars of their television career. During that time, Cher had a solo career on the side. She has released the albums, ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO (1965), THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER (1966), CHER (1966), BACKSTAGE (1967), & WITH LOVE, CHER (1968). In 1969, Cher had released her fifth album entitled, 3614 JACKSON HIGHWAY. Now, this album really isn't what I had hoped for.

We all know that Cher has made herself a star , when she and Sonny were a recording duo , as well as the stars of their television career . During that time , Cher had a solo career on the side . She has released the albums , ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO ( 1965 ) , THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER ( 1966 ) , CHER ( 1966 ) , BACKSTAGE ( 1967 ) , & WITH LOVE , CHER ( 1968 ) . In 1969 , Cher had released her fifth album entitled , 3614 JACKSON HIGHWAY . Now , this album really is n't what I had hoped for . Cher 's music from the 60s was not all too great , but do n't forget that Cher was still concentrating on her career with Sonny , so this album deserves more credit than people give it . FOR WHAT IT 'S WORTH 

   Not bad . ( JUST TO KEEP ME ) HANGIN ' ON 

   I usually love songs , where half of the title is enclosed in paranthesis , where the first half or the second half . This song turned out to be just great . ( SITTIN ' ON ) THE DOCK OF THE BAY 

   Great song . TONIGHT , I'LL BE STAYING HERE WITH YOU 

   Not bad , but good enough for the enjoyment . This is what most of do during or after a bad relationship . So , if you 're in a bad relationship , or you have just got out of one , this is the song for you . I 'm never getting these splinters out of my feet . Just kidding . Great song . LAY BABY LAY 

   Something every dating or married couple would like to do . PLEASE DON'T TELL ME 

   Great song . CRY LIKE A BABY 

   Men will not cry like babies when we lose our girlfriends , since we our smart enough to find more . Great song . DO RIGHT WOMAN , DO RIGHT MAN 

   Not bad . I gave this album a chance and I do not regret that I did because the album is pretty good , but it is not totally great . But if you would like to check this album out , then go right ahead ."

To enjoy this album you're really going to have to like their harmonies as applied to the standard operating procedure of MOR albums of the day: an album would have a single or two (or none) padded with covers of standards or show tunes or other popular hits of the day.

Of the twelve songs, one is the hit single title track, three are penned by John Stewart of the Kingston Trio (soon to have a #1 song with the Monkees singing his ""Daydream Believer""), and the rest are a random assortment of show tunes.

We Five's sound is pleasing to the ear but the MOR playlist lends a generic touch to their legacy; this playlist could have come from the Sandpipers but We Five turned up for the recording session instead.

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B0039A8QVI,1,-1,3,"The cover of newcomer Easton Corbin's self-titled debut depicts a homespun image of the singer-songwriter strumming an acoustic while relaxing on a porch in a wicker rocking chair. It's an apt picture. The album strips away much of Nashville's contemporary bombast in favor of the relaxed country vibe of Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson. The comparison is particularly close in the sunny satisfaction and road trip escape of ""Roll With it,"" the forthright statement of home-spun roots ""A Little More Country Than That,"" and multiple mentions of good times and simple pleasures. Corbin and his co-writers have pulled together a collection of love songs, both warm and broken-hearted, and link Chesney with Tom T. Hall by drawing a blue line from Memphis to Key West in ""This Far From Memphis."" There's a moving lyric of imagined nostalgia in ""Someday When I'm Old"" and the second-chance glimpsed in ""Let Alone You"" is illustrated with sharply observed everyday details.

A few of the songs are a bit close to their inspirations for comfort. ""Don't Ask Me `Bout a Woman"" rewrites the sentiment and mood of Brad Paisley's ""Waitin' on a Woman,"" and the sandy vacation of ""A Lot to Learn About Livin'"" is third-generation Jimmy Buffett by way of Kenny Chesney. Corbin's vocals are lightly drawled and producer Carson Chamblerlain counts out a variety of tempos that allow is singer to show off his emotional prowess as both a balladeer and mid-tempo honky-tonker. The album closes with the thoughtful ""Leavin' a Lonely Town,"" echoing the escapes and traps of Steve Earle's ""Guitar Town"" and Chris Knight's ""Oil Patch Town."" The sound is Nashville clean, but it's not slickly artificial; it's sophisticated in the manner of George Strait and others able to hang on to their country roots even as they embrace modern studio production. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

The album, in my opinion was better round than Ludacris's Grammy winning 'Release Therapy', but didn't spark the hits of 'Release Therapy' (""Money Maker"" and ""Runaway Love"" namely).  'Battle of the Sexes' already has a better advantage over its predecessor with the top ten hit single ""How Low"" returning Ludacris to the nastiness, yet addictiveness of singles such as ""Splash Waterfalls"" or the anthemic nature of ""Stand Up"".  Maybe if it were say Common (who made a huge faux pas with 2008's dreadful 'Universal Mind Control') trying to be more commercial it would be a big deal, but we expect Ludacris to be, well ""ludicrous"".  'Battle of the Sexes' is indulgent, but it comes over as more enjoyable than 'Theater of the Mind' because it settles for a cheaper, immature image.  Not my favorite Ludacris albums, but maybe it is that transitional efforts to buy back fans who didn't show up for his last album.

The album opens up with a forgettable intro, but ""brings the heat"" with ""How Low"", one of the strongest cuts from the album.  Nasty, over-sexualized, yet captivating,  it is no wonder why ""How Low"" has quickly ascended to the top of the charts and had more staying power opposed to singles ""What Them Girls Want"" or ""One More Drink"" from 'Theater of the Mind.'  He keeps up the pace, as provocative as ever with the catchy ""My Chick Bad"", featuring female rap standout Nicki Minaj. ""Everybody Drunk"" featuring Lil Scrappy deviates from the sexual overtones of ""How Low"" and ""My Chick Bad"", though it is slightly less enjoyable - still a standout.  After this, ""I Do It All Night"" is solid enough, but not nearly as potent as the first three cuts.  The Trey Song featured ""Sex Room"" in all its freakiness makes up for any lack of inspiration or 'ear candy.'

""Hey H*"" (feat. Lil Kim) and ""Party No Mo'"" (feat. Gucci Mane) are solid, but not necessarily stellar.  ""B.O.T.S."" (feat. I-20) finds a similar fate, though the soulful well produced duet with Monica ""Can't Live With You"" is one of my personal favorites.  Monica sounds better than ever.  ""Feeling So Sexy"" and ""Tell Me A Secret"" (feat. Ne-Yo) are ok, but forgettable.  ""My Chick Bad {Remix]"" featuring an all star collaborative crew (Diamond, Eve, Trina) and ""Sexting"" are excellent closers to an album that is solid enough, though inconsistent in overall conception.

While I wouldn't go as far to call this effort 'unexceptional', 'Battle of the Sexes' lacks the maturity of 'Release Therapy' (there is no ""Runaway Love"") and the well-rounded edge of 'Theater of the Mind'.  It is what it is.  Enjoyable, though not earth-shattering by any means.  3 stars.","Ludacris was once a pre - eminent rapper who could easily score a multiplatinum album .

A3OO4WIO4SKD55,B003AP683K,-1,1,4,"This 25th Anniversary remake of We Are the world is a mix of good and bad. Most Acts brought their A Game but there are 4 main problems with the remake

1. Janet Jackson's vocals - Either she's barely singing or she sounds so much like her late brother Michael. Either way, You can barely tell she's singing

2. Akon was unnecessarily auto-tuned. I don't fault t-pain on this since it's his trademark

3. Lil Wayne had a singing part. Faith Evans, Trey Songz, Jordin Sparks, Keri Hilson, Brandy Norwood, Gladys Knight, Natalie Cole, Anthony Hamilton, India. Arie, Jason Mraz, Melanie Fiona, and Musiq Soulchild are a few of the acts in the choir. Any one of them, especially Faith Evans would have been perfect to do this part. I saw An  interview With Lil Wayne where he even stated he couldn't even believe they wanted him to do Bob Dylan's part. So they should have used someone else.

4. the rap - Excellent lyrics, however, All you can hear is LL cool J. This is where Lil Wayne should have had his part. Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz, Snoop dogg were in it also. But LL cool J's voice over powers everyone else. The rappers should have taken turns like the main singing acts.

It seems as if they wanted to have the current newbies, Strong voices, legends and hot young acts do most of the main acts, Hence why Justin Bieber opened (Newbie/Hot young act), Barbra Streisand did Diana Ross' Part and LL cool J led the rap (legends).

I know it's about helping Haiti but because we're buying a song to donate to Haiti, It's gotta be something people are willing to buy, so the We Are The World Foundation can actually give money to Haiti. And If People don't like it, They're likely to donate money to the Haiti relief elsewhere

With these 4 issues, it's not the great remake it could have been. Most Acts that were used brought their A Game but some acts were used incorrectly.
Had Lil Wayne been replaced with a real singer, The rappers take turns rather than just LL cool J leading it, Janet's vocals been recognizable, And Akon not been-auto-tuned, This could have easily been a 5 star remake.

1. Still Standing - A pretty hot beat but starts out slow and quiet. The lyrics are good. Luda's verse is OK, but not completely necessary because it's short. Overall: 3.75 stars.

2. One In A Lifetime - Flat out boring and not up to her standards. I don't like it much. Overall: 2.75 stars.

3. Stay Or Go - You hear the chorus too much, but the beat more than makes up for it. Lyrics aren't bad, but it's the music that really hits you here. Another favorite. Produced by Bie Maejor. Overall: 3.75 stars.

4. Everything To Me - Produced by Missy Elliott, written by her and newcomer Jazmine Sullivan, I'm afraid this is the best Monica can offer. Great lead single, nice vocals and perfect sample. If I'm proved wrong, I will definitely eat my words. Overall: 4 stars.

5. If You Were My Man - Missy produced and has her vocals all over it like on 'So Gone'. Instead of being a throwback, production sounds dated. It's sorta catchy though. Overall: 3 stars.

6. Mirror - If it had one more verse instead of so many choruses, this song would be better. Verses are surprisingly strong. Overall: 4 stars.

7. Here I Am - The second and last track to be written by Monica on the main album (not counting the exclusive Amazon track, Lessons Learned). Not the most exciting track, but it's alright. Monica speaks about her man (or someone she's interested in) going out and maybe dancing with another girl. She says she's going to do her own thing and call her girls and get her own party on. Overall: 3.5 stars.

8. Superman - By now, I'm noticing this CD is more laid-back than upbeat. Some may find that boring. Produced by Bryan-Michael Cox, this track is another love song. 3.5 stars.

9. Love All Over Me - BY NOW, I realize she needed more upbeat tracks to accompany some of these slower tracks. Good vocals, decent, addicting beat and one of the better mid-tempos. 3.75 stars.

10. Believing In Me - Produced by Stargate, this is another slow ballad. Kinda inspirational, but at least one of these tracks should have been another party anthem. I guess Monica's just in that place. Nice guitar outro. 3.75 stars.

3.5 stars or a 7/10 (not an average).

V-103 FM Radio (ATL) is really giving her the big push as they have done in the past. Her single, ""Everything To Me"" is the best song on this product. It rips the vocal and music arrangement of Deneice Williams' '80s classic, ""Silly"" with new contemporary lyrics. Nice rip. I wish she did a few more songs like that.
Instead,  autotune usage and canned backing mar most of the other tracks.

A1432KCCCZL550,B003FRN28C,1,-1,3,"I've been a Sevendust fan ever since I heard Black on the radio.  I've got all their albums, and most of their b sides soundtrack songs, and they haven't released a bad song yet.  Granted some songs are better than others, but overall even the worst Sevendust song is still decent.  This album does continue that trend, and song qualitywise, It does a little better.  My concern with Clint coming back was that the sound would be toned down a lot, kind of like on Seasons, and damned if it wasen't.  I don't know, the sound is just lacking an edge that their previous albums had, except for Seasons.  There aren't really any really heavy songs, not that Sevendust will be confused with being death metal or anything, but they usually have a couple almost fierce songs.  Ok that's probably an exaggeration but I couldn't think of a better word for it.  There are also way too many soft songs for my taste.  Really those are the only complaints I have.

Overall the songs are good.  Although the sound is toned down there are still a few rockers to be found.  There are moments of experamentation which I like.  It's just a solid album.  It's just a shame the sound didn't match the quality of the album.

Splinter is a good example of a song that shows some growth and experamentation, but still rocks, probably the heaviest on the album.  The opening riff reminds me of something either Avenged sevenfold or a power metal band might do.

Unraveling is easily in my top five songs of the year, and a STRONG condender for favorite song of the year.  It's a softer song, definately made for radio, but the lyrics are really good, and the melodies are nice as well.

Forever is another rocker, I switched this one and Unraveling cause of all the softer songs by each other.  I love the melodies in the chorus.

Last Breath is kind of similar to Unraveling, but not as good.  Still a solid song though.

Karma is a softer one, with some interesting verses.  The chorus is pretty heavy.

I don't know how to describe Ride Inside.  It has an interesting intro, nice melodies, but nothing really special.

Confessions, another softer one.  There's sort of a pattern here, softer, slightly heavier softer again.  I LOVe the melodies on the chorus.  Kind of poppy a bit and I wouldn't be surprised if this was one of the singles, along with Unraveling.  I'm sure at least one of those songs will be a single.  Another of my favorites of the year.

Nowhere, Sort of a rocker.  It's a decent song, but I can't really think of anything that stands out, still a decent song.

Here And Now, another mellow song, nothing all that special here either.  The backing vocals in the chorus are kind of cool.

The End Is Coming, Starts off with a nice heavy riff, that leads into a faster part, but then as the verse comes up the song gets slower and softer.  It picks back up for the chorus.  It's ok.

Better place is kind of a mix of soft and heavy.  The verses have both softer and heavier guitars layered together.  There's an alright guitar solo, slower song though, but still a decent one.

Strong And Broken ends the album.  It's probably another of the heaviest songs on the album.  Nice verses, a kind of cool riff.  The chorus is only ok though.

Overall this is an alright album.  It has good song consistancy, as most Sevendust albums do.  I'm sure it'll please the hardcore fans.  I'm just a bit disappointed because I absolutely loved it on the first listen, and my interest has gone down the more I hear it.

This is a mellow, jangly folk rock tune that reminds me a bit of Fleet Foxes. It seems overdone to me, with strings and other background material overwhelming the core of the song. The vocals also sound whiny and otherwise unappealing to me. Not a bad song... but not that good either...

2. ""I Won't Lie to You"" by Let's Wrestle [5/5]
Now this is a fun tune. It's a loose kind of tune with a pop punk and garage rock style. Think of early 70s punk such as the Jam, Buzzcocks, and the Automatics. This one is messy, sloppy, and pretty catchy.

3. ""The Very Modern Dance"" by Destroyer [4/5]
This is a piano centered indie pop tune with deliciously sarcastic and whimsical vocals. It reminds me a bit of the Rocky Horror Picture show-- show-tunes with a spiked twist. The energetic piano playing near the end of the song is particularly nice.

4. ""Fall Hard"" by Shout Out Louds [5/5]
This is a pretty solid pop rock tune. Although the lyrics are pretty generic, the vocals have this begging sincerity to them. The guitars have this surf-rock-ish vibe that gives somewhat of a 60s feel to me. Overall, I like the mellow, dreamy feel to this one.

5. ""Written In Reverse"" by Spoon [5/5]
Spoon has a strong fanbase (I'm not a fan myself) that will be sure to love this one. On the song's own merits, it's great. Even if you're don't particularly like Spoon, you enjoy the wailing vocals, pounding piano playing, and catchy guitar riffs. The drum work also stands out to me-- love that cymbal pounding! I guess I'd categorize this as 'baroque pop rock'.

6. ""Don't Apologize"" by Lou Barlow [3/5]
This one sounds like pretty generic alternative rock to me. There's a dark, mellow, and fuzzy feeling to the whole thing. The wall of sound-ish chorus picks things up, but otherwise it's just okay.

7. ""Thieves"" by She & Him [5/5]
If you know She & Him, then you know that they keep alive that Brian Wilson style of layering achingly gorgeous melodies upon melodies. This tune is a classic example of their great soulful pop.

8. ""Learned to Surf"" by Superchunk [4/5]
This tune sounds like the generic sort of pop punk that you'd find from Bowling for Soup, Green Day, etc. with pissy sounding vocals and energetic guitars. I like that sort of thing, but I should emphasize the ""generic"" sound of this one. While nice, it's totally forgettable.

9. ""Glide"" by Alec Bathgate [3/5]
This is an upbeat tune with a folk rock feel, but it also has some electronic touches that are nice. However, this one also sounds pretty generic and nondescript for the most part. Just think of ""indie rock singer-songwriter"" and there you are. It's just okay.

10. ""I Wonder Who We Are"" by The Clientele [4/5]
This is an okay pop rock song with some dream pop elements and some horns thrown in. There's a mellow, floating kind of feeling all through it. Still, it comes across as easy listening type music that's forgettable (although you'll want to listen to it again).

11. ""Odessa"" by Caribou [1/5]
This just doesn't go anywhere. It's the only song I deleted after downloading.

12. ""In the Dreamlife U Need a Rubber Soul"" by Clean [5/5]
The group is pretty unknown in the U.S., but they're pretty popular in their native New Zealand. This tune is a simple pop rock song that probably will grow on you. It reminds me of Men at Work and Midnight Oil.

13. ""I Hope You Die"" by Wye Oak [3/5]
As you can tell from the title, this is a dark, sad, and subdued alternative rock tune. I like the subdued nature of this one. The vocals are soft and have a haunting kind of feeling. Yet it doesn't seem that interesting, and I didn't feel after playing it that I would want to hear it again for a while.

14. ""Give It"" by Lambchop [3/5]
Alt-country fans will recognize this group immediately. This track is a live performance jam that seems hard if not impossible to categorize in terms of genre and style. It's pretty lively at times, but at 6:28 it drags on and on without particular rhyme or reason. It's sort of like eating appetizer after appetizer expecting a main course but never getting it.

I recommend downloading the album. Eight out of fourteen isn't that bad. But still, if you have a more critical ear than you'll probably end up all but three or four of these tunes.","So there 's fourteen songs to this one , and since there 's nothing except for a certain independent attitude and the same label uniting them-- quality varies a lot .

Not the greatest cycle on record, perhaps, but pretty decent overall, pretty good sound (for the most part), plenty of lovely singing and playing from the orchestra, moving were it should be moving and thrilling where it should be thrilling - what more can one ask?

Some people pooh pooh this set but it's perfectly fine, especially if money is tight. I couldn't be more pleased, myself.

As is pointed out, there are a couple of technical issues (see post above): 3 tracks out of order (pretty easy to fix) and 1 track is missing (there's a track there but it's a duplicate of the 2nd track before it)

The missing track is disc 4, track 3 ""Lass ich's verlauten"" - it is actually a duplicate of disc 4, track 1 ""Was verlagst du""

To fix, do a search (in the Amazon search bar) for: die walkure lass ich's verlauten

The correct Lass ich's is the 7m 44s one (should be 1 and 2 on list, either will do) - the bad one is 7th on list, 5m 49s (that's the one in the complete download). Buy it for another 99cents and replace the bad one with it (make sure you edit the track info in Properties).

You'll probably want to edit the track info on the whole set anyway; the CD set had ten discs and the mp3 tracks from each CD have the disc number appended at the beginning, ex: (Disc 2) 01 ...... (Disc 2) 02 .... etc. All EXCEPT for the first CD, which only has the track #s (01, 02, 03, etc) and so this disc appears at the bottom of the folder instead of the top. Kind of a pain in the rear, I know, and for good measure, since there are 10 discs, I had to add a leading 0 the single digit discs, so (Disc 01), (Disc 02), etc - you get the picture. Don't know if that was really neccesary but I did it anyway.","OMG , a complete Ring cycle IN STEREO for only 8 bucks !

A15JX1TW5LNZIS,B003MLW01G,1,-1,3,"Kudos to Dierks Bentley for attempting a contemporary crossover bluegrass album.  It would seem natural for country music stars to produce bluegrass albums, but the effort is apparently harder than it seems, as few have been successful.  Although conceived and marketed as a ""bluegrass"" album, ""up on the ridge"" has more of the sound of the usual pop country fare.  This is a mostly acoustic album and Bentley took the usual formulaic gun-for-hire by employing a veritable all-star cast of bluegrass luminaries (Chris Thile, Sam Bush, Ronnie McCoury, etc.) for this album.  However, bluegrass fans and musicians would be hard pressed to recognize the music here as bluegrass per se or even newgrass.  Rather, the overall impression is that of that syrupy concoction known as popular country music, but perhaps a little less cloying.

It is not surprising that this album feels inauthentic.  Dierks Bentley grew up in Arizona and attended an east coast prep school. He does not speak with a southern accent.  his southern singing accent is fake and is incorrect in both its intonation and diction for the Appalachian accent of authentic bluegrass music.

Nevertheless, if one can get beyond the incongruity of these issues, this is not a bad little album.  Some of the songs are quite enjoyable, although with few exceptions, such as Bob Dylan's ""Senor"", the album is populated by songs with the usual pop country fare of pedantic lyrics.","Kudos to Dierks Bentley for attempting a contemporary crossover bluegrass album .

AYSLSU7966FWE,B003P976BE,-1,1,4,"It's been 3 years since Korn released an album, and their last 2 releases (See You On The Other Side and Untitled) received less than favorable reviews.  I see nothing wrong with a band wanting to keep things interesting by changing up their sound or stretching their wings, but their newer stuff just didn't pack the kind of punch their earlier albums did.  For this album, the remaining members of Korn continually mentioned that they were returning to the raw sound of their first 2 albums.  They even got their old producer Ross Robinson back and called it Korn III (even though it's their 9th album).  This is the second time the band claimed to be going back to their roots (Take A Look In The Mirror), but much like last time they didn't fully accomplish that.  The band did manage to cut back on the electronics and strip their sound down again, which proved to be a good idea since this is better than their last 2 albums.  But try as they might, this is only 3/5 of the original Korn and their writing style has evolved quite a bit over the years.  The most notable difference between the band in '95 and now is that Jon Davis's voice has changed a lot.  While the album as a whole doesn't sound like the original Korn, there are bits and pieces spread throughout that will remind you of the band's old ways.  Anyway, I'm done comparing this to their older records, let's just focus on how good the music is.

The album begins with Oildale (Leave Me Alone), a song with a familiar and refreshing crunch that we haven't heard in a while.  It's a good tune, but I'm not sure it's a good choice as a single since it doesn't really stand out in the band's catalogue like Freak On A Leash or even Coming Undone does.  Pop A Pill has a guitar riff that sounds like old-school Korn, and the verse is kinda nutty like something from Life Is Peachy, but the chorus sounds like anything else from Korn's last several albums.  Fear Is A Place To Live is pretty catchy, nothing special about the sound but it's easy to sing along to.  Move On is one of my favorites, it has that groove to it that Korn used to have in all their songs but only finds once in a while now.  Lead The Parade is good, it has another old-school guitar riff with a creepy chorus.  Let The Guilt Go is another favorite of mine, it sounds like new Korn but it has a good rhythm and I bet it sounds cool live.  The Past is kinda forgettable, it's closer to something from the band's last album.  Never Around reminds me of something from Untouchables but without all the effects.  Are You Ready To Live is a cool track, another standout but nothing mind blowing.  Holding All These Lies isn't bad but it's not memorable.  If you get the deluxe version of this album, you'll get 2 more studio tracks.  Trapped Underneath The Stairs is another Untouchables sounding tune, nothing special.  People Pleaser is really cool though, the melody in the chorus is like that of old Korn.

So basically what you get here is if you took the sound of their first album and Life Is Peachy, and then put it in a blender with the sounds of Untouchables and Take A Look In The Mirror.  I'd have to say that it's quite a step up for the band over the last 6 years, but I think it's also fair to say the band is over their artistic hill.  Overall, this is a fairly good Korn record and I seem to enjoy it more on each listen.  But things just haven't been the same since Head and David left, and it seems somewhat silly for Jon to still be screaming and crying when he has a wife, kids, a mansion and tons of money.  This might make a good high note for the band to go out on.","It 's been 3 years since Korn released an album , and their last 2 releases ( See You On The Other Side and Untitled ) received less than favorable reviews .

The album begins with Oildale ( Leave Me Alone ) , a song with a familiar and refreshing crunch that we have n't heard in a while . It 's a good tune , but I 'm not sure it 's a good choice as a single since it does n't really stand out in the band 's catalogue like Freak On A Leash or even Coming Undone does . Pop A Pill has a guitar riff that sounds like old - school Korn , and the verse is kinda nutty like something from Life Is Peachy , but the chorus sounds like anything else from Korn 's last several albums . Fear Is A Place To Live is pretty catchy , nothing special about the sound but it 's easy to sing along to . Move On is one of my favorites , it has that groove to it that Korn used to have in all their songs but only finds once in a while now . Lead The Parade is good , it has another old - school guitar riff with a creepy chorus . Let The Guilt Go is another favorite of mine , it sounds like new Korn but it has a good rhythm and I bet it sounds cool live . The Past is kinda forgettable , it 's closer to something from the band 's last album . Never Around reminds me of something from Untouchables but without all the effects . Are You Ready To Live is a cool track , another standout but nothing mind blowing . Holding All These Lies is n't bad but it 's not memorable . If you get the deluxe version of this album , you 'll get 2 more studio tracks . Trapped Underneath The Stairs is another Untouchables sounding tune , nothing special . People Pleaser is really cool though , the melody in the chorus is like that of old Korn . So basically what you get here is if you took the sound of their first album and Life Is Peachy , and then put it in a blender with the sounds of Untouchables and Take A Look In The Mirror . I 'd have to say that it 's quite a step up for the band over the last 6 years , but I think it 's also fair to say the band is over their artistic hill . Overall , this is a fairly good Korn record and I seem to enjoy it more on each listen . But things just have n't been the same since Head and David left , and it seems somewhat silly for Jon to still be screaming and crying when he has a wife , kids , a mansion and tons of money . This might make a good high note for the band to go out on ."

For the former, Arcade Fire's creative prospects are still flourishing; for the latter accolades come just short of this generation's `Sgt. Pepper' or `Nevermind'.  Either way it's an easy bet this offering is on the short list for The Top Ten albums of the year.

Arcade Fire prevent themselves from painting into a corner by elaborating this theme well--and, going out on a limb--they're more consistent at sticking to their concept than The Beatles ever were.  The real goldmine, however, comes from the music itself, which is more varied than The Mall of America.  With shivery and shimmering strings, solid piano,  and cascades of synthesizers on select songs, their collection remains solid and interesting.  The texture and sound is outstanding throughout.  To build my own analogy, `The Suburbs' is this summer's `Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'.

Synthesizers are awash in ""City with No Children,"" so at least `The Suburbs' music never gets boring.

As the talking head, Win Butler, seldom runs out of elaborations.  ""Something don't feel right.../Like a record skipping, I'm a modern man. Maybe when you're older you'll understand./Why you don't feel right. Why you don't sleep at night.""  While his sentiments on ""Modern Man"" may resemble W.H. Auden's  (The poet who coined the phrase, ""Age of Anxiety"".), the soundtrack is indelibly and unforgettably Arcade Fire's.  . Although ""Wasted Hours"" can't be considered the suburban counterpart to Springsteen's ""Jungleland,"" and ""Suburban Sprawl"" (the first) sports a dangerous trend toward snooze control, ""Suburban Sprawl II"" gets right to the point.  While Butler's vocals resemble the next Neil Young, his wife,  R&eacute;gine Chassagne's siren Yoko Ono-esque vocals admirably lament ""...We can never get away from this sprawl, living in the sprawl/ Dead shopping malls/ Rise like mountains beyond mountains.""

That might be the best way to describe the Arcade Fire and their new release, the Suburbs.

Most, if not all, the Montreal based septet are multi-instrumentalists and take some part in the writing of each song, though Win Butler does most of the writing/heavy lifting. But Arcade Fire is creative in ways of arrangements and mixing instruments like no other band.

The Suburbs is longer than their first two disks - over an hour of music. It is seemingly more of a combination of their debut Funeral and its follow-up Neon Bible than it is a departure. The jury is still out (with me) as if it is better than Neon Bible, let alone what I would consider the best disk of 2010.

Though not billed as a ""concept album"", one might take it that way if so chosen.

I can't help thinking that some of the disk is out of sequence if this were a concept disk. The excellent ""Wasted Hours"" would be right at the front of the playlist (""first they built the roads; then they built the town""). Then the disk could have kicked into ""Ready to Start"" - and it does kick.

With ""Ready to Start"", sometimes it seems this is the song with most energy, passion and sincerity. (""if I was yours, but I'm not"" or ""I would rather be alone; than pretend I feel alright"", but then conversely Butler sings: ""but to bow down to them anyway; is better than to be alone"".) Yes, life is the suburbs is no picnic.

That song really is the killer track on this disk. I have played it dozens of times and am really into it. But I think AF does a great job on ""Rocco"", ""Modern Man"", ""City with No Children"", ""Suburban War"" and ""We Used to Wait"". The latter song takes a while to kind of get going. Hell, the first half of it is two piano keys, but I'm really digging it.

I also like both ""Sprawl I (Flatlands)"" and ""Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)"". Ditto with ""Half Light"" I and II.

I'll be honest, I was not much of a fan of Rgine Chassagne. But for her work on this disk, I'm at least enjoying: ""Sprawl II"" works, as does ""Empty Room"" ""Half Light"" Maybe on the latter tracks (I and II), she does more singing with Butler. Her songs here are somewhat reminiscent of ""In the Backseat"" from Funeral. I didn't like anything she did on Neon Bible.

I want to like the title tracks more. I like the lyrics and the melody enough, but the Joplin-esque piano drives me to distraction. The reprise is somewhat throwaway, yet necessary almost to end the disk.

""Month of May"" starts out incredibly strong, until vocals are put into the mix. I was so excited when it started, but it is hard to sit through for me. But for all their mania, there are a number of slower songs, which while they existed on other disks, they did not seem as sparse.

Yes, there is a lot going on with the Suburbs, but the same can be said for all their disks. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. I saw their live-stream Madison Square Garden set and much of this works better live than on album.

My current conclusion (always subject to change with further listenings), is that it's a very good disk, but right now, not great. Neon Bible struck me more from the first listen and three years later has held me there. We'll see if the Suburbs does the same thing.","Controlled chaos .

I 'll be honest , I was not much of a fan of Rgine Chassagne . But for her work on this disk , I 'm at least enjoying : "" Sprawl II "" works , as does "" Empty Room "" "" Half Light "" Maybe on the latter tracks ( I and II ) , she does more singing with Butler . Her songs here are somewhat reminiscent of "" In the Backseat "" from Funeral . I did n't like anything she did on Neon Bible . I want to like the title tracks more . I like the lyrics and the melody enough , but the Joplin - esque piano drives me to distraction . The reprise is somewhat throwaway , yet necessary almost to end the disk . "" Month of May "" starts out incredibly strong , until vocals are put into the mix . I was so excited when it started , but it is hard to sit through for me . But for all their mania , there are a number of slower songs , which while they existed on other disks , they did not seem as sparse . Yes , there is a lot going on with the Suburbs , but the same can be said for all their disks . Sometimes it works , sometimes not . I saw their live - stream Madison Square Garden set and much of this works better live than on album . My current conclusion ( always subject to change with further listenings ) , is that it 's a very good disk , but right now , not great . Neon Bible struck me more from the first listen and three years later has held me there . We 'll see if the Suburbs does the same thing ."

The MP3 samples on Amazon give you a good idea of what to expect, though they don't really do the songs justice. There is a good mix of very good and decent songs, with only one or two clunkers, but taste is subjective and what I like and dislike, you might not. I think it is great to have the whole band back together again and their recaptured (though slightly modernized) sound is proof that even after the so-so albums of the 90s and 00s, they can recapture the magic that made them special.

Who is this album not for? Well, I don't think it'll win over many first-time listeners. Not that it isn't good, but it does have a retro sound I don't see getting much airplay these days.

A24N1BAS3CU27H,B0040B5ZEG,1,-1,3,"""Versus"" is a 9 track EP by Usher, released about 5 months after his million selling ""Raymond VS Raymond"".

This is Usher's (First?) EP. It's a project after 2010's successful effort,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raymond-v-Raymond/dp/B002RAREAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raymond v. Raymond</a>&nbsp;earlier this year. I honestly can't compare the two seeing as I haven't heard the complete CD of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raymond-v-Raymond/dp/B002RAREAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raymond v. Raymond</a>&nbsp;but I'm gonna show you what I thought about this project song by song. Sorry if it comes off as long, I'd just like to think it's in-depth. :)

1. Love 'Em All -- A real cool track that starts Usher on the right foot. He is basically just saying there are too many women available, so he's gonna love them all. B-

2. DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (Feat. Pitbull) -- Not a bad dance R&B cut. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about this song, but it really isn't bad. I'm sure after you hear it too many times, it will get annoying but it's really not bad. Pitbull's part is OK. Something you can definitely dance to. C+

3. Hot Tottie (Feat. Jay-Z) -- The beat isn't bad on this track. However, you would think the track would be better considering it's with 2 of the game's hottest superstars right now. Jay-Z's verse is pretty good though. B-

4. Lay You Down -- Finally. A slower jam. I usually like Usher's downtempos because they end up being a bit sensual. 'Can U Handle It' is still his best slow song, in my opinion (out of all of his catalog. Yes, I said it!). This one isn't bad. It's just not as good as that song. Not even as good as 'Seduction'. I like the piano though. C

5. Lingerie -- This song is a freaky one. However, it's also kind of filler. Not much to say. The beat ain't that great and that's what Usher is about these days so... C-

6. There Goes My Baby -- I'm getting tired of this song. However, as a whole, it's not bad, especially considering it's a radio song. It's just played out by now. If you didn't realize, it was also on his album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raymond-v-Raymond/dp/B002RAREAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raymond v. Raymond</a>&nbsp;and served as the 4th (and final?) single. C+

7. Get In My Car (Feat. Bun B) -- The beat is kinda lazy on this effort, but this song ends up not being bad. There's something about it. It feels like a marching band of some sorts. Usher's lyrics on this are similar to what the subject on 'Love 'Em All' is. Just not as good a song. C

8. Somebody To Love (Remix) (Feat. Justin Bieber) -- This song is a bit out of place, lyrically. The beat fits in with the likes of 'DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love' but the words to the song are about being faithful and wanting someone to love instead of flirting and getting your freak on with. Justin only has one verse and sort of gets put in the background towards the end so his part feels tacked on when it's originally his song. So that was kinda crappy. But all in all, this is one of the better songs on the album along with 'Love 'Em All' and 'Hot Tottie'. B-

9. Strangers Come -- He saved the last track to be totally serious. And it's a good song. It's about trying to get a girl that has been hurt and doesn't take any of his advances. Usher doesn't give up either. C+

This EP was totally worth checking out even though I think Usher hasn't been putting his all in his projects since 2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Confessions/dp/B0002ZYDKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Confessions</a>.

A234IZP4U2Y0OQ,B003KYKY3Q,-1,1,5,"I'm glad I got this cd. Damn this cd is a classic.  17 songs and they all sound different and good and are in depth with lyrics and beats that sound creative.  I'm not going to give a song by song.  Instead, I'll say Kweli's lyrics have been pretty good to me always but his delivery, hooks, voice, and beat selection bothered me too much to pick up most of his cd's, even though i did hear them. This cd is different than his last efforts.  This one, is his best or at least next to the last Reflection Eternal.  This cd is not commercial. Talking about oil spills, revolution, naming names of unknown or unpopular revolutionaries, and intricate storytelling, rhyme schemes used and this vocabulary is not commercial. I wish commercial artists did sound this good. Commercial artists I thought were about rapping songs where noone could be offended and only saying what is popular to say in society today or rappers scared to make a statement against the status quo and writing lyrics with no depth of thought to fully expand on a point beyond just an analogy or simile, cliche or quote.  I thought commercial was to not challenge the listener.  This album is great and if his name wasn't Talib it would probably go platinum like Lupe's next cd will.  No knock at all on Lupe, I'm just saying when you've been in the game this long and people think they know who you are and your sound (like Talib), and then your sound sounds rejuvenated, people like me can slip up and miss it cause we wrote you off and categorized you as that dude who has nice lyrics whose subject matter repeats itself, flow is weak, and has that nasal voice and is old.  It's rare as rare can get to hear an old rapper with as many cd's as he has come back this strong with this many different styles.  It's like Hi-Tek breathed all the ingredients he'd been missing into em'.  I didn't expect it.  Straight up to Kweli, put all your money on promoting this cd.  Don't think about the future. I wouldn't wait to promote the next one cause I've heard his stuff and unless he sticks with Hi-Tek I don't know if he'll ever do a cd better than this one. So bottom line if you've been like me who likes two or 3 songs off each of his past 6 cd's but no more, then just know that this cd is different and artistic and I liked all of it.  I can't say if you'll like it or not.","I 'm glad I got this cd .

This cd is different than his last efforts . This one , is his best or at least next to the last Reflection Eternal . This cd is not commercial . Talking about oil spills , revolution , naming names of unknown or unpopular revolutionaries , and intricate storytelling , rhyme schemes used and this vocabulary is not commercial . I wish commercial artists did sound this good . Commercial artists I thought were about rapping songs where noone could be offended and only saying what is popular to say in society today or rappers scared to make a statement against the status quo and writing lyrics with no depth of thought to fully expand on a point beyond just an analogy or simile , cliche or quote . I thought commercial was to not challenge the listener . This album is great and if his name was n't Talib it would probably go platinum like Lupe 's next cd will . No knock at all on Lupe , I 'm just saying when you 've been in the game this long and people think they know who you are and your sound ( like Talib ) , and then your sound sounds rejuvenated , people like me can slip up and miss it cause we wrote you off and categorized you as that dude who has nice lyrics whose subject matter repeats itself , flow is weak , and has that nasal voice and is old . It 's rare as rare can get to hear an old rapper with as many cd 's as he has come back this strong with this many different styles . It 's like Hi - Tek breathed all the ingredients he 'd been missing into em ' . I did n't expect it . Straight up to Kweli , put all your money on promoting this cd . Do n't think about the future . I would n't wait to promote the next one cause I 've heard his stuff and unless he sticks with Hi - Tek I do n't know if he 'll ever do a cd better than this one . So bottom line if you 've been like me who likes two or 3 songs off each of his past 6 cd 's but no more , then just know that this cd is different and artistic and I liked all of it . I ca n't say if you 'll like it or not ."
A92F571Y9MTW6,B003KYKY3Q,-1,1,4,"After a decade apart, Talib Kweli and producer Hi-Tek- collectively known as Reflection Eternal- return with a new album, the aptly titled ""Revolutions Per Minute"". This new album is a sharp left turn from its predecessor, their 2000 debut ""Train Of Thought"". On this project, it's decidedly more commercial which can be attributed to them being on the major label Warner Bros. Records. The album starts off with the rather slow ""City Playgrounds"" which would have been better suited for being in the middle of the album. ""Back Again"" features the long absent RES sounding noticeably different. Both tracks ""In This World"" and ""Long Hot Summer"" feature background vocals from Belinda Lipscomb, lead singer of the 1980's funk band Midnight Star. ""Got Work"" is a song in which fame is likened to a drug addiction, while ""Ballad Of The Black Gold"" addresses the controversy and conflict over the ever-present oil crisis. The song ""Lifting Off"" is, by all accounts, a weed song complete with an equally smoky sonic backdrop.

Talib handles primarily most of the lead vocals with the exception of the song ""So Good"" which is the lone track in which Hi-Tek actually performs on. The album's best song ""Strangers (Paranoid)"" shows Talib Kweli getting upstaged by Bun B of UGK. There are a few setbacks on ""Revolutions Per Minute"". The songs ""Get Loose"" with Chester French and the Estelle assisted ""Midnight Hour"" are just plain mediocre, while ""In The Red"" suffers from rather mundane production. Overall, Reflection Eternal crafted a good album, but it's a little too radio friendly- even for them.","After a decade apart , Talib Kweli and producer Hi - Tek- collectively known as Reflection Eternal- return with a new album , the aptly titled "" Revolutions Per Minute "" .

A24N1BAS3CU27H,B0042HQBQ4,1,-1,3,"When a band's lead singer goes solo, it is usually to express musical ideas different from those of his/her band.

Opening Brandon Flowers' debut CD is the theatrical ballad ""Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas"" (""Did nobody tell you, the house will always win""), not too far in sound from the day job. In fact, the album is produced by Stuart Price who also produced The Killers' last ""Day and age"". Not a bad thing if you, like me, are a fan of The Killers. However, the album is a patchy listening experience. It's filled with ballads, a good number of which are desperately ordinary, not doing justice to Flowers' exuberant voice, (""Only the young"" for example) and filled with copious mention of angels and demons, salvation, and other vivid biblical imagery.

Still it has its moments; the Countrified ""Hard enough"" is a duet with Jenny Lewis and sounds like Bruce Springsteen, as does the bouncy ""Jilted lovers and broken hearts"". The Country feel is felt also in ""Was it something I said?"" and ""The clock was tickin'"" with spoken Jack White-channeling verses.

""Crossfire"" is a nice ballad Coldplay or Keane-style, while the hymnal ""On the floor"" is a spare ballad. The midtempo chugging ""Right behind you"" has lovely reverbing guitars. Standout has got to be the Americana ""Playing with fire"" with a bruised Flowers sounding strangled in the wail-like chorus to stunning effect.

I'm a big fan of The Killers and I must say, even their album of B-sides ""Sawdust"" is stronger and more cohesive than this. Still, this has its moments which are very good too. 3 and a half stars!","When a band 's lead singer goes solo , it is usually to express musical ideas different from those of his / her band .

A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B0042HQBQ4,1,-1,3,"I was, like many, very curious of The Killers' Brandon Flowers solo effort. We've heard the music he's made and written for the group but `Flamingo' is his opportunity to define himself as a solo artist apart from the group. If you're wondering if his style and musical preference is really any different from that of the group, don't worry. It's both the albums' strength and weakness: most of the music on `Flamingo' sounds very much like the music you'd expect from The Killers. If you listen to this album without the knowledge that this is meant to be a solo record for Flowers, you'd think this was just another The Killers release. In a way, I was pleased with the album overall because The Killers and Flowers are known for some very unique music that harkens back to Springsteen, Lou Reed and Bob Dylan. On the other hand, I was let down because I saw this as Flowers' opportunity to be challenged as a writer and musical artist and experiment. Still, `Flamingo' has its high points and makes for a decent solo debut.

The Good: The best part of the album is the second half. The last half of the features tracks where Flowers ventures away from the style and sound that's come to define The Killers and experiments a bit with different instrumentation and beats. ""Magdalena"" is the first track that really caught my attention from the album. Flowers said that the track itself was inspired by a pilgrimage a group of faithful make to a town in Mexico. Even though the subject feels random, he sounds more connected to this song than the others. Other stand out tracks were ""Crossfire"" with its western flair with a rock vibe; ""On the Floor"" that sounds like a song from the `50s and `60s that features Flowers' great ability to pen lyrics that capture a moment and fully describes it with great details while evoking emotion through his unique vocal style; ""Swallow It"", while sounding suggestive, has Flowers being a bit sensual as he advises a woman who's in over her head take her time and stick to her guns rather than giving up.

The Bad: The first half of the album was a bit dull in my opinion. It sounds too much like unreleased tracks from The Killers and didn't do much to define Flowers as a solo artist. I was also taken back by how Brandon Flowers chose to release a solo album of music that feels very safe and expected. Yes, he's a songwriter and the image and brains behind The Killers but I felt this solo album was his chance to stand out a bit and do some songs that The Killers would never do as a group. I was shocked that most of the experimentation and chances were taken on tracks left as ""bonus"" extras for the deluxe edition. In my opinion, the tracks like ""The Clock Was Tickin' "" and ""Jacksonville"" should have been included on the standard edition rather than tracks like ""Playing with Fire"" or ""Hard Enough"" which felt like leftover tracks from The Killers.

 At the end of the day, I'm on the fence about the album. Of the standard edition tracks, half of them feel inspired and interesting while others feel like leftovers from The Killers' albums. I wish Flowers had taken more chances with his music; the album feels very safe. He doesn't stray far from the type of music or style that's made The Killers a hit band. That's ok, I'm sure many fans will be delighted that `Flamingo' offers up a slew of Killers-worthy tracks. However, with this being a solo album, it seemed like a great opportunity for him to define himself as a solo artist. Perhaps he could have taken more chances with the lyrics; I personally think he could have experimented a bit more with the music and instrumentation backing. I was let down by the fact that producer Stuart Price, the guy behind Madonna's `Confessions on a Dancefloor', Kylie Minogue's `Aphrodite' and most recently the Scissor Sisters' `Night Work' album wasn't able to really take Flowers into any new musical directions. He did wonders for these other artists but his usual synth and mixing style seems absent or subdued on `Flamingo'. If you get the album, definitely spring for the deluxe edition: the bonus tracks add more to the album in terms of variety, style and experimentation.

A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B0042HQBQ4,1,-1,3,"Even when Brandon Flowers makes mistakes on ""Flamingo,"" his intriguing solo debut, they are extremely interesting mistakes.

With his quivering yet authoritative vocals - reminiscent, in an unusual way, of the late, wonderful Roy Orbison's - he charges through this selection of unique, quirky, often quite touching set of modern, urbane singer-songwriter pop with aplomb and conviction.

Proponents of Ryan Adams could credibly postulate that Flowers is perhaps taking some of Adams' artistic eccentricities and sprucing them up for a more palatable audience, but nonetheless...

Lead single ""Crossfire"" has earned critical repute and deserves far more radio success than it has thus far achieved. The poetic, effervescent lyrics and hopelessly scintillating (and purely catchy) chorus make the song an instant hit. Other potential hits exist in ""Hard Enough,"" a gorgeous, lyrically eloquent mid-tempo ballad co-written and co-performed with Jenny Lewis, whose expressive voice gels extremely well with Flowers'. The cathartic, prayerful ""On the Floor"" sounds as weightless as it does profoundly beautiful.

There are many intriguing misfires (perhaps `misfires' is too harsh a word) on the album as well. The bubbly, perky, 80s-styled ""Was It Something I Said?"" sounds like guttural Americana and retro bubble gum at the same time, but, much like the overlong, cliched ""Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas,"" it takes a long time to not quite catch its groove, sounding more like a very interesting idea for a song than a finished one.

Even the promising ""Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts"" is sprawling and in need of restraint, despite its urgent production and excellent display of Flowers' vocal range. It has a common problem for the record - Flowers' excesses as a song writer have not been reigned in. The songs are often overlong and in need of more focus. Perhaps this has to do with his going it alone without his Killers bandmates. Perhaps this has to do with Island Records giving him creative carte blanche for the project. Perhaps both.

Even Tolstoy needed an editor.

The more forgettable material is still well-oiled due to Flowers' compelling, driving vocals and fine production work from Daniel Lanois, Brendan O'Brien and Stuart Price.

""Flamingo"" may not be an artistic triumph, but it is nothing to sneer at, either. Flowers is a quirky, brooding, highly inventive young artist, and while he is reminiscent of other performers (it is difficult not to be) he has a distinct sound of his own, even irrespective of the Killers, that he is beginning to hone quite well. It is a hell of a lot more interesting to hear an artist stumble a bit trying for something real and original than simply doing what has come before, and Flowers fulfills that desire. He is worth far more than a passing glance.

(The bonus tracks were clearly left off the album for a reason - from the folksy, beat-poetry-like ""The Clock Was Tickin'"" and the atmospheric, pillow-padded, downbeat ""Jacksonville,"" these tunes would have diffused the atmosphere of the standard album were they included on it.

Political and social tensions are running rampant yet again among almost everyone and so it seemed fitting that when these two soulful and funky musical entities got together it would be these issues rather than ones of a romantic nature would be dealt with. After seeing a sneak peak video about the making of this album I was convinced that Legend,Questlove and Malik Yusef were on yet another mission of ""saving music"" here and sacrificing high quality production values and original material by spouting a ""real instrument"" only ethic while interpreting songs by Curtis Mayfield,Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers. As commendable as this goal was it often has the effect of diminishing the music itself when it's bogged down with such heavy baggage so I tossed it aside. Upon hearing parts of it I decided to give this album a chance and,I must admit it's not quite what it's own hype was delivering on. True it isn't perfect and on some occasions the ""naturalness"" ethic does stick out more than it should. But the very fact that this album will DEFINATELY not ""save music"" is actually part of it's charms. This album is made up primarily of cover versions of message centered songs such as ""Hard Times"",""Compared To What"",""Hang On In There"",""Wholy Holy"" and an 11 minute version of Bill Withers anti war story song ""I Can't Write Left Handed"". Legend brings a lot of passion and life vocally to these songs and the music is genuinely funky with it's scratch guitars and basslines,even if the live drums are played by Questlove in a somewhat hollow manner. On the other hand some of the lumbering,downbeat nature of these songs may not make them quite as condusive to ""partying your troubles away"" much the way the originals are. And that is where the saving music ethic comes in; John and The Roots seem to take these songs a little too seriously to infuse them with much joy and hope. A bit more potent in that respect are the Yusef penned ""Little Ghetto Boy"", a wonderfully poetic groove that tells it's story with a glimmer of hope for the character involved. Same goes for the albums closer in the gospel fueled ""Shine"",same going for the reggae jam ""Humanity (Love The Way It Should Be)"".

AJK5WHV1GW941,B0043P1JK8,1,-1,3,"I have always known who Jeremih was because his songs play on the radio, but I never have seen a video, read an interview or listened to an album. Listening to his sophomore LP, ""All About You"" helped me familiarize myself with this young man. While I enjoyed this album, it is by no means timeless or excellent. It's a nice listen, though. There are a few obvious influences from The Dream, and some of the tracks, namely the ballads, sound a bit alike. He has a high-pitched singing voice. His voice is good, but he cannot hold a candle to some of his contemporaries vocally. I would put him in a box with Trey Songz and The Dream vocally.

Here we find lots of songs with sexual references, but subject. There are ballads, mid-tempos and fast tracks. The collaborations are few, which is fine. I once heard a person say that too many collaborations means that an artist is afraid to stand on his or her own. ""Down On Me"" is a club banger that features 50 Cent. It was a cool radio song. ""I Like"" is a ballad that he joined forces with Ludacris on. Again, it's a cool radio song, but probably not something most would remember in a year or two. Ludacris does an okay job. X's & O's"" is an okay song with decent production. In this song he is telling his woman that he is so happy to have found her that he has to give her ""X's & O's."" ""Love Don't Change"" is a great ballad, especially lyrically. He is singing with emotion here.

Pretty good album overall. He does a very decent job on his sophomore album.

ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0043TBMBK,1,-1,3,"There is something about Rucker's voice that I just can't get enough of.  He's so smooth and the way he carries a chorus is unlike any other.  I remember when Hootie and the Blowfish was striking gold with `Cracked Read View', singles like `Hold My Hand' and `Only Wanna Be With You' hitting the radios and staying for countless spins.  I also remember thinking that something just wasn't right about it all.  It was good, but it felt like something was amiss.  Then Rucker went solo and switched gears to the country side of things and it all made sense.  Rucker, the frontman for Hootie, just wasn't feeling it.  Now he is, and it shows.

`Charleston, SC 1966' contains a slew of great ballads as well as some uptempo numbers that show Rucker's complete grip on the genre.  I personally gravitate towards his ballads since his voice has such a smooth baritone that is complimented by those tones, but he nails some of the catchier tracks, which is shown on the success of singles like `This' and `Come Back Song'.  For me, `I Got Nothin' and `Things I've Never Do' dominate this album, showing vulnerability and honesty in his commiseration over failing relationships.

He can't avoid the stereotypical `country' pitfalls entirely though.  A common issue with country albums is the clich&eacute;d and generalized `storytelling'.  This problem even runs into the songs I really love, but his charisma and vocal quality help keep them afloat.  Still, `Love Will Do That', `Might Get Lucky' and `I Don't Care' ride that line of `anyone could have sung this song' and I hate it when a track feels like a throwaway.  I want my artists to connect to the material and not just grab songs from a list.  Sadly, as a whole this album just doesn't try to do anything.  It is a very safe album, and while some of the songs are beautifully done, none of them (even the ones I love) are noteworthy for their creativity or originality.  They don't really say anything that isn't generalized in many other country songs floating out there, and in a sea that vast you really need to try and differentiate yourself.

Still, Rucker manages to hold this album together for the most part, giving us a glimpse at where his heart is at.  He loves this music and you can feel that in his voice.","There is something about Rucker 's voice that I just ca n't get enough of .

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B0043TBMBK,1,-1,3,"Darius Rucker might be best likened to a `chameleon' - he changes musical styles and directions almost flawlessly like a chameleon changes colors.  2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-To-Live/dp/B001CJOHCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn To Live</a>&nbsp;found the former Hootie and the Blowfish frontman (often asked if he is `Hootie') leaning in a country direction.

Here, Rucker smartly sticks to the formula that helped Learn To Live become one of few platinum selling country albums (or albums in general) in this dismal music economy.  Why not stick to what you know as opposed to alienate fans, right?  'Charleston, SC 1966,' with that said, is not a spectacular album, but a solid one that is enjoyable for the most part.

""This"" opens the album a bit clunky from my perspective, where Rucker's quick paced lyrics come over as a bit clumsy given the fast pace.  Rucker's usually soulful and distinct voice sound a bit tamer here than expected, which is surprising.  ""This"" is  not a bad cut, but it is a bit odd given what the listener has come to expect from the talented singer-songwriter.  The production helps to redeem it, but the real redemption comes with top-rate cut ""Come Back Song,"" which is indeed a `comeback' from a bit of False-start on 'Charleston.'  ""Come Back Song"" features superb production work with acoustic guitars intact with superb riffs throughout.  The songwriting overall is much better here than ""This"" and suits Rucker much better.  Here, Rucker's soulful distinctive vocals shine and it is much easier to `get into' this tune.  The refrain is pop/country gold and just may be the best written one of the album.

""Might Get Lucky"" is by no means second rate, even if it is not quite as solid as the valedictory ""Come Back Song.""  What I like about ""Might Get Lucky"" is here Rucker perfects the `country twang,' something lacking in both ""This"" and ""Come Back Song.""  ""Whiskey and You"" gives ""Come Back Song"" a run for its money as one of the albums best cuts, finding the tempo slowing down and more restrained production supporting Rucker.  While the refrain (""whiskey and you/ain't nothing I can do/but come crawling back to you/whiskey and you"") may not be the most substance-laden set of lyrics given the somewhat serious tone of this ballad, it is enjoyable and there is a `rousing' sense about it.  ""Southern State of Mind"" keeps up the momentum with a nice contrast of tempo and nice clear vocals by Rucker.  The chorus is not as simple or `tried-and-True' as say ""Come Back Song"" or ""Whiskey and You,"" but it is still enjoyable.

""Love Will Do That"" is an uptempo cut possessing a different sound from other cuts; it places great reliance on an acoustic timbre, which is very nice.  Here, Rucker goes for more of an adult-alternative sound, which is different from the country numbers, but this track feels second rate compared to the previous ones.  The instrumental section is a superb touch, nonetheless.  ""The Craziest Thing"" features a `tried-and-True' formulaic approach, but it is enjoyable.  It does not come over as revolutionary, which is the general issue I would note with this album as a whole.

""Things I'd Never Do"" and ""We Fall Down"" are solid, but not distinctive.  ""Things I'd Never Do"" finds beautiful vocals by Rucker and an awesome, anthemic country refrain.  The problem is that as much as you appreciate Rucker's emotion, it is a bit melodramatic perhaps.  ""We Fall Down"" has a nice cool vibe about it, which differentiates it from other cuts; despite this, it still is not incredibly distinctive.

""I Don't Care,"" which features country standout Brad Paisley is a better cut and restores some lost momentum to the album.  The production is typical country, but after a few `B' cuts, that's appreciated.  This track could have easily appeared on a new Brad Paisley album.  ""She's Beautiful"" is solid, though not memorable.  ""I Got Nothin'"" falls into the same boat, but closing cut ""In A Big Way"" resurrects some lost energy, ending the album on a high note.

Overall, this album is solid, though not revolutionary.  There are good moments, but the album seems to be `mute' of innovations or new tricks.  Despite this lack to take the album `to the next level,' I understand and respect Rucker's thinking.  Next time out, I would like to hear him extend himself even more - he is MORE than capable.","Darius Rucker might be best likened to a ` chameleon ' - he changes musical styles and directions almost flawlessly like a chameleon changes colors . 2008's&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Learn - To - Live / dp / B001CJOHCU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Learn To Live</a>&nbsp;found the former Hootie and the Blowfish frontman ( often asked if he is ` Hootie ' ) leaning in a country direction .

A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B0043UI5O6,1,-1,3,". . . but I will admit that my doubts (after hearing Grigolo's second recital) about his ability to project adequately in a good-sized house have been put to rest.  He will sing Rodolfo at the Met next season, and here his ""Che gelida manina"" rings out well enough.  The middle of the voice is pleasant to listen to, and if he loses some color as he goes up, well, better singers than he is have that problem too.  I'm still not won over, though.  The bottom of the voice is never really projected in this recital (Calleja's, by contrast, is solid), and I don't like the constant dipping and swelling into and out of that whispery mezza voce.  I know that it's hard to tell on a recording sometimes, but I still have my doubts about how well-supported his soft singing really is.  I don't have these doubts about Calleja and Vargas, for example.  It might finally be a matter of schooling and style -- he doesn't project a well-sustained line, and Calleja does, even when his phrasing isn't all that imaginative.  I did a direct comparison between Calleja (at 25) and Grigolo (at 33) in the sequence from ""Rigoletto"" that starts with ""Ella mi fu rapita"" through ""Parmi veder"" to ""Possente Amor"" -- a sequence, by the way that is heard to as near perfection as you're going to get on Vargas's Verdi disc on RCA.  Neither Calleja nor Grigolo is really near that class, but Calleja projects and maintains the line with firmness, clarity, and good tone, while Grigolo tends to sound fussy and mannered with his little decrescendo effects.  Neither one should have gone for the high hard one at the end of ""Possente Amor""!  But Calleja was eight years younger, and sounds like the more mature and musical singer.  I read in Grigolo's booklet notes that at 23 he was singing in Beethoven's Ninth for Muti, and I assume Muti by now has veto power over inadequate singers, so I'm still willing to hear how Grigolo develops.

NOTE: About that booklet: no texts, but lots of photos of Vittorio in snazzy suits.  I know marketing's marketing, but come on . . .

A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B0043UHNL2,1,-1,3,"What were Huey and the boys thinking?!? On their first album in almost a decade, they've opted to once again go the covers route, releasing a collection of Stax soul classics. Thing is, this is the band's second album of covers over their last three releases, following 1994's FOUR CHORDS & SEVERAL YEARS AGO (Their last studio album being 2001's excellent PLAN B). You would think that, with this kind of gap between releases, the group would want to offer up something that's A) a little more substantial, and B) more representative of their overall sound.
 You would also expect something with a little more punch and depth. Sadly, though, that's not the case...instead, what it boils down to is the fact that SOULSVILLE is often nothing more than bad karaoke, frequently showcasing Lewis' vocal limitations. Much like Cyndi Lauper's MEMPHIS BLUES earlier this year, the arrangements and instrumentation are impecable, but the vocals just seem to be playing catch-up at the best of times, phoned in at the worst.
 Things start out strong enough with the bopping ""Don't Fight It."" With horns ablaze and the bassline pounding, Lewis lays down a nice, relaxed lead vocal. The underlaying vibe is one of fun and joy, with Lewis and the band obviously taking the song's words of wisdom to heart: ""You gotta feel it!""
 ""Got To Get You Off Of My Mind"" is nice enough, what with those killer horns, tinkling piano and sweet backing vocals, but this is one of the prime examples of Lewis' lead vocal just getting lost in the mix. There's laid back...and then there's comatose!
 ""Free"" is also a major misstep...the arrangement is just O.K., the backing vocals are WAY over the top, while Lewis' lead vocal....where do I begin??? Half the time he's just trying too hard (to be sexy, to be bluesy, to be down and dirty), while the rest of the time it's all just bad acting. A definite miss!
 And then there's ""Respect Yourself"", one of my all-time favorite songs. Only slightly better than, say, Bruce Willis' version, I often find my mind wandering as I listen to the cut, wondering what a cross generational all-female cast of, oh, I don't know, Bonnie Raitt, Melissa Etheridge, Beyonce and Katy Perry, could do with this song? O.K......but nothing special.
 ""Cry To Me"" is a prime example of when the album DOES work....more doo-wop than soul, Lewis' voice is much more comfortable and at home here....it never seems forced or faked. Sterling backing vocals only add to the overall perfection. Definitely one of SOULSVILLE's high points!
 If he had just dialed down his vocals a notch or two, Lewis would have had another winner with ""Just One More Day Now."" (Or, if he REALLY wanted to flip things, gone out on a limb and done it a cappella, with just a lone sax backing him!). As it is now, it just seems melodramatic and bloated.
 Things rebound strongly with the silky smooth ""Never Found A Girl"", which just spills out of the speakers like lusty aural lava. Lewis' lead vocal is both charming and cheeky, perfectly cushioned by the spot-on backing vocals. Toss in a crisp, understated arrangement and you have a real gem!
 Another one of the weaker cuts has to be the disc's title track....while a lyrical powerhouse, Lewis just seems out of place singing this ode to inner city living...it's almost like he's playing dress-up! Nice arrangement, strong backing vocals, great story...still, a miss.
 Things bounce back with the energetic ""Little Sally Walker""...what a joy! Lewis isn't trying to live up to the high standards of ""classics"" here ~ he and the boys are just enjoying themselves, having fun, singing and playing for the sheer love of...well, singing and playing! One of the disc's most infectious cuts!
 The album's finest moment, however, is the doo-wop-driven ""I Want To (Do Everything For You)""....THIS is where Huey Lewis & the News shine when it comes to re-visiting oldies! A perfect lead vocal, pristine harmonies, swinging, strong instrumentation and an overall swagger laced with equal parts rock, soul and street corner fun, it doesn't get better than this!
 Almost as nice is ""Just The One (I've Been Looking For)."" Lewis' lead vocal is rich and suppple, swooping and soaring around the lyrics, while the arrangement crackles with energy. A definite winner!
 The winning streak continues with the finger-poppin' ""Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You."" This rave-up really gets things going, but it's never too much. Special mention has to made about the amazing horn charts, both here and throughout SOULSVILLE....this album really is a horn lover's dream come True!
 Things get a little generic once again with the by-the-numbers take on ""Never Like This Before""....it's not that it's a bad cut, it's just not...authentic. It's like one of those old paint-by-number kits...everything fills in the correct spot, but does it REALLY look (or sound) right? Not so much.
 SOULSVILLE closes with ""Grab This Thing"", a percolating instrumental. Upon my first listen or three, I kind of thought it was a chintzy way to end things, but now I'm not so sure...I'm kind of thinking it's a nice salute to a sound and style the band obviously loves.
 And I hope they keep lovin' it. I just wish that they had mixed some of the stronger tracks here in with a heavy dose of originals...it's clear Huey Lewis & the News are still pretty much at the top of their game, but their True, more varied, inner voices seem to get lost on much of SOULSVILLE. And when we just get one record every decade or so, well, that's just not cool.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0043X6AMW,1,-1,3,"It has been over a year since Rod Stewart has released a record, and unfortunately he did dissapoint. After the lackluster Soulbook album last year, and his mixed 2006 Still The Same: Rock Classics cover album, he has tried to rekindle the songs that made him a crooner from this past decade. It unfortunately has felt like he did turn off a lot of his die hard Forever Young fans, while he did have a few nice wrinkles re-issued from his classics a few years ago including a re-issuing of his Storyteller boxed set, and his acclaimed Unplugged & Seated from 1993. But with all that hype, Rod has decided to back to his crooner fashion, and try to revise his songboook series. But is it worth while? Well, maybe Ol' Blue Eyes would've not been convinced.

Fly Me To The Moon: The Great American Songbook Volume V, is Rod Stewart's return to his songbook series, that really revised him as a strong and soulful crooner. This time around, he tackles covers from Dinah Washington, and The Chairman Of The Board Frank Sinatra, in this collection. The songs aren't bad on some of the covers including I've Got You Under My Skin, I've Got The World On A String, and What A Difference A Day Made. Rod does noblely well, but he does overdo Sinatra's standards here on the record as a back to basics here, instead of trying other standards from other acts that he could've done like Sammy Davis Jr. & Dean Martin to just name a few.

While Fly Me To The Moon: The Great American Songbook Volume V, isn't a bad buy from Rod Stewart, it still honestly a much better covers' album than the one Santana made at the same time. But, it honestly isn't as domiant as the covers' album Phil Collins released last month with his Going Back album. That one was more lively. Still, if Rod does release another Great American Songbook volume, it should be more diverse from other kinds of standards' acts. Still if you've loved Rod's first four volumes of The Great American Songbook, you'll definitely like Volume V.

A3PCTD8QM1BIXI,B0043ZDFEQ,1,-1,2,"Using a hook singer to push a single is nothing new in the hip hop genre, some time the results are successful, such  as the classic Ghostface Killah & Carl Thomas song Never Be The Same of disastrous  the Lloyd Banks & Musiq Soulchild track Addicted from Bank's second album . Last spring  rising hip hop artist  B.O.B. had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B., Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire. On the heels of a possible jail sentence, we now have Bruno Mars debut album. Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot.
1. Grenade - This is a rock influenced song where Bruno's vocals seem to go with beat very naturally. Mr. Mars even sings some of the riffs similar to the late MJ. *** out of ****
2. Just The Way You Are - The lead single which is straight bubble gum pop. I'm a grown man so this song didn't really appeal to me but once again the vocals are good. *** out of ****
3. Our First Time - I was waiting for a slow jam from Mr. Mars and this is one of the few on the CD. The arrangement reminds me of something that Robin Thicke would do. **** out of ****.
4. Runaway Baby - As I soon as I heard the production on the song, I knew I wouldn't like it. Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999. * out of ****.
5. The Lazy Song - Listening to this track, I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc. Just as the title implies this is a lazy song. ** out of ****.
6. Marry You - I'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence. *** out of ****
7. Talking To The Moon - Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time. I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away from a loved one.
8. Liquor Store Blues (Feat. Damian Marley) - The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it. *** out of ****.
9. Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be. If he doesn't go to jail and with a great band backing him, this song will sound great live. ****
10. The Other Side (Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o. B) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing. *** out of ****

Overall this isn't a horrible debut album, it is a mediocre album.  I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R&B album with top notch production, instead he's given us a Jason Marz sounding album.  Bruno has a naturally smooth Falsetto voice and while he couldn't handle to other Falsetto's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant, the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps. Given that Bruno is a fan of doo-wop I have to wonder why he didn't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It . If Bruno wants to have a longer career in the music industry he'll need to come a little stronger next time or his career could end up like Nate Dogg's.","Using a hook singer to push a single is nothing new in the hip hop genre , some time the results are successful , such   as the classic Ghostface Killah & Carl Thomas song Never Be The Same of disastrous   the Lloyd Banks & Musiq Soulchild track Addicted from Bank 's second album . Last spring   rising hip hop artist   B.O.B. had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B. , Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire . On the heels of a possible jail sentence , we now have Bruno Mars debut album . Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot . Grenade - This is a rock influenced song where Bruno 's vocals seem to go with beat very naturally . Mr. Mars even sings some of the riffs similar to the late MJ . Just The Way You Are - The lead single which is straight bubble gum pop . I 'm a grown man so this song did n't really appeal to me but once again the vocals are good . Our First Time - I was waiting for a slow jam from Mr. Mars and this is one of the few on the CD . Runaway Baby - As I soon as I heard the production on the song , I knew I would n't like it . Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999 . The Lazy Song - Listening to this track , I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc . Just as the title implies this is a lazy song . Marry You - I 'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence . Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time . I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away from a loved one . Liquor Store Blues ( Feat . The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it . Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be . If he does n't go to jail and with a great band backing him , this song will sound great live . The Other Side ( Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o . B ) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it 's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing . * * * out of * * * * 

 Overall this is n't a horrible debut album , it is a mediocre album . I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R&B album with top notch production , instead he 's given us a Jason Marz sounding album . Bruno has a naturally smooth Falsetto voice and while he could n't handle to other Falsetto 's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant , the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps . Given that Bruno is a fan of doo - wop I have to wonder why he did n't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It .

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0044JTID8,-1,1,5,"When I first heard about this song, I thought it was simply a gimmick by the band to score points with the comic-book-nerd crowd, or a goofy fan project by the band.  Why else would someone make a song about Superman, of all things?  Not that a song about a comic-book character can't be good -- it just seemed like a weird concept to me.  So when I finally heard the song on the radio, I was rather shocked.  Rather than being the goofy novelty song I was expecting, it turned out to be wistful and even sad.  Was I even listening to the right song?

Now I've fallen in love with the song, and it's introduced me to other fantastic numbers by Five For Fighting.  Though ""Superman"" will always be my favorite song of theirs.

""Superman (It's Not Easy)"" never refers to the titular hero by name in its lyrics, but its references are quite obvious -- it paraphrases the infamous ""It's a bird!  It's a plane!"" catchphrase in ""I'm more than a bird/I'm more than a plane,"" and makes references to ""a silly red sheet"" and ""digging for Kryptonite on this one-way street.""  And it takes what has long been a heroic but flat character and gives him a more tragic side, showing how difficult it is to be a hero, and reminisces about how even an icon such as the Man of Steel has his own dreams, fears, and grief, and ""even heroes have the right to bleed.""  One can easily apply this ""darker side"" to other classic heroes and figures, of course, but naturally this song is Superman's only.

The music is quite lovely as well, a wistful guitar and piano number that's never intense but always thoughtful and contemplative, with John Ondrasik providing vocals that are heartfelt but never over-the-top.  Drums are used at points of the song, but they're very understated and never overtake the music.

This is a lovely number I'd recommend to everybody, but is especially poignant to the comic-book fan who is familiar with Superman and wants to see another side to the Man of Steel.  Even heroes, after all, have the right to bleed, dream, and cry.","When I first heard about this song , I thought it was simply a gimmick by the band to score points with the comic - book - nerd crowd , or a goofy fan project by the band .

Cube is graced with some great verses from the reliable WC on ""Life In California"" and ""Too West Coast"", both of which are also standouts.

ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B0044V37QK,-1,1,4,"Now I'ma start off by saying THIS IS NOT OLD CUBE! So don't go in thinking it is. Yea it has its moments where it has that old school feel, but it's definitely not all the way through.
Ok now that that's out of the way let me say this is a very strong album from Cube. Now all the great legends have either passed away, matured, evolved, or just gotten plain crappy (Snoop) but I feel Cube is still trying to hold his own. He wants this to be like his older material, but that's not possible because everything has changed. There are some tracks that are ehh.... (She Couldn't Make it On Her Own) and then there are some that are like DAMN! (Hood Robbin). Then you have tracks where the beats are bangin' and some where it just doesn't seem like Cube should even be spittin' over it. But over all this is a solid album. The tracks fit together nicely and I don't find the need to skip any tracks because even the sub-par one's are a nice lil change of direction vibe-wise.
So if you're a Cube fan then check this out, if not then still give it a chance. Just don't go in preparing to hear ""Death Certificate"" or ""Lethal Injection"" or any of that stuff because YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!

P.S. As of now the track listing is wrong on Amazon. Just a lil FYI","Now I 'm a start off by saying THIS IS NOT OLD CUBE ! So do n't go in thinking it is .

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B0045QJ7UO,1,-1,3,"This delightful sampler of The Beatles' very own label is a lot of fun, if also loaded with plenty of trifles. It pulls a whole batch of lost 45's and gathers them onto one 21 songs salute. It's also a bit of a history lesson as to where The Beatles themselves thought music would head. They where often spot on, with the discovery of Badfinger (3 singles), James Taylor (the original version of ""Carolina On My Mind"") and Billy Preston (two singles). There's a few misses who should have been bigger (Mary Hopkin, with her classic ""Those Were The Days"") and Chris Hodge, whose near hit in the USA, ""We're On Our Way"" was one of the last Apple Singles.

Also plenty of fun stuff in the middle, like British Starr Jankie Lomax's Harrison penned ""Sour Milk Sea"" and a novelty TV theme for a Brit Comedy ""Thingumybob,"" written by McCartney and played by The Black Dyke Mills Band (allegedly the ""most famous brass band in the world). The goofiest of these is the rarity ""King of Fuh,"" by Brute Force, who was a member of The Tokens (of all groups!). Reportedly only 1,000 copies were ever pressed and its obscene double-entendre (""All hail the Fuh King"") had factory workers at EMI refusing to handle it.

There's a handful of duds, as well. Hot Chocolate eventually became a hit-making pop band (""Emma"" and ""Every #1's a Miracle""), but their reggaed version of ""Give Peace a Chance"" is forgettable. Lennon's early foray into political singles, ""God Save Us,"" is overbearing. ""Golden Slumbers-Carry That Weight"" by Trash was a sneak peak at The Beatles' ""Abbey Road,"" and won't make you forget the more famous version. It's very telling to hear how many of these artists were ""Applized,"" with different members of The Beatles writing, playing or producing these acts in their own image. Compare Taylor's Apple ""Carolina On My Mind"" to the more famous version; it's obvious he was being pushed to a sound that wasn't a completely natural fit.

Overall, however, ""Come And Get It"" is a treasure trove of lost singles that Pop History buffs will thrilled to have. Beatlemaniacs will find it a must own, and plenty of folks who'd listen to old AM radios will likely discover forgotten songs buried in the back of their aural memories.","This delightful sampler of The Beatles ' very own label is a lot of fun , if also loaded with plenty of trifles .

 Calling me out when I'm wounded
 You picking on the weaker man

You can take me down with just one single blow

That's what makes it so difficult to give this CD only one star.

But the fault of that lies with Curb, not with McGraw.  Curb, desperate to milk Tim for everything has now released the following Greatest Hits Packages from Tim McGraw:
Greatest Hits (completely legitimate)
Reflected: Greatest Hits 2 (completely legitimate)
Greatest Hits Volume 3 (It had material 1&2 didn't have, so it was worth the price, plus it had ""Find Out Who Your Friends Are"" and ""Nine Lives"" - still shady on Curb's part since Tim had only released one album since, but, eh)

Then, Curb got greedy
""Greatest Hits 1 and 2"" double pack
Greatest Hits 1-3
And NOW #1 Hits. AGAIN after only one new record.

No wonder McGraw is in such a hurry to ditch Curb and find a new label. They keep rereleasing everything simply to make a few extra bucks.

Download ""Felt Good On My Lips"" for 99 cents and send a message to Curb that this rereleasing isn't going to make them any money.

This is a very slow, quiet album, with sweet, fuzzy harmonies.

Very restful.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B004AXOBCG,1,-1,3,"When you think of classic musical acts, there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the Piano Man, Billy Joel. It has nearly been 40 years since he released his debut album, and his songs past and present have stood the test of time in a incredible way. While it has honestly been more than a decade since he made his final studio album, 1993's River Of Dreams, he still holds his own beautifully by delivering the strong songs that have been staples of great music. With the new success of his music being recognized with his documentary, The Last Play At Shea, focusing in on his music as well as being showcased as the final act to perform at the former home of the New York Mets, and being the first to deliver a rock concert at Yankee Stadium back in 1990. Now set to celebrate his 40th anniversay, a new new hits collection is out there to re-introduce Billy Joel's classics to a new era.

Billy Joel - The Hits is a single disc retrospective of Billy Joel's big hits on one album. While the songs have all been remastered nicely, it honestly is a collection of great to a younger era of those who've never owned a Billy Joel album before. Still, the collection does deliver nearly all of his big hits including The River Of Dreams, the #1 hit We Didn't Start The Fire, his signature staple Piano Man, and the intimate New York State Of Mind, and Big Shot. While the collection of songs stands well on a single disc, there are so many of Billy's biggest songs that sadly weren't here. The biggest shocker is his standout song Uptown Girl, as well as favorites like the Grammy-winning Just The Way You Are, Don't Ask Me Why as well as many others. It honestly is also a surprise that a standout like The Downeaster Alexa wasn't here, in place of one of Billy's lesser-known hits like Everybody Loves You Now. That simply is the biggest fluke of the record.

All in all, despite a lot of Billy Joel's great classics not being recognized, Billy Joel - The Hits isn't definitive from what has made him the Piano Man to sing us the songs tonight. It honestly isn't as definitive as was the case with Billy's better hits collections like The Essential Billy Joel (2001,) or his distinctive Greatest Hits Volume I & Volume II which sold over 21 million copies in America alone, and remains the highest-selling greatest hits record by a solo artist. I honestly can't recommend this hits collection for the ultimate Billy Joel fan, but a noble sampler for anyone whom has yet to hear a ode from the Piano Man. What makes Billy Joel? It honestly wasn't everything here.

Nicky is something ELSE, man. She's so good at what she does that... hell, it ain't even FAIR, man. It just ain't even FAIR.

Incredibly, this song was actually held back as a bonus track on Pink Friday -- and I don't know what actually happened here: 1. the song was either a throw-away that somehow found traction with Nicki's audience, or 2. more likely, an intentional decision was made to keep an obvious monster single hidden (available only as a bonus) to push the album organically after the first push at radio stalled (which they ALL do, eventually). MOMENT 4 LIFE was, indeed, the correct choice for lead-off single (the first 2 singles were ""preceeders,"" which means that they came out before the album, making MOMENT 4 LIFE the actual lead-off), but the idea of using a bonus track as a ""follow"" at radio is -- as far as I know, anyways -- untried (especially with so many radio-friendly units still left on Pink Friday remaining to break at radio!). My personal belief is that the label did this on purpose; notice that the video was already done. (!) That's a reveal, folks. That shows the cards. It's an interesting way to push a record, and it's especially risky for a new artist. They probably did it on purpose, too. That's BRILLIANT.

Marketing effort aside now, the track itself has Nicki flexing, goofing, and gear-shifting comfortably in double-time, interspersing the brilliant verses with a much slower chorus -- both of which are massively commercial. I almost feel like the versus are more hooky than the chorii. (!) No question this is a stand-out track; you KNOW this is Nicky from the first moment you hear the voice -- and what's especially good about this record is that you KNOW you're listening to a unique voice, even if you haven't yet heard Nicki's stuff before. A girl I work with actually stopped speaking in mid-sentence when this song came on the radio, and, pointing at the dashboard, she asked me: ""Who IS this?""

That's all that needs to be said.

It's massive, alright.

I don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.

But youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.

I guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs.","The rating I give is based on how much I like the song . My opinion

And that appears to be what Chrisette Michele was going for on her third release. Her first two albums. In her liner notes the concept is abundantly clear. She's decided to address the troubles of the modern day recording industry such as the obsession with surface value and resulting creative crisis's. On that end it's apparent that she has found herself in the middle of one. She isn't sure if the jazzy R&B/funk direction is for her after all. And seems to be changing her mind about her adventure. It all comes into her commentary. You'd think with an album with such a worthy and lofty mission that it would be a masterpiece. It didn't turn out quite that way.

  For one thing there's one simple contradiction. Much in the same way Funkadelic one proclaimed they were ""rescuing dance music from the blahs"",this album definitely has a similar concept. The problem comes because a lot of the music embraces many of the ideas it's supposed to protect people from. Songs such as ""I'm A Star"",""I Don't Know Why,But I Do"" and ""The Goodbye Game"" all embrace just about every contemporary hip-hop/R&B cliche one can imagine. The bassy techno strains of ""So Cool"" is even more puzzling at first. It isn't until you listen to some of the other songs do you find out why they are there. There is a title song and it is one of the strongest songs on here. Featuring Talib Kweli it's a powerful modern funk message song speaking about the hypocrisy of modern society,especially in dealing with matters of race and national defense. In an era when topical songs are extremely rare,this really speaks volumes. Another important song is the epic ""If Nobody Sang Along"". And THAT'S when the commerciality of some of the other songs is explained. As in the liner notes she's filled with a lot of doubt,contemplating selling out for further popularity or sticking to her guns.

  As anyone who reads my reviews a lot know I am not a ""cranky reviewer"". In fact anything below a four star review is very rare for me these days. The only reason I do so here is because Chrisette Michele is someone whose creative integrity I respect and trust. I completely understand and relate to her conception on this album. And I also support the fact she HAS a concept that's socially relevant. A friend of mine from Oakland had a conversation with me a few years ago about how critical people have become with music and film these days. His contention was that today's trouble was there WASN'T ENOUGH analytical criticism of these art forms in these day and age. That they were all seen as conventional media,little more than commercials and not looked into with more of a fine toothed comb. This album really helps me understand that. The modern cliche's she embraced,even in irony didn't add up to a creatively potent album. The fact she subdued her excellent vocal ability on these tunes didn't help either.

AA4VJFR1EDIN6,B004BUEYDO,-1,1,5,"Singer, Songwriter and Musician Eric Benet found himself at a personal and professional crossroads. In spite of a decade that had began with great promise, thanks to his gold-selling and Grammy-nominated Tamia duet, ""Spend My Life With You,"" his reputation as low-key R&B love man was nearly destroyed thanks to acknowledged infidelity against his then-wife, actress Halle Berry. His third CD, the intensely-emotional Hurricane, finally ended his six year recording hiatus and produced a couple of hits, but he didn't completely restore the groove until 2008's Grammy-nominated follow-up, Love & Life. Now, over a decade into his solo career and nearly a decade removed from Hallegate, Mr. Benet's fifth effort, Lost In Time, feels just as well-crafted as its predecessor, giving his faithful following exactly what they expect---lush, love-struck ballads and mid tempos featuring twists of sophistication and sensuality.

When Mr. Benet entered the studio for Love..., he confessed (during an interview to SoulTracks, no less) that he'd sequestered himself in the studio with longtime collaborators George Nash and Demonte, employing old school methods to crank out melodies for the songs rather than the other way around. The process of anchoring lyrics to a strong musical foundation continues to serve him well, evidenced in vintage-sounding tracks like ""Always a Reason,"" which could've been an outtake from a Stylistics album in the way it interpolates ""Break Up to Make Up"" and employs a tender Falsetto to coax his way into a reluctant heart: ""There's a lifetime of tears we could both leave behind, cuz' in so many ways, we've been broken inside/All the questions you ask, we'll find answers together in time , all you need is to believe...""

""Never Want to Live Without You"" is another blue-light-basement-party special, filled with confessions of a man who's wronged his lady and vows to move faithfully into a brighter future.  The exquisite title track describes the heady sensation that new love creates, and vulnerability reaches new heights with the aching slow-burn of a ballad, ""Sometimes I Cry,"" brimming with tear-stained, Prince-worthy pleading for another chance (or at least a fresh box of Kleenex): ""There's a smile on my face, yeah, but I'm broken inside/Sometimes I cry, when I'm all alone with this heart of mine. ""

Even the most successful performers need to shake things up from time to time, and that's what Mr. Benet accomplishes, surprisingly, on the Gamble-and-Huff-recalling ""Paid."" What could've been an ill-fitting and self-conscious duet is, instead, a freely funky jam that laments having more month than money and how the lean green is getting harder and harder to come by. Eddie Levert's baritone complements Mr. Benet's tenor as they grumble about getting ""paid on the first, paid on the last, and struggle all through the middle/M-O-N-E-Y never seems to multiply for me,"" a rich experience for the singers and the audience alike.

Still, in spite of its overall excellence, a few songs in the line-up manage to fall short. ""Take It,"" which pairs him with Chrisette Michele, sounds like a tentative I-don't-want-to-outshine-him/her vocal run instead of the fun frolic it was meant to be, and ""Good Life,"" featuring Ledisi, has a great message but needs a more modern backdrop to really drive it home. ""Something's Wrong"" wants to wrap up the collection with a conscience, but it seems to contradict itself in stating that, yes, the whip is fly and the cash is flowing, yet the evidence of mankind's suffering isn't exactly making his day, thank you very much: ""I avert my eyes as I travel them roads, of people begging on the street/Don't mess up my vibe and show another sick child ain't had enough to eat."" Huh?

More nuanced than Hurricane, but less exuberant than Love & Life, Lost in Time---even with its missteps---powerfully demonstrates Mr. Benet's artistic assurance and finesse, qualities that will keep the Milwaukee, WI native from becoming, well, just that.","Singer , Songwriter and Musician Eric Benet found himself at a personal and professional crossroads .

A92F571Y9MTW6,B004BUEYDO,1,-1,3,"In his fifteen year career as a solo performer, Eric Benet has stayed in his lane for most of his career. He has done the retro soul thing with few contemporary updates within that window in time. He has amassed a somewhat impressive body of work, even if his personal life has gotten him more noteriety than his music (See: His marriage to Halle Berry, for example). He has done six studio albums- five released and one shelved- including his recently released ""Lost In Time"". On this new album, he forgoes his longtime producer Demonte Posey in favor of George Nash, Jr.- who, along with Posey, produced Eric's 1996 debut ""True To Myself"". This time around, Eric goes into the territory of live instrumentation as well as live recording- to give it an 'old school' feel. Joining him on this recording are Ledisi, Chrisette Michele, Eddie Levert of The O'Jays and Faith Evans, who makes her second appearance on an Eric Benet album, having previously appeared on his 1999 sophomore album ""A Day In The Life"".

There are some good songs on this album, but upon listening closely, one can instantly notice how a great deal of the songs sound noticeably similar to classic soul songs of yesteryear. The song ""Feel Good"" sounds a lot like Cheryl Lynn's ""Got To Be Real"". The ballad ""Always A Reason"" is basically The Stylistics' ""Break Up To Make Up"" with more chord progressions. The recession themed ""Paid"" is The O'Jays' ""Backstabbers"" played in a different key. On the title track ""Lost In Time"", he channels Blue Magic's ""Sideshow"". The musical arrangement to ""Good Life"" sounds eeriely similar to Sister Sledge's ""We Are Family"". While Eric means well in his effort to bring back traditional soul, he ends up looking like a copycat in the process. With that said, this album could have been a lot better if he used retro soul music as an inspiration and not straight out plagiarism.","In his fifteen year career as a solo performer , Eric Benet has stayed in his lane for most of his career .

AJK5WHV1GW941,B004CA2QRO,1,-1,3,"Jazmine Sullivan's voice jumps out at you every time she sings a note! It is rich and very strong, even on uptempo tracks. There are not many female R&B vocalists of her era who can hold a candle to her voice. Compare her voice to someone like Jennifer Hudson. Of course, Jennifer's voice is overall stronger, but I said that in order to paint a picture for it to be understood just how strong her voice is.

""Love Me Back"" is a good album. I graded it 3.5 out of 5. The only song that sticks out in my mind after listening, though, is ""Good Enough."" I heard this song one time and fell in love with it. That song? Now that is what I call music! The production is wonderful (Prince's ""Beautiful Ones"" is sampled), her vocals are great and the lyrics are quite profound. The message is if a man will not love you right, another man will be happy to. It's a beautiful, quality track and the standout moment of the 11 tracks. Missy Elliot can be found hollering randomly on the album. I really wish she and Jermaine Dupri would stop doing that. Enough is enough. ""Don't Make Me Wait"" has a great uptempo beat. It's another track inspired by the one and only Prince.

Nothing groundbreaking or especially innovative here beside her creative lyrics. I can say I really enjoy listening to the words in her songs because her lyrics have something a lot of music of today lacks and that is content. It's a cool listen.

A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B004EI3ON4,-1,1,5,"Being a fan of both Wendy Carlos and Daft Punk, I was torn--should I wish for the old, or embrace the new?

I'm pleased with this score:  its sound may not carry the most recognizable musical themes I remember from the original, but the tone of Daft Punk's score is well matched to the world of Tron just the same.  Consider it more faithful to the *spirit* of Carlos' original score and you'll be happy.  There are sweeping synth passages that pulse and build in intensity (""Recognizer""), digital coughs and blips lifted straight out of an '80s arcade, and all of it is arranged in a way that clearly belongs in the film.  Strings blend excellently into the mix, such as the tracks ""Outlands"" and ""Flynn Lives"".

Sometimes a soundtrack--particularly one by a mainstream artist--can be more about promoting the artist than it is about the movie (for  example, the ""Spawn"" soundtrack was more about making two bands collaborate for each song and pulling music from multiple genres).  Daft Punk are very focused on the task at hand:  they create a sonic soundscape that reminds me why Vangelis' ""Chariots of Fire"" took the mainstream by storm--""The Grid"", ""Arena"" and ""Rinzler"" are very similar.  The music to Tron: Legacy sounds just retro enough to hearken back to 1980 while just appealing enough to not sound stale today.

If you're looking for a good sampling of what's here, listen to the passage from ""Nocture"" to ""End of Line"" to ""Derezzed"" to ""Fall"".  If you want one of the few moments the score sounds most like Daft Punk, that would be ""Solar Sailor"".  And if you are considering the digital download, yes you do get the booklet.  It doesn't show as available in the track listing but when you download you will receive a digital copy of the booklet in PDF form.

NOTE:  the downloadable MP3 album from Amazon contains one bonus track.  However, reviewers are stating that the downloadable version(s) available from other Amazon stores (such as in the UK at Amazon.co.uk) offer a larger ""2 disc"" version of the album.  A completist might want to mull over the difference and download that version instead.  I'm not sure how the exchange rate factors into such a purchase, so if you're not from the UK, keep that in mind.","Being a fan of both Wendy Carlos and Daft Punk , I was torn -- should I wish for the old , or embrace the new ?

I almost wrote him off as a second-rate Aaron Hall clone (of the group ""GUY"") since they both came out during the height of the New Jack Swing period of 90's R&B. From his second release ""12 Play"" onward, as an artist R. Kelly has confounded and sometimes aggravated me deeply. On the one hand there's that Bump-&-Grind, Thug Playah persona, which appeals to most R&B fans who came of age in the 90's and then there's that persona that can craft a gospel-tinged tune like ""I Believe I Can Fly"", a club bouncer like ""Home Alone"", steppers classics like ""Step In The Name Of Love"" & ""Happy People"", or classic old-school flavored songs like ""When A Woman's Fed Up"", or a contemporary ""begging"" anthem such as ""I Can't Sleep"". As an artist he didn't appear so much as versatile, but a musically schizophrenic shill pandering to the buck. For example, Prince, before his Jehovah's Witness conversion, could seemly transition from a licentiously dark sex freak to a metaphysical musical wonder and you could still sense the Prince's integrity and commitment to musical craft. the worse you could expect from Prince is him going off on some abstract tangent that nobody but Prince could comprehend. Up until lately, you often had to wonder just how low R. Kelly would sink, before he'd crank out another anthemic song in an effort to convince you he wasn't the child-stalking pedophile his court cases insinuated he was.

No doubt, the man has an almost unparalleled sense of hip-hop/pop craftsmanship and what will sell. But his music ... from TP2.com forward seemed to be just a little too calculated for my tastes. The contradicting irony is that I either have entire CDs or tunes from every release he's done up until Double-Up. And while most people would crown him the ""King of R&B"", I won't ... despite his obvious sales and track record. I will concede that his influence on 90's and first decade 2000's R&B is undeniable. I admit that having been weaned on the real masters of R&B: Marvin, Smokey, Sam Cooke, Luther, Peabo and groups Like the O'Jays, The Tempts, The Stylistics, The Spinners, The Dramatics ... people with a level of elegance, sincerity and class. R. Kelly and his hip-hop infused, thug-flavored  brand of R&B seemed to be the antithesis of what I consider REAL R&B was all about. In the 90's, it was as if any male R&B singer who wasn't singing in an R. Kelly vein, he was considered ""soft"" and unmarketable. And in truth, with a few exceptions, most of R. Kelly's ""soft"" contemporaries during that period ... with a few notable exceptions (Joe, Gerald Levert, Keith Sweat, Usher) ... their careers floundered and they disappeared from the scene.

Too many times R. Kelly ... IMO ... appeared more concerned about commercial sales than any heartfelt commitment to high-quality musical content. Even though R. Kelly had some admittedly memorable and enjoyable stellar departures from his standard modus operandi of gangsta-seasoned bedroom music. But to me they were finely crafted, million-selling hiccups. From where I sit, the whole ""neo-soul"" trend producing Musiq Soulchild, Maxwell, and Raheem Devaughn was a direct retort to the salacious Bump-&-Grind, Sex-Me road of ""Rubbish & Bullcrap"" R. Kelly and his clones had steered the genre down and almost killed it. And all of that flack with his sex crime charges certainly didn't endear me to his music. By the time ""Double-Up"" came out, I declared I was done with R. Kelly. It seemed like all he was capable of producing were thug anthems fit for strip clubs. Kicking Ne-Yo out of his tour back in 2008 really ticked me off ... I was done with the ""Peed Piper of R&B"". When his ""Untitled"" released came out 2 years ago, I listened to the ""Religious"" cut with amused contempt; typical calculating R. Kelly single!

But at this point in my long-winded polemic (seemingly) hating on R. Kelly, I have to say that ""Love Letter"" is a release truly deserving the 4-star rating I'm giving it. The obvious calculated decision to hearken back to and pay homage to 60's & 70's soul is why I'm stingy with that 5th star. I have plenty of 4 & 5-star rated R. Kelly singles in my music collection, but as far as whole CDs, only his first four releases (""Born Into The 90's, R., & R. Kelly"") were worthy of a rating from me higher than 3 stars.

""Love Letter"" is probably the first R. Kelly release I can say I like without qualifying it. It's also the first R. Kelly release in a long time that I don't have to wince at if my teenaged daughter were have it on her mp3 player. The title cut and ""Love Letter Christmas"" radiate with authentic sincerity. I have only 3 criticisms of this CD. #1. The cut ""When A Woman Loves"" though good as a ""testifying"" tribute to a woman's devotion, does sound a bit contrived. Anybody old enough to have heard Gene Chandler's live version of his 1965 cut ""Rainbow"" or Marvin Gayes' 1974 live version of ""Distant Lover"" will know what I'm talking about. Those R&B icons practiced a level of on-stage authentic testifying and begging R. Kelly has yet to achieve ... athough ... R. puts out a great vocal facsimile of their intensity. #2. If I didn't know better, I'd almost swear R. Kelly looked at/listened to Raphael Saadiq's 2008 release ""The Way I See It"" and said ""hmmm ... that's what I'll do next... a retro-release!"" And while Raphael Saadiq's ""The Way I See It"" sounds more organic and True to the period it pays homage to, ""Love Letter"" oozes with R. Kelly's slick studio production technique, though still evoking the era in a very admirable fashion.

Thanks to ""Love Letter"", I'm (temporarily) suspending my epithets of ""The Peed Piper of Rubbish & Bullcrap"" where R. Kelly is concerned. That is ... until he pi$$e$ me off with another set of thug-nificent ghetto anthems. I sincerely hope R. Kelly continues with this level of artistry.","I remember when R.

A17814AD8EWTN4,B004EK6UGU,1,-1,3,"There are so many reasons why I call R. Kelly the undisputed King Of R&B. One of them being the fact that the man's talent is unmatched in this ever changing music industry. Weather we are talking about his exceptional vocals, or his amazing swagger, or his ability to make every track he's a part of his own track. Another reason I call him the King of R&B, is because he is a True musician in every sense of the word. He writes, produces, sings, and plays instruments on all of his own records. He rarely lets other people produce or write for him, with the exception of his last album Untitled, and his '98 record R. And not only does he produce/write the majority of his own music, he also does so for other artists ranging from the legendary Michael Jackson to the lesser know R&B singer Joe. And another thing that has to be acknowledged about R.Kellys resume, is that he has been able to maintain relevance for almost 20 years, and not only maintain that relevance, but also dominate the R&B genre for almost that entire time. He helped change R&B into what it is today. Without R. Kelly, there wouldn't be any Usher's, or Chris Brown's, or Trey Songz's. R. Kelly paved the way for all of those artists, and not only that but he's also sold 40 million records and had a over 20 hit singles along the way. Needless to say, R. Kelly is easily the best modern day R&B singer of our time. He's like the new Marvin Gaye, which R. Kelly considers Marvin to be one of his biggest influences, and some would argue that Kells is better. He's won Grammy's, Soul Train Awards, Lifetime Achievement Awards, graced covers of several magazines, produced his own mini movie... I mean honestly, what has the guy not done in his 20 year stint in this entertainment business?

One of the things that I admire most about R. Kelly, is his diversity. He is such a unique artist that has so many different sides to his musical genius that it almost make it hard to tell what kind of artist he truly is. I mean obviously he is a bonafide R&B singer, and there is no doubt about that. But the thing I love about R. Kelly, and this is probably one of the biggest reason's why he's been able to stay relevant all these years, is that he is always changing. And I don't know if ""Changing"" is really the right word im looking for, but he is always tweeking and adding different styles to his craft. Like I said there are so  many sides to R. Kelly's artistry, there's the partying ""Ignition"" and ""Fiesta"" R. Kelly, there's the club goer ""I'm A Flirt"" and ""Supaman High"" R. Kelly, there's the sentimental ""I Wish"" and ""I'm Your Angel"" R. Kelly, there's the inspirational ""I Believe I Can Fly"" and ""World's Greatest"" R. Kelly, there's the Thug ""Double Up"" and ""Playa's Only"" R. Kelly, and my personal favorite baby making time ""Echo"" and ""Bump and Grind"" R. Kelly... And of course there's the strait up, what I like to call the Loverman side of R. Kelly, which was mostly shown on his Chocolate Factory album, and now Love Letter as well... Like I said, the man is very versatile...Which is why he is probably my favorite artist of all time. It's because every one of his albums is different from the last or has a completely different theme than the last. R. was his radio ready breakthrough record, TP-2.com was his strait up baby maker, Chocolate Factory was a love album, Happy People/U Saved Me was stepper's music/gospel, Double Up was a hip hop record, and Untitled was a collage of contemporary R&B. Now I'm not saying that those album's are strictly in those themes, obviously it can vary a little bit, but generally speaking his albums do tend to have a specific theme for the most part.

Now if I had to compare Love Letter to any of his previous albums, it would be without a doubt in my mind compared to the love album Chocolate Factory. As a matter of fact, after the first listen to Love Letter, I was calling it the poor man's Chocolate Factory, because sonically and lyrically, both of the album's have the same warm, lovey, romantic vibe. With Love Letter he does have a strong throwback 60's/70's soul vibe, which was only sprinkled on Chocolate Factory, where as with Love Letter the throwback vibe does tend to dominate a little more, which is why the album is garnering strong reviews most likely. The problem with Love Letter, and what's keeping it from being a classic like Untitled, is that although it is nice and refreshing to hear that 70's  throwback style today among all the pop/r&b thats dominating the charts today, Love Letter does drag a little bit and at times kind of starts to sound bland and a bit out dated. I'm not saying its a bad album or even sub par, but it's not one of his best albums. I understand what he was trying to accomplish with this album, but there's just not many songs at all on the album that have that aggressive, carnal tones that have made R the legend he is today. R. Kelly has always been known for his raunchy overly sexual baby makers, which is where he most successful and most dominant. And for me personally, the baby makers are my personal favorites from R. Kelly, because he does them the best...But there is little to none of that on Love Letter. Much like Chocolate Factory, on Love Letter the song's that do have any sort sexuality, which isn't much at all, but when there is that little bit of sexuality it's more in the form of romance than the typical raunchy style R. Kelly brings most of the time. Like on loud and roaring ""Taxi Cab"" or the mellow slow jam ""Lost In Your Love"", which are both standouts. But where R. Kelly really dominates on this album is the throwback soul slow jams, like on the smooth title track, and the old school ""When A Woman Love"", and on the groovy slow jam ""Number One Hit"", he compares his the love of his woman to that joy of a number one hit. ""Number One Hit"" sounds sooooo much like a track from Chocolate Factory that I almost wondered if it might have been from the Chocolate Factory sessions, the way he just smoothly glides across the mellow instrumental. It's for sure one of the standout cuts from the album, along with the catchy desperate I Want You Back anthem ""Radio Message"". And Mr. Kelly also does a pretty great cover of MJ's ""You Are Not Alone"", which isn't surprising since he wrote and produced the track for MJ. Overall, it's not a surprise that this album is getting the great reviews it is, and it will likely be looked at as a comeback record for R. Kelly even though he has never really left, as his last album Untitled was also great, but it was also a completely different style. The thing that will win a lot of people over with this record is it's soulfulness, and its throwback 70's soul vibe, which is rare these days from contemporary R&B singers...It's not his best record, and I definitely do prefer Untitled over this one, but it is still a strong album...But if anyone can pull off this type of style change, it would be the extremely versatile Mr R. Kelly!

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B004HYXW1O,-1,1,4,"This is a rocky album. Not in the 'it rocks' meaning of the word, but more in the sense that The Script deals with upheaval in love and politics. The trio of Dubliners waste no time in going for the gut with the opening ""You Won't Feel a Thing,"" which deals more with the austerity measures that Ireland is going through than a breakup. These former boy-banders have more on their mind than getting the girl; U2 echoes throughout ""Science and Faith.""

Too bad that ""You Won't Feel A Thing"" is the best song here. The Script know their way around solid melodies and good hooks, but they are smoothies from the school that also includes OneRepublic (they used to work with Ryan Tedder as producers), Snow Patrol and even Coldplay. The single ""Walk Away"" does make for good radio fodder, and the fine ""This = Love"" being the only song that really breaks the formula. Heck, ""Walk Away"" even features a rap cameo from B.o. B. in the 'everyone else is doing it' category. If you get the extended version, you'll likely enjoy the piano based and rapless version more, if only for the reason that the rap version sounds more of the moment than of the band.

That said, ""Science and Faith"" is pretty decent overall. There are moments that suggest The Script could break the rut and maybe find their way into Coldplay's creativity or (if they were willing to get away from the over-production) Maroon 5's pop-soul. Just too many times on ""Science and Faith,"" you keep wishing for the big payoff when all you get are little fireworks of inspiration.","This is a rocky album . Not in the ' it rocks ' meaning of the word , but more in the sense that The Script deals with upheaval in love and politics . The trio of Dubliners waste no time in going for the gut with the opening "" You Wo n't Feel a Thing , "" which deals more with the austerity measures that Ireland is going through than a breakup . These former boy - banders have more on their mind than getting the girl ; U2 echoes throughout "" Science and Faith . ""

It is a timeless classic!  ""Fly on the Wall"" is not as good as his debut, but substantially better than ""Special Occassion."" He is easily one of my favorite artists to come out in recent history. I like the fact that he is talented, educated (Clark-Atlanta alumnus), handsome and a class act.

I heard ""Words"" on AOL Radio and was thrilled to learn that he had another album on the way. I saw him promoting it on Twitter. I am glad I listened to it. It's lengthy, 18 tracks, but who can't appreciate an artist who gives a consumer their money's worth?  Bobby was kind enough to include club tracks, mid-tempos and ballads. He does all he can with his voice, another thing music listeners should appreciate. ""Hummin'"" is a nice track which features a good rap by Lloyd Banks. He remakes Bobby Brown's classic, ""Rock Witcha"" and though this version is nice, Bobby Brown's version trumps Bobby Valentino's. Bobby joins forces with Plies on ""Phone #."" This song is about getting a girl's number so they can have phone sex. ""Grab Somebody"" is another highlight, it features the king of fast-rapping, Twista. It's a mid-tempo about grabbing someone you are attracted to.

""Fly on the Wall"" is a good listening experience overall. Some moments are better than others, but it is an enjoyable LP.

4.""Rock Witcha""
5. ""Sweetness""","I want music listeners to know that Bobby Valentino 's debut album , "" Disturbing the Peace Presents Bobby Valentino "" is one of the best albums to be released in the last ten years . It is a timeless classic ! "" Fly on the Wall "" is not as good as his debut , but substantially better than "" Special Occassion . "" He is easily one of my favorite artists to come out in recent history . I like the fact that he is talented , educated ( Clark - Atlanta alumnus ) , handsome and a class act . I heard "" Words "" on AOL Radio and was thrilled to learn that he had another album on the way . I saw him promoting it on Twitter . I am glad I listened to it .

Before this album release Bobby decided to release a mixtape and its was horrible so I wasn't expecting his 4th album to be much. I have to say i came away very happy with my purchase. Very good uptempo tracks and slower songs do have his classic vibe to them.

The thing I did not like the most is the order of the tracklisting. It did not seem to have a gradual tempo it was more like morning traffic with(speed up then slow down and speed up again). That aspect really made it hard to judge the album because I lost track with where he was going with it. Still very well written songs, with features kept to just 2 or 3.","This album is more like a 9 on a scale of 1 - 10 rather than a 4 on a scale of 1 - 5 .

A92F571Y9MTW6,B004Q69TRY,-1,1,4,"Fifteen years have passed since Bobby Valentino made his debut in the short-lived late 90's group Mista. While they received critical acclaim and commercial success for their 1996 self titled debut ""Mista"", they tried to follow it up with a sophomore album. Unfortunately, the album ended up being shelved and the group would part ways shortly thereafter. In the interim, Bobby laid low by going to college and getting his masters and was unheard from for the first half of the 2000's. He made his debut as a solo artist on Ludacris' 2004 album ""The Red Light District"" on the single ""Pimpin' All Over The World"". A short time later, he released his self-titled debut, ""Bobby Valentino"" in 2005. By the time he released his sophomore album ""Special Occasion"", he was cast aside for fellow Def Jam labelmates Rihanna and Ne-Yo. 2009 saw him leave Def Jam Recordings for Capitol Records to release the long winded but underrated third album ""The Rebirth"". Now, he has returned with his fourth album- and his second under Capitol- ""Fly On The Wall"", an album that is mired in his duality as a performer.

On this new album, he reunites with his longtime producers Tim Kelley and Bob Robinson, who produce roughly half of the album. He also brings in producers he worked with in the past. Bryan-Michael Cox (who he worked with on ""Special Occasion"") produces the song ""Are You The Right One"". Leland ""Big Fruit"" Clopton, who also produced the song ""Beep"" from his last album produces the ballad ""Last Call For Love"". The production team The Pentagon- a spinoff from The Underdogs- turns in the first single ""Words"" as well as a cover of Bobby Brown's ""Rock Wit'cha"", and the ballad ""Hang On"". Jazze Pha produces the Plies featured ""Phone Number"" as well as ""Altered Ego"" which has an appearance from 50 Cent. While this album is listenable, it suffers from schizophrenia- from an artistic standpoint, at least. Bobby, who has long been critical of the state of present day R&B music, seems to want to play both sides of the fence. On the first half of ""Fly On The Wall"", he wants to make music that is reminiscent of the work of Babyface (See: His covers of the aforementioned ""Rock Wit'cha"" as well as ""Soon As I Get Home"" from ""Special Occasion""). However, on the second half of the album, he ventures off into making club records, which makes him sound out place- and also making his material sound dated and rather forgettable. ""Fly On The Wall"" could be a much better album if it weren't for his internal struggle between what he wants to be versus what he is trying to be.","Fifteen years have passed since Bobby Valentino made his debut in the short - lived late 90 's group Mista .

Nothing much more though.

I'm sorry but you can look every which way but this is not a good pop song.

A3HQ4QMJ8JUDUW,B004SLCYRO,-1,1,5,"Randy wasn't sure from the beginning how his dad convinced him to take a summer job. Let alone in the same place where he worked. Randy wasn't an Agent like Dad. He was only working as a Level 0. Besides it being a top secret lab, he was still just a janitor.

Often, he saw a monkey in a lab coat running through the halls (Dad said to stay the Hell away from it; one of the few times he ever looked scared). Once, he saw one of the scientists holding a camcorder and following a six-foot-tall thing with eight legs and four arms; he hoped it was some kind of robot even though it didn't move like one. And he really wondered why they let that one man walk around in nothing but a bathrobe even though everyone looked like they hated him.

All of this, Randy saw while cleaning the floors or emptying the garbage cans. And then there was that tree. Though it creeped him out, he liked being in its courtyard because he could at least see the sky there. He had the job of cleaning up what came out of one side of the tree. He especially didn't like doing that. The smell alone was terrible, and it steamed up his glasses so that he had to keep cleaning them, leaving him almost completely blind.

Randy really really wanted to know what Dad was thinking, putting him through this. Even though he got to see a lot of weird stuff, it was a totally crap job.

Meanwhile, in another part of the same site, a member of the administrative staff was speaking to an Agent.

""Agent Foxtrot, I'm glad that I managed to speak to you at last.""

""I'm always available to speak to a superior, Sir.""

""I was looking through the site's personnel roster and I noticed a strange discrepancy. For some reason, I saw your name listed twice. One as an Agent, and one as a Level 0 worker.""

""Yes, Sir. This is correct.""

""I also noticed that the lower ranked Randy Foxtrot is somehow assigned to aid in maintaining an anomalous object, despite being Level 0. And I assume that you had something to do with this. Is that also correct?""

""Yes, Sir. Is there anything else?""

""Damn right, there's something else! I demand an explanation!""

""May I speak candidly, Sir?""

""If that gives me an explanation, then yes.""

""Well, Sir, I'm sure you know that I'm going to retire in about a year. After that, the Foundation becomes nothing more than a memory. I wanted to leave this place with one less regret. That's all. I had to pull in a lot of favours for this to happen. The boy is still going to be given amnesics after this is all over. And I bet that my last year with the Foundation is going to be pure Hell. But I had to do it.""

""All this. Sacrificing the rest of your career and risking your pension. Just for him. Why?""

""I raised Junior from when he was an infant. I love him like a son. I feel proud every time he calls me Dad, even though I know it's not the truth. I wanted to do this last thing for him while I still could. I wanted, just once, for him to meet his real father.""

As Randy began to leave the courtyard, one of the tree's branches bent down in front of his face. The eyeballs at each tip hovered mere inches away from him, seeming to take in every feature. The branch, looking so much like an arm, then reached for his head and tousled his hair? After that, the branch once again pointed back up to the sky.

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B004U426HC,1,-1,3,"I guess I finally have to own up to it; KD Lang has been making the same album for a few releases. You're getting everything you'll love about her, that gorgeous voice, the extremely tasteful arrangements and musicianship, the immaculate production. Touches of country (love that dobro) and Lang's chanteuse's ease with a lyrical lick. But you'll also miss what you really loved. ""Sing It Loud"" is dominated by songs that range from mid-tempo (""Sorrow Nevermore"") to downright languid (""A Sleep With No Dreaming""). The more you listen, the more it becomes obvious that Lang has given up on music that has any kind of pep in its step. When you call your band Siss Boom Bang, you'd expect a little bang, maybe? Not this time.

Lang has still got the chops to take a song and just claim the thing as her own. While it mirrors the version done by Simply Red a couple decades ago, Lang's take on the Talking Heads' ""Heaven"" is masterful. She also nails the title track, but the point is that you're calling the album ""Sing It Loud."" Is it too much to ask for a little volume, a little bit of kick? The same misrepresentation happens when you call a song ""Sugar Buzz."" I'm not one to bemoan that she's no longer cutting ""Absolute Torch and Twang,"" but even ""Invincible Summer"" threw in a few pop thrills for a listener to grab hold of and for Lang to sink her teeth into.

A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B004VQK9XW,1,-1,3,"To begin, I must say that I loved the first Sixx A.M. album The Heroin Diaries which accompanied Nikki Sixx's book of the same name.  It didn't take more than a single listen of ""Life is Beautiful"" to become a fan of the band. At the time the concept of a soundtrack to a book was different and was a new concept to me, looking back I have to say it worked. Almost four years latter Sixx A.M.'s second album This Is Gonna Hurt is released, once again a book by the same name has been released shortly before. I really anticipated this second album as The Heroin Diaries was my favorite out of Nikki Sixx's side projects. The first Sixx A.M. album was fantastic; it was very honest, dark and twisted. I felt that it was reflective of Nikki's life and I could relate to that (and so did many other fans).

The title track kick starts the album with a bang, this is an anthem and fist-pumping track, it has a ""you and me against the world"" type of feeling to it. Unfortunately, the title track is a heavy and rocking as the album gets, everything that follows it is slower or softer, not heavier. When I first heard the single, ""Lies of the Beautiful People"" I admit that I was slightly disappointed but the song grew on me and gets better with each listen.  ""Are You With me"" is I feel, one of the strongest songs of the album, I love the chorus the song just works. When James sings the chorus with the ""come back from the dead"" part I get chills, it's such a great vocal performance and so passionate. ""Deadlihood"" was another song I really liked. ""Help Is On the Way"" has a great message and it rocks, nice build-up to the chorus. ""Skin"" is a lyrical highlight for the band, the lyrics are so personal, honest and touching which was probably the point. It's also very simple with James singing, a piano and orchestra in the background. It closes the album nicely.

This Is Gonna Hurt is overall a softer album and a bit less intense which is not necessarily a bad thing but I expected more rockers I suppose. This time around it feels somewhat less original; I don't have that special feeling, that connection with the lyrics from the first album. On its own This Is Gonna Hurt is a good album that has more of a modern feel to it. If you're a fan of the first I think this album is worth it as there are definitely some great songs worth listening to. I just wasn't blown away like I was with the first Sixx A.M. album, maybe if I never heard the debut I'd like this one much more. TIGH is a strong sophomore release from Sixx A.M., the band sounds tight. James Michaels proves himself once more as a vocalist and delivers a terrific performance. DJ Ashba is killer on guitar and Nikki is well...Nikki!

This Is Gonna Hurt is very much a continuation of TIHD, it's similar in many ways and it has a depth and beautiful lyrics but I feel that this time around while it works, it doesn't work as well as it did with the first album. It's a good follow up to the band's first album and it has its moments, I wouldn't say that it's as good but the ride is still enjoyable this time around.  I don't know, perhaps it was the point I was at in my life when the album was released or maybe I identified more with The Heroin Diaries for some reason. I realize that I've made a lot of comparisons to the first album but that's just me, on its own body of work this is a very good album with once again some excellent lyrics, great guitar work and some solid vocals, it works.  I wouldn't say This Is Gonna Hurt amazed me and I can't say it's a disappointment either because there is a lot of enjoyable music here, I just feel some reviewers are rating it a little higher than it perhaps deserves. It sounds a lot like what the bands of today are coming up with, maybe a little too much. For me I'd say this is a 3 stars out of 5, enough to keep fans coming back.","To begin , I must say that I loved the first Sixx A.M. album The Heroin Diaries which accompanied Nikki Sixx 's book of the same name .

"" Skin "" is a lyrical highlight for the band , the lyrics are so personal , honest and touching which was probably the point . It 's also very simple with James singing , a piano and orchestra in the background . It closes the album nicely . This Is Gon na Hurt is overall a softer album and a bit less intense which is not necessarily a bad thing but I expected more rockers I suppose . This time around it feels somewhat less original ; I do n't have that special feeling , that connection with the lyrics from the first album . On its own This Is Gon na Hurt is a good album that has more of a modern feel to it . If you 're a fan of the first I think this album is worth it as there are definitely some great songs worth listening to . I just was n't blown away like I was with the first Sixx A.M. album , maybe if I never heard the debut I 'd like this one much more . TIGH is a strong sophomore release from Sixx A.M. , the band sounds tight . James Michaels proves himself once more as a vocalist and delivers a terrific performance . DJ Ashba is killer on guitar and Nikki is well ... Nikki ! This Is Gon na Hurt is very much a continuation of TIHD , it 's similar in many ways and it has a depth and beautiful lyrics but I feel that this time around while it works , it does n't work as well as it did with the first album . It 's a good follow up to the band 's first album and it has its moments , I would n't say that it 's as good but the ride is still enjoyable this time around . I do n't know , perhaps it was the point I was at in my life when the album was released or maybe I identified more with The Heroin Diaries for some reason . I realize that I 've made a lot of comparisons to the first album but that 's just me , on its own body of work this is a very good album with once again some excellent lyrics , great guitar work and some solid vocals , it works . I would n't say This Is Gon na Hurt amazed me and I ca n't say it 's a disappointment either because there is a lot of enjoyable music here , I just feel some reviewers are rating it a little higher than it perhaps deserves . It sounds a lot like what the bands of today are coming up with , maybe a little too much . For me I 'd say this is a 3 stars out of 5 , enough to keep fans coming back ."

Nothing worse than when you hear a song for the first time and you can finish the artist's lines in the song because they have no creativity to them.  ""Cut with a knife"", ""Angel like you with Devil like Me""... etc.  It's been done before Nikki.

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B004WC3UZE,1,-1,3,"Emmylou Harris has a voice unlike no other.  I don't even think that is open to debate.  Like it or hate it, she sings like no one else and it has been this way for what, 35-40 years?  Personally, I love her voice.

Normally, I like Harris as a music interpreter as opposed to doing her own material, but now and again she shines in this aspect.  With 'Hard Bargain', she succeeds and fails depending on the track.  While it has gotten stellar reviews, I find it a bit uneven myself.

There are great great songs, like ""The Road"" (a tribute to her mentor, Gram Parsons), the gritty and fun ""Six White Cadillacs"" (though the iTune video version is even better!), the title track, ""Goodnight Old World"" and ""Cross Yourself"".

I know I should like ""Darlin' Kate"", but it is just ok. Same with ""My Name is Emmett Till"".  But I find them to be just fair and I'm left wanting more.  I'm all for Harris' dog rescue program, but ""Big Black Dog"" just does not fit here.

I am impressed that the disk is just Harris and two other musicians.  I think that takes great talent to do this.  I might have liked to hear Anna McGarrigale's backing vocals, but Harris took those out and sang her own harmonies.  Still, it sounds good.

Harris has done more with her own work ('Stumble into Grace', 'Red Dirt Girl'), so I expected and wanted more from this disk.  Don't get me wrong, it's good - better than most anything released this year, but I still expected and wanted better.","Emmylou Harris has a voice unlike no other .

I think there are half a dozen decent tracks here, the remainder are so depressing I really don't want more than one listen. 'Emmett Till' and 'Darlin Kate' may be well-intentioned and personal but boy do they drag. 'Big Black Dog' is embarrassing, whatever Emmylou's involvement with canine welfare. She is wonderful, we all love her. I'm afraid this album doesn't make it for me
I refer you to the Amazon UK review which I  think is spot on:

After a 40-year career which has generated over 25 albums, countless collaborations, twelve Grammy wins, membership of the Country Music Hall of Fame and the undying gratitude of several figures in country music, it's only fair that Emmylou Harris has earned the right to a bit of self-indulgence.
Alas, though, often self-indulgence doesn't work. Harris' genius has always been to take a song and own it, to make it her own. Whether it were an old Louvin Brothers number everyone had forgotten, or a completely new take on a Patsy Cline classic, her voice would transform it.

The trouble with Harris is that she's never been much of a songwriter. Actually, that's not correct, quite: there was one instance where her self-penned work was wonderful. Boulder to Birmingham, written shortly after the death of her collaborator, duettist and friend, Gram Parsons, was a highlight of 1975's Pieces of the Sky album. This set begins with another tribute to Gram, The Road; but where the former was full of imagery and allusion, this one makes its point in the most prosaic of ways. All but two of these songs are self-written, but the only one that resonates is Darlin' Kate, written for her close friend, the late Kate McGarrigle. Here it feels as though she forgets what she is trying to do and just writes from her heart.","Finest work ? Best ever ? Better than ' All I intended to be ' ?

A1RIKXU9XOQ67,B004WC3UZE,1,-1,3,"Emmylou Harris has not released a full studio album since 2008. It hasn't been a long wait, but it's had a big payoff. It would have been hard to top her last effort, All I Intended to Be, but she hasn't quite done that yet.

Hard Bargain starts out with one of the most epic opening songs in recent memory. ""The Road"" is a booming tribute to Gram Parsons and the mark he made on her life and music in his short but influential life and career. It's a touching story song with an instrumental and vocal performance guaranteed to take your breath away.

""The Road"" is a fitting start to an album that will take your breath away. It has all the classic elements of an Emmylou Harris album: love, loss, acceptance, and a touching love of dogs. The songs are honest and emotional. They tell stories that everyone knows, in a way only Harris could tell them. But her musical influences are more obviously diverse on Hard Bargain, taking elements from various points of her later career.

A startling rockier side to Harris is shown in songs like ""Six White Cadillacs"" and especially on ""New Orleans."" Her voice is melted into a background of pounding drums and electric guitar. Songs like ""Home Sweet Home"" and ""Hard Bargain"" are are more optimistic and poppy. They have more subdued instrumentals.

Among Harris' quieter ballads are ""Nobody,"" ""The Ship on his Arm,"" ""My Name is Emmett Till,"" and ""Darlin' Kate"" (one being the tribute to a boy murdered in Mississippi and the last being a tribute to Canadian folk singer and friend Kate McGarrigle). All of them are powerfully delivered, but they fall unfortunately short.

""Big Black Dog"" is one of the bouncier sounding songs on the album and it has the sweetest and simplest story to tell. It is just what it claims to be: a song about a big black dog that Harris rescued.

Although Harris has always sung very personal songs, Hard Bargain focuses more on her insecurities on feeling alone and on growing older in songs like ""Nobody"" and ""Lonely Girl."" It's nice to see this tender side of Harris, but neither song is particularly memorable.

Hard Bargain is full of old comforts and unexpected new developments in Harris' career. It has something for many of her fans and shifts effortlessly from one sound and mood to the next. But there are too many moments on it that fall short of the kind of masterpieces Harris has made in the past.","Emmylou Harris has not released a full studio album since 2008 .

It all started with his 2000 debut ""Aijuswanaseing"", he crafted a stellar successful debut- despite his ties to Def Jam Recordings. Not that it was a bad label, but at the time Def Jam had a long history of underpromoting its R&B acts (Remember Alyson Williams, The Black Flames, Tashan, Playa or Case?). He followed that album up with his 2002 sophomore album ""Juslisen"" and a year later with the criminally underrated ""Soulstar"". While he was on the rise, his label was on the decline as far as promotion... so he wanted off the label. In 2006, he was placed in a unique label trade off between himself and rapper Fabolous-  with Def Jam's Musiq Soulchild going to Atlantic, while Atlantic's Fabolous went to Def Jam. After a four year hiatus, he resumed his career with his first album for Atlantic- 2007's ""Luvanmusiq"", followed a year later with the experimental ""OnMyRadio"". After laying low for a few years, he returned with his sixth recording, ""Musiqinthemagiq"".

One thing that's obvious about the record is the noticeable absence of his longtime producers Ivan ""Orthodox"" Barias & Carvin ""Ransum"" Haggins. They have been replaced by Wyclef Jean's producing partner Jerry ""Wonda"" Duplessis, who produces much of the album- including the first single, the Swizz Beatz featured ""Anything"". Producer Lil' Ronnie produces the uptempo song ""Single"", a song about Musiq stuck in the dilemma of meeting an unattached woman while he's in a relationship. Swedish production team Element handles two songs- the ballad ""Yes"" as well as the 60's inspired ""Lovecontract"". On the track ""Dowehaveto"", Musiq tries to reason with a seemingly argumentative significant other and takes a woman to task who relegated him to being friendzoned on ""Befriends"". The album ends with its best song, the synth heavy ""Likethesun"". Overall, ""Musiqinthemagiq"" is another solid album from Musiq Soulchild- even if he seems content with taking the safe route and rarely stepping outside of his comfort zone.","In his decade long career , Philadelphia native Musiq Soulchild has a great , if often overlooked , body of work .

A17814AD8EWTN4,B004X0XR94,1,-1,3,"Musiq Soulchild has been one of the more consistent R&B/Neo-Soul singers of the last decade. And the reason for that is probably beccause he has a neo-soul style, but he incorporates contemporary R&B touches into his music as well, where as most neo-soul singers stick to that sub genre, Musiq knows how to balance the two extremely well. And Musiqinthemagiq is just another continuation of his already bolstering discography. While the album is definitely far from his best, it's still a typical Musiq album for the most part. The only really big change in style on this album is that he works with some brand new producers that he's never worked with before. There's not one producer on this album that's produced on any of his other albums. Which is a gift and a curse kind of. I always liked the producers he worked with before, (Mainly Carvin & Ivan, and Warryn Campbell) especially when he would switch it up and throw a big name in the mix like the Underdogs or Neff U. But on Musiqinthemagiq, he switches it up completely by enlisting a completely new crew of producers, Jerry Wonda being the executive producer. Because of this, Musiqinthemagiq does have a different style than his previous albums, Musiq himself called this album his most radio friendly album to date and most commercial record. And while part of that is True, due to songs like the funky first single ""Anything"" and the mid tempo contemporary track ""Single"", or the mid tempo banger ""Backtowhere"" which could have been on any Trey Songz or Chris Brown album, the album still has the genuine gentleman R&B feel that all of his previous albums do. There is still plenty of vintage Musiq on this album, like the mid tempo ode to marriage ""Sayido"", which reminds me a lot of ""Teachme"". Or ""Befriends"" also has the vintage neo-soul sound that Musiq fans have come to love. But what keeps this album from being a True stand out, is that while there is a fair amount of good material on the album, towards the end of the album it starts to drag, and the lack of ANY big name producers becomes more and more evident as the album drags on, the songs almost start to blend together, making it hard to distinguish what songs are the keepers and what ones are the duds. With a little more focus, and maybe some better production, this could have been one of his better albums, but in the end it ended up just being solid... nothing amazing or mind blowing, but a solid addition to his discography... if you liked any of his previous albums, you will get enjoyment out of this one as well, just don't expect anything as good as Juslisen or even Luvanmusiq for that matter...","Musiq Soulchild has been one of the more consistent R&B / Neo - Soul singers of the last decade .

It's music. Either you like, love it, or hate it. My tastes aren't your tastes... and if you're really here trying to decide whether spending $5 to buy songs you already know by heart anyway... then you're simply wasting your time. Just buy it and enjoy what you've gained.

There has been a lot of things that she went through musically, including a nasty lawsuit with her ex-label Sony, and her professional life as a actress has blossomed with the sequel to Why Did I Get Married last year which did well at the box office. But musically, her songs haven't shown lately that they have the spark they once brought out from her era with Sony. Her latest song, So In Love with Anthony Hamilton, from her upcoming record The Light Of The Sun is alright, but honestly the song is very short. I also wish that there could've been a bit more with the chemistry between Anthony & Jill. I still hope there is better than what has came out from Jill already. It is honestly very sad when someone whom has had a great voice, but loses their feeling in songs to showcase it. I just hope there is better from Jill when her album comes around next month.

A6J7UPYUI96XO,B0041Q5YJ6,1,-1,3,"On a good note: the strong hooks that were dominant on Anberlin's 2007 masterpiece ""Cities"" are back for the most part on their new album. 2008's ""New Surrender"" sounded good while it was on, and the lyrics were certainly top-notch. But the songs were not as strong as the material on ""Cities"" and thus it sounded like an album full of b-sides from ""Cities.""

2010's ""Dark is the Way Light is a Place"" is more radio-friendly than anything this band has done before. At ten tracks, it is also their shortest album. The songs are as sweet as sugar, with big sweeping pop hooks and melodic sing-along verses. The problem is that the lyrics have been stripped down to basic sentiments about love, relationships, and soul-searching. So what we have is ten songs that sound as if they were recorded by a more lightweight band who was trying to sound like Anberlin. The production is flawless, and there is not a single bad song on the entire album. But the sound is so similar to modern day Coldplay mixed with some late 1980's U2, that one could literally sing the lyrics to those bands' past hits to some of these songs. I thought at the time ""Cities"" was released, that it would never be topped, and that just might be the case. But Anberlin has a world of talent, and if their next album is a bit riskier and edgier, they might match or exceed all they have previously done. But these ten songs are polished and spit-shined for the masses, and while some may cry ""sellout,"" others might just wonder why they felt the need to so closely emulate other bands.","On a good note : the strong hooks that were dominant on Anberlin 's 2007 masterpiece "" Cities "" are back for the most part on their new album . 2008 's "" New Surrender "" sounded good while it was on , and the lyrics were certainly top - notch .

AKEKH0KGH6QWO,B004ZGCZ9Y,-1,1,5,"Grimm isn't as bluesy as he was on AGT (from his songs listed on another website, I didn't watch the show) but that isn't a negative. This CD seems to find all avenues of pop/rock and blues. A tad country, a tad honkytonk. Vocally, Grimm comes across as emotionally raw, exposed and vulnerable as if some lady hurt him pretty badly. Fallin' is truly brutal. It may be an Alicia Keys helmed song but Michael Grimm has clearly lived it a time or two. This will be an odd comparison but this CD reminds me of Josh Groban's latest, Illuminations, wherein JG tried something different with much less success. Voices do need to be great, as is Groban's, but material matters. Grimm, mixing in the other styles, nailed it.

  While I am rating this as five stars but it isn't perfect. It isn't Grimms' singing or the production value that I find fault with - it's the duet with Ann Wilson nor do I care for song #6, Champagne and Wine. But I am more of a root beer and Aqua Fina kinda lady so that's just that. The duet with Wilson struggles because she doesn't seem able to keep up with Michael. It could be any back-up singer and I relish that song so it was a bit disappointing for me. The other duet with Travis Tritt, includes a vocal misfire by Tritt but it's still the better of the two. Even with the Tritt bobble towards the end. All in all, this CD is a reminder that America did pick the right winner last run of AGT. And I didn't even watch the show, just heard of MG by word of mouth. This is one sincere album.","Grimm is n't as bluesy as he was on AGT ( from his songs listed on another website , I did n't watch the show ) but that is n't a negative .

But they really have too early to be considered as a one hit wonder. Musically though, they still have a lot of growth to build on. Don't Stop (Color On The Walls,) the second single from their debut album Torches isn't a bad song, but not really anything that puts them with their feet forward to the next plateau. I do hope though there is more good music from them down the horizon. Something that is pumping up to for new fans to see and hear that is exciting.
