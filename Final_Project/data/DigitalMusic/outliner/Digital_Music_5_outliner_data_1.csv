There was a radio station in the South that was allegedly either bombed or burned down for playing this song!  Janis had the insight to write this song at age 13!  I would give this song 5 stars except that the girl cops out at the end. However, the song played in 1965 or 1967, so the taboo of the times still has to be considered.

Jim talks a lot about his recessive genes causing his absolute paleness, his Midwest upbringing, and his hatred of reading. But the most famous of his jokes is present here, the famed Hot Pocket joke. How much can one man talk about the destructive nature of this lovely frozen food item? You will be surprised.

The best part of this release is the included DVD with several of classic Gaffigan stand ups originally on Comedy Central. He sure looked really skinny and pale back then!

A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B000X964EY,-1,1,5,"Monolithic Baby! is the sixth full-length Monster Magnet studio album, it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time.

The album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.

The aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.

The fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.

Regardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'

Most Monster Magnet fans are fond of Dave's Vocals and lyrics, which are up to their usual high standard on this record, and most fans will be more than happy with this album, the songwriting is of a very high caliber and there are so many rocking songs that this is one of the most direct, focused and in your face records the band have made.

Of course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments. If that describes your feelings in similar situations then maybe give Monolithic Baby! a miss, elsewise do not hesitate to pick up a copy, it really is a very enjoyable record.","Monolithic Baby ! is the sixth full - length Monster Magnet studio album , it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time .

A235NA61RC6YC1,B000XXZ31K,1,-1,3,"The Good
""Call to Arms"" is no doubt the band's anthem for this album. A major difference you notice right away is that this album is a lot brighter and hopeful as compared to their 2006 album We Don't Need to Whisper. ""Everything's Magic"" adds a hint of keyboards and lots of progressive effects that complement Tom Delonge's (ex-Blink 182) melodic, high-pitched vocals. ""Breathe"" is not your typical radio ballad, but more like a sci-fi movie love song. Driving guitars mixed with melodic vocal breaks make up the track ""Secret Crowds."" Drummer Atom Willard (Offspring) experiments with some unique drum beats on this one. ""True Love"" employs electronic drum beats, unique guitar licks, and uplifting vocals.

The Bad
Despite the different effects and drum beats used, the album tends to sound like one long, drawn-out song.

The Verdict
The brighter more optimistic Angles and Airwaves are far more enjoyable than their darker and hopeless debut. However, lack of diversity keeps this album from returning to my CD player.","The Good

For those who have already picked up ""Dead Again"", this new edition is only worth picking up for die hard fans of the band.  The bonus DVD includes the live Wacken performances of fan favorites ""Kill You Tonight"", ""Love You to Death"", ""Anesthesia"", and ""Christian Woman"", along with the videos for ""The Profits of Doom"" and ""September Sun"".  An interview with the band is included as well, but it's nothing special, even though it concludes with Josh Silver touring Coney Island, which is actually pretty funny.  As for the album itself, you can check my old review for a more detailed take on it, but other than the DVD and new red colored cover, this is the same ""Dead Again"" that you picked up last year.  That's not a bad thing for more casual or new fans to the band who haven't picked up ""Dead Again"" yet, of which by all means this is the edition to pick up.  Other than that though, unless you are a die hard fan who needs to own everything Type O Negative, or you don't own ""Dead Again"" at all, this re-release isn't all that worth picking up.","Type O Negative 's most recent album , "" Dead Again "" gets re - released and repackaged with a bonus DVD .

A5TJL46NVFH47,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,4,"Musically, ""Dead Again"" features some of the most ambitious, memorable songs in Type O's career.  The formula hasn't exactly changed, but these songs for the most part match up to past classics.  However, lyrically, this is easily Peter Steele's worst work ever, and oftentimes the inane lyrics detract from the emotional power the arrangements inherently have.

There are several reasons this might be the case.  For instance, it's quite possible that all Peter knew how to write about were the typical Type O topics: death, romance, wolves, fire, etc... The lyrics on this release instead attempt to make real inspirational/thoughtful and moral statements.  That in itself is not the problem, nor is the fact that apparently now Catholic Steele preaches his newfound faith through several of these songs.  The problem is that the lyrics are usually either simple and literal (""I'm a drug addict, always will be"", ""there's no excuse for drug abuse"", ""A child is torn from the womb unbaptized, there's no question it's infanticide"") or pun-filled attempts at humor (""Turn your cheek, gets ripped off, that's why we're given four"").  The song ""Ode to Locksmiths"" actually has the line ""Now I know why girls hate boys,'cuz Eve was in fact raped"".  It seems painfully obvious that Steele's faith is hardly sincere (more out of fear of death than anything) and that he's only preaching because he feels he should, not because he really believes in what he says, judging by the tired and sometimes ridiculous points he tries to make.  Steele himself even said in an interview that he had a hard time finding lyrical inspiration for this album.  A few of the tracks have decent lyrics, such as ""September Sun"" but most, being long songs, have their fair share of good and bad parts.  Only 2 become unlistenable, ""She Burned Me Down"" and ""Halloween in Heaven"".

Other than that, this is a much more energetic and punky Type O than we've had in a while.  Nearly all of the songs have some sort of throw back to their early days, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" is fast throughout.  Many of the songs are quite positive, also... this may be the least depressing album in their career.  Even the World Coming Down-esque ""These Three Things"" has a triumphant finale.  There's no question to me that the drama in their songwriting has improved... all of the epics on this album truly build energy and go somewhere.  Kenny's guitar work seems more Sabbath-inspired than ever before, and although the guitar tone has lost the signature, thick, flanged tone, the combination of Steele's vocal melodies and Silver's organ textures still creates the signature Type O sound.  The songs are full of tempo changes just like the Type O epics of old (""Black No. 1"") but there seems to be a logic and flow present in these songs that just wasn't there in those days.  The album is incredibly consistent, and has no filler and is easy to listen to all the way through despite its length.

In conclusion, ""Profits of Doom"", ""These Three Things"", ""Ode to Locksmiths"" and the haunting closer ""All Hail and Farewell to Britain"" with its excellent ambient outro all contain some of my favorite Type O moments.  I'd recommend ""Dead Again"" to any Type O fan who doesn't put too much importance in the lyrics.","Musically , "" Dead Again "" features some of the most ambitious , memorable songs in Type O 's career .

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B0010S8HRO,-1,1,4,"I figured coming from such creative stock that Martha Wainwright's album would be 5+ star worthy.  It's good, but it's not great.  Like her brother Rufus, I like the idea of her, more than I actually like her.

I have heard her sing with her father (Loudon Wainwright III) and she came across much more bluesy than she does on this effort (check out ""You Never Call"" on his live disk). Her voice on this disk hits some qualities of Marianne Faithful (great) to some more alt. generic female lead singer(not so great).

The good thing (for me) is that she kind of defies a certain style.  It's not that she's all over the place, just that the music doesn't fit nicely into one genre.

Wainwright's writing is pretty good for her initial effort. I think that's where all her family's strentgh lies anyway...which is not a knock to their performing abilities.

But like most disks there are some outstanding tracks: ""When the Day is Short"", ""Wither I Must Wander"" and the oft mentioned ode (?)to her father, ""BMFA"".

Some of the highlights of the slower songs are ""That's What Love Is"" (my favorite song), ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"",  ""Talk To Me"", ""If You Love Me"" (which sounds like it could have fit right in on her previous huge hit of a CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>) and even ""Come To Me (Peace)"" which ends the album on a slightly more upbeat and inspiring note.

It's just more of a grower in my opinion. To me though some of these tracks are just amazing. I guess the ballads/mid-tempos actually makes this one of my favorite recent MJB efforts.

A3FTSMLO4972GR,B00110DT4C,-1,1,4,"This is a decent album; I personally was expecting more soul into it. What I actually got was a mixture like Geffen is trying to turn Mary J. Blige into a black Carole King. This became apparent in songs ""Smoke"" and ""Fade Away"". I did listen to the record three times consecutively on my recent trip and the first half was pretty good, what I was looking for was for Mary to hit me with something heavy like she has on all of her recent efforts (i.e. PMS, I'm Not Lookin', Changes I've Been Going Through, Not Gon' Cry) and then I heard ""Roses and personally, I'm split with the song. It's Mary but it's didn't grab me like Whoa!.
I did appreciate ""Just Fine"" a little more than when I did initially. ""Grown Woman"" I love and ""Work that"" picked up where the hidden track from her last album left off. The beat is nice, the lyrics are little B-rate. After ""Just Fine"" things start to run together and sound a bit same, then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little. Her duet with Usher ""Shake down"" is cute but a bit odd vocally. Usher is nice but I would've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary's (i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight). This album is a hit and miss with me, where only a good 3 songs are my favorites and they aren't the best of Mary.","This is a decent album ; I personally was expecting more soul into it .

A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B0011B6UI8,1,-1,2,"The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought ""Cool...this just might work!"" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's True talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's ""I'm Not In Love."" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the ""Big boys don't cry"" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the ""I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back"" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with ""Under The Milky Way"", ""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Broken Wings."" Oh, sure, ""Under...."" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on ""....Town"" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for ""Town"", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for ""Wing""). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal ""Human."" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a True testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. ""Holding On To Yesterday"" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. ""Baker Street"" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. ""Let's Go Out Tonight"" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on ""For The One."" Much like ""Human"", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to ""Miss You Nights"" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! ""Blue Rose"" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. ""Cry"" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (""You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb""), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with ""Imagine"", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).","The whole point behind covering a song is to A ) better the original or B ) shake things up and make it different than the original .

There are standout tracks, such as ""Never Change"", ""Can't Stop"", ""City Of Gods"", ""The Come Up"" and the Bonustrack #2 ""Magic Hour"", but the rest of the album just seems to be randomly and unkindly put together.

AZ is one of the best MCs in the business (no doubt), but he needs to come up with a neatly organized album. I am thinking about DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Buckwild to produce it with guest appearances by Nas, CL Smooth, Common and Cormega.

None the less, pick up this CD to support AZ. He is one of the last True rappers in the business! Check out AZ's Greatest Hits CD ""Decade 94-04"", which is hard to find in the US.

(It starts with one)
 One thing I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To explain in due time
 (All I know)
 Time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down to the end of the day
 The clock ticks life away
 (Its so unreal)
 Didnt look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on but didn't even know
 I wasted it all just to watch you go

 I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time when...

 I tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end
 It doesn't even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end
 It doesn't even matter

 One thing, I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To remind myself how
 I tried so hard
 In spite of the way you were mocking me
 Acting like I was part of your property
 Remembering all the times you fought with me
 Im surprised it got so (far)
 Things aren't the way they were before
 You wouldnt even recognize me anymore
 Not that you knew me back then
 But it all comes back to me

I used a magnifying glass to study the picture art on the cover of the CD jewel case and found the caption: twisted dog sister. The blimp in the upper left corner of the picture on the CD cover has the message: BAD YEAR. The CD is round and does not have the entire message, but the art on the CD itself clearly has bombs that are called DOOKIE. This CD was released in 1994 during the transition from January to February, so MTV had many opportunities to play the song Basket Case during the year 1994, and I think a special thrill was beheld internally at the idea of giving myself the creeps and my mind plays tricks on me. Basket Case was the Martin Luther Stonehood of 1994 expressing itself in punk rock, and people who have forgotten are like Americans who lack Hegel circling the present with the depth of its past.","Twenty years ago , at the end of 1994 , MTV counted down 100 music videos of 1994 and gave the number one video position to the song Basket Case by Green Day from the CD Dookie .

Let's reflect for a moment--

Between 1982 and 1987, Prince came out with 1999, Purple Rain, Around the World in a Day, Parade, and Sign o' the Times.

Pause. Taking it in...

Do you realize how many songs are included here that are necessary elements of the cosmos?

By my count, at least twelve.

This is the most amazing thing that has ever been done.

If the man had only produced Purple Rain, that would be the most amazing thing that has ever been done.

No.""

After he tried to reinvent himself for the 80s with Flush The Fashion, I think many people abandoned him for the cruddy new bands that started popping up.

All of us fans fell in love with the creepy character of Alice Cooper, and this album comes across as an album by the man and not the character.  Look at his picture on the cover.  Yes, it is funny, but ""Alice Cooper"" wouldn't do something like that, or make an album of songs like that either.

A3O7GCUU4VEZY3,B001239GP4,-1,1,4,As described,
A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.

1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  ""Reach"" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.
2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.
3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.
4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.
5) 2 Find U: Weak.
6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.
7) Doin' Fine: ""We are what everyone wants to be.""  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.
8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is ""spells"" the song title...).
9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.
10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.
11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.
12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.
13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).
14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own ""becoming"" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.

As you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to ""This Way"") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.","I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel ... and how would that work out ?

A2WZYL0HNUR5XH,B001237HCI,-1,1,5,"For former Jewel fans who don't like this CD, tough!  I've never heard anything like this, and my friends agree it's great.

""Stand"" (take a stand) is like some time tunnel idea from when music counted for something, set to a sleazy bar beat that holds the counterbalancing darkness.  We haven't had an artist who could popularize stuff like this in a while.

And there hasn't been so much hidden in lyrics since people tried playing Beatles records backwards.  Consider that ""Intuition,"" seems to be ""follow your heart"" inspiration, all mushy stuff you'd be proud to sing in church, when suddenly a stacatto vocal riff breaks in with ""just cash in, sell yourself.""

There are two striking examples of subliminal change of the apparent message by the silencing of a ""t"" at the end of a word.  In ""Leave The Lights On"" the rhythm makes it impossible to pronounce the ""t"" in ""can't"" so what we actually hear is ""you can try my love, you can buy my love"" instead of ""you can't buy my love.""

The second one is in ""Yes U Can.""  The first time the ""t"" in ""boots"" does come through, but after that it sounds like ""b"".  This one will get my review censored if I spell it out here, and maybe that's why she wrote the lyrics that way, to get past the WalMart censors?  The albumn does NOT have an explicit lyrics rating.  But the ""boots"" are bumpin'.  Apparently it worked.

A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"Firstly, I am a huge Jewel fan.  She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever.  At first, I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering.  The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general.  But let's not give up on Jewel so quickly.  I admit, I don't like the first single from 0304 ""Intuition"" because it is rather forgetful pop (and won't go down as a classic), but you cannot deny that it appealed to many younger people.  The second single ""Stand"" really appeals to me, on the other hand.  It is a very catchy song, and while it is not traditional Jewel, it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there. And at the end of the day, isn't that what is important about a singer?  To be able to re-invent themself from time to time?  Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it.  I consider ""0304"" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different.  She never said she wouldn't go back to her traditional style in the future.  Unfortunately at the moment, folk type music isn't that popular ... so that's another reason why Jewel is trying something different.  In 1978, the Rolling Stones released a disco single (Miss You) because that's what the public were really into then - even though rock was their normal style. Going with the flow, in other words. Times will change yet again, and folk music will be what the public want.  Cycles ...
""0304"" is Jewel in 2003.  It's not the classic of ""pieces of you"" or ""Spirit"", but it's not as vile as many reviewers have stated.","Firstly , I am a huge Jewel fan .

Over the past four years, however, he's had but one top ten hit, the chart topping heart tugger ""The Little Girl.""  With his recent singles struggling, a hits collection was the logical choice for Montgomery's next release.

Among the hits not included on either collection are the engaging ""Ain't Got Nothin' On Us,"" ""Love Working On You,"" and ""Hello L.O.V.E.""

What may be surprising is that she's managed to pick out an album's worth--well,almost--of songs that hold the listeners interest,something she failed to achieve with the mostly half-baked BELIEVE(the obvious exceptions being the title track and 'All Or Nothing').

Granted, there's nothing here that matches the instant pleasure of 'Believe' or 'All or Nothing', but there's also nothing here that matches the abundance of filler found on BELIEVE either. Lyrically, the tracks follow similarly in the vein of her eighties' corporate-rock albums than her more recent output. The set's first international single, 'The Music's No Good Without You',seems an odd choice, if only because it isn't one of the albums more ingratiating tunes.  Far better is 'Alive Again', as well as 'A Different Kind Of Love Song' and 'Real Love'. Also interesting is 'You Take It All', an electronica-driven track that sounds like Cher trying to channel Olive or Dido.  Among the very few missteps are the sole ballad 'Rain Rain', which is just plain dull, as well as a pedestrian remake of 'When The Money's Gone'. The only other minor quibble is the use of the dreaded vocoder on nearly all the tracks--it sounded cool the first thousand times we heard 'Believe', but has since been rendered just another tired, over-utilitzed gimmick--her voice is better than ever, and the heavy reliance on vocal effects just detracts from the album's overall impact after several listens. Though it doesn't match her underrated nineties opus IT'S A MAN'S WORLD as her best, it is a superior album to BELIEVE and reinforces the notion that Cher sounds best when she supresses the rock chick and unleashes her inner dance diva.","After staging arguably the biggest musical comeback this side of Tina Turner with her dance - driven project BELIEVE , Cher 's back three years on to offer up more of the same with LIVING PROOF.Utitlizing many of the same producers , she attempts to build on the momentum experienced with the previous set , and the end result is an overall more consistent album .

And ""Here in My Heart"" is a Lenny Kravitz-produced song from 1997's anthology THE HEART OF CHICAGO.

So what other creative ways can Rhino repackage this material?  The Terry Kath years?  The Robert Lamm-penned songs? Songs from albums whose titles don't contain a Roman numeral?

Don't get me wrong. If all you're looking for is Chicago's love songs--and ONLY their love songs, this is a solid collection.  My only problem with this is that it presents the group as a bit too one dimensional.","After Rhino released the near - definitive 2 - CD collection THE VERY BEST OF : ONLY THE BEGINNING in 2002 , I was a bit confused by the title . "" Only the Beginning ? "" Hey ! Chicago has n't had a top 40 hit since 1991 's "" Chasin ' the Wind . "" But LOVE SONGS makes it perfectly clear .

Before I even had time to think about it, we looked at each other and started ""car dancing"", you know, you're bustin' a move while moving at a high rate of speed, singing at the top of your lungs, laughing, crying and just having fun.  People driving past us would look over and smile, or laugh, some even paced themselves alongside us and broke out in their own car dancing moves.

I didn't stop and think about what people would think if they knew my husband had just died.  I didn't stop and think about anything except the moment me and my best friend were in, ""Girl's just having fun"".

The lyrics are easy to pick up, sing along with and dance to and the video was great.

I believe that if more girls just wanted to have that sort of carefree silly fun, the world might be a little less uptight.","I love this song , it brings back bittersweet memories of the summer of 2000 .

Listen to the phrase, ""I'm going where the sun keeps shining through the pouring rain.  Going where the weather suits my clothes.""  In the south along the Gulf Coast they have a saying for this condition.  ""The devil is beating his wife""  This means the sun is shining and it is raining like hell.

He goes for the sledgehammer right over your head, when a little more subtleness would have better for a love song written for his girlfriend at the time.  The guitar work sounds a little too much like a knock off of Neal Schoen.  The song was a massive hit in early 1984, peaking at number 3.  It would be his only solo song to crack the top ten.",""" Oh Sherrie "" was Journey lead singer Steve Perry 's first solo release .
