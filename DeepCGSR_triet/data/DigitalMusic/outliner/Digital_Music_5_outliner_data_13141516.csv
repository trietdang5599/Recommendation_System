The singer intended it to be about a man and woman, but the tv show employed it to illustrate the fragile truce between two male friends.

A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B00122KTCO,-1,1,5,"Originally known as The Detroit Spinners, this group was discovered by Moonglows great Harvey Fuqua around 1960. In fact their very first release ""Thats What Girls Are Made For"" was done in The Moonglows style. The Spinners were signed by Berry Gordy in the early 60's but struggled mightily to find their sound. They released a dozen or so singles before finally hitting paydirt in 1970 with ""It's A Shame"".

Convinced that the group needed to go in an entirely different direction, good friend Aretha Franklin convinced they to leave Motown and sign with Atlantic Records where she introduced them to producer Thom Bell. This was a match made in heaven. And as they say the rest is history. One of their first big records at Atlantic was ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love"" in early 1973. The song spent 15 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #4 and was a #1 on the R&B charts as well.

It has that classic Cars sound--a quirky bridge between rock and new wave

To be clear the three-star rating I give this song is a good rating.  I suppose someone else might give it four stars, but I save four stars for great songs and five stars for songs I simply could not live without (there are only 8 five-star rated songs in my entire music collection.)

If you like the Cars sound and do not own any of the songs on the album ""Candy-O"" then purchase the whole album.  Because I already owned ""Let's Go"" from another compilation, I could not quite justify the cost and bought this individual .mp3 instead.  I own five of the songs on this album:  ""Let's Go"", ""It's All I Can Do"", ""Double Life"", ""Candy-O"" and ""Dangerous Type.""

If you are trying to gauge my review, understand that I tend to prefer the Cars more rock-oriented songs, which are sometimes, but not always their most popular.  ""It's All I Can Do"" is definitely one of their more pop-oriented songs.  It just happens to be one of their better ones.","This is the third - best song on the Cars second - best album .

When you listen to it, you'll probably wish like me that there was another verse in there, but this song sounds like a studio session where he had one solid verse, a chorus, and decided he'd ad-lib the rest of it.

It did work out, albeit, to be the country version of dentist waiting room ballads, but the lyrics are great for those times that you did wish you were waiting for a root canal, or that you weren't surrounded by hapless co-workers.

For me, the first thing that comes to me when this song comes on, my desire to be on a beach somewhere none of you are going to be at!

If you like the artist, just buy the album.... who ever bothers reading these dumb self-promoting, badly spelled, and grammatically incorrect reviews anyway? (Unless maybe it's to groan at how bad our English has become with the younger crowd.)

I like this one for the 13 second descending metallic fade in, the driving beat, the strings throughout, the weird middle fast spoken bit, the little 'day in the life' outro, the imagery, e.g. 'the tired streets that hide away.'

Sadly, it has been 20 years since the deviating suicide of Michael Hutchence of INXS, and his death is still just as sad and unparalleled for anyone whop is a hard core fan of the 80's Australian rock band. Yet, INXS did try and comeback hard in 2005, with a new lead singer, J.D. Fortune, and he took the group back to the heights they used to have for a brief shining moment with their 2005 album, Switch. Their lead single, Pretty Vegas from the Switch album is one of those songs that tries to bring in the hearty hard core pieces from some of INXS's past songs like Devil Inside from their Kick record. The song is alright, but not anything that tries to be more striking to bring in new fans of INXS. It is just so sad that INXS isn't together anymore, but they did leave a amazing imprint in Australian rock music that has still has not been matched from the land down under. Maybe the next Michael or J.D. will come around the corner and try and be more than fiercely pretty.

So much negative was written about the man, it is often too difficult to find a common middle ground among those who favor him versus those who do not mind repeating what seems to be the most popular. Leave Me Alone announces clearly that Mike HEARD it all, evening the references to him and The Elephant Man, which he shows in the video. His expression, through both music and his words, never seem to bring what he wanted the most: peace and/or acceptance. The Glove started as the result of his vitiligo and that experience, clearly marked what most call abnormal, and he felt the same. Who wants to feel less than, even if others do not say the same? I can recall being teased as a child, from, ""He wears mascara!"" because of my long eyelashes, or, ""He has eyes like Tweetie Bird."" I got dogged openly, in front of the girls I so wanted to notice me.

Leave Me Alone is the theme song for so many of us at various points in our existence, and our lives do not need a camera for an audience: the audience is always there in our minds.

Turns out I'd heard it before, I just hadn't known the title or connected it to Toto at all.  And while I still prefer ""Rosanna"" over ""Africa,"" ""Africa"" is still a very enjoyable song, and makes me want to check out more by the band.

""Africa"" is a nice upbeat song, a well-done mix of pop and rock with a tune that's pleasant to listen to and good vocal harmonies.  The lyrics are somewhat generic -- despite the occasional Africa references (such as Kilimanjaro), it seems more like a generic love song than anything else.  Still, as another well-known band likes to say, ""some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs, and what's wrong with that?""

Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war. German artists are so avant garde, like Mike Myer's Dieter.","and I had purchased 4 of my favorite songs from the 1980s from Amazon Prime to listen to while I drove through the scenic roads of Northern Norway .

The lyrics are sung by four band members simultaneously. They sound awesome on the chorus, and in little extraneous moments: 3:03, chen trench strokes, etc? at 3:08, 4:16.

I think this is the song that finally turned Sly Stone away from songs about racial harmony. He didn't think people were getting the message, plus stardom had gotten out of control. He turned further inward and away from the mainstream, took more drugs, and began to write more about more controversial subjects like racism and violence. He name checks his earlier tunes, as if to say 'what was that all about?' He felt like he had sold out and lost the good vibes.","What do Mice Elf look like ?

I bought just about ever CD that the Delfonics released since CD's first came out ($600 for a CD player then), because something was missing or not in stereo on that CD. Most of these re-mixes are very clean, and again I'll have to replace 90% of the Delfonics songs on my MP3 player with these. What stood out to me was the first recordings were made at the old Cameo-Parkway building, which later became Philly International on Broad street, but when Sigma was opened in 1968, and the Delfonics started recording there, you can really hear on these CD's the voices of Thom Bell if you know it, with the background vocals, until he stopped producing them. The horns sound fantastic, especially Joe (the lips) D, and on The Delfonics theme near the end, I could have sworn that was Lenny Pakula on the organ making that sound alone, but now I hear a Kettle drum roll with him that I never hear before with this cheap headset, I had to backup to make sure I wasn't hearing things. Next I'll play this CD I'll use my good phones, or through speakers. It's hard to believe some of these recordings are 49 years old. Any disappointments? Yes, just 3 for me. Can't get over Losin' you; was remixed in mono, ""I gave to you""; was not the extended version, and the extended version I do have is one of the worst mix out there of the song, so I'm still looking. ""Didn't I blow you Mind"", was the only song that the band recorded live together, and I love strings, but they leaked into Earls drum set and had to be lowered, and it's the only Delfonics record where the strings are too low for me, though this version is better than any previous ones, the strings are to far in the mix and I was expecting a miracle I guess. I got the CD on the 1st day it was released and I'm glad I bought it. I'm no expert, but some of these songs sound like they recorded at a higher digital rate. If you have these Delfonic songs on a CD already, you may not notice any difference, but if you have pretty good ears or thought you knew every note or sound in these songs and want the best versions of these song recorded, then this is a must buy. I don't know if this guy had the original tapes to work with, but he somehow got rid of the musicians talking in the beginning of; ""Think about me baby"", and someone's enthusiasm on ""Trying to make a fool of me"" after the music intro, maybe Thom Bell?

A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00137ZDC4,-1,1,4,"The main flaw of this song has less to do with music than promotion. Epic Records, Michael Jackson's label ever since the release of Off The Wall, is trying to push this as a new single despite the fact that it's (apparently) at-least six years old. Some of the vocals may be new, I don't know, but the music; the drumbeat of which is a replica of Remember The Time; isn't. That's a major marketing glitch that could've easily been fixed by simply releasing the song as an outtake from the Dangerous album. It's also a bad look for producer Teddy Riley, considering the fact that it's only taken six years for his New Jack Swing to sound old.

Other flaws, like lack of bass on a song that should be pounding the club and subpar vocals melodies during the verses, are relatively minor. Aesthetically this is a good song overall. The protagonist, a knife-wielding killer named Susie, is bad, at-least in a moral sense, but the chorus sounds catchy enough, especially during the final peak when Michael Jackson starts hyping it up with his signature ad-libs. The song then goes from good to great for about twenty seconds. ""It was blood on the dance floor,"" Jackson sings with masterful inflections, ""It was blood on the dance floor."" The last two times he says it are particularly striking.

It 's also a bad look for producer Teddy Riley , considering the fact that it 's only taken six years for his New Jack Swing to sound old . Other flaws , like lack of bass on a song that should be pounding the club and subpar vocals melodies during the verses , are relatively minor . Aesthetically this is a good song overall . The protagonist , a knife - wielding killer named Susie , is bad , at - least in a moral sense , but the chorus sounds catchy enough , especially during the final peak when Michael Jackson starts hyping it up with his signature ad - libs . The song then goes from good to great for about twenty seconds . "" It was blood on the dance floor , "" Jackson sings with masterful inflections , "" It was blood on the dance floor . "" The last two times he says it are particularly striking .

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00142MQ0K,-1,1,5,"Upon its release in 1981, this band's debut (and with this line-up, only) album quickly found itself dwarfed by the iconic track, ""Tell That Girl to Shut Up."" A decade later, when the song was turned into a hit by Transvision Vamp, the album from which it originally sprung (and the band that originally sprang it) receded yet another step from public renown. Things weren't helped by Virgin's reluctance to reissue the album on CD, nor the time-limited nature of this Wounded Bird's release. The hard-luck story leaves this great power-pop album once again difficult to find.

And rest assured, this is no one-hit wonder of an LP; Holly Beth Vincent's other songs were in the same league as ""Tell That Girl,"" and veteran producer Richard Gottehrer (Blondie, Go-Gos, Richard Hell & The Voidoids) deftly mated the verve of new wave and punk with the timeless sound of guitar-driven rock 'n' roll. Vincent's music is in a league with The Waitresses, Go-Go's and Pearl Harbor & The Explosions, but without the New Wave affectations that prematurely aged the competition's work. Think of this as a sharper-edged version of Bonnie Hayes & The Wild Combo's ""Good Clean Fun.""

Wounded Bird's reissue includes the original front and back covers and song lyrics for the album's original ten tracks. Four bonus cuts include the single edit of ""Miles Away"" and its B-side ""It's Only Me,"" along with two additional B-sides, the acidic ""Fanzine"" and the Ronnie Spector-styled ""Poster Boy."" MIA from this disc are the pre-LP 7"" version of ""Tell That Girl to Shut Up"" and its B-side ""Chapel of Love,"" which were disappointingly include on the CD reissued of Holly Beth Vincent's confusingly-titled follow-up solo LP, ""Holly and the Italians.""

Tagtgren then left and Akerfeldt returned for the EP ""Unblessing the Purity.""  Despite his return, these four songs don't sound much like the style heard on the first two releases.  All four tracks are more aggressive and brutal, faster, and less melodic, and they mostly shed the buzzsaw guitar sound that basically mimicked early Entombed and Dismember.

Being just an EP, each song can be called a highlight, but if you don't get a kick in the gut when that ridiculous groove in ""Mouth of Empty Praise"" breaks down, you're just being stubborn.

Because Pavarotti was admired as the Donizetti tenor par excellence, his two recordings, early and late, were obvious contenders. The Decca version has always been preferred, thanks to the freshness and charisma of Pavarotti's singing - he owned Una furtiva lagrima for decades - but as much as Sutherland is beloved, her Adina is girlish or light; she tries hard to bring the right comic tone, and even her notorious pronunciation is improved - but a second drawback for me is Bonynge's conducting, although he too tries hard to bring rhythmic life to his ordinarily slack style. Of course, the testimony of countless fans sees beyond these limitations - so be it.

The later DG L'elisir corrects the weak points in the earlier with alert, expert conducting by Levine and Battle's utterly charming Adina, her voice and characterization a delight. But Pavarotti! This recording dates from a series of live Met performances that began in 1989 (there's a met release in MP3 at various download sites), and the great tenor's voice had grown creaky  and threadbare - to me, it's painful to hear.  When the lead singer is unacceptable, so is the entire performance. Apparently this isn't the case for the enthusiastic reviewers here, but newcomers should be warned. I bought the set sight unseen and threw it away.","I was recently in search of the best L'Elisir d'amore that I could find .

Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection during your down load or the power goes out or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you paid for it, its all legal , and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection or the power goes out during your download, you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:","I love this song , and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes , you can keep downloading it to a new phone , or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download , all for free .

The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more.

There are songs I rate more highly, and I save four and five stars for those (only 8 songs in my entire collection rate 5 stars)

""Blue Morning, Blue Day"" is in my opinion, the second best track on Foreigner's ""Double Vision"" album. (second only to the title track and better than the more popular ""Hot Blooded"".)  Like much of Foreigner's early work, it is powered by memorable guitar riffs combined with strong pop hooks.  Lou Gramm and Mick Jones were songwriters, unlike many of their more album-oriented contemporaries.  This has always caused them some undeserved disrepute in a album-oriented rock/progressive art rock community.  In an era dominated by disco, Foreigner was one of the few rock acts that managed to make it onto the pop charts.

If you were a rock fan living in the late 1970s, this song definitely belongs in your collection.  If you are too young to have remembered that era, the two more recent bands I consider to be most like Foreigner are Matchbox Twenty and Toad the Wet Sprocket with maybe a little bit of similarity to the Foo Fighters.","My rating system is slightly different than Amazon 's .

For newcomer Jazmine Sulluvan, she has had a lot she had to prove not only because there have been very few dominant R&B acts, but she had to make her voice and style her own. Her latest single Lions, Tigers & Bears, the third single from her debut album Fearless brings in a very simple and elequent melody to her song, by the orchestrations in the background. The song isn't a bad song at all, but I honestly was expecting a little more from her voice. To be honest with you, the song is at least better than the recent ones Beyonce' has made like Halo and the lagging Diva. Hopefully, Jazmine can bring out something to perform next time that is more than just the big top.

Greedy record label owners and executives would conspire to cheat artists out of the royalties they were entitled to. Not surprisingly during this period many black artists were victimized by this practice at labels like Herman Lubinsky's Savoy records in New Jersey and Syd Nathan's King records in Cincinnati. In the late 1950's, Berry Gordy Jr. had been bouncing around the record business trying to find his niche. Although he had written a couple of hits for Jackie Wilson Gordy quickly discovered that songwriting was really not all that lucrative. Berry Gordy Jr. had much bigger ambitions. He looked at the musical landscape in America and determined that there was a boatload of money to be made marketing black music to affluent white teenagers. And so with several hundred dollars of borrowed money Gordy founded Motown Records in Detroit. The year was 1960. He dubbed his modest recording studios in an old house in the Detroit suburbs ""Hitsville, USA"". Now there was a ton of talent in Detroit in those days and Berry Gordy was very adroit at recognizing it and getting these artists to sign with Motown.

One of the first acts signed by Berry Gordy Jr. was an R&B group from Detroit that called themselves The Miracles. Led by the gifted song writer and dynamic vocalist Smokey Robinson The Miracles would become one of Motown's most consistent hit makers. In December 1960 Motown released ""Shop Around"" on it's Tamla label. The song was an immediate success spending 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #2. It was also the label's first #1 hit on the R&B chart. This is the original hit single you would remember from the radio.","It is a story that is all too familiar to those who have studied the early history of rock and roll .

Yes, some of Brit's new music is trashy (looks at 3) or trash (also looks at 3) but this one is tolerable.

Plus, watching the video enhances it. I love the bridge where she comes out looking like an upper class Marilyn Monroe.

To get down to the lyrics though, Britney's saying ""don't hate me"" while saying that all of the boys and girls want her in bed.

Obviously, we all know that by now but the video plays sometimes at MTV Hits so I thought I'd put my own review in for it.

Nothing compared to 'Baby One More Time' but it's still catchy with the la la la, la la la la la's and the ""Oh, say what you want about me"" parts.

This album doesn't just bring him together with collaborators such as Kanye West and T.I., though, but frequently buries his talented voice with a lot of slick production.

Foxx's scattershot approach could've made for a well-rounded album, but it feels more like a mixed bag than anything. Some tracks have a particular appeal to them while others seem more average than anything. ""Blame It"" became a major radio hit at the time of release, although as a pop rap single it's nothing special. Foxx's vocal abilities shine far better in songs such as the Boyz II Men style emotional ballads ""Rainman"" and ""Why"", the two of which alone make the album worth picking up.","Coming into fame as a comedic actor , Jamie Foxx has expanded his horizons to take on a variety of dramatic roles .

I find it strange though that there are like 3 different versions of this song. I find that the video version is the best and I'm guessing that that version which starts and ends with the ""Ho oh oh's"" will be the one on the album that I just *may* get if the samples sound inviting upon release.

A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B002VGYLTC,-1,1,4,"I discovered Hollywood Undead with their recent Day of the Dead release (and fell in love with the music so much that I immediately went and bought their other main albums), so Im only just now going back and trying to collect their more obscure releases.  That brings me to this cd/dvd combo, Desperate Measures.  When I checked this out, the first thing I noticed was the rather poor average review score.  I was baffled by the negative reviews for this product...and while I don't think they are merited, Im now starting to understand why they exist.  The band released this directly after Swan Songs when everyone was excited for a new albumand then they got this instead.  This release is really more of a bonus thing (the sort of thing that bands don't usually put out until they have a few main albums under their belt), so I can understand why some people were disappointed.  Nonetheless, Im going to judge it purely on its merits, which will be easier for me since Im not coming into it with the same expectations as someone several years ago.

Disc 1 is a cd full of bonus songs: a mixture of original songs, covers, and some live tracks.  The first two original songs (Dove and Grenade, and Tear It Up) are great (and are among my favorite HU tracks), but El Urgencia is just okay, in my opinion.  The next couple songs are coversand they aren't exactly great (ugh, well, at least the HU boys seemed to be having some fun with it).  The last songs on the cd are live tracks, and they are pretty good; in fact, I rather enjoyed the live atmosphere of them.  It kinda makes me wish theyd release a full live album someday.  Oh, something odd to note (if you buy this on amazon) is that the mp3s being sold are actually the clean versionand there doesnt appear to be an explicit version of the mp3s being sold at all (as of the time of posting this review).  I have not been able to figure out why, but keep that in mind if you are like me and trying to get everything in its original, unaltered form.

Disc 2 is actually a dvd.  It contains live concert footage, and a few little interviews/extra bits (which are amusing) sprinkled throughout.  I was excited about having high quality concert recordings, but it feels like it was edited by someone with ADD.  The camera angle jumps around constantly, about every second, and it's a bit jarring to watch.  Still, its nice to have concert footage that wasn't filmed on someone's cell phone (and I eventually got used to the editing), so Im pleased to have this inclusion.  If nothing else, like the live tracks from Disc 1, this makes me yearn for a live album release.

Overall, this cd/dvd bundle is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of quality.  The original songs and live tracks are worth owning, but the covers are questionable.  The concert dvd is nice to have for the more hardcore fans, but I could understand why the casual fan might want to skip it.  I feel this item is worth owning, for me at least, since I'm happy to have some concert footage not filmed on a potato.  Also, as far as I know, this is the only official release containing live concert footage, and thus, it is now an important part of the historical record.  About 200 years from now when historians are studying Hollywood Undead, theyll be very grateful for this scrap of high-quality recordings.  If you are an HU fan and are considering picking this up, just keep in mind what it actually contains, and make an informed decision as to whether its worth it to you or not.","I discovered Hollywood Undead with their recent Day of the Dead release ( and fell in love with the music so much that I immediately went and bought their other main albums ) , so I m only just now going back and trying to collect their more obscure releases .

AJK5WHV1GW941,B002Y5D7JK,1,-1,2,"I feel like this: If it weren't for the hot beat that Pharrell Williams give the Neptunes, there would be nothing at all special about them. In fact, they would be those brothers (yes, the Clipse are brothers) selling their albums out the trunk of their cars. I have never heard a song by them that just blew me away lyrically. Their hottest song to date, and one of my favorite rap songs to come out in recent years, is featured on this album: ""I'm Good."" I really, really like that song and it's positive nature. The beat and hook are fantastic and their energetic, optimistic vibes make the song even better. Simply put, it's a feel good rap song.

I lost count of how many times they mentioned their chains, how good their chains looked, and how bright their chains are. That's what stands out most after listening to these 13 tracks. I can say this matter-of-factly, though: The best tracks here are ""I'm Good"" and ""Champion."" The rest of the album is basically the same as far as quality is concerned. ""Never Will It Stop""and""There Was a Murder"" are the LP's biggest most glaring missteps. These tracks are just all around bad. ""Showing Out"" is an energetic track if nothing else. It has an OK beat and a decent offering by Yo Gotti.

I gave this album 2 1/2 stars and I wonder if I was being too generous in doing so. Perhaps.

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B003KSBQFC,1,-1,3,"Last May, I discovered Tenth Avenue North's debut and fell in love with their encouraging lyrics and fun music.  I've been looking forward to their follow up, The Light Meets The Dark.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't live up to their debut.

With this release, Tenth Avenue North has firmly established themselves on the pop side of the pop/rock genre.  In fact, I would be hard pressed to call any of the songs on this disc as rock.  There are some upbeat tracks, but for the most part, things pretty much seem to be on an even keel.  And that's my biggest problem with this disc.  The songs all start to sound the same after a while.

The lyrics on the first disc were moving and inspirational.  Here, they don't seem quite as deep, even bordering on cliche.  That's even worse to me since the lyrics are usually what make or break a release for me.

There are some good tracks here.  For example, disc opener ""Healing Begins"" is a nice mid-tempo number that reminds us that we won't truly heal until we accept God's forgiveness.  The verses talk about how all our trying won't do any good.  It starts out rather quiet and slow, but it picks up in both volumn and tempo when they reach the first chorus.  You can even hear some strings in the midst of the guitar and drums.  It really does give me a sense of freedom to remember that God knows my faults and has forgiven them.

They up the tempo with the next track, ""Strong Enough to Save.""  This track is on the rock side of the spectrum, especially on the chorus, with the loud guitar and strong drum beat.  It follows up the theme of the first track by reminding us that the God who controls nature is strong enough to save us.

""The Trust is Who You Are"" uses guitar to remind us that our belief in God needs to actually affect how we live.  Once again, we've got a guitar driven song that starts slow and builds to mid-tempo by the chorus.

Another favorite track is the disc closer.  ""Oh My Dear"" is a piano driven ballad.  The longest track here, it's absolutely beautiful to listen to.  The lyrics are pretty powerful as well.  They're written from the point of view of a person who goes over to help a friend who is going through a very rough patch, mainly due to sins of the past.  The forgiveness and love shown are convicting and heartwarming at the same time.

There are a couple songs that I find annoying because of the lyrics.  ""On and On"" is written from God's point of view as He reminds us of His love and sacrifice for us.  It's got a great piano and strings background that is pretty.  It's an upbeat ballad that could really deliver a powerful wallop.  Yet it leaves me feeling cold because the lyrics cover ground they've done better in other songs on their two discs.

Then there's ""House of Mirrors.""  And upbeat guitar track, it challenges us to break the mirror of our pasts and focus on what God has done for us.  Again, it's something they've covered before and the chorus is just so simple.  I've heard prediction it will be a concert favorite, and I think that will be the case because the simple chorus will be easy to shout out, but it doesn't make for a good song on a CD.

Frankly, this is one of those discs I think I will enjoy best in bits and pieces.  The songs are okay by themselves, so as they come through iTunes shuffle or some such program, I will enjoy hearing them.  But when I sit down and listen to them back to back, I find them lyrically and musically repetitive.

I really did want to like The Light Meets The Dark.  Tenth Avenue North has a gift for putting familiar truths into fresh, encouraging packages.  But the repetitive nature of the songs here makes it only average.","Last May , I discovered Tenth Avenue North 's debut and fell in love with their encouraging lyrics and fun music .

It was a mixtape joint that just blew up out of nowhere. That was like the summer anthem. Then you got Styles P on it. His verse was cut short for some reason. A lot of people felt like SP messed the song up. I disagree, his verse served it purpose.  And then you got two high energy song like ""MC Hammer ""and ""I'm Not a Star"". Yall know those songs will get hype whenever they come one. Yeah, Yeah he recycled the formula but thhe make it work!

""Freemason"" is another song I like on here. Ross basically trolled everybody with title Lol. Keep in mind this is everybody was running with the Jay Z Illuminati stuff. Me personally, I stay the away from all of that type off stuff. Back to the review, Ross did his thing, but Jay bodied this joint! His wordplay was crazy ""He without sin shall cast the first stone/ So yall look in the mirror, Double-check your appearance/ B****, I said I was amazing/ Not that Im a Mason/ Its amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in/ Lord forgive me, I never wouldve made it without sin"".

""Aston Martin Music"" is just one of those smooth radio joints. The song was so dope that Drake and Chrisette Michele had to make their versions of it! ""Tears of Joy"" is dope too. Cee-Lo did his thing on the hook. Its funny to hear Ross address the DJ Vlad situation."" A punch in the face get you 300K/ ask Vlad, Now he back to making minimum wage/ another victim of my criminal ways"". S***, the punch basically made Vladtv what it is today Lol. I bet Vlad don't regret getting punched one bit Lol. Also check out ""Super High featuring Ne-Yo"" and All The Money In The World featuring Raphael Saadiq, which is one of Ross' most personal joints.

Now lets into the bad. ""No. 1"" is wack! Everything about that song is wack. The lyrics are wack, the beat is wack and the hook is extremely wack. Am I the only one not feeling ""Live Fast, Die Young"" and ""Maybach Music III""? There weren't necessarily wack, but its something about those two songs that I cant really get into. I really cant put my finger but oh well...Overall I really enjoy this album and I think its safe to say that Teflon don is the most accessible Rick Ross album. I like how short the album is with just 11 tracks. Ross solidified himself in the game and this album took his popularity to a whole new level.

The folks at Liberty records were duly impressed and signed Lind to their World Pacific subsidiary. Among the tunes on that demo was ""Elusive Butterfly"" which became his first and only hit single peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1966. Much was expected of the follow-up record ""Truly Julie's Blues"" but it proved to be a major disappointment.

A3MGZWFEPAWQH4,B0042970G2,-1,1,5,"I was visiting Norway and I had purchased 4 of my favorite songs from the 1980s from Amazon Prime to listen to while I drove through the scenic roads of Northern Norway. Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war. German artists are so avant garde, like Mike Myer's Dieter.","and I had purchased 4 of my favorite songs from the 1980s from Amazon Prime to listen to while I drove through the scenic roads of Northern Norway .

A10S47RQ7EJHX6,B0044V37QK,1,-1,3,"I wanted to review one of Cubes last 3 records, and I decided to do this one even tho its my least favorite of them... but I feel its still a good Cube album and a great album when viewed against almost every other rap album that came out in 2010.

Of the 3, Raw Footage was definitely my favorite. It might even be in my top 5 Cube records. The lyrics were so on point, between it and Laugh Now Cry Later, it really seemed like hed found that spark he had when writing stories back between 90-93.

The music and beaten on I Am The West is probably my favorite since Lethal Injection because it was modern AND extremely unique, not just piggybacking off whatever sound is popular the minut he was writing the song... because if you write a song to be popular right then, chances are, in 6 months when its released, its gonna sound played out, let alone a year or two from now when you're looking for something to listen to... bottom line, musically, this is top 5 of his to me.

But now the problem... the reason this album only gets 3 stars is because this is the FIRST album hes put out in his (at the time) 24 year career containing ALL but one song (Hood Robbin) is essentially just emceeing the whole time... in other words, just bragging about himself and his skills/rep. Gone are the stories and descriptions of life in that way that only he does.

The whole reason Cube has stood above the rest is because hes always balanced the emceeing with the storytelling (with a strong majority on each album leaning towards the latter) because Cube was supposed to be ABOVE that petty garbage and all the rappers that based their entire careers off doing just that.

BOTTOM LINE, any Cube album is a great rap album because no one does it like him. The music is great, his lyrics are still great, its just the subject matter is weak, and unfortunately, subject matter makes up about 51% of the reason that an album great, and about 80% of the reason an album is worth listening to more than once.","I wanted to review one of Cubes last 3 records , and I decided to do this one even tho its my least favorite of them ... but I feel its still a good Cube album and a great album when viewed against almost every other rap album that came out in 2010 .

A2W9I628I6SE1U,B00471GFJ8,-1,1,4,"Numb by Abica was a hard album for me to review. The band sent me a promo CD and I've listened to it a number of times trying to figure out how a feel about it. It isn't a style I normally listen to, so I want to be as objective as possible. The music doesn't want you to be objective though. It wants you to feel and get deep down into it.

If forced to classify it, rap-rock with and industrial influence is as close as I can come. I think Tac and Hash are really trying to something unique here. In some instances they succeed wonderfully while in others they fall back in to cliche. Their rap interplay works well yet their singing voices leave a little to be desired. The big strength of Numb is its the lyrics. Very well thought out, you really get into their heads. These songs are brimming with emotion, though I'd say the predominant one is angst. The F-bomb gets dropped frequently, but it only serves to emphasize the more meaningful lyrics.

Musically I really dig most of Abica's songs. There are some very cool things going on in the songs and repeat listens are needed to pick out some of the more subtle stuff. I'd compare them to Trent Reznor, but their studio wizardry isn't quite to that level. Yet. It is well on it's way and very listenable. I'd just like to hear a bit more dynamic range and a slightly less ""processed"" sound. While Abica covers a wide range of topics and a few different styles, in the end it one song comes out sounding a bit like the next. But if you want strong beats, emotionally driven lyrics and catchy hooks, then maybe that isn't such a bad thing. It has grown on me and I am willing to bet that album #2 takes things to the next level.

Standouts for me:

I'm not familiar with the The International Childrens' Choir stuff is good as is most of the rest.","There is some really great music on here mixed in with some pretty terrible music .

AV648VU7JR5D5,B004DD1U40,-1,1,5,"I remember hearing More Than A Feeling on a Saturday morning in the Fall of 1976, in our station wagon as my Mom drove me to gymnastics class. I liked the song so much that it caused me to make my first and worst mail order record purchase. The TV had advertised a record called Muskrat Love, which had this song plus many other popular songs of the time, like Rubberband Man, Nadia's Theme, Theme from Airport '76, Car Wash, Boogie Fever, Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word. Some real tepid stuff. Unfortunately, what I failed to understand about Muskrat Love from the commercial, was that these songs were not the original artist recordings. They were covers that sounded very close to the originals but not quite. I think my Mom tried to explain this to me before she helped me send $3.99 to some PO box in Michigan, but I probably didn't understand. After waiting 4-6 weeks for delivery, which is a lifetime to a nine year old, the album arrived and I eagerly placed it on the turntable. Right away, I knew something was amiss. More Than A Feeling sounded weird. I still listened to the album, but soon soured on it and eventually tossed it in the creek across from our house. I was disappointed, flabbergasted. How could someone be allowed to sell crap like this? Apparently, Canadians were spared this monstrosity.

I finally heard the actual Boston album years later, I heard the real More Than A Feeling. And Peace of Mind. And Foreplay/Long Time. As my brother would say, may your birthday be as cool as side one of Boston's first album. It is a great side. Side Two is good also, but I never cared for Something About You and Let Me Take You Home Tonight (Mama now it's all right). By the way, when did guys start referring to women as 'mama', and when did it end? Was it just a hippie thing?

Later on in life, I heard Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, and noticed that the chord structure was very similar to More Than A Feeling, albeit an angrier angst-ridden 90s yin to Boston's happy 70s yang. The guitar solo in More Than A Feeling is like taking a dose of serotonin. It sends joy and pleasure right into your bloodstream.","I remember hearing More Than A Feeling on a Saturday morning in the Fall of 1976 , in our station wagon as my Mom drove me to gymnastics class .

However, that doesn't mean this is a bad album by any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that this is Gorillaz most ambitious album to date, just for the simple fact that the album's creation was limited at the time of its release. This album was completely composed by Apple iPad music apps. The amount of depth and creativity Damon was able to produce and record off of a simple iPad is truly astounding to me, because despite the album not breaking any new ground sonically, the music on this project is still of high quality. I personally can enjoy this album on its own merit. But when compared to the previous 3 Gorillaz project, it falls short. Because of Damon's choice of using only music apps, the albums sound is not as rich or organic as past albums are. This album has a much more electronic feel than the previous 3 albums and it does suffer for it. The song-writing does not grab your attention as much and the songs aren't nearly as catchy. Its an average project for Gorillaz, but far more creative than most artists can drum up.

If it was, surely a club song like 'Papi', 'Invading My Mind', or 'Hypnotico' from Jennifer's 'Love?' album would have been chosen to follow the success. Instead, this summery single is just pleasant without ever catching fire, immediately inferior but less polarizing than the aforementioned songs.

Lil Wayne's feature surely had much to do with this choice of a single, though many flop singles in the past have shown that an artist doesn't necessarily equate to success. This song will likely crack the Top 40 or 30 on Billboard, but it's a shame if this stops the 'Love?' campaign. Jennifer has recorded some spectacular pop songs for the album, this being simply middle of the pack.

Bottom line: If you like what you hear in the clip, you'll surely enjoy the song, since there's not much else to it. However, don't miss out on the phenomenal non-singles (thus far) that I've mentioned above.

This set achieves that, in spades.
You know what a great orchestra performing a beautiful piece of music sounds like, yes? This set of Sibelius doesn't, to me, sound like that at all. No, it's more like sound rising up like mist from the ground and swirls around you as you walk through it. As if the music just appears and unfolds of its own volition, with no human involvement.
Lemminkainen, for example: one reviewer feels Lemminkainen in Tuolena is too slow, while another says the suite pales in comparison with the old Ormandy recording. I grew up with the Ormandy and I love it: it's an amazing, beautiful performance, a fitting valedictory to a long and illustrious career. Yet it still sounds like a performance, a wonderful orchestra playing a wonderful piece of music, whereas this Lemminkainen is like a dream unfolding. Kind of hard to explain the difference, I know.
The symphonies share this same organic feel.","I 've always felt that Sibelius ' music , like Mahler 's , is less like music than it 's like nature coming alive , with each instrument one voice joining with others to tell a story , Sibelius even more so than Mahler , though , more fundamental , more primitive .

Whatever it is, this unexpected sound is enough to capture a listener's interest.  Clearly Dispatch isn't a band that's afraid to think outside the box.

The lyrics speak enigmatically of the American immigrant experience: disillusionment, hardship, homesickness, and the struggle to belong.

Esperanza Spalding's cover of Billie Holiday's ""I'll Look Around"" gets it exactly right.  Compared to Holiday's version, which was filled with languorous yearning, Spalding's is a little smoother and more upbeat, bringing an almost whimsical note to this song of lost love.  The background is easy-listening jazz - it's the sort of thing you might expect to hear playing softly in a classy restaurant.  Spalding's voice is just as appealing, silky and fluidly sensuous.  This is an old-fashioned song with a timeless sound, and Spalding has made it her own for a modern audience.

I like the song well enough, but it isn't something I'd play every day. The rest of 'Osaka Romones' sounds much the same, so if you like enjoy Shonen Knife's take on ""Rock N Roll High School"" and J-Pop in general, then you might want to add it to your Cloud Player and jam out with the three girls from Osaka.

This is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering ""Is this working right?"" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks.","This is one where I 'm rating it pretty much based on value .

Because of the strength of his reactions to things, sometimes I find myself needing to find middle ground no matter how much I admire and respect the therapists who work with him and their recommendations.  Many OT clinics like to do The Listening Program with sensory processing disorder or Autistic kiddos, and our little man does *not* do headphones.  We've been working on it, working on it, working on it...and we have brief periods of time where he will tolerate it, and most of the time he either rips them off his head or gets agitated at the mere sight.  So in looking at the studies on The Listening Program and AIT therapy in general, some of the information indicates that listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits.  So I purchased a whole bunch of these because the price point was great and they were digital and I could access them from multiple devices.  This is the other collection my son will listen to for a longer period of time then the others.  He prefers the Mozart one, but he'll get through more of this one before requesting it be turned off then he will the remainder of them.","This was another "" Rise of the Masters "" purchase I made to support some occupational therapy goals for sensory integration for our son shortly after he was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder .

But for her latest single from her sophmore album, Echo, I Got You, she tries to bring in more of a pop-driven melody than being a sultry and soulful torch singer as a departure from her earlier songs like Bleeding Love and Happy. Unfortunately, the song isn't really as strong for Leona as she has shown with her earlier tracks. While it honestly isn't her best song, it still has a nice rhythm. But, if you really want to download a great Leona song, stick with Better In Time instead. Hopefully, for her next single from Echo, Leona can bring out something a bit more driven and vibrant.

""Insanity Beach"" is Sleeze Beez's third and final album. With the release of ""Insanity Beach"", Sleeze Beez took a more harder rocking approach than with their previous releases. Gone is the Def Leppard sound alikes, and in it's place is a more modern hard rock sound. Now don't get me wrong, this album still has that Sleeze Beez sound, it just doesn't have that over-the-top catchiness that ""Screwed, Blued & Tattoed"" and ""Powertool"" had. The album does contain some filler, but the good far outweighed the bad. My favorite tracks from the album are ""Tell It To The Judge"", ""The Long Goodbye"", ""Save Myself"", ""Scream"" and ""Gun Culture"".

The worst thing about this album is, it's almost non-existent for some reason. I know it was released only in Japan, but come on, where in the world is Rock Candy or Wounded Bird???

The second is that the track entitled ""little hitlers"" seems to be a word-for-word copy of an earlier Louis C.K skit.

Aside from those two things - five stars. His skit on old school rap is especially hilarious.","Donald Glover A.K.A "" Childish Gambino "" is talent in comedy and music .

AMMU9VZZ9OSII,B00931JMWE,-1,1,5,"Look, it's a great ZZ top song. I feel weird rating a song anyway. Usually people know what they are buying at least through a sample but this song is very good for those of us that have listened to ZZ Top since the 70's and HATE what the 80's and 90's did with them.

The song is about smoking meth from my best understanding, which I think is a stupid thing to do. You have to be an idiot to do use meth. But there are many historical songs about drug use that are not promoting the behavior, and I suspect this is one of those songs...just making an example of the behavior, not promoting it. These guys are so old, a hit of meth would kill any one of them, so I think they know that.

You have to get in to the mental weeds to understand all that, especially since the lyrics are about as seemingly random as can be and make virtually no sense...pretty much like the words of a meth head, which I think is the point of the song.

Do not use illegal drugs especially idiotic drugs like meth. It will turn you in to an idiot if you actually survive.

When Whitney passed on in 2012, right before Sparkle was released to the public, it felt like the world lost its voice.

The newer version of I Look To You didn't even ignite with R. Kelly, whom wrote the song for Whitney over a decade earlier, but it didn't get to Whitney, until she decided to get back in the music industry, after she was mocked by the populace as the ""Crack Is Whack"" girl. When the song originally came out in 2009 from Whitney alone for her final album, it was beautiful and sincere at the soul, because the world was mourning the death of Michael Jackson, and it was truly beautiful beyond words. But posthumously with R. Kelly, it sincerely was no where near the ""Unforgettable"" intimacy in posthumous duets. It isn't a bad download for new Whitney fans and die hard fans of ""The Voice.""

AAOL7BE0EDGRB,B00BPB8JBU,-1,1,5,"""Whistle"" is a song by American rapper Flo Rida from his fourth album Wild Ones (2012). It was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from the album. ""Whistle"" was written by Flo Rida, David Glass, Marcus Killian, Justin Franks, Breyan Isaac and Antonio Mobley while production was handled by DJ Frank E and Glass. It is a song about oral sex.
""Whistle"" is a pop-rap song characterized by a whistling melody. Upon its release, the song received mostly mixed reviews from music critics. They generally praised its pop sound, noting that it had the potential of becoming another hit with its ""catchy"" hook. However, several critics gave a negative review for the lyrics, interpreted as a thinly veiled euphemism for oral sex, calling it ""the least subtle song ever"". The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Flo Rida's third number one hit and his first since 2009's ""Right Round"".[2] ""Whistle"" was a commercial success, topping the charts in some countries, including Australia, Israel and Sweden, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in others, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.
An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Marc Klasfeld, was released on May 24, 2012. It was filmed in Acapulco, Mexico and makes use of split screen at various points. It mostly shows shots of Flo Rida and several girls on a beach. Upon its release, it received positive to mixed reviews from critics, who noted that it was a perfect accompaniment for the song. Flo Rida also promoted the song by performing it during the finale of the talent show, The Voice. This song is the second track on Now 44. The cover image of the single also drew praise for its subtlety and originality.",""" Whistle "" is a song by American rapper Flo Rida from his fourth album Wild Ones ( 2012 ) .

Ciara, is an artist that is hugely talented. But is living NOT IN HER ERA. She is always going to be in the shadow of AAliyah. And That's OK.  Moreover, she is dwarfed by Beyonce.  So Ciara will never get the credit or stardom she could very well earn.

The song, is catchy, and has a snappy back beat. Nicki Minaj is a bit too crass, for my taste. But  well, that's what  in for 2010's.

Nice song, and better to buy the single, the entire album, is not a good buy.","This is a cute song to add to a workout playlist . Ciara , is an artist that is hugely talented .

A37VF0LNXK0IA6,B00DY9A8NI,1,-1,3,"This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky, heavy on works for orchestra. The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.
  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE","This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky , heavy on works for orchestra .

Her song Woman 's World , from her 20123 album Closer To The Truth is n't a bad song , but honestly not as big as when she came back on top in the 90 's with songs like Strong Enough and Believe . It is alright , but honestly not a strong song that dominates , but it still is classic Cher alone . If you are a die hard fan of Cher 's than you 'll download this song , but otherwise go back to songs like Song For The Lonely to make it more worth the effort ."

AM4X3TREMZTQZ,B00F6CM68Q,-1,1,4,"""Deficit"" is a very dark and moody instrumental song.  It is very atmospheric, and is something that I would expect to hear playing in the background of a movie about ghosts, as the tension is building towards the climax.  The second half of the song is a bit more upbeat, with a quicker tempo and more metallic highlights, but it would still be quite at home in a ghost movie.  It seems to drag on a bit longer than what seemed realistic for a song of this type, since the tension cannot last forever.  The weakest part of the song played out in the last 10 seconds or so, with seemingly otherworldly transmissions that didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the song.  But it was offered as part of a free promotional download, and for that, I'll round the rating up to four stars.",""" Deficit "" is a very dark and moody instrumental song .

Never mind the fact that her self titled 3rd LP ""Debby Boone"" is, in my opinion, a pop vocal classic (""I'd Rather Be Alone"" is a classic in and of itself, but her version of ""Choosey Beggar"" is an alltime favorite of mine!) or that her country remakes showed a talent bigger than her one-hit-wonder status, Debby was the squeaky-clean religious daughter of Pat Boone and nothing was going to change that.  How sad she records so little and how sad we miss out on hearing more of those amazing vocals on a variety of genres.  We turned our backs, basically stating that nobody wanted to hear from her again.  Oh, how wrong we were.

But, lucky for us who have been paying attention, as Debby recorded music last year which is both fun, flashy and yeah, pretty darn fantastic.

Uptempo tunes show Debby's fun side, which (I think) few people think she has.  The most fun for me is ""Get Me To The Church On Time"", ""Sway"" and a jazzy/swinging version of ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"".  But once again it's Debby's voice on ballads such as ""Cry Me A River"" and ""More Than You Know"" that sets my heart a-flutter.  She's sounds as crystal clear and darn near perfect on these songs as she did 37 years ago, showing True talent endures through the ages.  Simply put: BEAUTIFUL!!

(The only slight hic-cup for me is a version of ""Mack The Knife"", which in my opinion truly suits a males voice a bit better than a females.  So, it's more of a song choice than an issue with the vocal.  This song, however, no way effects the CD as a whole or it's well deserved 5 star rating.)

While the foggy production keeps any one of Temples 60s/90s retro mix from standing out, a heavy Revolver-period Beatles influence is evident, as the opener Shelter Song echoes Tomorrow Never Knows, right down to the boxy snare.  However, Temples is not a Dukes of Stratosphear, wherein every tie-dyed reference is a tongue-in-cheek overstatement.

It's here

It is everywhere

I see all the people buying it

I want to scream, cry, rave, warn them

But it wouldn't help.

May 16
All of them
Walking down the street
Calm and collected
Yet doomed from the start
Don't they know?

I want to ask them, ask them with their phony faces and plastic smiles, ask them first when they buy and then when they rot

Was it worth it

Was the beauty worth it

I sent a letter

It won't be enough

It will never be enough

Considered the leading doom metal band all across the globe, Electric Wizard carefully crafted another reminder that they have no intention whatsoever of relinquishing their throne.  My first Electric Wizard album was ""Black Masses,"" which I love for its heavy Black Sabbath influences (and who happen to be one of my all-time favorite bands), but ""Time to Die"" is another beast in itself.  Other reviewers have compared it to ""Dopethrone,"" which I have not yet heard, but this album is MUCH heavier than ""Black Masses.""

In fact, the album is so heavy that the guitar, bass, and drums can be a little overwhelming.  The lyrics on several songs are practically indecipherable and wind up sounding like witches chanting (in a good way).  With the exception of ""Destroy Those Who Love God,"" ""SadioWitch,"" and ""Saturn Dethroned,"" every song on this album is either close to or over 10 minutes in length, which is enough to loosen even the sturdiest of brains.  And of course the band lays on the Satanic schtick, adding audio clips involving cult killings and the like throughout the album.

""I Am Nothing,"" ""We Love the Dead,"" ""SadioWitch,"" and ""Lucifer's Slaves"" are my personal favorite tracks, but you can't treat this the same way you would another album.  Listening to Electric Wizard is, in and of itself, a completely different experience than just simply listening to your average album.  Sometimes it requires dimming the lights, lighting some candles, burning some insence...you get the idea.  Now enjoy!","If you 're looking to pummel your senses , then this is the album for you .

Joell Ortiz is obviously in a healthy place in life, considering the fact that he is performing this self examination with a grateful attitude.

In other words, the bulk of the album is made up of smart material. Ortiz has invited some rappers and some singers to appear on House Slippers and has even brought his Slaughterhouse group mates (Royce Da 5'9'', Joe Budden, and Crooked I) into the studio for ""Brothers Keeper"" to show that besides being a rap quartet, they are also a family. The production is handled mainly by The Heatmakerz and gives the album a sparkling yet rugged sound.

The Beauty Of Independence is a great showing of solidarity from G-Unit, considering the fact that all four original members are on the EP. When nature dictates that groups tend to disband over time, this complete reunification is a feat in and of itself. The gang are essentially back to their old antics, and this consistency proves to be a fitting formula. The opener, ""Watch Me,"" brings listeners up to speed and establishes the current level of musicality with which the group is comfortable and proficient. It is gangsta through and through, and as an introduction to G-Unit in 2014, it screams to audiences everywhere, ""Here they are!"" The follow up track, ""I Don't F--- With You,"" is more real gangsterism over concert style cornets, giving way to ""Digital Scale,"" a track almost exclusively dedicated to the subject of drug dealing, a topic which is touched on again in ""The Plug."" Nowhere is this G-Unit crew more eloquent, however, than on ""Changes,"" where they discuss reversals of fortune and how nothing ever really remains the same over time. Overall the guys do a good job of being lyrical on a competitive level, and some nice, new territory is explored production-wise throughout.

The Michigan-bred beat maker Brown has constructed a great set of productions that are just as complex and interesting as Ras Kass' lyrics are. As the title suggests, Blasphemy starts with Ras Kass making critical arguments against popular religions, especially Christianity, in ""How To Kill God."" He will continue in this questioning fashion for other tracks, like ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" where he discusses various historical violations of The Golden Rule. Although proclaiming himself a fallen angel, he boasts wisdom all over Blasphemy by preaching clean living (""Please Don't Let Me""), racial equality (""Strawberry"") and moral rules (""48 Laws Pt. 1""). As always though, Ras Kass still finds time to brag, strut and celebrate his gifts. His lyrical game is still sharp after all these years and so is his storytelling, as evidenced by ""Too Much Of A Good Thing"" and ""Francine,"" two songs about demons coming back to haunt mischievous women. Making the perfect beats to match the high caliber lyricism of Kass is no easy task. That's why Apollo Brown has combined eclectic samples, elegant instruments and East Coast style drum beats for a super nice audio event that can claim bits of orchestra, soul and r&b music within its mix.

Blasphemy contains three power-packed posse cuts, but with all the mighty guest verses on the album, they never seem to outshine Kass and his enormous lyrical prominence. Apollo Brown and Ras Kass are both respectful of the hip hop culture and the rap game, even if Kass is picking on industry giants one moment (""Humble Pi"") and saluting deceased legends the next (""Bon Voyage""). They make for a very compelling duo on the risky yet entertaining Blasphemy.","The Watts , LA - raised , lyrical virtuoso Ras Kass , now over 18 years strong in the game , has banded with underground , boom - bap style producer Apollo Brown ( Mello Music Group ) for the Blasphemy LP .

To brighten up these rosy realities for Double-M.G., label mate Stalley (Kyle Myricks) has just released his debut solo LP, Ohio, which is of course named after his home state. True to his roots, musical influences and the MMG code, Stalley has filled Ohio with enough hustlin', stuntin' and Midwestern hoo- ridin' so that fans can easily recognize his brand and affiliations. His fluid flow is sufficiently varied in style and vocabulary, and the different inflections of his tone of voice give his rapping an animated, non-mechanized feel. Stalley discusses his hard times coming up in life but also mellows out by indulging in the club scene, lady loves, fashion and cars, particularly the sporty, high-performance type. Speaking of cars, Stalley has created an intriguing interpolation/remake of Eazy-E's ""Boyz-N-The- Hood"" single, called ""Jackin' Chevys,"" about getting it on in hot, stolen cars. Ohio is a relatively singular affair for Stalley except for guest appearances by Nipsey Hussle, Rick Ross, August Alsina, Ty Dolla Sign and Rashad, who produced much of the album's music. As a pleasant surprise, Stalley has also brought legends De La Soul out of retirement to spit a few bits of wisdom for listeners on ""Navajo Rugs."" The productions contain some real instruments and original beat loops but several sound like recreations of trap/drill standards, not necessarily a bad thing considering the album as a whole has a very unique, distinct sound beneath the lyrics. The most important fact to note about Ohio is that Stalley has not fully fallen prey to commercial, music market appetites. Instead, he has mixed up his content and style with new concepts and fresh rhymes and music, making for a solid enough solo debut.","With the minor feud between Meek Mill and Wale rumored to be cooled down and new albums slated to be released in the near future from each of Rick Ross and the two aforementioned rappers , things are currently looking up or Maybach Music Group ( MMG ) .

A viable Southern hustling emcee of yesteryear, Paul Wall has made contributions to hip-hop through his records with the Swishahouse label and most recently with Paul Wall Music.

Never one to blow minds with advanced lyricism, Paul Wall has historically received regards for his raps of steady rhyming, and this same modus operandi is applied faithfully by Wall in Po-Up. He is still that same on-the-grind hustler with expensive tastes, focused on staying on his toes and having fun in between time. Worthy of notable mention are the tracks ""No Favors,"" a lesson in self-reliance, and ""Codeine Heartbreak,"" where Wall discusses his love/hate relationship with extra strength, prescription cough syrup. The guest line-up is predictable, offering up verses of Dirty South flavor, especially from Screwed Up Click rapper Z-Ro, who appears twice on the album. The electronic trap beats match all of Wall's objectives and while formulaic, they are just original enough to be tolerable.

Ironically, 50 hardly even appears on this The Beast Is G-Unit EP, aside from one: a wooing autotune bit opening the introductory ""Ballin,"" and two: the chorus of ""Boy Boy."" G-Unit's six year hiatus proved their best marketing tool for The Beauty Of Independence, which overall performed well. The guys were gallantly back on their gangsta schtick with some renewed and newfound spirit. The same is True for The Beast Is G-Unit, except this one suffers the fate of coming after Beauty.

In relation to before, the repetition in content includes the gangsterism, pimping, worship of big boy toys, and various other infractions of the law that the five-piece crew commit on this round's excursion. The mostly-complete gang of Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Kidd Kidd (50 Cent barely contributes) are satisfactorily lyrical for the most part, relegating their gifts to street life matters and proving to fans that they can still band-up after all these years. Notwithstanding that fact, Lloyd Banks, out of all the members, gives the EP the brightest signs of lyrical virtuosity, throwing in different rhythms and tempos and basically just showing the most free-spirited character of any in the bunch.

Aside from needing to be there and appealing to a new class of hip hop listeners, the beats walk a thin line between relevancy and redundancy, harnessing the nervous, temporal energy of drill- ticks and a few sounds from G-Unit's past, i.e., organ, wavering electric guitar and ringing piano. Although The Beast Is G-Unit is lyrically on par with anything from the group's past, it still remains skimpy on intelligent, advanced art, making the biggest impact by being stunning, shocking and thrilling as opposed to the aesthetic of being fascinating and intriguing from an intellectual standpoint.","50 Cent 's flagship team , G - Unit , is back after releasing 2014 's The Beauty Of Independence EP , the group 's first release since 2008 's Terminate On Sight LP .

AVV5JGLBZERCM,B00SJMQR2G,1,-1,3,"Alternative, conscious hip hop can be approached from many angles, which is why it's glaring when styles are reused without expounding on, extrapolating from or offering solutions to the source issues. In the Words Paint Pictures EP, Rapper Big Pooh (of Durham, North Carolina trio Little Brother fame) and Detroit producer Apollo Brown have come together with the spirit of Mello Music Group to once again describe what they feel are the most exigent problems in society now, namely police-on-black violence, federal government wrongdoing and the prison industrial complex as a second ghetto for blacks.

All of those moving parts, which blossom from Pooh's golden rapping voice box, play out to the backdrop of Brown's sample-based soul beats, which are nice as always but show little innovative growth and bring to life few new ideas or techniques, just nice new samples. Give him some time though. Brown's a good beat maker.

Words Paint Pictures is regrettably a little one dimensional, and Big Pooh makes hay of a racially beleaguered America, even if his critique on the public sector with Ras Kass is excellent. After ""Promise Land,"" the EP settles into fresh rhymes and cold chillin'. There are nine songs total, but the last two are remixes leaving seven ""originals."" Other guests besides Ras Kass include Steve Roxx, Eric ""Blakk Soul"" Keith, Marv Won, L'Orange and an awesomely lyrical triplet of Jalen Santoy, Novej and Lute in ""Kings.""

It would have been nice to hear Big Pooh suggest curative measures of conduct to combat the flaws of our current social order and system, but his questioning mentality and healthy skepticism are appreciated nonetheless. Likewise, Apollo Brown simply rolls out his music loops rarely with a surprise moment in the fold, but even if it is within a familiar comfort zone that he produces, the beats still possess harmonious, throwback beauty.","Alternative , conscious hip hop can be approached from many angles , which is why it 's glaring when styles are reused without expounding on , extrapolating from or offering solutions to the source issues .

My children enjoy listening to this when we are having some quiet play time as well . My son asked if he could listen to this song before bed too . I think he is able to realize that it is very relaxing and may also help him get to sleep as well . I would recommend this to someone who likes to listen to music when they go to sleep ."

The son of an African American mother and a Sudanese father, a young Oddisee (real name Amir Mohamed) would split his residency between Sudan and the U.S., witnessing the juxtaposition of the two civilizations firsthand as a small boy. Later in life, with the world at his fingertips, he couldn't ignore his hip hop calling with which producing, or making beats, became his forte. With the help of the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff, the Low Budget Crew, Diamond District and many others, Oddisee gained national recognition and is now thriving to the nth degree with Mello Music.

Making beautiful music with Mello Music Group since 2008, Oddisee is still very much hungry as his ambition shines through in The Good Fight for 2015. A real hip hop wiseman, Oddisee is overflowing with his feelings on unconditional love, relationship ills and the losses in life. Streams and streams of poignant, pensive rhymes from this natural master of flow testify to an unflinching tortured soul who doesn't hold himself back in the least bit. Oddisee ebbs and flows through his music like the push and pull of everyday life. ""Want Something Done"" explains the blues and joys of being an underground artist, and ""Contradiction's Maze"" documents the tug of war between right and wrong. Like his lyrical heft, Oddisee's beats keenly display the rich delectability his musical style is known for. Elegant, organic music and samples make for soulful, mellow boom bap orchestrated by Oddisee's gentle, talented hand. The Good Fight is another impressive Oddisee album, progressive and very consistent for this intellectual man. It definitely helps Oddisee's evolution as an artist, though not by leaps and bounds.","Before producer / rapper Oddisee set his sights on blowing up Brooklyn and Arizona 's Mello Music Group , he set Washington DC on fire , and before he took on our nation 's capital , he was sizzling in his affluent Prince George 's County , Maryland home base , all the time repping his "" P.G.

Most of these recordings are better than that, but some are lacking.  The performances are a bit more schmaltzy and slower in tempo than the more recent recordings of Rachmaninoff I've heard.

Their self titled Czarface debut became an instant underground smash in 2013 and revealed that the Rebel INS plus 7L & Eso mix very well with each other.

Their second official release, Every Hero Needs A Villain, is almost a mirror-image of their first, save for a new set of guests (Method Man, Large Professor, Juju of The Beatnuts, GZA, MF Doom, Meyhem Lauren, R.A. the Rugged Man) and all- original rhyme verses in each track of course. In any case, EHNAV is a strong album sustained by epic, raw lyrics and more of 7L and Spada4's industrial and grunge rock-inspired alternative beats. Ambitious on both its vocal and instrumental fronts, the album's main concerns are to appall (with coarse, sometimes violent imagery), impress (with dizzying, nonstop rhyme schemes) and exhilarate (with artsy, indie, experimental production), and by all intensive purposes, they've more or less reached their goal.

Despite having few social implications or a variety of concepts (it truly has only one), EHNAV flourishes by being a rich greenhouse of thriving hip hop excitement, a wild comicbook-like rap album. The most important meaning behind this project however is its continuation of healthy collaboration between two rap acts from substantially different backgrounds, Inspectah Deck from the rough and tumble Staten Island, New York and producer/emcee team 7L & Esoteric from the more congenial backdrops of Boston, Massachusetts. Both have overlooked some of their cultural disparities to commune on their shared love for hip-hop.","In much the same way that Run The Jewels with El - P and Killer Mike joined two pretty humongous , previously unassociated rap camps for a detour into cruel punk rap songs , Czarface ( Wu - Tang Clan 's Inspectah Deck with Boston 's 7L & Esoteric ) are putting their unique spin on the genre with a personality and mike - disposition nearly identical to RTJ 's .

But then someone added a few tracks from Audiomachine's album to a youtube playlist and I found myself looping the same songs over again. War of Faith, Sura, Being Alive, just to name a few. I wanted to know more of who the artist was that composed these songs and lo and behold it was from Audiomachine's Magnus album which is absolutely stupendous.

Take for instance War of Faith. The song starts with a slow, almost imperceptible build where you're wondering if you set the audio levels correctly on your device. Then you hear the pianos, the strings, a flourish of cymbals, and all of sudden you're hit with powerful vocals. I was left closing my eyes, bobbing my head, listening to this track over and over until I had to force myself to move onto another song.

So when I saw that there were 23 tracks left in the playlist, I couldn't help but grin. Magnus is an excellent compilation of orchestral scores and should be a MUST HAVE to any fans of epic, instrumental music.","As someone who is a die hard fan of Two Steps from Hell and E.S.

AFSWTC59OW4O7,B01AB9Q2RE,1,-1,3,"The cd single has five tracks: Say it to me (new radio mix) which is just a shorter version of the album track with a bit faster beat/pace. Tracks 2 and 3 A Cloud in a Box and the Dead Can Dance are typical b-side tracks with the first being the better one by far. Finally track 4 is the Stuart Price  remix. The TRUE GEM in the cd version is the inclusion of an ultra rare (previous only available on a limited vinyl run) Inner Sanctum Carl Craig C2 Juiced remix that is made for the clubs and is a pure delight.

The three digital mixes should have been available on the cd version. The Offer Nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the versions out there. It is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of It's a Sin or Can You Forgive Her - the glory days when all mixes appeared either in vinyl or then cd /cassette forms.
A Cloud in a Box is a good b-side track with a techno dub feel a la 80s flavour. Say It To Me Stuart Price version is nearly identical to the album version but has been slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there. It is the second-best version of all the remixes.",The cd single has five tracks : Say it to me ( new radio mix ) which is just a shorter version of the album track with a bit faster beat / pace . Tracks 2 and 3 A Cloud in a Box and the Dead Can Dance are typical b - side tracks with the first being the better one by far . Finally track 4 is the Stuart Price   remix . The TRUE GEM in the cd version is the inclusion of an ultra rare ( previous only available on a limited vinyl run ) Inner Sanctum Carl Craig C2 Juiced remix that is made for the clubs and is a pure delight . The three digital mixes should have been available on the cd version . The Offer Nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the versions out there . It is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of It 's a Sin or Can You Forgive Her - the glory days when all mixes appeared either in vinyl or then cd /cassette forms . A Cloud in a Box is a good b - side track with a techno dub feel a la 80s flavour . Say It To Me Stuart Price version is nearly identical to the album version but has been slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there . It is the second - best version of all the remixes .

AVV5JGLBZERCM,B01BQ7NRV4,1,-1,3,"Why does Joell Ortiz have to make it so hard for us to wait for a new Slaughterhouse album? Putting out nice albums like his latest, That's Hip Hop, makes it even harder. You can tell how great he would sound in the group again because his rhyme game is so tight here, and after all, he's obviously been working on it continuously. The Brooklyn backpack bomber comes off of 2014's House Slippers and 2015's Human with Illmind for this very retro, throwback-themed project, and it's got a lot of hardcore rap cats on it just doing their thing, with production that is True-to-the-pit boom bap. That's Hip Hop was released Tuesday, March 15 on the record label of the same name.

The album was clearly designed with the pure rap/rhyme addicts in mind. Like a typical Joell Ortiz set, it is not loaded with messages and really only aims towards a social end when Jo describes his urban N.Y.C. milieu and community across a handful of songs, when he tells a woman's sob story for her in ""Precious"" and when he tells some of his own war stories of hard times in ""Trouble."" Everything else is pretty much a lyrics-fest. Experienced, respected guys like Kool G Rap, Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P. start that good golden-era fire, and some neo-shine is cast by new jewels like Raven Felix, Chris Rivers and Token, the last of whom has a very double-edged verse in ""Kill at Will"" - it's very fast, very nimble and very impressive delivery-wise, but as insane rap mouthpieces tend to do, the search for meaning and message gets lost in his ravishing rapacious technique.

Joell's well tuned machine-mouth works just fine here, but those offensive, shockingly controversial bits and pieces that all hip-hop heads know, love and look for are few in That's Hip Hop. Without making striking statements that are anti-status quo or anti-establishment, like he should, he depends on his striking yet easy obscenities and profanities to turn heads. And it was just like this on his last two albums as well. Many of us look to talented and skilled emcees like Joell to spread awareness about the world's problems, but sadly there's too little of that in the correct form here. Technically, Joell Ortiz is a beast and so are his features, and the producers have properly and impressively fashioned their beats into that vintage '90s style of hip-hop production, but if you're looking for new enlightening messages, you may not want to spend a lot of time on this disc.","Why does Joell Ortiz have to make it so hard for us to wait for a new Slaughterhouse album ?

Don't get me wrong, I like them, have all of their albums, but it's just not the same anymore. They're not fresh anymore. I hardly pay attention now, and that's something I used to do with ""Lincoln"", ""Flood"" and ""Apollo 18"". Heck, even ""Mink Car"". And, sure, ""Nanobots"" was pretty good, a strong turn around, but overall, since 2001's ""Mink Car"", the guys have felt stale. They need something new. You know, Franz Ferdinand collaborated with Sparks last year to great effect. It was completely unexpected, and strangely, it worked very well. Perhaps that's what TMBG need. To collaborate with an unusual artist that we fans would never suspect. You know it would be interesting. More interesting than ""Phone Power"".

""Phone Power"" is yet another collection of oddballs, this time from dial-a-song, but it just falls flat. It's just okay, nothing more. I used to get excited about TMBG. I used to want to memorize their quirky lyrics, but now, not so much. They need a kick in the pants. Stop doing children's music, you've diluted your effectiveness. Collaborate. Yes, collaboration is now called for. You've exhausted everything else.

Here's how ""Phone Power"" compares to previous TMBG works:

1986 They Might Be Giants: Four Stars
1988 Lincoln: Four and a Half Stars
1990 Flood: Five Stars
1992 Apollo 18: Four Stars
1994 John Henry: Two and a Half Stars

That also has some of the Szigeti/Arrau Beethoven Sonatas (##6, 7 & 8) and excellent recordings of the Franck Sonata and Beethoven's ""Kreutzer"" by Oistrakh, as well as a number of encores performed by Oistrakh and by Elman.
