A3QWNQ2WA7QZYJ,B00138F9AO,1,-1,2,"THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE, GET AWAY.

Released in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.

There is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.

This is one of those singer/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.

To make a singer/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.

John Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.

It also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.

The album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.

But, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.

The worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.

If you are new to Widespread Panic, get the live CD Classic City and then get the first two CD's, Widespread Panic and Space Wrangler, which are fantastic, five star albums.","THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE , GET AWAY .

Some of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on her ""Mama's Gun"" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, ""Don't You Forget It"", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track.
The only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on her album, but smoothed around the edges, ""Butterfly""; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough.
The rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear her sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.  After about the 5th track, you're in for some rough riding, buddy.
The tracks by Glen Lewis, Badu and Arie are almost wort the disc, though.  Almost, except that lewis's track will likely be on his CD anyway, and Arie will probably put this track on her next record as well, so you'll end up with the best stuff one way or another.","Starts off great , gets bad real quick .

A29TNAVMPYFRDF,B00138KJI6,-1,1,4,"Lorrie Morgan's second hits compilation starts pretty much where her last one left off, including tracks left off that one('We Both Walk')as well as incorporating singles she'd since  released. While there are a couple of holdovers from the previous set, there's still no 'Out Of Your Shoes', and tracks like 'Half Enough' and the new 'Whoop-De-Do' are  radio trifle that do nothing more than waste her vocal talent.  But when she latches on to something like Sarah McLachlan's 'Angel' or the superb Jon Randall-duet 'By My Side', it only serves to remind the listener that Morgan remains one of Nashville's most underrated vocal stylists.","Lorrie Morgan 's second hits compilation starts pretty much where her last one left off , including tracks left off that one('We Both Walk')as well as incorporating singles she 'd since   released .

A1ALPL858XSDE,B00138KJI6,1,-1,3,"With Lorrie Morgan's recent departure from RCA subsidiary BNA, this new seventeen-track set captures the final original recordings of a mostly successful eleven-year tenure.  It also serves as a fairly effective sequel  to Morgan's eleven-track Greatest Hits collection from 1995.  There are two  overlaps: her signature recording - the symphonic saga ""Something In Red"" -  and the pedestrian non-hit ballad ""Standing Tall.""  The latter tune should  have been dumped in favor of the pretty, top 5 charter ""Out Of Your Shoes""  (the only significant Morgan recording not found on either anthology).
  In the five years since her first collection, the honey-voiced Morgan's  track record at radio has become increasingly spotty.  Not surprising,  about half of the hits included here are recordings made before 1995 that  didn't make it onto the first set.  These include her hard-shufflin'  breakthrough single ""Trainwreck Of Emotion"" (choo-choo!), the toe-tapping  #1 ""We Both Walk,"" and the stirring confession ""He Talks To Me.""  They tend  to make more of an impact than the recent rousers ""Go Away"" or ""One Of  Those Nights Tonight"" and especially, her snoozy duets with ex-hubby Jon  Randall (""By My Side"") and Sammy Kershaw (""Maybe Not Tonight"").
  The five new recordings show a great diversity in both musical styles and  taste.  Morgan's stunning take on the Tammy Wynette classic ""Another Lonely  Song"" is a tribute in every sense of the word and probably her greatest  vocal performance to date.  Meanwhile, the rap-infested ""Whoop-de-do"" is  definitely her worst (Morgan has never sounded so inane).  The remaining  new efforts are a pair of pale ""Something In Red"" imitations (""To Get To  You,"" ""If I Cry"") and a live recording of the precious Sarah McLachlan hit  ""Angel.""  Those last three torchy recordings seem to signal the direction  Morgan wants to take her career in the future... what a shame.","With Lorrie Morgan 's recent departure from RCA subsidiary BNA , this new seventeen - track set captures the final original recordings of a mostly successful eleven - year tenure .

The Stills stuff is not quite as strong as the Bloomfield stuff. It Takes a Lot to Laugh..., a Dylan cover, is pretty good. Season of the Witch is totally re-imagined from the Donovan original. Still haven't decided what I think of it. You Don't Love Me sounds really dated, in my opinion. Man's Temptation & Harvey's Tune are not strong.

This time, she doesn't bring any phony rap artists, but rather, herself and a backup singer. The result is distinctively Brit Pop, but maybe a little more suited to today's audiences. The vocals are the same as always for Bedingfield. The music itself is typical modern music, take it or leave it, although my description is a bit vague.

Well , now it 's trying to make a comeback with Leona Lewis , and former HillSong singer and song - writer , little Natasha Bedingfield .

A6FIAB28IS79,B0013DCCS6,-1,1,4,"This is not the cacophonous circus that two big bands playing together (for the first time, without rehearsal, and in one 12-hour session) might have become.  Think of it as one large ensemble (like Kenton's 40+ piece mellophone orchestra) commanded by a first captain (Ellington) and two assistant directors (Basie and Strayhorn).  Basie, the spokesperson for understatement, and Ellington, the supreme creator of small ensembles within larger ensembles: the result is sensible, swinging, and frequently exhilarating music--with enough spontaneity to satisfy even a Charles Mingus.

In fact, Mingus was the only musician the ultra permissive Ellington ever fired from his band--at the insistence of Juan Tizol, after the volatile bassman had come at the trombonist with a fire ax.  On the occasion of this recording, Tizol again insisted that Ellington fire someone--trumpeter Cat Anderson, who had nearly sliced off his head with a spiraling Sam Woodyard cymbal. "" It's him or me,"" said Juan.  Ellington may have been agreeable, but the Maestro was not about to submit to an ultimatum issued in public by his trombonist.  So ""First Time"" was the last time for Juan Tizol.

Musical highlights include some heated exchanges between the two bands' top soloists, especially Thad Jones vs. Cat Anderson, and Frank Foster + Frank Wess vs. Paul Gonsalves (who could hold his own in any company).  Also, Wess' flute (an instrument that didn't interest Ellington) and Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet do a memorable ""pas de deux.""  At the same time, not bringing together the lead altoists--Johnny Hodges and Marshall Royal--is a wasted opportunity.  On the whole, the affair favors Basie over Ellington, whose subtle, nuanced palette and sophisticated compositional genius are less apparent than usual.  The Freddie Green rhythm guitar would all but clinch it as a primarily Basie date were it not for the rich percussive colors and personal back-beat (as opposed to Sonny Payne's broader stroke) of Sam Woodyard.

A minor disappointment is the audio on this 2008 edition.  There's some breaking up of the sound during the climactic ensemble passages of the main burner, ""Battle Royal.""  Perhaps mine is a defective copy, because after the perfect sound of the digitalized and reissued ""Ellington at Newport 1956,"" a buyer would have the right to expect as much of a 1962 date.  Otherwise, the reissue presents complete tracks for the first time and adds 11 tracks to the 8 on the original album.  The notes are copious, informative, and frequently absorbing.

Like the Ellington/Coltrane meeting, this is not an Ellington essential, but then again it's one no fan of either member of the royal pair would want to be without.","This is not the cacophonous circus that two big bands playing together ( for the first time , without rehearsal , and in one 12 - hour session ) might have become .

But as radio versions usually do, it doesn't give justice to the album version. And like the special edition of The Abyss, some things are better extended.

Like I said, about the first four minutes of the song sound like a boy band reject song. It has good vocals, less than original lyrics and beat, and although it's not as bad as most of the stuff out there, it's kind of a passing song. Easily forgettable.

But get into the extended portion, and you get more lovely instrumental intrudes, and just general expansion that could be a considered a deleted scene in the movie world. And while it may not be much, it is a nice addition.

Justin still has a long way to come around before he becomes amazing.

For example the plain demo and vocal version of ""The French Inhaler"" packs a wallop as does the solo piano version of ""Mohammed's Radio"". As with the ""Elton John"" two disc release that had demos on the second disc, this is one of those few albums that was great to begin with but has been improved by including these terrific alternate takes and solo demos. The band version of ""Carmelita"" captures the live vibe of how this sounded with a full band and I actually prefer it to the more somber reading on the original album (although both are exceptional). ""Frank and Jesse James"" is SO intimiate you can hear the helicopter that passes over Warren's home briefly at around the 3 minute mark.

Warren Zevon considered this his debut but it was really his second solo album (""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" was his first an album he really disliked). The cream of L.A. musicians appear on this terrific album. Zevon's vision focuses on the dark side of L.A. and America. ""Hasten Down the Wind"", ""Poor Poor Pitiful Me"" and ""Carmelita"" were all tackled by Linda Ronstandt on various albums and as great as her versions are they lack the bittersweet quality Zevon infuses in his versions. The original album sounds good--not great in this remaster. It's louder, more compressed than the original but fans will really be picking this up for the second disc out outtakes and alternate versions of the songs on disc one.

For example the plain demo and vocal version of "" The French Inhaler "" packs a wallop as does the solo piano version of "" Mohammed 's Radio "" . As with the "" Elton John "" two disc release that had demos on the second disc , this is one of those few albums that was great to begin with but has been improved by including these terrific alternate takes and solo demos . The band version of "" Carmelita "" captures the live vibe of how this sounded with a full band and I actually prefer it to the more somber reading on the original album ( although both are exceptional ) . "" Frank and Jesse James "" is SO intimiate you can hear the helicopter that passes over Warren 's home briefly at around the 3 minute mark . Warren Zevon considered this his debut but it was really his second solo album ( "" Wanted : Dead or Alive "" was his first an album he really disliked ) . The cream of L.A. musicians appear on this terrific album . Zevon 's vision focuses on the dark side of L.A. and America . "" Hasten Down the Wind "" , "" Poor Poor Pitiful Me "" and "" Carmelita "" were all tackled by Linda Ronstandt on various albums and as great as her versions are they lack the bittersweet quality Zevon infuses in his versions . The original album sounds good -- not great in this remaster . It 's louder , more compressed than the original but fans will really be picking this up for the second disc out outtakes and alternate versions of the songs on disc one . The track listing below represents what is on the second disc . The French Inhaler(Solo Piano Demo ) Backs Turned Looking Down The Path(Alternate take ) Join Me In L.A.(Alternate take ) Poor Poor Pitiful Me(Alternate take ) Mohammed 's Radio(Alternate take ) The French Inhaler(Alternate take ) Desperados Under The Eaves(alternate take ) Mama Could n't Be Persuaded(Live ) I 'll Sleep When I 'm Dead(Alternate Version )

Not Trent Reznor. The Ghosts are truly something very new on a long-known but previously underdeveloped foundation. Consider ""A Warm Place"" off Downward Spiral or the opening to ""Something I could never have"" off Pretty Hate Machine. These were reminders that beneath (and even coexisting with) the screams and mechanistic vicissitudes that define industrial music, Trent Reznor is a consummate musician.

""Ghosts"" is fully a harmonic successor to the atmospheric movements on the very underappreciated ""The Fragile"". Consider the 1999 album's ""La Mer"" or ""Pilgrimage"" as opposed to ""Where is Everybody?"" or ""The Wretched"". Not to say that NIN isn't atmospheric, but rather that there are definitely tracks with an intentional message as opposed to tracks that are more meant for the listener to get lost in. Ghosts is clearly the latter.

AZKXH0J59TK11,B00158SHD8,1,-1,3,"Last year, Nine Inch Nails bounced back from the artistic decay that was ""With Teeth"" with ""Year Zero"", a record that I believe to be Nine Inch Nails' artistic high point, a dense but never fractured album that featured some of his highest production and some of his sharpest songwritting.
Now, only a year later, Nine Inch Nails and their leader Trent Reznor, who for all intents and purposes is Nine Inch Nails, have returned with the nearly two hour ""Ghosts I-IV"", a set of atmospheric instrumentals.
Now, if you would have told me even two years ago that the words ""prolific"" and ""Trent Reznor"" would ever, EVER be mentioned in the same sentence I would have laughed at you. But apparently after getting sober and getting the awfulness of ""With Teeth"" out of his system the man is just that. A total of thirty six tracks, ""Ghosts"" is as sprawling in ambition as ""The Fragile"", even without the accompaniment of vocals.
In fact, this new, quicker working version of Trent Reznor works much better for the music than the one who would spend a good half a decade pain stakingly going over every note. Like ""Year Zero"" last year, there is an immediacy to ""Ghosts"" that previous NIN records lacked. Though the record is dense and layered, it is never overblown with needless tinkering and a million small little pops and bells and whistles that can be found on earlier NIN products.
It's also nice to see Reznor in a True collaborative spirit, as ""Ghosts"" is co-written by Atticus Ross and Alessandro Cortino, NIN's current keyboard player. The difference in perspective helps give this record a feel different of any previous Nails album.
And let's all be honest with each other: the weakest point to any Nine Inch Nails record has always been the lyrical skills of Reznor. Usually clumsy, occasionally inane, Reznor lets the music do the talking for him this time, which is a nice plus.
So why only three stars for this record? Well, because at times ""Ghosts"" feels like a collection of ideas rather than songs. Though there is nothing awful on this record, there is also very little that is extraordinary, and it is too long for it's own good. The mood swings of the record are all complimented well, but too many song build and build and build and just stop, rather than fully taking off and entering someplace different and more interesting.
In fact, the best place to listen to ""Ghosts"" is probably in your car, late at night, driving home, where it can sink into your head but you're never really paying close attention to it.
But ""Ghosts"" is worth the purchase for sure. It's price, and the quality of good, if rarely great, music, and the fact that after almost twenty years Trent Reznor actually sounds like he's enjoying the process of making music.
Hopefully this is a series that he will continue to work on for many years to come.","Last year , Nine Inch Nails bounced back from the artistic decay that was "" With Teeth "" with "" Year Zero "" , a record that I believe to be Nine Inch Nails ' artistic high point , a dense but never fractured album that featured some of his highest production and some of his sharpest songwritting .

A9IZ4H60VZMMT,B00158SHD8,1,-1,3,"...Which is my only complaint with this record. I pre-ordered the whole thing over a month ago and got the free download. After a month of digesting, I must say that this really is not as musically redeeming as other NIN albums, and thats not because of the lack of vocals. I've always loved NIN since the Broken days and I think every album up to this one was great in its own way. To me, each track on Ghosts seems like an incomplete musical idea. As soon as one track starts to build and get interesting, it ends. Other tracks are just looped sound effects with no real variation. More than anything, this album is a fantastic showcase of electronic sound effects. I think its really cool the types of sounds Trent has made with his electronical synths and moogs, and other various toys. Ghosts really shows you what you are capable of doing with todays modern electronic musical equipment. Sadly, as a NIN album it failed to hold my attention, even as background music. I think if Trent were to take the strongest tracks here and have them fully realized into songs, then it would really feel like a new NIN album. This is an experimental effort only. But a cool one. Needless to say, I don't think its worth the $300 dollars (now $600 on ebay) for the special Ed with the Vinyl records. Bottom line, definitely get this if you are a NIN fan at all because it is a fun listen and there are cool sounds on here. Just beware, as the songs don't tend to go anywhere. Have fun.","...

A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,B00158SHD8,-1,1,4,"For a musician who has taken 6 years and 5 years between albums in the past, Trent Reznor sure is active lately, and we can probably thank the rising technical possibilities for working outside of record company strictures. But it's important to remember that Ghosts I-IV is NOT the next proper NiN release, and it should be viewed more accurately as a side project. Here Trent eschews lyrics and vocal melodies (his traditional Achilles heels) for 36 instrumental tracks that mostly provide atmospheres for not-so-easy-listening mood music, while highlighting Trent's sequencing and programming skills. It takes many, many listens for all of the tracks to differentiate themselves in your consciousness, but your patience will mostly be rewarded. Ghosts I-IV occasionally recalls the classic albums, delivering mood manipulation a la The Fragile (tracks #3, 11, 17, 28, 33); and surprisingly for this rather quiet collection, harsh Downward Spiral-like angst (#4, 8, 19, 23, 31). There are also a few experimental surprises that have not been heard from NiN before, such as weird bluegrass guitar (#14 - courtesy of Adrian Belew), pummeling rave (#16), old-school gangsta-hop (#24), bass-driven heavy funk-rock (#26, 27), and even vaguely Asian world music (#30).

But even with those occasional throwbacks and advances, many of the tracks on this release still have trouble rising above the pack. Primarily, almost all of the songs are just too short for their ideas to develop beyond basic introductions. In fact, just two tracks (#20, 34) feature more than one basic beat pattern or chord progression. And there are just too many weak tracks that turn moodiness into boredom - ranging from thin beat programming exercises (#9, 18), simple piano melodies propped up unsuccessfully with random noise (#10, 13, 22), and basic sequencer patterns that repeat to the point of absurdity (#6, 34). Of course, fans should feel as mellow and moody listening to Ghosts I-IV as Trent probably did while creating it. But at times there are just too many under-developed ideas vying for the listener's and the creator's attention.

Way too often that does not even encapsulate the feel or sound of the music/song or artist I am talking about.

Much like books, food , perfume- music is a subjective thing.  You either love it or you don't.

AYSLSU7966FWE,B0016679I8,1,-1,3,"I love everything Sevendust has ever done, and I loved the significant evolution that was heard on each of their first 3 albums. Since then, they've continued to put out quality metal, but it seems that they got stuck a few times in terms of direction. ""Seasons"" was an excellent album, but it didn't do much that ""Animosity"" hadn't already done. ""Alpha"" was also great (one of their heaviest), but it didn't do much that ""Next"" hadn't done. I prefer Sevendust when they're heavy, but I felt like ""Next"" and ""Alpha"" were slightly boring compared to earlier stuff...the songs weren't as diverse, and the chugging guitar riffs and the chorus vocals seemed a bit repetitive. Now we have ""Hope and Sorrow,"" the band's 7th album. It's a breath of fresh air, because we see the band getting back to incorporating melody again. ""Inside"" is a great opening tune because it's very heavy and also it sounds like the Sevendust we know and love. ""Enough"" offers a fun guitar riff that breaks the cycle of the chugging guitar riffs from the last 2 albums. The first single, ""Prodigal Son"" is a very basic tune, but it's catchy groove will get stuck in your head almost immediately. ""The Past"" is a mellow tune featuring Chris Daughtry doing some guest singing, and while it isn't a very strong track, it's nice to see the band playing with this style again.
Overall, this is a typical sounding Sevendust record, and it represents their general sound quite nicely. It's certainly not the strongest album they've put out, but I'm glad they are back to experimenting with different styles again. I think if they had put out another album that sounded like ""Next"" or ""Alpha"" it wouldn't be enough to hold my attention with all the other albums coming out this year.

A2VCKET09T30E4,B00168G2M0,1,-1,2,"This is the first album without Mick Taylor, and it shows. To use the title of one of their tunes from the Goats album, Black and Blue continued the mid-70s trend of the Rolling Stones ""Coming Down Again"" from the glorious heights of their '68-'72 Classic peaks. B&B is simply an uneven, if not amateurish performance, by a group touted as World's Greatest ROCK & ROLL Band.

This album has much more of a NON-rock & roll style. ""Hot Stuff"" is funky; reggae is evident with ""Cherry Oh Baby""; and ""Melody"" is a little jazzy. Tellingly, only one song from B&B managed to (barely) crack the US Top Ten, and wasn't even a Rock and Roll number (Fool to Cry).

No, this can arguably be considered a low point in the Stones' output from the '70s, especially considering that Ron Wood was still testing out his wings here as a new band member. The album DID manage to score some notable PR for the infamous Hollywood billboard in which a Jagger-bound young model was shown to say

""I'm BLACK AND BLUE from the Rolling Stones -- and I love it!""

The resulting firestorm from feminist groups probably added to sales of the album, despite the mediocrity of the tracks. The lads from London thus continued their notorious streak of controversy for being ""Bad Boys.""

One last thing....

Just wanted to make some corrections on reviewer Jarchow's comment ""Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording""

Technically incorrect.

-- The incomparable English pianist Nicky Hopkins played on numerous Stones' recordings, and on one or more Beatles recordings (e.g., ""Revolution"" from the White Album).

-- Guitar great Eric Clapton played lead ax on The Beatles ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" and recorded with Keith Richards and John Lennon on the tune ""Yer Blues"" for the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.

More technically correct, but still historically interesting, are the following:

-- One of the Stones played on a Beatles recording. Appropriately, this was Rolling Stones founder and talented multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who played alto saxophone on the B side of the Beatles' last single ""Let it Be."" The recording is a comedy-lounge tune called ""You Know My Name (look up the number)."" Jones was part of the recording sessions with the Beatles in early April 1967 for this composition.

-- One of the Beatles played on a Stones recording. That honor goes to none other than John Lennon, who jammed with Keith Richards (and Clapton, as mentioned above) on the Beatles tune ""Yer Blues"" for the Stones' 1968 Circus.

-- Head Stones Jagger and Richards joined the Beatles in recording their 1967 release ""All You Need is Love.""

-- Lead Beatles Lennon and McCartney joined the Stones in recording their 1967 release ""Sing This All Together.""","This is the first album without Mick Taylor , and it shows .

The Bad
As with most mainstream and modern rock today, there is not much diversity here. Sure, there are rockers and ballads, but the rockers don't break mid-tempo and all sound the same. The ballads fall into the same rut.

The Verdict
While 10 years have certainly nailed down great vocal melodies on Division, they have faltered when it comes to diverse and interesting rhythms to accompany them.

Regardless, the iconic photo was taken at that Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street stop.  The photo shoot proved problematic as several hundred images where taken that turned out to be unusable due to an all familiar suggestion that had been penned on the tiled wall, which inspired the writing of the future song A Poem On The Underground Wall, from the album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.

Its not uncommon for an initial outing to be a mixed bag of original material, covers, and arrangements of traditional songs, which was the case here, with their cover of Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin ushering them into the inner circle for all things Bob Dylan, and gaining cross-over fans.  For the most part the album was largely acoustically focused, and largely unremarkable, so unremarkable, along with the invasion of The Beatles, that Simon & Garfunkel broke up, with Paul headed off to the UK, and Art going back to school.  It wouldnt be until the track Sounds Of Silence was reworked as the opening number on their following album, and was presented in a more haunting rock n roll manner, that Simon & Garfunkel secured a place on the musical map and never looked back.

The release was so overshadowed by the Sound Of Silence album that many people completely overlooked it, and with that hit single being on both albums [though as differing versions], it caused confusion for many.  Regardless, what shines most on this release are the traditional and cover songs, where the duo come off as energetic, harmonious, and emotionally sincere.  While sounding sincere and ambitious, the album comes across somewhat disjointed because of this non-original material, and the fact that the songs seemed to have been chosen at random, without consideration for the contextual flow needed for a concise body of work.  While certainly better than their Tom & Jerry [with name taken from the Tom & Jerry cat and mouse comic] material, theyve stepped headlong into an Everly Brothers / Peter, Paul and Mary-ish adaptation, making the album sound a bit flat, thin, campy and uninspired.

Im trying hard to bring something positive to the table, yet in all honesty, there is little I can say about this album to make it seem worth not only your while, but your investment.  The one thing Simon & Garfunkel did, which was similar, though not as dramatic as Dylan at Newport, was that they stepped out of the crooning vocal era of the late 50s, and into the folk scene, and then nearly single handedly reinvented the folk attitude, flying under the banner of folk-rock, though still heavy on the folk side  so yes, in a sense this is an important album as a bookmark of sorts, though holds little of lasting value.

That said, the soundtrack is good, but not great.  To have a copy of ""Woke Up This Morning"" on the CD while driving is sublime; a couple of other things are worth it.  Springsteen's inclusion is great, but you should already be carrying a copy of NEBRASKA with you everywhere you go, so who needs another copy?  The best thing here is the Nick Lowe song, ""The Beast In Me,"" which I listen to over and over and over--I mean, I played that song 8 times in a row last night, I just can't get enough of it.
But some of the other songs here...the Elvis song--and this comes from an Elvis fan--is pointless.  It's that middle-of-his-career Elvis, where there's an impressive style, but no emotion. The Wyclef Jean song is junk.  The Los Lobos is just average Los Lobos.  The Eurythmics song is the same old Eurythmics song--and it's been played to death on SoftRock radio stations.
Again, I'm a Sopranos addict.  I bought this, I'll probably get the next one.  If you aren't a huge fan of the show, with something visual to relate the Sinatra song to, for example, it might not work for you.  I love Sinatra, but ""It Was A Very Good Year"" doesn't exactly dovetail with R.L. Burnside or Bob Dylan.
I tried to quit watching the Sopranos, y'know.  Tried to go back to The Practice and E.R..  Then Tony's mom dropped a dime on him and, I dunno...I keep trying to get out, and they keep pulling me back in.

The ""June"" ballet is interesting but is marred by the sounds of the chorus' shoes on the stage floor during the dance! It was obviously just lifted from the film soundtrack. The latter ""Ballet"" is actually a nice addition, with a varied version of the Carousel Waltz, with a calliope effect making it sound like a real carousel; very atmospheric.

A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B001ESDIQ0,1,-1,3,"Lil Wayne - Tha Carter III (Cash Money, 2008)

Mainstream hip-hop fans vs. underground hip-hop fans: can't we all just get along? I mean, is it cool to dig both Lil Wayne AND Little Brother? (Incidentially, Wayne did make a guest appearance on Little Brother's last album, suggesting that his appeal stretches beyond the Billboard charts.) Well, although I'm more of a fan of underground, indie hip-hop, I'll give credit to where it's due. Lil Wayne is a pretty nice rapper and he was even nice in 1998 when he was on Big Tymers' ""Millionaire Dream"". And although he hit a dry spell (namely during 2001-2003 when the Cash Money trend was dying and people were leaving the label), he reengerized and came with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tha-Carter/dp/B00027JYPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tha Carter</a>. That album wasn't all that great except for the song, ""Ain't That a B***h"", which was lyrically sharp. That set the stage for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tha-Carter-II/dp/B000BLI4UG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tha Carter II</a>, which found Weezy F. Baby finding his niche. Then came all the mixtapes and guest appearances on every song, occasionally making songs by nobodies sound better (i.e., Playaz Circle's ""Duffle Bag Boy"" and Shop Boyz' ""Party Like a Rockstar"" remix). With so much critical acclaim, of course there would be so much hype for the much-delayed Carter III.

There are a couple of hot tracks on here like ""3 Peat"", the inspired ""Tie My Hands"" and the David Banner-produced ""La La"". But the best song is the innovative ""Dr. Carter"", where Wayne plays a surgeon operating on wack MC's. Swizz Beatz (with a beat that is very uncharacteristic of him) takes a David Axelrod sample (""The Smile"") and when the music intensifies, Wayne follows suit with his rhymes. The nurse then tells him of each patient's condition. If only all of Wayne's songs were this clever.

In fact, if Wayne could spend his time making actual songs, the album would be better. A lot of times, we find him just spitting off the dome, saying nonsensical stuff and lazily getting through a song, making tracks like Kanye West's ""Let the Beat Build"" good only because of the beat itself. Other times, he makes songs that scream, ""My next single"", like the subpar ""Mrs. Officer"" and the ringtone-friendly ""Lollipop"" (which was a single). Also, the last track, ""Dontgetit"", finds Wayne talking out his you-know-what about society today and why he hates Al Sharpton. Leave that conscious rap for Talib Kweli.

There are many times last year when Lil Wayne spit a rewindable lyric and you'll have no choice but to compare the songs on this album to those moments. Has he used up his best material already? It's hard to say. But Tha Carter III is still one of the better mainstream hip-hop albums of the year. [Earlier editions of this album also came with a bonus disc of his best mixtape songs, the highlight being ""Kush"".] -EJR","Mainstream hip - hop fans vs. underground hip - hop fans : ca n't we all just get along ?

I rarely play this cd now and actually am more likely to play Da Drought 3, Like Father Like Son, or Tha Carter 2 before I put this one in. Below is the review I wrote on the week this was released. I still stand by what I said as far as those four songs now not 13 that were creative; the rest are good, good songs but nothing classical.
People hated Kobe too, but the best will shine. Hardest part for me was determining is this a classic or not since three songs on this cd are not good (Got Money, Comfortable, Mrs. Officer), but when I had to think about how many times I rewound like 13 songs over and over just out of sheer enjoyment I had to say yeah when most classics consist of 10songs or 13. This is True melodious art and lyrical gymnastics,& not something you've heard on your typical assembly line rap.
Most folk that don't like Weezy aren't from the South...well too bad for u suck it up and swallow deez in ya' mouth. And due to what I've heard over the years I have to say it's a classic for these times and yes for these times Weezy is artistically the best at rappping while flipping styles and riding beats with his voice and vocally catching singer's notes while rapping (he's sick when it comes to this).This really is his niche and because he's so much better at it than any, any other rapper it makes people that like this style of rapping (rapping while switching your voice, melodious tones, vocal creativity, intriguing choruses, punch line raps built on the flow riding the beat instead of first doing a rap and then attaching a beat behind it) think he is the best rapper out now. This talent makes his other deficiencies seem not so apparent to those who like him and those who are too young to know raps history. The biggest critique is when it comes to lyrics and content and probably word for word rhyming he is not even in the top 10. This is why when people like Jay or Andre3000 or even BunB feature with him he doesn't out shine them like Nas, Eminem, and Pac used to. Lyrically not in the same conversation as Chino XL, Immortal, Ghostface, Genius, Cube,Big Daddy Kane, Rakim,the list goes on. Some of these artists had weaknesses too, so like them he has his but quit the hating on True talent. It's like listening to Thriller and asking ""where's the political content"" like Marvin Gaye's What's Goin On.  Bottom line to New Yorkers who basically don't like anything not N.Y. and only tolerate other rappers if you can say Method Man's Tical is a classic (which I consider it to be) where he basically doesn't talk about nothing then you should be able to see where Wayne's coming from artistically. Musically, he's like a young Method Man before he sold out and became lame.
How many artists sound like something you've already heard?Wayne is original for the most part, he has adopted some of his 10 styles to rapand Wayne does his own choruses and they sound like...music. If you can't respect the lack of meaningful lyrics you have to respect the artist and what he's doing musically--cause straight up it is rare. Just cause you don't like him doesn't mean he isn't doing something creative.

ASVNSWIXBV72Q,B001ESSLIU,-1,1,5,"In 1996, following a fight with the group, the thrash metal band Sepultura lost their vocalist and rhythm guitarist. Max Cavalera, the member who left the band, formed another band, Soulfly in 1998.

Over the course of their six albums with Cavalera, Sepultura evolved pretty far. With each passing album, they became more and more creative and experimental, but (in my opinion) they also became less and less heavy. Therefore, everybody (or every metalhead, at least) eagerly awaited Soulfly's self-entitled debut. Would it pick up where Sepultura left off, or would it be a rehash of a past Sepultura album, or would Max start over, from the beginning, and make Soulfly have a completely new sound?

Well, aside from being heavier, angrier, and more energetic, ""Soulfly"" pretty much picks up where 1996's ""Roots"" left off. This album doesn't expand on or evolve Sepultura's sound, but it still has plenty of new and refreshing ingredients and sounds.

""Eye for an Eye"" is one of Soulfly's better known songs. It's the opening track on this record and the first of three relentlessly heavy tracks. The first ten seconds are a buzzing sound, but then the floodgates open with very heavy guitar riffs which groove and pounding drums.

""No Hope=No Fear"" begins with an ascending yell, before it becomes a demolishing beat with surging riffs.

""Bleed"" begins with a drum beat and some light, almost wah-wah guitar noise, then Max makes another screaming entrance and the song explodes. Then Fred Durst makes his cameo, yells ""Bring it on!,"" and begins rapping. This song is OK, but the rap part of this song doesn't really

fit.

The first minute of ""Tribe"" is an acoustic guitar with some guy singing in a foreign language (maybe African). The drums, and eventually the power chords and vocals begin, and the song jumps in volume. The guitars turn out heavy churning riffs and the drums sound like tin cans.

""Bumba"" begins with the sound of a rainstorm, before turning to chug and churn riffs and vocals which are in Spanish.

""First Commandment"" has more crunchy riffs, but, about halfway through, it becomes a light interlude with tribal drums and (Deftones frontman's) Chino Moreno's dreary vocals. Max Cavalera made a guest appearance on the Deftones 1997 album, ""Around the Fur,"" so Chino repays Max for it by making a cameo on this album.

""Bumbklaatt"" is another very angry track. The beat/song becomes full volume following a guttural yell by Max at the beginning, and the rest of the song is a very catchy rhythm with good drum work.

""Soulfly"" is an instrumental with tribal drums and some light guitar strums. It's a nice, peaceful track, but it's also kind of forgettable and not as creative as later Soulfly instrumentals.

""Umbabarauma"" is maybe the catchiest song on the album. It opens with a yell of ""Un, dos, tres, cua!,"" then some half volume guitars and a catchy drum pattern kick in, but this song is really a highlight because of the great chant/shout along of ""Umbabarauma!""

""Quilombo"" has angry vocals, but the instruments buzz along at only half volume.

""Fire"" has more fast, plowing riffs, but they break briefly and the song becomes a drum beat with dwindling, twinkling guitar strings. But an ascending yell and some more heavy riffs bring the song back to full volume. Most of this song (except for the very beginning and end) is an instrumental.

""The Song Remains Insane"" begins with the sound of a TV, with two people who talk, in Spanish, about ""Sepultura"" and ""Max Cavalera."" The song itself, though, is a super loud, pounding beat with more heavy yells.

The second half of ""No"" is an instrumental. The first half has a throat straining yell and more churning riffs, but the second half has a weird guitar noise and jazzy drumming.

""Prejudice"" gains momentum well and has good vocal hooks.

""Karmageddon"" has almost spacey guitar notes and a repetitive drum pattern. Then, following a half a minute of silence, there are more tribal drums alongside some female vocals.

This album is essential for all Sepultura fans and Max freaks, and if you're looking for an heavy, hard hitting, energetic listen, check this album out. Expect a great listen, but don't expect this album to be a classic, like Sepultura's ""Beneath the Remains"" or ""Arise."" And don't listen to it if you're the type of person who gets headaches easily.","In 1996 , following a fight with the group , the thrash metal band Sepultura lost their vocalist and rhythm guitarist .

With each passing album , they became more and more creative and experimental , but ( in my opinion ) they also became less and less heavy . Therefore , everybody ( or every metalhead , at least ) eagerly awaited Soulfly 's self - entitled debut . Would it pick up where Sepultura left off , or would it be a rehash of a past Sepultura album , or would Max start over , from the beginning , and make Soulfly have a completely new sound ? Well , aside from being heavier , angrier , and more energetic , "" Soulfly "" pretty much picks up where 1996 's "" Roots "" left off . This album does n't expand on or evolve Sepultura 's sound , but it still has plenty of new and refreshing ingredients and sounds . "" Eye for an Eye "" is one of Soulfly 's better known songs . It 's the opening track on this record and the first of three relentlessly heavy tracks . The first ten seconds are a buzzing sound , but then the floodgates open with very heavy guitar riffs which groove and pounding drums . "" No Hope = No Fear "" begins with an ascending yell , before it becomes a demolishing beat with surging riffs . "" Bleed "" begins with a drum beat and some light , almost wah - wah guitar noise , then Max makes another screaming entrance and the song explodes . Then Fred Durst makes his cameo , yells "" Bring it on ! , "" and begins rapping . This song is OK , but the rap part of this song does n't really 

 fit . The first minute of "" Tribe "" is an acoustic guitar with some guy singing in a foreign language ( maybe African ) . The drums , and eventually the power chords and vocals begin , and the song jumps in volume . The guitars turn out heavy churning riffs and the drums sound like tin cans . "" First Commandment "" has more crunchy riffs , but , about halfway through , it becomes a light interlude with tribal drums and ( Deftones frontman 's ) Chino Moreno 's dreary vocals . "" Bumbklaatt "" is another very angry track . The beat / song becomes full volume following a guttural yell by Max at the beginning , and the rest of the song is a very catchy rhythm with good drum work . "" Soulfly "" is an instrumental with tribal drums and some light guitar strums . It 's a nice , peaceful track , but it 's also kind of forgettable and not as creative as later Soulfly instrumentals . "" Umbabarauma "" is maybe the catchiest song on the album . It opens with a yell of "" Un , dos , tres , cua ! , "" then some half volume guitars and a catchy drum pattern kick in , but this song is really a highlight because of the great chant / shout along of "" Umbabarauma ! "" 

 "" Quilombo "" has angry vocals , but the instruments buzz along at only half volume . "" Fire "" has more fast , plowing riffs , but they break briefly and the song becomes a drum beat with dwindling , twinkling guitar strings . But an ascending yell and some more heavy riffs bring the song back to full volume . Most of this song ( except for the very beginning and end ) is an instrumental . "" The Song Remains Insane "" begins with the sound of a TV , with two people who talk , in Spanish , about "" Sepultura "" and "" Max Cavalera . "" The song itself , though , is a super loud , pounding beat with more heavy yells . The second half of "" No "" is an instrumental . The first half has a throat straining yell and more churning riffs , but the second half has a weird guitar noise and jazzy drumming . "" Prejudice "" gains momentum well and has good vocal hooks . "" Karmageddon "" has almost spacey guitar notes and a repetitive drum pattern . Then , following a half a minute of silence , there are more tribal drums alongside some female vocals . This album is essential for all Sepultura fans and Max freaks , and if you 're looking for an heavy , hard hitting , energetic listen , check this album out . Expect a great listen , but do n't expect this album to be a classic , like Sepultura 's "" Beneath the Remains "" or "" Arise . "" And do n't listen to it if you 're the type of person who gets headaches easily ."

Max's new band Soulfly, is like speed metal overdrive that has splinters of Sepultura's harder past, with funkier beats and rhythms that make Soulfly stand on their own.  But there are some problems, namely some songs sound like they were B-sides from Sepultura's ""Roots"" and ""Chaos A.D."" which will make longtime Sepultura fans feel they have heard this before and heard it done better.","I was a big Sepultura fan back in their older days of death metal , and I was n't too bowled over with their breakthrough album "" Roots "" which proved to be Max Cavalera 's last album with the band .

A2RXC61UJQQSWZ,B001EVXR1S,1,-1,2,"The actor Terence Howard has ventured into the music form, with this, his debut album. According to the man himself, music is his first love, and if it came to having to choose between acting & music, music would always win out. So, what does he offer us, as a way to see if he is as talented a musician, as he is a actor.
Well, firstly there's his voice. On many reviews I have read around the web, he has been castigated for his singing voice, which I think is a little harsh. Bob Dylan and Lou Reed are two artists that, to my ears, haven't got the greatest voices in the world, but that doesn't stop them from having success and award selling albums. To these ears his voice suits the music on offer.
And to me that is the problem, the music on offer. Whilst not awful, there's not much here that stands out. Whilst it's pleasant sounding, it all kind of blends into a much ness. The exception to this rule and my favourite track on offer here is 'Spanish Love Guitar' in which Terence show cases his skills on said guitar. This is a lovely moment that I kept on repeat for a while, enjoying the soothing sound.

I do hope that this isn't Mr. Howard one & only shot at a musical and that Sony back him with the means to produce a sophomore album. This CD hints at more to come.","According to the man himself , music is his first love , and if it came to having to choose between acting & music , music would always win out .

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B001EVXR1S,1,-1,3,"Terrence Howards debut album SHINE THROUGH IT goes against the grain of what you would expect Howard to record. Howard's brand of R&B is mixed with influences of jazz, pop, folk, and singer-songwriter elements.  The result isn't always fully developed, but SHINE THROUGH IT allows for a couple of truly compelling moments. One strong point, regardless of weaker material, is the acoustic instrumentation.  There is nothing like a good album that uses live instrumentation.

SHINE THROUGH IT's first couple of tracks are all ""fire"".  ""Love Makes You Beautiful"" is one of the most beautiful examples of orchestration in pop music I have heard for a while.  The string bass gives this track an inherent jazz feel while the acoustic piano, acoustic piano, and bells add the ""cherry on top"". Howard's vocals are great here, filled with great nuance and inflection that can't be denied.  Howard can actually sing; the issue for those expecting a more ""urban"" debut will be that Howard's songwriting isn't what was expected.

""Shine Through It"" shows Howard sounding very similar to a mix between Anthony Hamilton and John Legend.  As ""poppy"" as ""Shine Through It"" is, it is incredibly soulful.  The choir in the background is just great and shows Howard's cerebral nature in crafting this album. Once again, the strings are fantastic and add that extra dimension to SHINE THROUGH IT.  The brass truly makes this feel like we are reliving the 1960s/70s again.  Say what you will about SHINE as a whole, but ""Shine Through It"" is fire.

""Mr. Johnson's Lawn"" shows more exceptional songwriting from Howard, if a bit less impressive than ""Love Makes You Beautiful"" or ""Shine Through It"". The tropical feel shows Howard once again stretching out his wings with a mesh of differing styles and influences. Vocally, Terrece isn't as refined as on the two previous standouts, but he still sounds fine.  ""Sanctuary"" lays very well, making it another fine listen.  ""No. 1 Fan"" isn't bad, if not truly great, while ""Spanish Love Affair"" 'is what it is'.  Lovely Spanish guitar work introduces the track followed by a Spanish instrumental groove. Now how often do pop albums have instrumental tracks these days? Not often.

""Plenty"" is an overall strong track, with an urban groove, still utilizing live drums and acoustic piano.  Howard does make the concession of adding an electric bass as opposed to string bass. Also, the addition or organ makes it clear to fans that Howard wanted to embrace ""soul"" on this track exclusively, laying down his folk ruminations momentarily.  ""I Remember When"" changes styles again, giving the sense of a 60's pop song. In fact, I believe that the Beach Boys or even the Beatles might perform something like this.  It works and it's catchy. It's nothing truly record-breaking, but it is a fine enough listen.

""It's All Game"" resurrects Howard's jazzy ruminations via a second instrumental track. It is a fine enough listen, though shows a bit of the problem with SHINE THROUGH IT - it is uneven.  ""She Was Mine"" has a 'tongue-n-cheek' jazz feel to it, which is enjoyable.  It's nothing that never been before, yet Howard resurrects it and brings the sound to a new group of listeners.  The closing track ""War"" features a big-band.

The main problem with SHINE THROUGH IT is it is over-ambitious and at some moments undercooked. Howard never sounds bad, but sometimes his songwriting is ""all over the place"".  It possesses potential in a number of ways, but I think that Howard's follow-up album would have to tune more closely into one style as opposed to being such a mixed bag as SHINE THROUGH IT. 3 stars.","Terrence Howards debut album SHINE THROUGH IT goes against the grain of what you would expect Howard to record .

Imagine my surpise when Mr. Howard was the one singing on his debut CD. The album opens with a lush ballad while the rest of the album is a mixtue of different styles ranging from bossa nova, to jazz to even a dabble in big band.

Believe is a good album, the following track ""the power"" takes cher almost in another direction with a feel of eastern music added to a slow thump of a beat which worked very well.

""Runaway"" was probably the main song i would say could have been released which has a very groovy darkness about it with a very modern fast basey beat and suits chers vocals very well.

The following 2 songs ""all or nothing"" and ""strong enough"" are typical cher songs, just with pop beats instead of power rock music. Unfortunately after the 5th song things start taking a little bit of a dive - ""dov'e l'amore"" doesnt sit right on this album and sounds too latino, the Emilio Estefan Junior Remix of the song would have sounded better and that was released in the uk. ""taking back my heart"" is ok but not alot to it.

After this i think targeting a younger audience was taken to the extreme ""taxi taxi"" and ""love is the groove"" are very badly wrote, cher does her best but it only just manages a level for 10 year olds to enjoy. Finally we get a remix and not a re-recording of ""we all sleep alone"". A little disapointing that there were only 9 new tracks of which 5 were excellent and the others quite the opposite.

In two ways, I was wrong:

Radio played it quite a bit and once my mother got a hold of this song, she really, really, REALLY did NOT let go. She played it a lot and it grated on my nerves so bad, I started to ""hate"" this girl.

But fast forward some time and I say this is a good song made great because of the vocal force and runs that were perfected to a tee. Some say the lyrics are a bit juvenile and they kinda are overall, but the voice really does carry it over in this case.

The music to the song is good too but it doesn't compare to Lions, Tigers & Bears which also has better lyrics. If you have yet to hear it and have been ignoring radio, that's a good thing. But it's a bad thing if you haven't heard said song.

Find it somewhere and dig in.

A17R7H005QCW8O,B0000CFWZA,-1,1,4,"Ok, so maybe it's not as good as Silver Side Up, but the boys of Nickelback had a HUGE task in front of them to top that masterpiece, and they did pretty well. Most of the tracks are good, but unfortunatly I got the limited editon version which goes on WAY TOO LONG i.e after track 11, I start to get REALLY bored.

Flat on the floor...(Very faced paced, with an awesome chorus. One of the best on the album 9/10)

Do this Anymore...(The beginning is kinda slow, but it kicks in pretty quick with killer verses and an ultra-catchy chorus. Probably one of my favorite songs By Nickelback, period 10/10)

Someday...(Way too overplayed, expecially on Mtv. At first I really liked it, but now I usually skip over to Believe it or not 8/10)

Believe it or Not...(The verses are kinda slow and repetitive, but the chorus is great 8/10)

Feelin way too damn good...(Very well sung, with a nice, melodic ring to it. It has the kinda chorus that'll get you singing along once you learn the words too, which is always a plus 8/10)

Because of you...(The chorus on this one seems almost perfect, right up until the end. The thing is, they try to jam too many words into too little time, and the result is an almost ugly sound. Minus that little detail, its a great song 8/10)

Figured You Out...(The second single, and totally stupid lyrically. Still, it's pretty catchy 7/10)

Should've listened...(The fact that I can't remember how it goes tells me right away that it's forgetable. Too be fair, I won't grade it n/a)

Throw Yourself Away...(Its got a very ""Nickelback"" sound, which is a good thing. The lyrics are pretty heavy too, kinda like ""Never Again"" from silver side up 9/10)

Another Hole In The Head...(For some reason, the chorus really stands out for me on this one. That alone makes it worth listening to 8/10)

See you at the show...(Great (offical) closer. The chorus is great, the verses are great, and the song is very catchy. The lyrics are kinda dumb tho 8.5/10)

The Other 3 Songs...I don't really listen to these, at all.

AYSLSU7966FWE,B0000CFWZA,-1,1,5,"I've been a big Nickelback fan since ""The State"" was first released about 4 years ago. I loved it, and when ""Silver Side Up"" came out, I loved it even more. At that point, I figured the band had already hit their high point, and anything else they'd put out would probably only be just ok. Well, after picking up my copy of ""The Long Road"" last September, I was pleasantly surprised. I really wasn't expecting too much out of this album, but at the end of every song, I found myself saying ""YEAH!"" The first single, ""Someday"" is a great song, but for those that thinks it's a watered down version of ""How You Remind Me"", listen to the rest. ""Figured You Out"" is also a good song, however, I don't think it's a good choice as a single. ""Feelin Way Too Damn Good"" is the next single, and again I have to say I love the song, but it's not a good choice as a single. The album's best material is found on tracks like ""Believe It Or Not"" and ""See You At The Show"". It doesn't stop there though, ""Flat On The Floor"" and ""Because Of You"" are probably some of the heaviest songs the band has ever written. There's not one bad song on this album! I'd say it's at least as good as ""Silver Side Up"" if not better. So I urge you to pick this up right away! However, if you have the means...get the limited edition version which features 3 bonus songs: ""Learn The Hard Way"", ""Yanking Out My Heart"" and ""Saturday Nights Alright"".

SIDE ONE NOTES
1.) On the group's first session with George Martin, the producer was unsure of Ringo Starr's abilities so he hired Andy White to play drums, with Ringo relegated to tambourine. This alternate version of ""Love Me Do"" has Ringo at the sticks, and no tambourine. 2.)

Ditto #2. 4.) In the U.S., a SWAN label 45,  in Germany it was partnered with ""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand"" on a 45 issued in January of '64. 5.) Alternate take with a six-bar ending. 6.)

An amalgam of US singles and UK album mixes. This created ""Walrus"" has a six-bar intro and extra beats before ""Yellow matter custard..."" The transition to rechanneled mono which occurs two minutes in is done as an easy segue rather than an abrupt shift, as it is on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MAGICAL-MYSTERY-TOUR/dp/B005E0CDTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR</a>.

SIDE TWO NOTES
1.) This dub of the German stereo version ncludes a tagged on piccolo trumpet at the end that was only on US and Canadian radio station promo singles. 2.) From the unique mono mix WHITE ALBUM, not available in the US. There's laughing at the start, beeps heard throughout and different drumming at the end. The track ends at the first fade, thus eliminating Ringo's ""I've got blistahs on mah fingahs!"" 3.) Another mono WHITE ALBUM cut, it's sped up and includes alternate violin riffs. 4.) Liner notes indicate there's no known stereo mix of this ""Lady Madonna"" 'B' Side, but the PAST MASTERS: VOLUME TWO track is a slightly different True stereo version. 5.) Stereo ""World Wildlife Fund"" mix (pre-Phil Spector's overdubbed strings) has birdwing SFX at the beginning. 6.) Released 3/70 as the flip of ""Let It Be,"" this zaniest of all Fab Four tracks was originally planned for an 'A' side, also inclusion on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHITE-ALBUM/dp/B00B40R7RO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHITE ALBUM</a>.

ASFXD8YLO67KW,B001GFKIBE,-1,1,5,"So, with more than a few variations of this LP, how do you write a proper review???
Well, lets start with the US version. I've had three different versions of the ""Red & Blue"" albums, A later 80's pressing on the Red Capitol Label, The Original Red and Blue colored Vinyl US issues, also with Capitol Labels and the ""C1"" issues on the ""small"" Capitol label-and those issues are very limited pressings as the record companies were already starting to ditch vinyl as a popular format. The Blue colored edition looks beautiful, but it sounds just average for sound fidelity. The UK Blue vinyl edition sounds much better and the UK mixes, which in 73 were superior to the Capitol mixes, were used. The nice thing about the US edition is some of the US mixes, even thought their not as 'clean' as the British mixes, sonically I like them better. Songs like 'She's A Woman', 'I Feel Fine' sound more fuller and richer with the added reverb to my ears. And 'Help' is preceded by the James Bond Theme as found only on the US mix, and it fits perfectly. All in all great music!

A129YBX5BVNW2,B001GFKIBE,-1,1,5,"Commonly known as the ""Blue Album"", the 2LP vinyl set ""1967 - 1970"" became an instant classic when it was first released in April 1973 (as did its ""Red"" counterpart ""1962-1966""). When they were finally reissued onto the new CD format in 1993 however, they caused consternation because of their extortionate full price.

So is this newly remastered 2010 mid-priced 2CD reissue on EMI/Apple 5099990674723 any better - the answer is an emphatic 'yes'.

PACKAGING:
The first thing you notice is that the clunky double jewel-case of the 1993 reissue has been dumped for a three-way foldout card sleeve. The centre and right flaps picture the photograph on the inner gatefold of the original vinyl double album (St. Pancras Old Church in London, 27 July 1969, The Beatles with the public looking through the railings - it's the same photo on the ""Red"" album). It also houses the two CDs - CD1 has the full Apple label (14 tracks, 51:15 minutes) and the 2nd CD has the half Apple logo (14 tracks, 48:43 minutes). The vinyl set is yet to come, the Digital Download versions are available from 25 Oct 2010 and there's also an issue that lumps both the Blue & Red reissues together as one package in late November.

The left flap houses a new 32-page booklet. The lyrics are intact from the inner sleeves of the original album issue, there's new liner notes by BILL FLANAGAN the MTV Executive and author of ""Evening's Empire"" (a book on Rock in the Sixties) and there's plenty of superb colour photos from the period - it's impressively done. Downsides - some complained that the 09/09/09 card digipak sleeves for The Beatles reissues were easy to smudge once out of the shrinkwrap and worse - the inner flaps easy to tear as you removed the disc. I'm afraid these are the same. I suppose I would have been nave of us to think that EMI would actually listen to the complaints of 2009 about packaging, but they haven't - the need for these issues to look the same as the preceding ones has overridden all considerations... Having said that, I still think they look great - substantial even...

PLAYING TIMES:
Unlike the ""Red"" issue which could easily have fitted onto 1CD (and even included bonus tracks), as you can see from the playing times provided above, it would not have been possible with this set. Anyway - EMI would of course argue that a single CD issue of this most `iconic' of double albums would fundamentally alter the aesthetic of the original release. At least this time, this 2CD reissue is at mid price, so we're not being charged for the privilege of separation.

TRACK CHOICES:
The compilation itself is basically the A-sides of all their UK 7"" singles releases between 1967 and 1970 in chronological release date order with a few key album tracks thrown in for good measure. Eagle-eye fans would therefore note that up to and including ""Get Back"" - ALL Beatles UK 7"" singles for that period were issued only in MONO (""The Ballad Of John & Yoko"" was their 1st STEREO single in the UK). So the tracks on the album should reflect that - the MONO single mixes. But EMI did nothing of the sort. They're all in STEREO (there's 4 MONO on the ""Red"" set) and i would argue that accuracy's loss is the listener's gain, because the STEREO versions used here are awesome.

SOUND:
Although the compilation is copyrighted to 2010 (released Monday 18 Oct 2010 in the UK and 19 Oct 2010 in the USA), the liner notes don't try to hide that these are the 2009 remasters by the same team who did the much-praised Beatles catalogue of 09/09/09. The sound quality is fantastic - breathtaking clarity on instruments - the piano and guitars on ""Lady Madonna"", the jet screeching in at the opening of ""Back In The U.S.S.R"", the brass on ""All You Need Is Love"", Billy Preston's superb keyboard work on ""Let It Be"", the wonderfully loose live feel of ""Don't Let Me Down"" (best B-side ever?) - and so on.

CONTENT:
But what impresses most is the actual listen itself. Even now, it's truly shocking to hear just how accomplished The Beatles became during this ludicrously productive period. And diversity of writers crept in too. There's the 4 Harrison gems ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Old Brown Shoe"" and the magical double of ""Something"" and ""Here Comes The Sun"", while Ringo gets the witty ""Octopus's Garden"". Leaving the rest as Lennon-McCartney originals. And what an embarrassment of riches they are...

7"" perfection comes twice - ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" b/w ""Penny Lane"" and arguably the greatest single ever released - ""Hey Jude"" b/w ""Revolution"" (melodious Paul on the A with rockin' blistering John on the B). Most bands would kill a close relative to get anywhere near this level of genius. And by the time you get to the ballads at the end of Disc 2 - ""The Long And Winding Road"" and ""Across The Universe"" - adjectives begin to fail you... Were The Beatles really 'this' good - the answer is yes - and always will be.

To sum up - the sound on these new reissues is fabulous; the packaging better than the 1993 versions and each is being sold at mid-price - available in most places for less than the price of a single new album. You can't help but think that millions of people globally will take one look at these beauties on a shelf somewhere and slap them straight into their shopping baskets. And rightly so...

AOWZ87AGIR2VU,B001GFKIBE,1,-1,3,"I have had this one for thirteen years, enjoying a love/hate relationship with it. Half the cuts I can live without, and the other half is essential to every collection. To give you an idea of where my tastes lie, I have always hated the bubble gum pop prior to their drug-inspired hippie days. I have also considered them to be highly over-rated, since my tastes in progressive music leaned towards early Yes and Genesis. Many would say that the Beatles introduced art and creativity into rock, albeit with drugs as their vehicle. Yes, this is True, but so many other groups took this much further. With that in mind, this set and the stellar Abbey Road was all that I needed for many years. Then the Yellow Submarine Songtrack was released, which brought back memories of many trippy midnight movies. I consider that one to be a much better and cheaper introduction to the best of The Beatles, since it represents some of their best from late 1965 to early 1969, with only a few new songs (when it was released). So I have sufficed with just three Beatles releases up until now.

Well, I got to wondering today on how much it would cost to add some more good Beatles songs to my collection. For my tastes, this was surprisingly affordable. This also led me to identify why I have the love/hate relationship with this collection, which also had put me off with the Beatles in general for all these years. All of my own favorite cuts are not represented enough here, and too many of the overplayed and annoying cuts are on this one. I have finally decided to complete my Beatles collection of favorites and donate this puppy to my girlfriend.

So if your tastes run similar to mine, here is what I recommend in chronological order. Start off with Past Masters Volume 2 (which contains all of the 1965-1970 non-album singles), then Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine Songtrack, The White Album, and Abbey Road. I will throw in Let It Be just for the sake of completion.  I plan to make my own compilation for my car and leave all of my hated cuts off. Judging from most of the reviews, all Beatles fans need to do the same, since no one compilation can satisfy anyone. They put out a lot of good stuff, but due to their willingness to experiment, they could never satisfy everyone. A lot of their later stuff even makes me cringe, but a lot of it still stands the test of time forty years later.

If you want a good compilation to start with, try the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, but not this one.","I have had this one for thirteen years , enjoying a love / hate relationship with it .

A1X93ES4DITTWK,B001GH1ZQE,1,-1,3,"Amy has a very strong and distinctive voice, which is refreshing to hear since most of the female artists who are out today sound the same to me.

Yes, it's ""different"" than what's already out there *today*, yet it sounds the same as the music that came out during the 60s. Not that that's a bad thing, the CD is good, but I wasn't blown away by it. Amy should develop her own signature style to incorporate into the genres she likes. If she had her own style, people wouldn't compare her to Lauryn Hill and Billie Holiday. In conclusion, good CD, different than the norm, better than Xtina's album, but nothing NEW either.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B001I884I8,1,-1,3,"For Pink, this past year has really been a tough year for her. After her saddened divorce with her skateboarder husband, she still has shown she has a great face in appeal with her music. That showed well with So What, and the ironic appeal of having her ex in the viudeo which was in good spirits. As for her latest single from Funhouse, Sober delivers a deeper and more dormid appeal that stands out in her feelings from her divorce. The song isn't bad, and brings in a mood that shows her feelings and depths of her voice fairly. while the song isn't bad, it isn't Pink's best song that shines, where as the case with her earlier songs like Stupid Girls and the deep Family Portrait showed. Honestly though, it is much better than what Britney Spears has delivered after her marriage died. I just hope for Pink though, that her next song clicks much more with listeners.

A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B001IQMCZQ,1,-1,3,"I fell in love with J-Hud's voice while she was a contestant on American Idol.  She along with Fantasia & Latoya London made up the so-called ""Three Divas"" - they are all talented young women and of the three I felt that Jen was the most talented BUT that Fantasia had an undeniable ""it"" factor while in comparison Jen needed more seasoning as a performer.  It sure would've been fun to see a Fantasia vs J-Hud finale but it's water under the bridge at this point since both a living their dreams now.

I've had to sit with this album for a while and give the songs a chance to ""marinate"" before giving my opinion.  As debuts go I think it's ok - the problem for Jen is that fans have heard her and gotten to fall in love with her voice before this album was released and were expecting magic but the songs selected didn't really help her cross over to the wider pop chart audience.

I think that once again, Clive Davis was trying to throw a little bit of everything at the listening audience to see which tracks would ""hit"", Jen's powerful voice was toned down on a lot of the tracks and some of the tracks seem like throw-aways - not designed to show those who are unfamiliar with Jen exactly who she is as an artist. I didn't mind that a couple of the tracks are gospel oriented because if Aretha Franklin can successfully give us r&b, pop & gospel so can this young woman!

My favorite tracks are:

GIVING MYSELF - Jen's restrained vocals power this track, there is an alternate sweetness & power to her voice that makes this track interesting

SPOTLIGHT - catchy song

YOU PULLED ME THROUGH - great power ballad

IF THIS ISN'T LOVE - a synth-pop sounding track that's taken some time to grow on me

I'M HIS ONLY WOMAN f/ Fantasia - love the pairing of their voices, both unique and distinctive

CAN'T STOP THE RAIN - melodic track with great lyrics

JESUS PROMISED ME A HOME OVER THERE - touching

Another song of note is WHAT'S WRONG (GO AWAY) - this song could've been a great duet IF a real male singer had been paired with Jen (someone like Anthony Hamilton or Tyrese).  This is an example of trying to pair her with someone who is ""hot at the moment"" like T-Pain whose vocals ruin this track.

Overall I'm happy that Jen was finally able to get a shot in this business and hope that with her next album, there is a thought out focus so that better singles can be selected to really showcase her as the gifted vocalist that she is.","I fell in love with J - Hud 's voice while she was a contestant on American Idol .

A1Q2GLZXL2CNJ8,B001IQMCZQ,1,-1,3,"well I really expected more from this CD in regard to collabo's.  The T-Pain is nice, the Luda is cute; pocketbook. But I wished there was a collabo with Dwele, Donnell Jones, Lloyd or even one of our more seasoned ballader's like Maxwell,Joe, Avant, Brian McKnight, etc. With Clive Davis, as executive producer, there should not have been a budget crisis  Her Dreamgirl's fame should have warranted big production credits to make the album a spotlight release.  There was enough publicity to make this a number one release.  Don't get me wrong I love Fantasia, but that the boy is mine, has been done, remember Brandy & Monica, then Whitney & Deborah Cox. Besides the arrangement didn't highlight any new technique.  You would think these CEO's could be a little more imaginative.  The song Spotlight is really the hightlight of the CD.

AJK5WHV1GW941,B001IQMCZQ,1,-1,3,"Jennifer Hudson blew moviegoers away with her movie debut, ""Dreamgirls.""  What astounded them most was her powerful alto singing voice.  Couple that with the fact that she played the role of Effie White to perfection, and never wonder why she held everyone's attention.  It also doesn't hurt that she seems to be a down-to-earth and sincere individual.  If you want to know what makes me say that, check out her blogs, home videos and interviews.  However, never mistake her for a pushover, because she can be frank.  For example, Jennifer Holiday said something smart about the fact that Hudson redid the song ""And I Am Telling You"" and Hudson gave Holiday a piece of her mind in a magazine.

 ""Spotlight"" is one of the standout songs of 2008, make no mistake about it.  The song has the Neyo signature sound (he wrote and produced the hit song) and Hudson really did a magnificent job.  As for the album, I was a disappointed with it as a whole.  There are highlights and memorable moments, but, really, they are the songs that were released to radio, mostly.  This album has its share of bland moments.  Some people will lose interest by the middle of the disc.  Jennifer's voice shines on each and every track, though.  She is an effortless talent and she makes that obvious to anyone who observes her.  Fantasia, T-Pain and Ludacris all make guest appearances.  I was gleaming with excitement when I heard Hudson and Fantasia singing together.  What a nice move!  The song, ""I'm His Only Woman"" mimics ""The Boy is Mine"" by Brandy and Monica and ""Same Script, Different Cast"" by Whitney Houston and Deborah Cox because all three songs feature two R&B singers and in each song the women are fighting over men.  It's a concept that is being recycled, but, personally, I am entertained by it.  The ladies do a great job together and it is one of the better songs on the album.  ""We Gon' Fight"" is another standout.  The hook and beat are nice; you'll be replaying this one if you invest in this album.  ""Pocketbook"" features Ludacris.  The two of them sound so nice together.  This song uses what made Doug E. Fresh famous, a technique called beatboxing.  I'm glad she stepped outside of her box and did this because it is a good song, namely the chorus.

 Jennifer Hudson's voice is sometimes way too strong for R&B.  Her niche would no doubt be gospel music.  However, a lot of her songs are good.  I granted this album 3.5 stars because it is pretty enjoyable, but it is not something I will be listening to on a frequent basis.

AJK5WHV1GW941,B001KP2E4Y,1,-1,3,"Although I am not traditionally a fanatic of rock music, I love quite a few of Lenny Kravitz's songs, ""It Ain't over `Til It's Over"" being my favorite.  I have seen many of his videos and seen him perform on award shows a few times.  I like his style.  He never conformed; he always exudes uniqueness and it just shines through. His 2008 release, ""It Is Time For A Love Revolution"" is a decent offering.  His best musical companion (the guitar) comes along for the ride; it's included in almost every song.  Vocally, he is just as good as he was on previous releases, ""Mama Said"" and ""5"".  His lyrics are decent on this album, but they don't contend with his best.  This album contains mostly mid-tempo and up-beat numbers.

 ""Bring It On"", ""I Love the Rain"" and ""Dancin' `Til Dawn"" all have decent guitar and percussion arrangements, along with great vocal delivery and alright lyrics.  ""Good Morning"" and ""Back in Vietnam"" are also worth listening to.  ""Good Morning"" has a pretty impressive melody and instrumental arrangement.  Kravitz's harmony is nice, too.  Out of all the songs on this album, I was most impressed by ""This Moment Is All There Is"" and ""Will You Marry Me?""  Love/marriage songs are usually ballads or slower songs, but Kravitz, like he always does, tries something different and gives his listener an upbeat love song.  I enjoyed it!  ""This Moment Is All There Is"" is the only ballad on the album, but it stands out because of that fact, and because it is lyrically very nice.  This is also the only song that doesn't include guitar and it's a nice change.

 Potential buyers, this is an average album. If you decide to pick it up, you'll most likely benefit in some way.  However, if you decide against it, your music collection won't miss it that much. 3 stars.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B001KQGE08,1,-1,3,"Back in the late 90's, we've seen a huge Latin explosion in the music industry. While there have been acts that have been more about hyppe, and less of heart and soul like Jennifer Lopez, who hasn't really been a credible singer lately, or Ricky Martin, who hasn't really made an English pop album in years who just made everyone say they were Livin' La Vida Loca so much, others made it because of their family bonds. That was the case with Enrique Iglesias. His family has had a enormous career with singing because of the triumphs of his father Julio, and his sibling Julio Iglesias Jr., who has a moderate career in English a few years ago. But, it is hard to believe that it has been nearly 10 years, and Enrique has been the last Latin crossoverof the 90's act standing today. Now, his English music career is celebrated with a new hits collection.

Enrique Iglesias 2008 Greatest Hits, is a single disc reflection of his biggest ballads and seducing women to dance, that spans his 1st decade of success. The collection is noble, and a simple reintroduction to what he has brought to the table. The songs have all been remastered well, and include his boldest songs. All the hits are here from his seductive dance smashes like Bailamos and Rhythm Divine, to his intimate ballads such as Hero and the overlooked and seductive Could I Have This Kiss Forever with Whitney Houston. There are a few new songs here that really lack a bit of chemistry though, that miss the mark by a longshot including Away with Sean Garrett, and Takin' back My Love with Ciara, which feels like it is lacking soul and heart. That is something you haven't yet heard from Enrique, and that makes the new songs feel more like a turnoff than a starter for love and games in bed.

Still, despite those new tracks which feel more like a drag than seductive starters, Enrique Iglesias Greatest Hits isn't a bad buy for hard core fans, but mostly could've had a bit more for those who haven't yet heard any of his standards at all. While it isn't a bad purchase, I just was honestly hoping for a bit more to say that the rhythm was more divine to.

While there have been acts that have been more about hyppe , and less of heart and soul like Jennifer Lopez , who has n't really been a credible singer lately , or Ricky Martin , who has n't really made an English pop album in years who just made everyone say they were Livin ' La Vida Loca so much , others made it because of their family bonds . His family has had a enormous career with singing because of the triumphs of his father Julio , and his sibling Julio Iglesias Jr. , who has a moderate career in English a few years ago .

At first I'm not sure I liked this song that much. Even when I got the album it wasn't something I played over and over. In fact, I barely noticed it until the video came out. And for a while, that made me interested in the song.

The beat is pretty original compared to what's booming through our stereos on U.S. radio, and although the lyrics are a standard affair, this song holds up.

Beyonc co-wrote it with Wayne Wilkins, Rico Love & James Scheffer.

In my opinion, it doesn't compare to the other singles that have been released (save for the average ""Diva"") but like I said, it's not bad and is somewhat far from fodder.

3 stars

While I wasn't too thrilled about their last single Gotta Be Somebody, their latest single fairs a little better from the album Dark horse. If Today Was Your Last Day, the second single from that album brings in a more darker and meaningful message about living your life, and not forgetting your things for others. The song isn't a bad song, but not really anything that felt like it drove completely that sounded different from what we've heard from Nickelback before. I hope their next single feels like it is a bit more driven from the heart.

A1143SNKOV0ZIT,B001LR80ZS,1,-1,3,"To be honest, I really wasn't thrilled with this album after the first listen.  However, I always post my reviews after the third or fourth listen.  I think you must give an album a chance before posting your review.  Now I can honestly say that I think this is a good album...not her best work, but good...the songs grew on me.  Brandy has gone back to her previous sound; which is working with long time producer Rodney Jerkins.  The album reminds me of ""Full Moon"" and ""Never Say Never"".  Aphrodisiac was a good album also, but it was a different sound for Brandy.  I thought that Brandy and Timberland didn't make a good combination.  One thing I can say about Aphrodisiac is that I think it was Brandy's best album vocally.  Some producers and artists are meant to make great music together and also make up a dynamic team.  There's Janet Jackson and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis; Jermaine Dupri & Lil Bow Wow, Usher & Mariah Carey; Eve & Swizz Beats; Rich Harrison & Amerie; Aaliyah & Timberland; Ciara & Jazze Pha; Monica & Dallas Austin, and Toni Braxton & Babyface.  Just like those mentioned, there's Brandy & Rodney Jerkins.

My favorite tracks are:
The Definition
Warm It Up
Long Distance
Shattered Hear
True
Torn Down

Because this album received little or no promotion, it only sold 73,000 the first week.  Brandy is a veteran in the music business and I think she doesn't get the recognition she deserves.  I've seen on one review where she is being compared to Beyonce.  Then again, every female artist is now being compared to Beyonce. Why???  Beyonce is a great entertainer and she dazzles on stage, but she's not the first and she's won't be the last.  Where Beyonce is now, Brandy has been there and have done a whole lot more.  Not hating on Beyonce, just think she's overrated.

A1S2IY37JU93XS,B001LR80ZS,1,-1,3,"Brandy's last album, Afrodisiac--while not a commercial success--was a masterpiece in my eyes. Her voice was full of pure soul and grit that only comes from heartbreak and the dark Timbaland productions were a perfect canvas for the woman's chilling, eerie, and euphoric harmonies. Not only was it one of the best albums of the year, but it remains on my list of favorite R&B albums of all time. Foolishly, I expected Human to be a catastrophic release that rivaled her previous effort. It could never compare. It is not a bad album by any means, but it's a generally simple album. It is clear that Brandy has decided to veer in the more ""pop"" direction after her ""urban"" album did not fare well on Billboard. This creates some great songs, but the album tends to get a bit formulaic at times; I can only handle so many overly joyous synth-pop songs with a suffocating amount of layers (""The Definition,"" ""Warm It Up (With Love),"" etc.) Quite a few of the songs simply sound the same, frankly. ""Human"" is a clich&eacute; ""I'm-just-like-you"" type of song that should've been left off and replaced in favor of better songs that were irresponsibly left off of this set (""After the Flood,"" among others) and ""Long Distance"" feels like the writers were just trying too hard to write a universal super-hit. Still, Human has plenty of satisfying songs, including the grand first single, ""Right Here (Departed)."" ""Shattered Heart"" is a beautifully ominous track with a gentle broken-hearted chorus. ""True"" is a breath of relief from some of the overly complicated material here: a simple and genuine ballad saturated with heartbreak. ""A Capella (Something's Missing)"" is the song I've always wanted Brandy to record. Her harmonies are pretty much unrivaled by anyone in the R&B industry and I'm glad they are shown in their naked form. Co-written by Brandy and Natasha Bedingfield, ""Fall"" is a dramatic, piano-laden mid-tempo full of energy. The best track here, though, is the sweet ""1st and Love"" with its stomping and waling chorus. While this is not the album I was expecting--and it does have several weak moments of overly glossy pop--it is still a nice album from Brandy.","Brandy 's last album , Afrodisiac -- while not a commercial success -- was a masterpiece in my eyes .

But there is no point in over-analysing a band called 'Faster Pussycat' - they're a bit of fun, don't take themselves seriously. They're fun while they're on, and that's more or less it.

While acts like Warrant , Extreme and Winger champion their technical virtuoso , these guys play with a carefree , reckless abandon ; much like Mudhoney . But there is no point in over - analysing a band called ' Faster Pussycat ' - they 're a bit of fun , do n't take themselves seriously . They 're fun while they 're on , and that 's more or less it .

Playing in a pretty much to  be expected AOR style this disc is blessed by a number of factors. Firstly you sort of know what you are getting and Stanleys' smooth and familiar vox are preaching to the converted here. With little surprise factor to trouble them listeners are free to just let these appropriately simple rock numbers wash over them. Tune after tune here politely does its job, as unambitious as that job may be. And it's hard to argue with the toe tapping results of Wake Up Screaming, Where Angels Dare or nice songcraft such as the bridge of Bulletproof (with non-spectacular solo courtesy of John 5).

Production by the man himself is warm, non abrasive and in character with the tunes and allows things to breath. The booklet comes with a couple of photos and fully lyrics and each track has individual credits. Of course there are no huge surprises in the lyrics but they are infused with Stanleys irrepressible joy at life and are quite life affirming in a simple and honest manner.

For all it's easy smile and simple intentions this is not a poor album, but it is in many ways the equivalent of fairly floss. Fun and diverting for a time but ultimately lacking in the `meat on the bone' department required to satisfy any long term hunger.

Approach it for what it is and you'll enjoy it but keep your perspective working.","Paul Stanley has put out a solo album in 2006 and it 's .... not all bad news .

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B001NCO758,1,-1,3,"For his first solo album since 1978's self-titled ""Paul Stanley,"" this Kiss frontman has produced a batch of polished rock songs that reach back to mainstream '90s arena acts, with the backing of modern players (guitarist Corky James, drummer Victor Indrizzo, and keyboardist Harry Sommerdahl) who've powered mainstream hits for Avril Lavigne, Macy Gray and Carrie Underwood. That latter connection, via Carrie Underwood to American Idol, isn't one to miss as these overwrought power ballads could easily pad one of AI's rockers' debut albums.

Kiss fans will notice that Stanley's written with several of his early collaborators, including Desmond Child and Holly Knight, but he's also brought in Andreas Carlsson, who's worked with Bon Jovi, and Marti Frederiksen, who's penned songs for country crossover diva Faith Hill. Stanley set out to ""sing about my life because my life is not that different than anybody else's,"" and the results are human-scale songs that skip the rock-god grandeur of Kiss. Such songs turn out to be substantially more pedestrian than the best work of Kiss.

The band has studio chops (that is, this isn't the sort of organic band effort one would expect from Kiss), and Stanley's in good voice. His production adds a touch of oomph, but not enough to give this any sort of sweaty rock band rampage, and the album's power ballads, ""Second to None"" and ""Loving You Without You Now"" have neither the story or heart of ""Beth.""

AGQEUU21DLZBH,B001NCO758,1,-1,3,"Paul Stanley is a hero of mine. He and Mr. Simmons wrote the sountrack to my childhood. I always loved his voice and appreciated the fact that he showed some class, unlike Gene who stamps his name on anything that can make a buck. But i must admit to being a bit disappointed at this cd. Aside from the fact that he used co-writers on every track, i am very unimpressed with the quality of some songs here. Almost as if it were a connect the dots pop record. The guitars are a bit in the background and some of the cheesy 80's style keyboards are too much for my taste. A few tracks have potential, but overall an average cd that took a very long time to come out.

The fact that he had years to put this together and he had no contractual obligation to put out anything got me excited. I may have expected too much, but i don't believe so. All i wanted was a nice rock record with balls. Maybe in the vein of some of the 80s (Animalize) style Kiss records that were very good. And i do understand that Paul is in his 50's now and his musical taste is a bit different at the moment. I will grant him that. But this album is very cliched lyrically and the music is quite light. The most surprising thing is that with all the additional writers it is very generic. Thats what bothers me the most. Paul is a great songwriter in his own right, and this album does not let him shine. But this is what he wanted. Trying to cater to the 40+ age group with a light AOR style cd.

Kiss fans will buy this so im sure it will sell ok. And it is still better than Genes crap as*hole cd. Just wish it was a bit heavier.","Paul Stanley is a hero of mine .

A246BU2DG7JC8I,B001NCO758,-1,1,4,"Ok, on first listen, I was less than enthused... the songs seemed unimaginative and formulaic and the vocals just seemed... like a redo of many things on Psycho Circus and COS... I was never all that impressed with Live To Win, the song.  I really didn't like Lift much better.... though I have since come to realize that I just don't care as much for the chorus (which backs down in energy rather than go forward) and the verse is fine.  Before I go on saying generally negative things... this CD has been STUCK in my player repeating since I got it...  and I do find with each listen I find more and more I like and I find I don't dislike things I originally disliked as much.  So for me to claim I dislike the album would be very inaccurate.  For one, this album is of course going to be compared to the '78 solo and that isn't exactly fair and you have to acknowledge how that comparison is going to hurt the ability to truly deeply LOVE this album in the same way.  We are talking nearly 30 years ago to affect the sound and style and one has 30 years of greatness dug into my heart.  Live to Win, to me, doesnt have the truly GREAT songs that you found on the 78 solo... or, more precisely, not enough of them.  Similarly, I didn't think anything was weak on the '78 solo and on Live To Win, I the song Second to None pretty much sucks (I hate the chorus lyrics) and is sort of a rehash of other things already on the album.  Get rid of that and add another in the vein of Bulletproof and it would have gone a long way to making this a better album.  Hell, 5 more solid songs would help as it is a bit short for an artist that you just know is more productive than this.  The other thing, I really think Paul SHOULDNT write with so many other people as I swear they do more to sterilize his work than help it... it just adds to the nature of being formula driven.  There are a few times where you feel ""ok, here is the part in the song where there would be a bridge prior to the solo section..."" and sure enough, there is one... and it seems more forced to be there than it feels to be a real natural progression for the song.  I cant recall the example song for this, but I know there are at least 2 songs that illustrate this and you should find it obvious when you listen to them.  Anyway... as I said, its an album that I think will at first come across to many as good, but not as good as it should be... but, then if you stick with it, it actually grows on you rather than away from you... so that is a good thing.  Had I rated it right after I first got it, I would have given it a B-... now, its a solid B moving towards B+ (probably Second to None keeping it from hitting the B+... I really hate that chorus).  I originally disliked Wake Up Screaming and its ""911"" lyrics... which I thought were pretty weak (there is alot of cheese in the lyrics album wide, but Paul can usually pull of cheesy lyrics rather well)... but the more I spin it the more that song just sticks well without the lyrics ruining it.  Bulletproof is the gem of the album... with Where Angels Dare being a very close second, for me.  I also really like Loving You Without You Now... it just sounds nice and in this case I actually enjoy the lyrics and think they are pretty neatly crafted.  Listening to this album, I actually think alot of the songs are similar in style and production to the Paul Psycho Circus songs which I guess helps me feel a little better about the Psycho Circus songs (an album that has generally been tainted in my mind to the point where I never listen to it... because it feels like a KISS album that KISS didn't play much on and only sang on).  Some of that holds True with this album... just like with Gene's you really wonder with all the names and credits... just HOW MUCH did Paul actually do?  In Gene's case, I suspect he did as little as he had to... and likely didn't play much of the bass even.  With Paul, I do believe he did the guitar... but the songs aren't all that full of guitar and so many others are creditted on guitar, so it does make you wonder.  Still, I hear alot of traditional KISS Paulismns in the rhythm to help me feel at ease here.  This is probably why I like Where Angels Dare so much... there are some very familiar sounds from the past layered in that song.  So, my mind tends to think Paul plays quite a bit of the guitar but uses the guest players to really fill it in and provide some modern touches in lead and lead noodling that goes on.

By the way, this is not nearly as weak as a Bon Jovi album, though it does have that overerly formulaic (at times) feel to it that would be a fair comparison.... especially in the more ballady songs.  Bon Jovi has been virtually nothing but Puss-Rock from after Slippery When Wet and on.  Paul doesnt deserve negative comparison to Bon Jovi... and comparing him to them actually is like giving BJ some kudos.

I still think this album is a must for KISS fans... and really isn't a waste of money for anyone (that would be Gene's solo album).  If all you have heard is Lift or Live to Win and felt only ""ho hum"" about them, rest assured, there are still better songs awaiting on the album.  Another thing about this CD, is at first, I think most of the songs will seem very similar to each other... but as it sinks in with repetition, the differences shine through more and that contributes to it being a ""grower"" album.

I am totally looking forward to seeing Paul live on this tour... it should be great.  I hear he is playing Live to Win, Lift, Everytime I see You Around, and Bulletproof on the tour... I understand Live to Win and I think Bulletproof is a great song... but the other two are among my least favorite on the album... I wish he'd change that up.","Ok , on first listen , I was less than enthused ... the songs seemed unimaginative and formulaic and the vocals just seemed ... like a redo of many things on Psycho Circus and COS ...

With Paul , I do believe he did the guitar ... but the songs are n't all that full of guitar and so many others are creditted on guitar , so it does make you wonder . Still , I hear alot of traditional KISS Paulismns in the rhythm to help me feel at ease here . This is probably why I like Where Angels Dare so much ... there are some very familiar sounds from the past layered in that song . So , my mind tends to think Paul plays quite a bit of the guitar but uses the guest players to really fill it in and provide some modern touches in lead and lead noodling that goes on . By the way , this is not nearly as weak as a Bon Jovi album , though it does have that overerly formulaic ( at times ) feel to it that would be a fair comparison .... especially in the more ballady songs . Bon Jovi has been virtually nothing but Puss - Rock from after Slippery When Wet and on . Paul does nt deserve negative comparison to Bon Jovi ... and comparing him to them actually is like giving BJ some kudos . I still think this album is a must for KISS fans ... and really is n't a waste of money for anyone ( that would be Gene 's solo album ) . If all you have heard is Lift or Live to Win and felt only "" ho hum "" about them , rest assured , there are still better songs awaiting on the album . Another thing about this CD , is at first , I think most of the songs will seem very similar to each other ... but as it sinks in with repetition , the differences shine through more and that contributes to it being a "" grower "" album . I am totally looking forward to seeing Paul live on this tour ... it should be great . I hear he is playing Live to Win , Lift , Everytime I see You Around , and Bulletproof on the tour ... I understand Live to Win and I think Bulletproof is a great song ... but the other two are among my least favorite on the album ... I wish he 'd change that up ."

AYSLSU7966FWE,B001NCR4OO,-1,1,4,"Wow, it's been over 4 years since Mr. Zombie has graced us with an album. Let me start by saying that this album is not as bad or as weird as some people are saying it is. I've heard a lot of people saying things along the lines of this not sounding like Rob Zombie at all, or that it's not heavy, or that it sounds weird. Not True. Okay, if this album had come after ""Hellbilly Deluxe"", I'd probably be saying the same thing. But after ""The Sinister Urge"" was released, I knew he was headed in a different direction, and this album is not much different than that one. In fact, I'd say this album is more like Zombie's past works than the stuff that was heard on the ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" soundtrack or even the new songs from his greatest hits album that was released a couple years ago.

""Sawdust In The Blood"" is merely the album's intro, with pounding drums and creepy piano...sounds like the opening credits of a horror film. ""American Witch"" is a great song. It has typical heavy Zombie guitar and could pass for something from ""Sinister Urge."" The next song, ""Foxy Foxy"" is the album's first single. It's not as heavy or angry, it sounds more like something you'd hear on one of Rob's remix albums. ""The Scorpion Sleeps"" is the only song on the album where I hear the influence of Rob's new guitarist, John 5. This guy played guitar for Marilyn Manson, and this track has a similar feel to past Manson songs like ""Rock Is Dead"" or ""Disposable Teens."" Then there's ""Let It All Bleed Out"" which may be the heaviest on the album, and could probably pass for something from ""Hellbilly Deluxe"". Songs like ""Death Of It All"" has something I've never heard in a Zombie song before...acoustic guitar. It's a decent song and I'm glad to see Rob is exploring new territory. ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""Lords Of Salem"" are your typical Zombie crunchers, both very good. I enjoyed every song on this album. My only complaint is that there isn't much new music...there's only 11 tracks, and since 2 of them are fillers, it's more like 9 new songs.

Bottom line: this album isn't as different or as bad as everyone has claimed. If you're a big Zombie fan, don't dismiss it based on what others have said or even on the album's first single. Give it a listen, I bet you'll like it.","Wow , it 's been over 4 years since Mr. Zombie has graced us with an album .

A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ,B001NCR4OO,1,-1,3,"Review no. 66. I wasn't exactly sure, but this looks to be Rob's fourth solo effort. Maybe not his best work, but still very decent. Produced by Scott Humphrey (Metallica, The Cult, Triumph, Crue) so I thought at least the production and the pace of 'Educated Horses' were pretty happening. Tracks that I was most impressed with were the ass-kicking ""American Witch"", ""17 Year Locust"", ""Scorpion Sleeps"", ""Death Of It All"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" (name of his latest movie-a must see). I've recently seen Rob Zombie on this very tour and it appears that he had scaled his live shows down a bit, but they're JUST as effective. Plain and simple, not a bad metal release. A should-have.","Review no . 66 . I was n't exactly sure , but this looks to be Rob 's fourth solo effort . Maybe not his best work , but still very decent .

A26NLSTT75FMJM,B001NCUWMU,-1,1,4,"...nut some tracks are problems. For instance, how Passing the Time managed to sneak on board in the place of As You Said is insane. World of Pain is good, but slightly dated. On the other hand, Dance the Night Away isn't and also deserves (but doesn't get) a spot. Doing That Scrapyard Thing and What a Bringdown are simply throwaways. In their place, imagine Outside Woman Blues and the studio version of Spoonful.

Then, look at disc two. Though it's True that Spoonful is awesome live, the studio version is much better. Toad, on the other hand, simply drags... unlike it's studio counterpart, which is amazing. And N.S.U. is just plain endless.

Still, it does cover the basics - I Feel Free, N.S.U., Sweet Wine, Sunshine of Your Love, Tales of Brave Ulyssess, SWLABR, White Room, Politician, Crossroads, Anyone for Tennis and Badge, to be exact. And Wrapping Paper was wisely left off.

Though I feel that you'd be better suited with the one-disc Best of Cream, if you want to hear them live this is a good place to start.","... nut some tracks are problems .

A2RB6IQQN6BTK,B001NDLQTW,-1,1,4,Arrived as expected,
AJK5WHV1GW941,B001NDLQTW,1,-1,3,"Jamie Foxx is such a talented fellow; he acts, plays the piano, sings, and makes you laugh.  Although he started his career as a comedian, he was always serious and passionate about singing.  I appreciate anyone who is serious about their craft, but I think he sounds very whiny when he sings.  His voice never appealed to me much, but I tolerate it because I like him and he's extremely popular.  He does have a decent voice and good vocal control, but the actual sound of his singing voice is what I don't care for.

 ""Intuition"" is his third musical installment.  As with his second LP, ""Unpredictable"", there are a heap amount of guest appearances, but that's fine because in this instance, that actually helped improve the album.  ""Just Like Me"" is the first single and it features the ubiquitous T.I.  These two men do a fine job together.  All of the songs that were released, I either don't like them, or they took awhile to get into and ""Just Like Me"" is no exception.  ""Blame It"" is a bit more catchy than the aforementioned track, but both tracks are highlights.  The video for ""Blame It"" features lots of celebrities like Samuel L. Jackson and Forest Whitiker.  This song is simply saying that whatever happens tonight at the club, blame it on the alcohol.  Obviously, he is talking about having a one night stand more so than anything else.  ""Slow"" is one of the ballads found here.  Sexy is the tone of this song because of the fashion in which it is sung and the production.  ""She Got Her Own"" is one of the worse songs I have heard in a long time.  Though this song features the incredible Neyo and the wonderful Fabolous, it is annoying and Neyo should have not continued creating songs that have the same gist as ""Miss Independent"" because we got the point.

  This is a cool album for the moment, but by no means is it timeless or a classic.  After 2009, you'll probably be ready to deep six it, honestly.

A3PCTD8QM1BIXI,B001NDLQTW,1,-1,3,"Jamie Foxx is one of the few actors to be able a successful transition from comedy & film to the music industry.  When his sophomore CD Unpredictable, was released back in 2005 it became evident that Foxx would be a force in the ever dying field of soul music.  Following up the soulful, ballad heavy Unpredictable, wouldn't be an easy task, however Foxx has provided a quality release with Intitution.

1.  Just Like Me - The lead single feat. T.I. was originally written for Usher's Here I Stand project; however Jamie puts his own soulful spin on the song which could serve as a sequel to his massive hit Unpredictable.

2.  I Don't Need It - I wasn't too impressed with this song as it was a bit poppish for my tastes and it seems better suited for Justin Timberlake.

3.  Number 1 (Get Dumb) feat. Lil Wayne - At first listen, I found this song to be a bit annoying but it's starting to grow on me.

4.  Digital Girl feat. Kanye West & The-Dream - Now this is what I'm talking about when it comes to up-tempo material. Kanye delivers an energetic freestyle while The-Dream provides a soulful hook. I can easily see myself doing the two- step to this one in the club.

5.  Blame It feat. T-Pain - Even though I'm sick of the voice-coder, Jamie does a decent job with this song. He has more in common with the originator Roger Troutman, than the biter T-Pain (who needs to take a break).

6.  She Got Her Own feat. Ne-Yo & Fabolous - I've been feeling this song I first heard it back in September.  The only thing new on the song it some added vocals from Jamie & Ne-Yo. However I do wish, Jamie would`ve  remixed the song with a different with an old school sample of say Switch's I Wanna Be Closer or El Debarge's Love Always.

7.  Intuition Interlude - I was waiting for Jamie to slow it down, and the first hint of a ballad is an interlude, but Jamie easily more than makes up for the length of the song with his delivery of the material.

8.  I Don't Know- Even though, I was hoping for a slow jam after the previous track, this is still a good song and once again Jamie delivers top notch vocals. Given the title and message in the song I was surprised; Jamie didn't sample The Pharcyde's classic's song.

9.  Weekend Lover - Finally we get a slow jam from Mr. Foxx, and it was more than worth the wait. I can easily see this being a big concert song for Jamie, where he pulls a lady from the audience and serenades her.

10.  Why - Another song on the poppy side, even though it's a ballad it reminded me too much of an Akon song.

11.  Freak' in  Me feat. Marsha Ambrious - Jamie redeems himself with the sensual slow jam , that's a guaranteed baby maker. With this song alone, Jamie makes for any sub-par material on the CD.

12.  Slow- Jamie has always said Prince was a big influence of his, and it's evident here with this slow jam. I don't know why but this song reminded me of The Beautiful Ones.

13.  Rainman - Another winning ballad, where Mr. Foxx showcases his voice.  It's amazing how a singer like Foxx can sing anything and make it sound good.

14.  Overdose - After seducing the ladies with some sexy slow jams, Jamie gives us a sentimental ballad, expressing his True feeling for his lady love.

15.  Love Bring Change - The CD closes out with another sentimental ballad, that reminds me of a seventies Stevie Wonder. I can already see this being a piano song @ Jamie's live show.

A2ASAU4Z0JJH2R,B001OTLS16,-1,1,4,"For those of you who have read my previous reviews of Mushroomhead, you'd see that this is the first time I've awarded an album of theirs less than five stars. Four out of five is still very respectable, and if a half star were possible, I'd give it 4.5, but let me explain my position.

This is a very solid album if it weren't for a few tracks and few hiccups here and there. The album starts out with ""Come oN"", which is also their first released single, and ironically, the worst track on the album. The music is fair though a tad predictable, but that's not where it falls short. Here is an (edited) snippet of lyrics;

Come on
Do you really wanna **** with me?
Come on

MH's lyrics have traditionally been poignant and meaningful so I question their motivation to write a top-40 sounding song that is graphic just to be graphic. Being a fan of Mudvayne and Korn, I'm not one to take offense to controversial lyrics so long as they're artistic in nature and expression. Lyrics like those I pointed out are entirely A-typical of anything they've ever written in the past.

My second complaint is with the guitar solos sprinkled throughout the album. They sound out of place and apologetic as if the band is asking permission to place them where they did.

But enough with the bad. Here are the high points: Beginning with ""I'll Be HerE"", the album kicks into high-gear and starts to sound like the Mushroomhead we have grown to love. I'll never fault a band for trying something new, and while this album has a definitive MH sound, it is a broad departure from their first three albums. Some are going to criticize this experiment, but it's still a very solid release.

When a band releases their third or fourth album, one of two things usually happens. 1.) They begin to talk down to the average masses in order to spruce up their album sales or 2.) They grow up and begin writing more mature material. Mushroomhead actually did a bit of both on ""Beautiful Stories"". I'm disappointed that some of the tracks sound like radio ""singles"", but overall, the music has grown while retaining the elements that made them a stand-out act in the first place.

Some of my favorites include ""Burn The BridgE"", ""The Feel"", ""Harvest The GardeN"" and ""Do I Know You?"" If you've liked MH in the past, you'll like ""Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children"". If you haven't enjoyed their previous works, you won't like this one either.

A29AQW33B8ILM1,B001OTLS16,1,-1,3,"When I first heard Mushroomhead XIII they were a metal group with a touch of melody for good measure. Two discs later, they are a melodic group with a touch of metal thrown in for good measure. There may not be three part harmonies and such going, but the sound is much crisper and the thrash is gone and the screaming is considerably less. Not to mention they released a single, ""Come On"" that most old school Shroomheads despise, because of what a blatant attempt it is at mainstream success.

 For me personally, I enjoy the song. In fact I enjoy a little over half their new cd. Songs like ""Slaughterhouse Road"", ""Build The Bridge"", and ""Harvest The Garden"" do get the blood pumping a bit. Maybe not like ""Sun Doesn't Rise"", ""12 Hundred"", or ""Kill Tomorrow"", but they are still solid tracks. For what this cd does right though, it almost does as much wrong. The last half of the cd is plagued by songs like ""Holes In The Void"" or ""Do I Know You"" that lack any kind of redeeming quality or atmosphere to draw you in. ""The Harm You Do"" feels bland, while ""The Feel"" suffers from more ridiculous lyrics than those of the lead off single ""Come On"".

In closing, I have no problem really with Mushroomhead's transition to a more mainstream sound, though I'm sure alot of the fans of their material up through XIII will/do. My issue is that the last two cds suffer from terrible inconsistency, making them just average cd. The potential is still there, which is apparent on the tracks I listed earlier and a few others. I just wish the group took full advantage, much like they did on XIII.","When I first heard Mushroomhead XIII they were a metal group with a touch of melody for good measure .

A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B001QP9FWC,1,-1,3,"Alanis repeats the same mistake each time an album others is out. She tries to say too much in too little time. On her last effort, 17 songs had thousands of words, but it's ok then cos some of the songs were really amazing and feature a more matured production, featuring a diverse Indian sound, electronica, and dance/rock.

On Under Rug Swept, the decision to release Hands Clean as the first single still goes to show how much she intends to reach the masses with a rather radio-friendly track. Elsewhere on the album, 21 Things might sound like a nice edgy guitar-rock track, reminiscent of her Pill days. On Narcissus, Alanis works her voice into a melancholic winner and brings out the emotional depth in the song. The danger of Alanis goin with it alone is that she oftens get into a self-obsessed mode where she waxes lyrical but often ends up deep within herself that alienates her listners. What's she trying to tell us? By the time you get through with Alanis, you'll be as vexed as our rock princess.

 the best track here must be the concluding track Upotia, that features a strip-down, nearer to acoustic sound. On this album, Alanis does score by not over-using her voice to a screech.

Not a terribly fabulous album but nonetheless True to its roots. Not likely a 15 million seller but will just do well. Overall, a controlled delivery as always but too many things to say in too little time.","Alanis repeats the same mistake each time an album others is out .

AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B001QP9FWC,1,-1,3,"I am by no means a fan of Alanis Morissette. Her voice sometimes annoys me. Lyrically her songs comes off a bit contrived and lacking any bite or edge that artists such as Ani Difranco and Tori Amos consistently churn out with each album. What compelled me to buy ""Under Rug Swept"" was not the single ""Hands Clean"" but rather the plaintive acoustic ballad ""Utopia"". I just fell in love with the song. When I heard ""Surrendering"" on MTV2 over the past weekend, my curiousity was piqued even more. I decided right then and there that I would have to buy ""Under Rug Swept"" regardless of my thoughts on Alanis as an artist. Now that I have heard the entire album. The good news is that I can't say that I regret buying the cd because there are some excellent songs. The bad news is that the first two songs are just hideous for me to listen to. I just hate Alanis' screeching vocals on ""Narcissus"", and ""21 Things I Want In a Lover"" just came off sounding stupid lyrically. I have to skip those two tracks. ""Hands Clean"" isn't too bad. It is starting to grow on me but it certainly isn't one of my favorite tracks on this album. The material starts getting stronger and better right after ""Hands Clean"" I think, particularly starting with ""So Sexy"". The lyrics were a bit off-putting for me and came off somewhat cheesy but the melodies and the musicianship were great. ""Precious Illusions"" is another favorite track of mine. This time the lyrics were good as were the hooks and melodies. I think Alanis sounds much better when she isn't singing off the top of her lungs and rather low-key (for her that is) like in songs such as ""That Particular Time"" and ""Utopia"". Those were my favorite moments. Unlike Natalie Imbruglia's ""White Lilies Island"", I still remain unconvinced regarding Alanis Morisette's talents. This album was so spotty in various places I still remained convinced that she is just a mediocre artist but it doesn't mean that I think she is terrible, just mediocre at best. Nevertheless she has gotten off on the right foot with this album for me. I just hope that she can do better material than ""21 Things I Want in a Lover"" and ""Narcissus"".","I am by no means a fan of Alanis Morissette . Her voice sometimes annoys me . Lyrically her songs comes off a bit contrived and lacking any bite or edge that artists such as Ani Difranco and Tori Amos consistently churn out with each album . What compelled me to buy "" Under Rug Swept "" was not the single "" Hands Clean "" but rather the plaintive acoustic ballad "" Utopia "" . I just fell in love with the song . When I heard "" Surrendering "" on MTV2 over the past weekend , my curiousity was piqued even more . I decided right then and there that I would have to buy "" Under Rug Swept "" regardless of my thoughts on Alanis as an artist . Now that I have heard the entire album . The good news is that I ca n't say that I regret buying the cd because there are some excellent songs . The bad news is that the first two songs are just hideous for me to listen to . I just hate Alanis ' screeching vocals on "" Narcissus "" , and "" 21 Things I Want In a Lover "" just came off sounding stupid lyrically . "" Hands Clean "" is n't too bad . It is starting to grow on me but it certainly is n't one of my favorite tracks on this album . The material starts getting stronger and better right after "" Hands Clean "" I think , particularly starting with "" So Sexy "" . The lyrics were a bit off - putting for me and came off somewhat cheesy but the melodies and the musicianship were great . "" Precious Illusions "" is another favorite track of mine . This time the lyrics were good as were the hooks and melodies . I think Alanis sounds much better when she is n't singing off the top of her lungs and rather low - key ( for her that is ) like in songs such as "" That Particular Time "" and "" Utopia "" . Those were my favorite moments . Unlike Natalie Imbruglia 's "" White Lilies Island "" , I still remain unconvinced regarding Alanis Morisette 's talents . This album was so spotty in various places I still remained convinced that she is just a mediocre artist but it does n't mean that I think she is terrible , just mediocre at best . Nevertheless she has gotten off on the right foot with this album for me . I just hope that she can do better material than "" 21 Things I Want in a Lover "" and "" Narcissus "" ."

If you want to drift off or just relax with background ""white noise"", this is a great choice. I was awake at one point to hear that the sound does vary--part of the recording sounded as if the waves were crashing on rocks, not just the sand.

I like relaxation music and white noise to calm down after a long day. I love the sound of the sea and this recording is one of the best ones I've found so far.","This is a recording of ocean waves ; no music , no birds ( that I could hear . ) If you want to drift off or just relax with background "" white noise "" , this is a great choice .

A2LI4FORV0U5JH,B001TI3IB0,-1,1,5,This is Prince's best work since Emancipation however I can't the MPLsound part of it which is his worst effort ever.

A1VFBYDCGS4OFK,B001TI3IB0,1,-1,2,"So basically some of the arguements are that Prince does diverse stuff here. Ok, fine. But there's plenty of ecletic stuff. I believe people are becoming ever more schizoid, and you have all sorts of musical combinations from artists on myspace and elsewhere, people who mix jazz with death metal, reggae with metal, no exaggeration.

But is this inspired? uh... not neccessarily. Maybe to those who lack imagination. It's great as a display of instrumental ability, but it's otherwise cold.","So basically some of the arguements are that Prince does diverse stuff here . Ok , fine .

A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B001TI3IB0,1,-1,3,"""LotusFlow3r"" is easily Prince's best album since 1997's ""The Truth"" (aka Disc 4 of ""Crystal Ball""), and possibly since 1995's ""The Gold Experience."" It has a great overall flow and sounds like a complete album, unlike hodgepodges such as ""Planet Earth,"" ""3121,"" and ""Musicology.""  The focus is on cohesive pop and rock songs, without the conceptual mumbo-jumbo that ruined the otherwise musically inventive ""Rainbow Children.""

Each track on ""LotusFlow3r"" is worthwhile, especially the brilliant ""4ever"" - one of Prince's best pure pop songs in many a year.  The album drips with intense guitar soloing, which saves even the somewhat uninspired Hendrix rip ""Dreamer"" (a little too close to ""Voodoo Child"").  Some of the album is instrumental, including the bookends ""From the Lotus..."" and ""...Back 2 the Lotus"" which open and close the album, but they are musically strong.  ""77 Beverly Park"" is an acoustic guitar based instrumental that is among the loveliest trifles Prince has released in some time.  ""Love Like Jazz"" is funny (intentionally, I believe), and ""Wall Of Berlin"" builds up serious momentum.

There really isn't much downside to ""LotusFlow3r,"" except when comparing it to Prince's True masterworks.  With especially strong vocals, a live rhythm section throughout, and (for the first time in too long) plenty of hooks, the album sits comfortably alongside other second-tier Prince discs.  It ain't ""Parade"" or ""Lovesexy,"" but the man is never likely to scale those heights ever again.  However, it's a kick to hear him so focused and inspired.

Then there's ""MPLSound,"" the second of two all-new Prince albums.  While the album is nearly as focused as ""Lotus,"" it's unfortunately focused on the stale, electro-beat dance crud that Prince has glutted his discography with for the past ten years.  The opening three songs are overlong, largely melody-free, and worst of all BORING.  Mid-album, things pick up a bit, with the ballad ""U're Gonna C Me"" (which was previously released in a far superior alternate version on ""One Night Alone"") and a satisfying mid-tempo pop tune ""Here.""  ""MPLSound"" peaks with the stunning ballad ""Better With Time,"" though even that song is somewhat marred by a too-loud drumtrack.  ""Valentina"" is an embarrassment, a lust letter to Salma Hayek addressed to her toddler daughter (""Hey Valentina, tell yo' mama she should give me a call"").

As for Bria Valente's Prince-produced debut, ""Elixer,"" I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though Ms. Valente's voice is thin and unremarkable, Prince has written and produced a solid album in the 'smooth jazz' vein that is actually more listenable than ""MPLSound.""  The title track, a tantalizing duet between Prince and Valente, is the sexiest creation by Prince in years.  ""Kept Woman,"" ""Something U Already Know,"" and ""Immersion"" are all highlights.  I expected ""Elixer"" to be a total throwaway, yet it turned out to be a the second best of the three discs.

Bottom line: ""LotusFlow3r,"" while not a True return-to-form, is a kickin' guitar rock work-out with Prince's best tunes in eons.  I consider the other two discs to be more like ""bonus"" material, especially since the package is so economically priced.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention ""No More Candy 4 U"" - this killer throwback to the ""Controversy""-era is classic Prince.",""" LotusFlow3r "" is easily Prince 's best album since 1997 's "" The Truth "" ( aka Disc 4 of "" Crystal Ball "" ) , and possibly since 1995 's "" The Gold Experience .
