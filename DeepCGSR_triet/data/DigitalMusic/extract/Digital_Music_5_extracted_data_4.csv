A15T3Y3BL2AJ9V,B00123MCL4,1,1,5,"This is one of the better compilations available. The re-mastering was done very well and doesn't seem to take anything away from the original flair; it does not unduly alter anything either. Good job. It sounds great. It really brings out Buck's and Don's vocals. Occasionally, I listen to it, my mind reaching to much younger years. In the late sixties, I had the good fortune to meet Buck and Don after a life performance I attended. What great guys they were. This CD does them justice. I love it.","This is one of the better compilations available .

A2OAKHL0E0A4YQ,B00123MCL4,1,1,5,"I first heard of Buck Owens thru the Beatles' Act Naturally version back in 1965 or so. As time went on I began to appreciate Buck's remarkable band and talent. His records sounded so clean and featured twangy Fender guitars. His band leader, Don Rich was a model of restrained professionalism. Clean and accurate picking, not fast or flashy. Buck was an outstanding singer and his two part harmonies were his trademark. All these songs were No. 1s on the country charts and date from Act Naturally in 1963 to 1988's Streets of Bakersfield with Dwight Yoakum featuring Flaco Jiminez on accordian. WOW! What a great CD this is. There isn't a bad cut on it! If you only want one Buck Owens CD, this is the one! It's too bad most younger people only remember him as a cornfield clown on Hee-Haw, because Buck Owens was truly one of the greatest country stars in its history.","I first heard of Buck Owens thru the Beatles ' Act Naturally version back in 1965 or so .

It's a very up-tempo song with a memorable guitar riff and fun lyrics that tell the story of a road trip on the California Coast in an old Rambler: ""I'll have a burger and a root beer. You feed the heap some other grade."" I don't know how this didn't become a bigger hit when it was first released. But, almost as soon as this song was released, it disappeared along with the band that recorded it. Hard to believe this wasn't even an American band! They captured the feel of the American road trip perfectly. This is one of those songs that belongs on everyone's Summer Vacation mix tape.

While the song is short and simple, the grip from Michael's voice into the song still ignites. I honestly found this song to be one of their best, and it still is just as haunting today, as it was when it came out in the late 80's. While INXS has tried to come back with another singer, J.D. Fortune and with Switch, that didn't work very well. If you really are nee to INXS, and have never heard one single song from the rock group from ""Down Under"", than this song would be a fantastic song to to get.

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight's music is firmly rooted in traditional country, yet makes just enough concessions to progress so that it appeals to a modern generation. I guess a few purists will ignore him, but not many - there aren't many country singers now whose music owes so much to tradition while still selling in large quantities.

This compilation covers the whole of career to date, including eight tracks from his compilation of eighties hits (Just looking for a hit), eight tracks from his compilation of nineties hits (Last chance for 1,000 years), Things change (from A long way home), I want you to want me (from Tomorrow's sounds today) and two tracks from Population me (Late great golden state, Back of your hand). Thus, there is no new material here, but this compilation is the strongest single CD of Dwight's music so far released.

Inevitably, some classic songs have been omitted, one example being The heart that I own. Most of the songs here are originals but Dwight has recorded many fine covers, represented here by Little sister and Suspicious minds (both Elvis Presley) and Crazy little thing called love (Queen).

The set features nice mix of remastered hits from both the 70s and 80s . In my view you can never go wrong with the music of Chicago . Heck , I would nt mind getting one this myselfhinthint . Recommended ."

A1GIIPXONCEEHP,B00124HVBO,1,-1,3,"After Rhino released the near-definitive 2-CD collection THE VERY BEST OF: ONLY THE BEGINNING in 2002, I was a bit confused by the title.  ""Only the Beginning?"" Hey! Chicago hasn't had a top 40 hit since 1991's ""Chasin' the Wind."" But LOVE SONGS makes it perfectly clear.  That album was only the beginning of repackaging Chicago's material.

There's really little new here if you already own THE VERY BEST OF.  ""If You Leave Me Now"" is a live version with Philip Bailey. Another live version is ""After the Love Is Gone"" featuring Earth, WInd & Fire.  ""Never Been in Love Before"" is from 1975's CHICAGO VIII.  And ""Here in My Heart"" is a Lenny Kravitz-produced song from 1997's anthology THE HEART OF CHICAGO.

So what other creative ways can Rhino repackage this material?  The Terry Kath years?  The Robert Lamm-penned songs? Songs from albums whose titles don't contain a Roman numeral?

Don't get me wrong. If all you're looking for is Chicago's love songs--and ONLY their love songs, this is a solid collection.  My only problem with this is that it presents the group as a bit too one dimensional.","After Rhino released the near - definitive 2 - CD collection THE VERY BEST OF : ONLY THE BEGINNING in 2002 , I was a bit confused by the title .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00124HVBO,1,1,4,"There are just so many hits collections that realy seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists. That has always been the case with love songs collections as well, because there are just so many of them that really don't seem to showcase enough material that really reflects the best of those love songs. That just isn't the case with Chicago, and their great music collections, because they definitely hit the nail of the head very, very well. Their music has endured extraordinarily well for over thirty-five years. There have been a few successful hits collections that really reflects Chicago, and this one is just no acception.

Chicago's 2005 Love Songs collection, consists of their most well recieved love songs from thier long-time career. The album conists of 18 tracks, and a couple of live rendidtions of classics never before released on any Chicago album as well. The collection contains a lot of great tracks inclding You're The Inspiration, Will You Still Love Me, Beginnings, as well as classics like Colour My World Hard Habit To Break, and Hard To Say I'm Sorry. The album also includes a couple of live recording with Phillip Bailey from Earth, Wind & Fire fame, on versions of If You Leave Me Now, and the Earth, Wind & Fire classic, After The Love Is Gone, which really sounds delightful and lively.

While there love songs albums that really don't sell very well, or just miss out on a lot of great songs, Chicago's Love Songs really displays very, very well within not just its price, but the vast number of classic Chicago tracks here. While many not at all be interested in this collection, it really is a good reflection of Chicago's best ballads.

And maybe that was part of the idea Charles Lloyd had when he put out Forest Flower in 1967. Coltrane, Shepp, Taylor, The Black Panthers, protest vs. revolution. All this had taken over jazz that year. So Charles Lloyd comes along, and Forest Flower says--""This is all supposed to be fun. Chill for a second. We'll make the demonstration tomorrow. Let's play some tunes. RELAX!""

Not that these ""tunes"" leave subtance lacking. Lloyds sense of harmony and melody is increadible. Listening to is chord structres, I feel as if a Beatles or Brian Wilson has been channeled into a jazz man. His chords are so tuneful, this music is just a joy to listen to. Fresh and clean now as it was the day it was born.

I don't have to tell you about the skill of Keith Jarret or Jack Dejonette--there is a reason Miles inducted them--and proof is right here.

There was a lot of great jazz like this during this era, and unfortunately, it gets hidden in the shadow of giants like Coltrane, Miles, and Archie Shepp. Listen to them always, but dig on this sometimes, too.","You know , I have been listening to a lot of 1965 - 67 Coltrane lately , and as essential as this is to my system , I need a break .

Not only that but their are many excellent creative elements to this music as well that are even still ignored to this day for the same reason. So instead of concentrating on this album for what it isn't I'll focus this review on what it is. Throughout his career it's important to understand that George Benson was always on the cutting edge of vocal soul-pop/jazz. Even his earliest albums such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-George-Benson-Cookbook/dp/B0012GMW5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The George Benson Cookbook</a>&nbsp;featured Benson singing pop songs of the day so I am not going to criticize him on this album for doing what he'd always done. The main thing that makes the difference here is that George Benson is modernizing his poppy funk-jazz here for the mid 70's and in terms of music,song selections and just his renowned playing and singing this album certainly takes the cake there. It's not very long in it's entirety but the fairly long cuts that are here are all excellent each in different ways and aside from two one vocal number the instrumentals that dominate this recording give enough time for everyone,especially Benson to strech out instrumentally. No matter how many times I've heard the title song of this album,as far as I know one of only a select few instrumentals associated with Bobby Womack and aside from the rather pretty melody these days I actually really enjoy the bluesy sort of licks gets on the final verses of the song. After having heard the original of ""This Masquerade"" on Leon Russell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carney/dp/B000002U04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carney</a>&nbsp;it gives new meaning to this one. Leon's had a deep bayou flavor to it wheras George Bensosn presents the song as something of an American pop standard with the darkness of the melody baught up to the surface even more along with George's guitar-scating signiture almost making the song into a Benson original as opposed to an interpretation. In fact the only Benson original here is the instrumetal ""So This Is Love?"" which,much like ""Lady"" and the Jose Feliciano cover ""Affirmation"" all get a great balance between soul-jazz,funk and R&B with a tempo and rhythm that variates enough to keep it really interesting and involving. ""Six To Four"" is a great pop/funk that's a bit more uptempo and upbeat than the rest of the album and provides a nice change of pace. This album,all and all is not altogether as pop oriented as you might expect despite Claus Ogerman's flowery string arrangements and the upfront melodies and it actually serves it's purpose very well in that regard. There are plenty of very musical licks from George,Phil Upchurch and everyone else involved in the making of this album so it's not just a commercial triumph for Benson but he didn't totally compromise himself artistically either.","So much controversy has been generated regarding the creative merrit of this album that I truly believe it 's many enjoyable qualities have been forgotton .

A3DPACNQCR3720,B00124OEBY,1,1,4,"I've been a fan of the Bee Gees since the 80's.  At that time, they were a 'singles' band, the 'baby Beatles' because of their influence.  After the success of the album 1st, which was more of a compilation of singles, their albums were hit and miss.  So when this album came out, in all it's velvet splendor-it sported a velvet cover, but no single to back it up.  After 45 years, I finally downloaded and listened to it, and there were some songs that could have been singles, although they departed from the 'formula' because they went in a slightly 'country' direction, an idea from one of the non brother members of the band.  Country and symphony, who knew?  The 5 piece band was disintegrating with Robin leaving the group after this release/  They would come back stronger in the 70's, but they kept on recording up until the death of the twins.  The only song that may be familiar is First of May, but the music and lyrics are top notch.  The boys were finding their own voices and style.  But when you consider all the good music coming out in '69-Abbey Road, The who, the San Francisco sound was coining to flourish on the charts, this one, probably also because of it's cost' was ignored.  Maybe that's why it's so endearing now, considering that the guys were Justine Beiber and Miley Cyrus's age when they produced this.  It's an inexpensive download for the original album, and money well spent.","I 've been a fan of the Bee Gees since the 80 's .

A2162NFEC5ZSDQ,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions. This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period! This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original. As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment! From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being ""Tommy"" by the Who and ""White"" album as it's called by the Beatles.

Although never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the ""British Invasion"" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc. This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of ""statement"" album. The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving. The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.

Barry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon/McCartney or Townshend/Entwhistle or Jaggar/Richards and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be. The epic title track shows their strong ability to ""story tell"" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean. Then you have songs with a country fell such as ""Marley Purt Drive"" to the folk sounding ""Melody Fair"" to the bouncy ""Suddenly"" amongst others. Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.

This album really showed that the ""boys"" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19. Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him. Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers. That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later.","This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions .

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>. There was orchestral rock before this masterpiece, and most rock albums using strings and horns from 1967 or 1968 sound nothing like Sgt. Pepper.

Odessa sure doesn't. Where Pepper was really, on one level, about applying any type of music to rock--making it a limitless expanse, Odessa is extremely consistent in sound.

Odessa shoots for an almost Spectorian, Wagnerian sense of orchestral pop. Huge strings, huge echo on the voices. Listen and the Beegees seem to sing out of the funnel center of the bigness they crate.

You'd better get used to this  sound if planning to sit through Odessa, because it runs through what was a double album. (Young? Call mom and she'll explain.) If you like this sound, it is like being stuck in orchestral mud honey. Just surrender and drown in it for the next seventy minutes. There are deviations: some silly sixties light pop, and some country tinged experiments that really work.

But what there is not is a grinding guitar like on Pepper's ""Getting Better,"" rock and roll stomp like""Good Morning."" You would barley know guitars plugged into amplifiers listening to Odessa.

I understand why Pepper is used as a bench mark, and in the sense that rock bands were more free to ""experiment,"" after Pepper, this is accurate. But if Odessa does not actually sound like the Fabs benchmark, that is ok.

A1XP7P3X9MRE5H,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"Odessa was the Bee Gees' fourth internationally released album, and their first double album. It was by far their most ambitious release and was had a red-flocked cover and included a poster and sticker. At a certain point the title ""Masterpeace"" was considered.

The band was still a 5-piece band at the beginning of the recordings, but before the release of the album in 1969, guitarist Vince Melouney had left the group.

Though not a direct concept album there are themes about the ship Odessa that runs though the songs. Apart from some long, mostly instrumental orchestral pieces, the music is not really that different from the group's previous releases.

To be regarded as a real classic I find the album too uneven, with too many average songs. There are of course a lot songs, too, that ranks with the very best of their early works.  I have always liked their music best without the big arrangements that often burdened good songs too much.

Simple songs with great melodies like, ""Sudddenly"", ""You'll Never See My Face Again"" and ""I Laugh in Your Face"" are still my favourites. I also used to like ""Marley Purt Drive"", but it seems the songs hasn't aged that well.

Among the classic ballads ""Lamplight"" is outstanding, and ""Melody Fair"" and ""First of May"" are both great songs.

This 3 CD version contains both mono and stereo versions of the original album, and the third CD contains some very interesting alternate versions along with some previously unreleased songs. Many of these are almost as good as the well-known versions, and a few maybe even better; I especially like the alternate mix of ""You'll Never See My Face Again"". The song ""Barbara Came to Stay"", is the same tune as ""Edison"", with different lyrics, and also one of the great additions. For fans of the group, this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums, of course is must.

AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"After forty years, the Gibb Brothers have finally re-released their most classic and eclectic of albums, ""Odessa"".  Released at the height of their first popularity and the start of their ultimate eighteen-month breakup, these three musicians, barely out of their teens, produced their only double studio album.  Originally coated in a red velvet cover, this is one of the most extravagant re-releases to date.  Originally seventeen songs, varying from the near operatic, ""Odessa (City On The Black Sea)"" to country flavored tunes like, ""Marley Purt Drive"" and ""Give Your Best"", the Gibbs cover nearly every style of pop music available, including rock, orchestral, country and R&B.

Originally slated to be titled, ""An American Opera"" or ""Masterpeace"", this double album epitomizes the height of talent of the Bee Gees boundless creativity.  In addition to two new studio songs, ""Pity"" and ""Nobody's Someone"", there are alternate and demo mixes that will surprise in their originality, beat and alternate verses.  ""Edison"", ""Lamplight"", First Of May"" and ""Whisper, Whisper"" all are given special treatment, sometimes twice.  ""Whisper, Whisper"" is actually Part Two, a welcome addition to a song that originally ended too quickly on a fast, rock driven pace.

Of the three discs (57 songs), the stereo had been remixed/remastered to absolute, crystal clear perfection, bringing out all the muffled sounds that the original LP contained.  The Mono mixes present the songs with emphasis on different vocals and instruments, while the third disc contains all the previously unreleased material.

Fan Joe Brennan of website ""Gibb Songs"" has this great explanation of Stereo vs. Mono recordings:  ""Odessa was recorded on 1-inch 8-track tape reels.  Each of the 8 tracks can be played separately, and each might have the input from one or more microphones.  Each of the 8 could be recorded at different times and places (like New York and London), or erased and re-recorded.  To make stereo, you have to mix down to 2 tracks, and for mono, mix down to 1 track.  While doing this you get to decide how relatively loud each track should be.  That's where the differences come from.  The source is the same 8 track master.  Mono was for old record players, and for AM radio, which was where you heard the latest tunes on your transistor radio or car radio"".

With three discs, a poster, extensive liner notes, photographs of the group, handwritten lyrics, single covers and reel-to-reel listings, a T-Shirt and a sticker all enclosed in a nifty red velvet covered box, this limited edition is a fan and collector's dream.","After forty years , the Gibb Brothers have finally re - released their most classic and eclectic of albums , "" Odessa "" .

A3QPA2Y4CDZUAH,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"First off, the packaging...in a lovely, luxurious red velvet BOX, not a slipcase as I originally thought it would be...with the title gold embossed.  Open it up and the treasures flow out...first a round red Bee Gees sticker, then a huge poster (double-sided), then a great photo-packed booklet (love the B&W cover, and Robin's buggish sunglasses...he looked downright alien-ish...a precurser to Flaming Lips head genius Wayne Coyne!!)...with incredible, informative liner notes that said what we've always known...prior CD issues were crap (abridged, bad sound, etc) and this was an opportunity to give ""Odessa"" the full glory treatment, and info on EVERY song...all versions.

Now, the songs, oh man, THE SONGS!!!!  There are 3 CDs (as I guessed it would be when I first heard of this deluxe (an understatement if there ever was one) release...CD1 is the 17-track album in stereo, CD2 is the album in MONO (first time released in the US) and CD3 is the REAL treat, the 23-track ""Sketches For Odessa""...cool and fascinating demos, alternate takes (sometimes both), 2 UNRELEASED tracks and a promo spot for the album from some record stores, not the radio.

I won't go into the riches of the songs TOO much, but the lovely folks at Reprise/Rhino must have known about how grand this album is (possibly the Bee Gees' best album ever, a True masterpiece) and how crap prior issues were, so they pulled out all the stops and made this clearly the best-sounding CD version of the album.  I don't know what is better, the stereo or the mono...they both sound great.  I love the songs on ""Odessa"", exquisite orchestral pop with killer melodies & 3-part harmonies and excursions into alt-country/rootsrock a la The Band, and orchestral interludes...it works best playing from beginning to end as one piece, yet each track coulda worked as a killer single (except the 3 instrumentals of course).  Faves are def ""Melody Fair"", ""Marley Purt Drive"", ""Give Your Best"", ""Never Say Never Again"" (ESPESH the CD3 alt version with the fuzz guitar, AWESOME, it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain!!!), ""I Laugh In Your Face"", the awesomely cool Maurice-led ""Suddenly""...on and on, one of THE great pop/powerpop albums EVER made, and that's an understatement...

Now, the REAL treats are the TWO unreleased tracks, ""Nobody's Someone"" & ""Pity""...those songs are AMAZING, and it's wild to know they were in the vaults for 40 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!  They could have been hit singles easily, they sound finished and complete, with great hooks and harmonies, just killer.  Another thing is the album was not done justice by the choice of single released, ""First Of May""...nothing against the song, it's lovely, but it would NOT have been my first choice of first single...""Melody Fair"" or ""Marley Purt Drive"" or the title track would have caught people's attention, and the album would have done better, not widely forgotten except for collectors, hardcore fans and powerpop freaks...

NOW, with this GRAND 3CD reissue, people will realize what they truly missed, the treasures in store for them.

So far, best reissue of 2009...nothing will top this.","First off , the packaging ... in a lovely , luxurious red velvet BOX , not a slipcase as I originally thought it would be ... with the title gold embossed .

CD1 is the 17 - track album in stereo , CD2 is the album in MONO ( first time released in the US ) and CD3 is the REAL treat , the 23 - track "" Sketches For Odessa"" ... cool and fascinating demos , alternate takes ( sometimes both ) , 2 UNRELEASED tracks and a promo spot for the album from some record stores , not the radio . I wo n't go into the riches of the songs TOO much , but the lovely folks at Reprise / Rhino must have known about how grand this album is ( possibly the Bee Gees ' best album ever , a True masterpiece ) and how crap prior issues were , so they pulled out all the stops and made this clearly the best - sounding CD version of the album . I do n't know what is better , the stereo or the mono ... they both sound great . I love the songs on "" Odessa "" , exquisite orchestral pop with killer melodies & 3 - part harmonies and excursions into alt - country / rootsrock a la The Band , and orchestral interludes ... it works best playing from beginning to end as one piece , yet each track coulda worked as a killer single ( except the 3 instrumentals of course ) . Faves are def "" Melody Fair "" , "" Marley Purt Drive "" , "" Give Your Best "" , "" Never Say Never Again "" ( ESPESH the CD3 alt version with the fuzz guitar , AWESOME , it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain ! ! ! ) , "" I Laugh In Your Face "" , the awesomely cool Maurice - led "" Suddenly"" ... on and on , one of THE great pop / powerpop albums EVER made , and that 's an understatement ... Now , the REAL treats are the TWO unreleased tracks , "" Nobody 's Someone "" & "" Pity"" ... those songs are AMAZING , and it 's wild to know they were in the vaults for 40 YEARS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! They could have been hit singles easily , they sound finished and complete , with great hooks and harmonies , just killer . Another thing is the album was not done justice by the choice of single released , "" First Of May"" ... nothing against the song , it 's lovely , but it would NOT have been my first choice of first single ... ""Melody Fair "" or "" Marley Purt Drive "" or the title track would have caught people 's attention , and the album would have done better , not widely forgotten except for collectors , hardcore fans and powerpop freaks ... NOW , with this GRAND 3CD reissue , people will realize what they truly missed , the treasures in store for them . So far , best reissue of 2009 ... nothing will top this ."

A20JK8DT702CWE,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"This is still the lushest of all the Bee Gees' albums, unless you count the late, great CUCUMBER CASTLE.  That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my, oh my- -those songs.  I don't know what the rift was over the band's direction that temporarily broke them up (a family affair, you see), but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious, inglorious Sixties.  It was their last of that decade, and everything they'd done previous to it, great as it may have been, was merely prelude.  In England ODESSA was released as a red-velvet two-LP box set; in the States as a red-velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster-at-sea insert.  You could put the thing on your coffee table (or floor, or kitchen counter) and let it speak for itself, or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean.  Or both, with or without headphones.  Okay, that may be overstating it, but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers' finest compositions, ranging from the story-telling prog-rock of the title track (the cello solo is an ingenious touch) to the lighter-than-air, lovely 'Melody Fair' to the oboe-chugged, acoustic 'Suddenly' (Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor) to the desperately haunted 'Sound Of Love'.  Heck, they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one, the prescient globalists!!  And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot!  And- -'Lamplight'!! You want goofy instead?  Okay, 'Give Your Best', and 'Never Say Never Again'! There! These guys are awesome!

AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00124OEBY,1,1,4,"Yes, this was the Bee Gees 'white' album, only this doubled LP had a red velvet cover and a 'Titanic'-like illustration in the gatefold.  Now available on a single CD, it marks the end of the sixties period for the Bee Gees.
The music?  This was an important time for the Gibbs' who were maturing (at ages 19 and 21) and already millionaires.  The music was conceptual and starting with the title track, it delivers with powerful orchestration and emotional, lyrical simplicity.  It is a skewed look at a fabled seafarer lost at sea and emotionally destitute.  At least, that's what the project started out to be.
Somewhere during the recordings, egos flared and tempers snapped, so what you ended up with is a collection of half Bee Gees conceptual songs and half individual Gibb contributions.  It is still a remarkable recording!
Stand-out cuts are ""Marley Purt Drive"" that could have been recorded by ""The Band"" and ""Melody Fair"", a single in some countries and a well covered track.
Most of the other tracks deal with period issues like, drugs, sex, rock 'n roll, psychodelia and why not?  Producer Stigwood unwittingly fueled the tensions by choosing ""First Of May"" as the A-Side single instead of B-Side ""Lamplight"", which was just as strong.
Regardless, the final outcome is a conceptual album filled with an orchestrally sweeping moodiness aligned with perfect harmonies and lyrics envied by everyone. This is one of the few albums of the period with orchestral solos with the Gibbs providing the chorus.  It is monumental.","Yes , this was the Bee Gees ' white ' album , only this doubled LP had a red velvet cover and a ' Titanic'-like illustration in the gatefold .

But, his music has been very melodic and intmate, that it is worth taking a listen too each and every time. His classic 1979 standard Sailing is just as melodic and souldully deep as it was when it has came out over 30 years ago. While he was never a part of the MTV era, his music is still just a great escape to, and honestly still holds up better to all the crap music that has came out over the past several years. If you've loved Christopher's opus, it is worth downloading all over again. While his latest Dr. Faith isn't bad, truthfully Sailing is the one you'll always keep coming back to.

After they disbanded, Seals began performing as Dan Seals and launched a country music career through the 1980s which produced 11 No. 1 hits."" Another reviewer writes that England Dan & John Ford Coley's music was along the lines of ""light pop"" with ""a touch of folk;"" and I agree!

These five tracks are some of their very best music; I love the way they performed so well! England Dan & John Ford Coley could harmonize flawlessly and their melodies were easy on the ear and memorable as well. ""I'd Really Love to See You Tonight"" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and it still sounds great in our time! ""Nights Are Forever Without You"" is a little masterpiece that is timeless; it has great electric guitar work and the arrangement overall is very strong. They cover Todd Rundgren's ""Love Is the Answer"" so well that Todd would surely approve and ""It's Sad to Belong"" is very poignant. The track set ends with England Dan & John Ford Coley performing their awesome ""We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again;"" this is yet another evergreen classic that I could never tire of hearing!

Big fans of England Dan & John Ford Coley will probably have most if not all of these songs already, so I think this music is best geared toward more casual fans and people just discovering their artistry. True, it's very sad that Dan Seals passed away all too young; but he does live on through his music. I highly recommend the beautiful songs of England Dan & John Ford Coley.","England Dan & John Ford Coley "" were an American pop rock duo composed of Danny Wayland ` England Dan ' Seals and John Edward ` John Ford ' Coley .

A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0012EFZWG,1,1,5,"""Smoke on the Water,"" originally from the great Deep Purple album ""Machine Head,"" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat. This somewhat extended version, recorded live in Japan, has, if anything, even more energy than the original. Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record ""Machine Head"" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.

The song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood,"" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I love live music, and highly endorse this version, and I also recommend ""Machine Head"" (the ""Best Hits"" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price.) One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple.",""" Smoke on the Water , "" originally from the great Deep Purple album "" Machine Head , "" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat .

The Monkees make different mistakes at each of the concerts.  Sometimes they sing the wrong lyrics, sometimes they play the wrong notes.  And there are often technical problems with the microphones and instruments.  Probably the major difference other than the mistakes is in the ad libs that the Monkees say during the concerts.

A1KBQK0AHXY9PE,B0012FE454,-1,-1,2,"When I was 11 years old(1967) I attended a Monkees concert on this tour,and certainly,these 4 concerts are True to what I remember hearing at The Miami Beach Convention Hall(yes,I was at one of the 6 shows where Jimi Hendrix was one of the warmup acts).What you get in this 4 disc set are 3 concerts professionally recorded on 4-track by RCA engineer Hank Cicalo and one mono soundboard tape from Mobile,Alabama recorded by one of the group's roadies. The Mobile tape sounds somewhat better here than on bootleg editions. The primary fault is with the group's performances. As we all know,the Monkees were singer/actors hired to portray musicians,and on the group's first 2 studio albums,98% of the instruments were played by sessionmen. Even if Mickey Dolenz(Drums),Mike Nesmith(guitar),Peter Tork(Bass,electric piano.organ) & Davy Jones(tambourine) had been better players,they were in a no-win situation,trying to play songs from the first 2 albums,which featured up to 10 instruments per song. Typical Monkees fans would be best advised to buy Rhino's ""Live 1967"" CD,which creates one ideal set from the three professionally recorded shows(all the shows had the same song line-ups).For those who do purchase this 4-CD set,you'll note that none of the selections in the 3 professionally recorded shows match exactly with the recordings as heard on ""Live 1967"".I suspect that on ""Live 1967"",that Rhino engineers(who had access to 3 renditions of each songs) spliced between renditions,used sampling,or (perhaps) had The Monkees come into the studio to overdub/correct the recordings. What you'll get if you buy this set is the REAL(not particularly listenable!) ragged/amateur/garage band sound of The Monkees circa 1967,albeit lovingly packaged by Rhino Handmade. But ""Live 1967"" is much more listenable.","When I was 11 years old(1967 ) I attended a Monkees concert on this tour , and certainly , these 4 concerts are True to what I remember hearing at The Miami Beach Convention Hall(yes , I was at one of the 6 shows where Jimi Hendrix was one of the warmup acts).What you get in this 4 disc set are 3 concerts professionally recorded on 4 - track by RCA engineer Hank Cicalo and one mono soundboard tape from Mobile , Alabama recorded by one of the group 's roadies .

As we all know , the Monkees were singer / actors hired to portray musicians , and on the group 's first 2 studio albums,98 % of the instruments were played by sessionmen . Even if Mickey Dolenz(Drums),Mike Nesmith(guitar),Peter Tork(Bass , electric piano.organ ) & Davy Jones(tambourine ) had been better players , they were in a no - win situation , trying to play songs from the first 2 albums , which featured up to 10 instruments per song . Typical Monkees fans would be best advised to buy Rhino 's "" Live 1967 "" CD , which creates one ideal set from the three professionally recorded shows(all the shows had the same song line - ups).For those who do purchase this 4 - CD set , you'll note that none of the selections in the 3 professionally recorded shows match exactly with the recordings as heard on "" Live 1967"" . I suspect that on "" Live 1967"",that Rhino engineers(who had access to 3 renditions of each songs ) spliced between renditions , used sampling , or ( perhaps ) had The Monkees come into the studio to overdub / correct the recordings . What you 'll get if you buy this set is the REAL(not particularly listenable ! ) ragged / amateur / garage band sound of The Monkees circa 1967,albeit lovingly packaged by Rhino Handmade . But "" Live 1967 "" is much more listenable ."

It was founded by Rick Roberts, who had been in the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Jock Bartley, who had been Tommy Bolin's replacement in Zephyr. The band's biggest hit single, `You Are the Woman,' peaked at number 9 on the Billboard charts in 1976. Other hits include `Just Remember I Love You' (# 11 in 1977), `Strange Way' (# 11 in 1978), `Cinderella' (# 34 in 1977) and `Staying with It' (# 37 in 1981) with female vocalist Lisa Nemzo."" (Wikipedia).

These five tracks are some of Firefall's best music. ""You Are the Woman"" has a sweet melody and Firefall does this really well--it's a classic that got lots of airplay when it was originally released! ""You Are the Woman"" still sounds good today. ""Just Remember I Love You"" also was a big hit for the band; just one listen will tell you why! The guitar is well used in the musical arrangement and this couldn't have been done any better. ""Strange Way"" features Firefall singing and playing at their usual very best; and ""So Long"" is an excellent tune. The track set ends with Firefall performing ""Livin' Ain't Livin';"" it leaves me wanting more from this awesome group!

Firefall biggest fans will probably have most if not all of this great music already, so I think this music is best for the more casual fan or newcomers just discovering Firefall's incredible artistry.

For many, this is the only Yes song they've ever heard - well, this and ""Owner Of A Lonely Heart"" - but it's arguably the best distillation of everything good about Yes.

Come to think of it, ""Roundabout"" dashes through the door ""Light My Fire"" had opened five years previously. Both employ a prominent Classical-sounding organ riff along with Spanish guitar scales. However, next to ""Roundablut,"" ""Light My Fire"" sounds positively earthbound (not that that's a bad thing). Maybe the Doors and Yes should have swapped lead singers, just as an experiment.

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00136J7OA,1,1,5,"please understand, that as what I wrote in an earlier review, I believe that there is more than enough room in this world for women who choose to be childfree and those who choose to become and stay mothers  (regardless of their age).  For some reason, I have heard billie jean by Michael Jackson on the radio enough times for the song to grow on me. Im taking it that billie jean by Michael Jackson symbolizes the journey of a man coming to terms with being the father of a woman who became pregnant at an extremely young age (Im guessing a teenager) due to the lyrics she is just a girl. He does not want to believe that he is the father, but he sees that he probably is due to singing about looking at the babys eyes that remind him of his own eyes. From my humble opinion, Billie jean by Michael Jackson still does touch on a relevant issue today because the common societal message that is still being sent is that every woman who is someone becomes a mother, and I do believe that many teenage females subconsciously take in this message and internalize it. I just happen to have made my own decision on what I was going to do after my teenage years when I was tasked with helping my adoptive mother look after the younger children in her care.  I have an open mind when it comes to teenage mothers because I myself was born to a woman who had just turned 16 8 days before my entrance into this world. However, that is all that Im going to say for now for a compelling song that touches on a topic that is not going to go away anytime soon.","please understand , that as what I wrote in an earlier review , I believe that there is more than enough room in this world for women who choose to be childfree and those who choose to become and stay mothers   ( regardless of their age ) .

A1GR2QPCD08COG,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,"I've been buying Amazon music for a while now and I love how Amazon offers low cost music and even free music from new artists. I listen to radio mostly and frequently I get tired of the same stuff and definitely tired of the over-played stuff (even if it's a great beat like Lady Gaga's ""Poker Face""). I've never heard of Franz Ferdinand and I first heard ""Take me out"" on Amazon. The more I review songs the more I'm aware of my alternative music tastes (especially alternative music reminiscent of 1990's alternative).

For me, good alt-music has a rock beat with a twist--something different, unexpected, experimental even. I think this can be subtle or obvious and very subjective definitely (in the eye of the beholder or the ear in this case). Sometimes a repetitive beat is annoying (one reason modern country music doesn't do it for me); but sometimes it's classic (like Elvis Costello's ""Pump it up,"" Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode,"" or Elvis Presley ""That's Alright Mama"" and even some old-skanky-country like Hank Williams' ""I'm so lonesome I could cry""--old-skanky-country is a term of endearment made up entirely by me). By no means am I comparing ""Take me out"" to the classics, I'm trying to explain how I base my reviews.

What caught my ear on ""Take me out"" was the initial repetitive rock beat (it's fast with a hint of punk) guitar and drums dominate; it's a great mix with the singer's voice (is he singing or screaming--it's hard to tell, there's an angry sound to his voice which is fitting with the punk aspect of the music). A minute into it, the beat transitions to a slower, deeper, harder rock sound (hm, interesting choice of words yes? If good music doesn't make you think sex, maybe it's not good music. Anyway, a very sexy transition IMO). There are hints of 70's disco in the cymbals in the chorus (or what I think is the chorus). There isn't much variety in the lyrics or rhythm for that matter; but sometimes that just doesn't matter. The beat keeps the song moving along. The lyrics do borderline on the monotonous but it's an easy song to sing to--maybe Franz doesn't have much to say. It's the only song I've listened to from Franz Ferdinand. I like it, a lot.

With Amazon's 20 million songs, there is so much to listen to! I rated this song 5 stars because I am very happy with my purchase.

For Billy Joel, who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years, his song still sound just as vibrant and distinctive as they did when they first came out back in the 70's, the 80's, and even the 90's. Sometimes the distinctive and classic style of a great songwriter still can deliver better than the joke artists of today. That has shown with Piano Man, New York State Of Mind and the classic We Didn't Start The Fire. The song still lights up the flame 25 years later after it originally came out and it still sounds just as driven as it did years ago. I still never get tired of the rhythm and rhyme into a great history lesson through time, as Joel pointed out into the song, and it still is better than the wasted acts of today. Maybe they should try and make a fire that still works like this song shown all this time.

Whitney Houston showcased more bravado and simplicity in her songs that still withstand the test of time more than any of the songs that today's acts could reach. That stands with her biggest template, I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard, and off of her hits record I Will Always Love You: The Best Of Whitney Houston. The song still is just as majestic as it was when it first came out 20 years ago, and just the strike of the notes that Whitney had delivered is still with brilliance. This is a must download for anyone whom has never heard a brilliant note from Whitney Elizabeth Houston. She will always be loved.

Musically, she showcased being the world's great soulful singer, whom not only made covers brilliantly, but songs all her own. The biggest example is I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard. The song is just as intimate and beautiful from her soulful heart and voice alone. Something that stands taller beyond the tests of time. The song is honestly the biggest movie song of all time, and definitely is the most classic cover she had ever done in a lifetime. Her Dolly Parton cover even stands taller than any song that anyone has made within the past several years.

As a young man finding my way in New York City there were what the residents called public baths. This was a very long time ago but as a music fan even then, I remember a young, explosive female entertainer named Bette Midler who would entertain at these baths accompanied by her pianist, Barry Manilow. Of course they would later break away from each other to become each outrageously loved and successful show business personalities. There were definitive differences with Barry Manilow becoming a much more  conservative recording artist whereas Bette is the nouveau Lucille Ball with a comedic lasciviousness that generations have enjoyed immensely. My wife and I waited in an endless, serpentine line to see Barry Manilow do a show at the Garden back in 1981. Once inside, we immediately noticed his engaging smile and friendly persona which is nothing short of contagious. His material, as evidenced by the classic Weekend in New England ranks amongst the finest songwriting in American music. In Barry's case, whether another classic of his I Write the Songs classifies him as a 100% singer songwriter is irrelevant. We appreciate him as a captivating singer who is an authentic charmer. That is exactly how Barry Manilow can credit his gargantuan success since the days of playing the piano and appearing with Bette Midler in New York's public baths. I would have to say that his vocals and keyboard playing are indeed highly professional. His strength is to light up any room he walks into and then you have have to add one of the most highly regarded song catalogs music fans have ever appreciated.

A2IHB3M0ZIKNOZ,B00136JB8W,1,1,5,"Many people cite The Love I Lost, from late 1973-early 1974 as the first disco song. It has all the elements from the disco beat to the use of strings. I would say the Trammps with Zing Went the Strings of My Heart had all the disco elements down including the strings, and that was in late 1972, over a year earlier. But the Trammps song was minor and The Love I Lost was a huge mega-hit, so it's known to far more people. Disco evolved out of the Philly sound of Gamble and Huff, and taht's who Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes recorded for.

But forget labels like disco anyway (some people don't like the term), and what you've got is a smooth orchestra, a driving rhythm and Teddy Pendergrass singing his heart out. It's a great R&B classic and is as fresh today as it was when it was released. There was a long version on the album, but that just had an extended interlude for dancing because dance music was expected to be more than a three minute AM tune. But for just listening I think the single is better as the dance interlude gets a bit repetitious on the long version if you're just listening.

However, there is a rarer quality of a movie song, one that if you have not seen said movie, but you here the song first, and you love the song so much that you actually want to see the movie. That is what this song does. While watching these past Oscars they played the nominees for best movie song of the year, and I thought to myself, it all seems so fake. The song from ""August Rush"" completely missed the mark it was trying to achieve, and ""Enchanted"" with the exception of ""So Close,"" sounded like typical Disney type fair.

However, then came, ""Falling Slowly,"" a song from a widely unknown film, I was like, ""Wow, this is really different, this is beautiful!"" And it was all that and more, and the studio version only improved on these precious elements. It's a moving, gentle song that really touches your heart. And like I said, I liked the song so much, I now want to see the actual movie, ""Once.""

Overall, the surprise song of the year, and a feel-good story that these unknown musicians are finally getting the credit and recognition they deserve. Buy this song, and you won't be disappointed.

By the way, get this version, there's a longer version that was put out, and it's not as good, because the song seems a little bit too spontaneous and drawn out, and it also loses some of the elements that makes the soundtrack version so great.","And I 'm not talking about instrumentals either , I 'm talking about lyrical themes to movies that have to embody the movie , and really set the tone for it the movie .

While they just haven't had the definitive sales that have shown with their albums in awhile, they have made a good impact back into the light with Hey, Soul Sister from their new record Save Me, San Francisco. But, their classic songs still remain as distinctive as you could imagine like Drops Of Jupiter, their 2001 smash which is still as strong to listen to today, as it was when they Pat Monahan and company made it nearly a decade ago. So if you've loved Hey, Soul Sister, than add Drops Of Jupiter to your MP3 collection.

For those acts, we always will think of Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince. But, for Billy Joel, he really made the best that was still coming around. 35 years after he broke ground with Piano Man, he has still dominated with his music on the radio. While he hasn't recorded an album since 1993's River Of Dreams, his music still stands the test of time because it is worth while from beginning to end. But for those who seem more interested in acts like Britney Spears and anyone who has been on American Idol, and doesn't own a Billy Hoel record, than this is a start to download for your MP3 player.

The Essential Billy Joel is a collection of over 30 tracks from Billy's long and successful career from the 70's, 80's and 90's. The songs here have all been remastered well, and chronicle a innocent man who has made the music of our times. The collection includes a lot of great standards he has made his own for over 35 years like Piano Man, River Of Dreams, We Didn't Start The Fire, the delight diddy Uptown Girl, and The Longest Time, all the way to #1 hits like My Life, It's Still Rock N' Roll To Me and Allentown. There is so much that is great in music, but there are a few of his great songs that were sadly overlooked like You're Only Human (Second Wind), Modern Woman and a few other good songs. But, those are small complaints, because those songs were only minor hits. Instead, the collectin includes some of his songs from his 2001 classical pop album instead.

All in all, The Essential Billy Joel is a very strong and standard greatest hits album from beginning to end that is fun and a joy to listen to, whether you're a hard core fan, or anyone who is new to Billy Joel's songs. This album is definitely a great purchase to download off the internet, or buy from your local record store. Even though Billy Joel hasn't made anything new in awhile, his music is still making us go to extremes.

I purchased an old The Source magazine from December 1994 and saw that was a track for one of their Sure Hot Singles back in the day. Thing was I never paid too much attention to UGK, except for a few songs here and there. Then ended up being the laughing stock at my job, because I told them that I'm from the A, their recent album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underground-Kingz/dp/B000K7UFL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underground Kingz</a>&nbsp;was the only album I owned. So I ended up buying this the very next day.

Super Tight is a very southern style album. Both Bun B and Pimp C sound way different back in '94, than they do today. A lot of tracks would bump today as they did back then. ""It's Supposed To Bubble"" is one of them. Bun B drops a solo track ""Feds In Town"" which sounds real good. ""Pocket Full Of Stones 2"" and ""Protect & Serve"" are other good songs. ""Stoned Junkee"" is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and features 3-2. The final track ""Three Sixteens"" featuring DJ DMD is a very good way to close out the album.

Super Tight is an excellent album. Some of the production sounds dated (although I have to give mad props to Pimp C for his production), but it still bumps here today. It's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar, especially when other albums from the south such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik/dp/B0000013GB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Diary/dp/B000000W6Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Diary</a>&nbsp;dropped the same year. But if you're a fan of 90's southern rap (mainly groups like E.S.G., UGK, or anyone from Rap-A-Lot), don't hesitate to get this album. I used to live in San Antonio during my high school days ('00-'04), and this album reminds me so much of how it was down there in Texas. Peace!

Only 11 songs but no weak point, 1 classic, 2 almost classics, 2 are ok, and the rest are good or great songs.  Guests are on 3 of the 11 songs.  As usual for a UGK album, the production is great and handled mostly by Pimp C (9 songs) and DJ DMD does the other 2.  They show why they're the best group to come out of the south on this one and especially with their ""Ridin Dirty"" album.  A must have, great album!!

Every song bumps but the classics are `Return', It's Supposed To Bubble, I Left It Wet For You,  Feds In Town, and Front Back Side to Side.

A26CCP0YRR14AQ,B00136LQUI,-1,1,5,"I love this song, it brings back bittersweet memories of the summer of 2000.

In June of 2000 after the unexpected and sudden death of my husband, my BFF at the time and I were riding in my black '96 Mustang GT, windows down radio blaring.  She was trying to get my mind off of what had happened a few days before when Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" came on.

Before I even had time to think about it, we looked at each other and started ""car dancing"", you know, you're bustin' a move while moving at a high rate of speed, singing at the top of your lungs, laughing, crying and just having fun.  People driving past us would look over and smile, or laugh, some even paced themselves alongside us and broke out in their own car dancing moves.

I didn't stop and think about what people would think if they knew my husband had just died.  I didn't stop and think about anything except the moment me and my best friend were in, ""Girl's just having fun"".

The lyrics are easy to pick up, sing along with and dance to and the video was great.

I believe that if more girls just wanted to have that sort of carefree silly fun, the world might be a little less uptight.","I love this song , it brings back bittersweet memories of the summer of 2000 .

I know that when I first heard this song it came and went. I didn't pay much attention to it at all.

But these days I like it lots. This is after I bought the platinum edition (2007). The ending is emotional. And I could see myself getting teary-eyed if I loved someone half this much.

But I'm not in a relationship. But I still like songs like this. Love-oriented ones. I always have!

 And they range from different sides of mainstream music from Pop (Mandy, Robin, Christina or Jesse,) to R&B (Mariah, Carl Thomas, Beyonce and Luther Vandross) to Pop-Rock (Maroon 5, Incubus, Yellowcard and Fall Out Boy).

5 stars.

Something that only few and far between artists whom has passed on can still deliver in spirit. His last major hit, You Rock My World from his lackluster Invincible record still remains very solid with his standard dance songs from the late 70's and 80's. It is one of his better songs from Invincible that still stands tall. While it isn't as good as his ballads were like Man In The Mirror or Lady In My Life. Still, it holds up well into why he will always be The King Of Pop. He knew what he wanted in song and heart. The song still stands taller than most of the junk on radio today.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,4,"Hard to believe today it is 5 years since Michael Jackson tragically lost his own life the way he did. I definitely do not think Michael Jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a pedophile and wacko jacko. Still he still had some great songs towards the end of his career and his life. You Rock My World, one of his last hit songs originally from the lackluster Invincible album is still one of those few standouts from that album that is playing well. It showed a more R&B rhythm to the appeal that Michael Jackson wanted to get into a generation that was getting into Destiny's Child, TLC and when a lot of R&B really was going more into a dance and hip hop rhythm. It really was a good song, but one of Michael Jackson's last to really hit the nail on the head. If you would prefer Michael's music from the afterlife, as it was released from the Xscape record, you should absolutely go back to what made Michael Jackson a legend in the first place, and get Invincible with You Rock My World.

A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,5,"The prelude; Michael Jackson and Chris Tucker having a conversation about a girl they're supposedly looking at, though there isn't any background noise to help set the scene; is like the skit at the beginning of Black Or White. It may be funny initially, but it's replay value is nowhere near that of the song it introduces. Listeners of at-least the official album versions of these tracks may, in other words, find themselves skipping past, or at-least zoning-out on, the first several seconds. That means the tracks, essentially the songs, would be better without their preludes. In the case of You Rock My World, the title of which doesn't come across nearly as corny as it should, the song would also make more sense without it. The dialogue implies that the girl is a total stranger to both Chris and Mike, but the song lyrics have Jackson already romantically entwined with her.

""It feels like I've finally found a perfect love this time,"" he insists before going into one of his best choruses yet. ""You rocked my world, you know you did,"" it goes, utilizing a harmonic vocal stack similar to the haunting Ghosts, ""Who'd think I'd find someone like you to call mine?"" The words are trite; on paper the song would read like a high school crush poem; but the vocal melodies, even on the verses and bridge, are quite awesome. The music, highlighted by dramatic keyboard strings where applicable, is a slinky soul groove that goes back to the relative timelessness of the Thriller album. Despite an unnecessary scratch break near the end; the ad-lib peak section should take the song out; it's producer Rodney Jerkins at his best. It's not Michael Jackson at his best, but it's damn close. If the quality of this love theme is any indication, I'd guess he got the girl.

It has some nice flourishes such as great sax solos, judicial use of cow bell, and one of the nicest drum solos recorded, with ample timbale which lends an exotic flavor. There is great synthesizer throughout with strong performances by all backup musician. The drum solo on this version is a little longer than the radio version (I like this slightly longer version better).

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136LEMS,1,1,4,"To really be honest with you, this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music. While so many artists like Jordin Sparks and Beyonce' have taken so much radio airplay, it has been harder to find fresh faces to make good music come alive. Newcomer, Sara Bareilles though has managed to get herself out there and try to make a name for her little voice with her debut single, Love Song. The song actually is very catchy after awhile, and stays with you. It is a pretty good song that shows she has a decent ability who has the distinction of making good songs sound fresh, rather than flimsy and manufactured. I really hope she keeps making good ones for years to come, that really stick to the mind and soul.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00136LEMS,1,1,5,"First off, Sara Bareilles is a great new musical talent, in the vein of the gaggle of female pop artist dominating the airwaves today. She sings great, and her piano work is incredible. The song could be compared to REM's classic, ""The One I Love,"" in that, the title sounds, well, like a lovesong, but actually it's like a break-up song. Bareilles does a great job at creating a radio-friendly upbeat pop song. And it all seems to work. Just the other day, I heard the song twice within a span of 15 minutes, on completely different radio stations.

Overall, a great little pop tune from a big talent. Music just seems to be coming up with a ton of surprises lately, and this song is no exception.","First off , Sara Bareilles is a great new musical talent , in the vein of the gaggle of female pop artist dominating the airwaves today .

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00136LEMS,1,1,5,"Much more things going on, production-wise than the version that I have downloaded to my computer. It's great though, gives it more personality.

The version I hear when I listen to it (downloaded version) has just the piano and vocals. Nice, but no production whatsoever. It's great, but not this. The video version is much livelier.

The song itself is pretty impressive though; it lets us know who Sara actually is; what she wants; needs and most importantly, how she thinks! Lyrics are subtly interesting and the piano work is somewhat infectious, albeit simple.

I've heard the samples here, and although they weren't enough to make me want to purchase the album, it doesn't take away from this awesome single and I will still give them another go someday!

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,"One of the best songs from the glam band Europe, another song they wore out playing on the radio. I was in 7th grade when this hit came out. I remember some of my friends and I before school would start walk the halls singing this song. I mean you do crazy things when your 12/13 years old. The reason why I like this song , I guess it's because its not like other glam band songs, this one sounds different. I like the lyrics and the beat isn't the same copycat beat you hear from some of the other glam bands. I recommend this hit to any glam band fan, 80's music fan or anybody looking for that old school sound.","One of the best songs from the glam band Europe , another song they wore out playing on the radio .

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00136NEAI,1,1,5,"I love the music of the '80s... but somehow I was blissfully unaware of this song's existence until I stumbled upon it in a list from Cracked -- ""The Most Terrifyingly Epic Songs of the '80s.""  I had heard most of the songs on the list, but had somehow overlooked this one entirely.  Cracked has a sketchy record when it comes to recommendations, in my opinion, but given that I loved most of the other songs on this particular list (""Eye of the Tiger,"" ""Don't Stop Believing,"" ""Holding Out for a Hero,"" ""Love is a Battlefield,"" etc.), I decided I had to give this one a listen.

I'll just say... if you're an unabashed fan of cheesy '80s poodle-hair rock, you will love this song.  :D

There's nothing subtle whatsoever about this song.  From the triumphant and soaring synthesizer opening to the epic guitar and drum riffs, this song's instrumentation is the epitome of goofy '80s rock.  The lyrics, while simple, are also rather nonsensical, seeming to hint toward a group of astronauts leaving Earth but otherwise defying easy explanation.  And the lead singer's voice is nothing to write home about, though at least he actually tries to carry the tune and doesn't just yell into the microphone.

And yet somehow, this all WORKS.  It's a goofy song, yes, but it's the kind of goofy that leaves a huge smile on your face.  It's a song that's completely over-the-top but in the best possible way, and you can't help but want to bang your head and sing along when it comes on.  I haven't listened to anything else by Europe -- and from what I understand this is their only real hit -- but they sure hit a home run with this number.

This song has found plenty of new fans thanks to ""Arrested Development,"" but even if you've never seen that show, it's almost impossible not to like this song.  It's not the greatest hit of the '80s, but it sure is one of the most fun... and yes, one of the most terrifyingly epic.","I love the music of the ' 80s ... but somehow I was blissfully unaware of this song 's existence until I stumbled upon it in a list from Cracked -- "" The Most Terrifyingly Epic Songs of the ' 80s .

When Ray Parker Jr. came out with the original Ghostbusters theme song, it was caught under innuendo and storms, with him using the Huey Lewis & The News song, I Wanna New Drug back in the 80's. But with time and space, the song has still been as iconic today, as it became a hit back then. When I had heard Fall Out Boy do a cover of this definitive song, Ray Parker Jr. & Huey Lewis got credit for in the 80's, and the original version isn't bad after all this time. It is definitely one of those movie songs that has still stood the test of time, in the way other movies songs like Purple Rain did for with the late great Prince and Footloose for Kenny Loggins as well. It surprisingly still shows a lot of longevity that is worth listening to, and much more worth the download for new fans of the upcoming Ghostbusters remake, and die hard fans of the classic films with Bill Murray & Dan Akroyd.

Exhale (Shoop Shoop,) is a sweet and simple song that ignites well in simplicity and soulfulness. It because the first song from a movie to debut at #1 on Billboard in 1995, and it still shows a lot of soul and simplicity. I have always liked the song because it really is better than most of the jokes on radio today. While Whitney somberly passed away a year ago, her songs still carry a tune beautifully.

The massive success of The Bodyguard dominated the soundtrack world in the 90's and beyond, but her songs from Waiting To Exhale are not to be overlooked, especially Exhale (Shoop Shoop.) It became the first song from a movie to debut at #1 on the Billboard charts, and showcased a sweet and simple voice that Whitney displayed in elegance by Babyface's music. Just like I Will Always Love You, this shows Whitney Houston, at her simplest and best. God bless the sweet voice.

A2QUAQ4GR6SLF7,B00136NIJA,1,1,5,"And I'm the first to give this song a review?  Amazing.

On the strength of hearing this single once on the radio (with of course no statement as to who sang it) I embarked on a quest to find this singer.  I bought one CD (Hotel Paper by Michelle Branch) which I ended up giving to my daughter - it was good, but sort of ordinary...  My second try netted Wreck of the Day, the right one, and it was worth every bit of effort and two purchases.  This is an awesome song, and every song on the CD is excellent, too.

I just hope my 5 stars lift this track up to where someone else might find it and discover Anna's incredible voice and superior songwriting.

The chorus for others who may be looking for the right one...

'Cause you can't jump the track
We're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass
Glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So just cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe","And I 'm the first to give this song a review ? Amazing .

He sounds like no one else. Perfect song to start out with if you never heard of Cohen. And it is not religious if that is what you were thinking by the title.

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00136NH1Y,1,1,4,"October 29th, 2009

And I say positively because this one is more upbeat compared to a lot of his sadder affairs, although not an uptempo.

Face talks about being at work and wanting to come home to the girl that he loves so much, so they can have some bedroom fun. Or in general, anyone being stuck at work, unable to wait to get home to the one that they adore to be next to them once again.

Whip Appeal serves as a sexy mid-tempo number that hasn't really aged much at all. In fact, it feels like it was made in the 90s!

Written by Babyface and L.A. Reid.

4.5 stars.

edit: It's a shame I don't have more stuff to review. I would do it more often *if* new things were coming into my life at a dizzying rate. But alas...","And I say positively because this one is more upbeat compared to a lot of his sadder affairs , although not an uptempo .

Now I'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz (which by definition IS fusion, like in Fused On) no, I'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro-Latin Gumbo Rock!  Dig That Fusion Baby!  Artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Traffic, Pink Floyd, Genesis, even Yes and ELP; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor's stable of jazz giants.  Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers' label (not represented here of course) got word of mouth disease, it was jazzy, funky, rock-drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago, this music was not a stretch at all, especially if you were also a fan of War, with or without Eric Burdon.

So this groovy 17-track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential.  The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order, not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music.  Listen to Can't Hide Love and try not to think about ""smooth jazz"" a decade later, way ahead of its time, way!  This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide.  It contains all of The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire (1978) save the weakish Love Music, six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2, and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story (from Open Our Eyes, '74) and the title epic from Gratitude ('75).  Even if you have most of their studio releases, how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life!

The CD comes with full music and track credits, a terrific bio (The Eternal Groove) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in-depth history (The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks) all packaged with some beautiful artwork (always a staple of EWF albums).  Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group, full of positive vibrations and inner peace, Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it.  Get a heaping helping right here and you won't regret it.","I do n't think there has been a more definitive example of "" fusion "" in music history as with Earth Wind & Fire .

But for Whitney Houston doing it back in 1991, she made it more dominant than what Francis Scott Key could've ever imagined. It came on the heels of the Persian Gulf War, and hearing how bold and somber it is, sadly after Whitney had died, it is a unparalleled trademark of why someone is that strong. Whitney dominated that song beyond what words could've ever said, and that lightning in a bottle will never be replicated. I will never get over the sadness I feel without hearing the voice of our times pass on. Whitney Houston will be missed, and definitively never forgotten.

I've long since lost my collection of jazz recordings, having few left when transitioning to CD. And now that I'm slowly adapting to today's new technology of 'cloud' storage, I am slowly compiling a playlist of Jazz Favorites.

Fortunately, this 'Take Five' track is authentic, and probably the best choice for MP3 players.  It's great to include in your playlists to download on your media player.

If you are a Dave Brubeck fan and enjoy jazz, choose this track.  You won't be disappointed.

It has been done so many times, and by so many people, but there have been a lot of faults that haven't been able to outshine others. Arguable, the biggest version of the Star Spangles, is definitely from the great Whitney Houston. Her legacy to deliver any cover, has been beyond what words could ever be ignited from the soul of the heart. Her rendition from the Super Bowl back in 1991, still ignites from the impassioned soul. Whenever I hear this version that ""The Voice"" honorably showcased, I am constantly reminded of how beautiful she still can shine, where so many singers like Beyonce' Knowles have not even came close to singing and delivering a simple note where Whitney ignited from first to last place. If you have never heard a song by the dynamic Whitney Houston, than this song is one I sincerely recommend.

AB6O8EM172B74,B00136PX6Q,1,1,4,"Sometimes, all of us want to escape the 'drudgeries' of every day life.  The idea of someone holding '2 tickets to Paradise' in their hand - and just waiting to give them to me - to 'take me on a trip so far from here' - is, quite appealing to me - especially at this juncture in life.

Although there is no 'love' component to the song, which, typically I find to be the most attractive aspect - the promise of 'relief' from daily pressures, plus, the idea that I might have a '+1' on my 'trip,' brings me inspiration and, most importantly, hope.

Good stuff - the song, that is.

I created a slideshow on my computer with this music - paradise is looking pretty good - even if me and my '+1' just get to spend two weeks at an all inclusive resort somewhere in the Caribbean.  There is, after all, in reality - 'No place like home.'

They just don't make'em like they used to.

$1.29 for '2 Tickets to Paradise.'

A wise investment - in one man's humble opinion.","Sometimes , all of us want to escape the ' drudgeries ' of every day life .

He raises his voice some times during the songs but he does it at the right times in the songs such as in the end of it and at one of my favorite moments in the song when he sings ""I'm always here for you"" ""Iknow, I know, I know, I know that you'll thank me later"".

I am a huge 80's music fan, and the music is still popular today. I am so happy young people know what great music is, I guess that's why 80's music is so popular in the 21st century. I am sure most people have heard this song, it is worth the 1.29. I think this is the only song Scandal had success with, but some of those one hit wonders live forever.","An excellent song from the mid 1980 's , I feel in love with song when I was in Jr. High .

There are other songs that this group did, mind you, but they weren't nearly as powerful, nor as wonderful and memorable as this song was and still is!

A23Q1T4MXZHFM7,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Earth Wind and Fire is one of the greatest R&B groups which scored a number of great hits during mid 70s to early 80s. It has released a number of greatest hit compilations so far, but this one is most suited for ordinary music fans who have never bought any of EW&F albums.

Earth Wind and Fire is regarded as a disco hit maker because during late 70s to early 80s the group had produced such tracks that might fit well for disco-dancing from slow ballad AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE to dance-pop BOOGIE WONDERLAND and LET'S GROOVE. But up until mid 70s they created some great spiritual songs with ethreal out-of-the-world chorus. CAN'T HIDE LOVE is one of the good examples to show their chorus style. FANTASY is by far the most successful single release in Japan. KALIMBA STORY and MIGHTY MIGHTY are the funky pop songs representing their early days' music style.

Verdict: Well-balanced and great one-CD compilation showcasing their career.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits has many hits that I remember from when I was a kid in school; it brings back a lot of memories for me. This is a strong single CD compilation although as others have noted it doesn't give you every last one of their hits. However, what we do get is very high quality control music from Earth Wind & Fire; and that's great. The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that artwork, too.

""Shining Star"" rocks! This came out and hit the airwaves big time! Earth Wind & Fire simply never sounded better. They really handle this well; they never skip a beat nor do they ever let go of a superfluous note. The tempo and key changes make the number strong; and they sing this very well. ""That's The Way Of The World"" quickly shifts gears for a much more mellow sounding tune; this features the group squarely in the spotlight--right where they belonged and still belong! ""That's The Way Of The World"" was always one of my very favorite Earth Wind & Fire tunes; and I think just one listen will tell you why--this is all THAT good.

""September"" has an awesome beat that would even get the dead tapping their feet to the rhythm; ""September"" was yet another huge hit that got a lot of airplay when it was originally released. I still hear it sometimes on an ""oldies"" radio station in my area; and that's grand. ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" is one heck of a snazzy tune; they make this a masterpiece and they deliver this with a lot of feeling. In addition, ""Sing A Song"" has them harmonizing to perfection--and beyond! ""Sing A Song"" is another major hit on this CD.

""Serpentine Fire"" uses the percussion to great advantage; and of course another big hit for this group is ""Fantasy."" ""Fantasy"" charms me with its beauty and it's truly a stand-out on this album--how could they ever get better than this? I'm amazed. ""Mighty Mighty"" has quite a beat that gets you up and dancing nearly wherever you are; and listen for ""Reasons."" ""Reasons"" has a mellow, pensive flavor to it that is absolutely stunning--and the backup singers harmonize well.

""Let's Groove"" is another tune that still sounds good all these years later; and I really like ""Boogie Wonderland"" which Earth Wind & Fire performs with The Emotions. ""Boogie Wonderland"" was a huge success for these artists and I still love to hear it today. ""After The Love Has Gone"" again showcases Earth Wind & Fire at their mellow best; and the album ends strong with Earth Wind & Fire performing ""Getaway."" ""Getaway"" has a strong beat that makes me want to dance; and it also leaves me wanting so much more!

This is a great album for fans of Earth Wind & Fire, but if truth be told they would need other CDs to have all of the hits from this fantastic group. This album is particularly good for the casual fan who wants most of their hits on one single CD; and it makes an excellent starter CD for people just discovering the fine talents of Earth Wind & Fire.","Earth Wind & Fire : Greatest Hits has many hits that I remember from when I was a kid in school ; it brings back a lot of memories for me .

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"In their seventies heyday, Earth Wind and Fire were one of the hottest touring acts in the world and an unstoppable singles machine. Band leader Maurice White and main singer Phillip Bailey had a chemistry that was almost unbeatable, and top notch musicians brought the chops. White eventually hit a supple groove that was both funky and popular, and when the hits started coming, like ""Shining Star"" and ""September,"" they helped make disco into a bit less of a dirty word.

They had another secret weapon in the EWF Horns. Punchy when they needed to be, smooth jazz when required, they often provided an 'x' factor in the band's best work. The band mixed these elements into a dynamite stage show that rivaled George Clinton's Mothership era for sheer audacity and showmanship. While there are no live tracks here, if you've ever seen the camp classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band/dp/B00009APB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>, you'll see a tiny fraction of the excitement when the band performs ""Got To Get You Into My Life.""

Listening to this CD several years after what EWF tunes had been trimmed from my library is a real trip down memory lane. From the opening Black Pride Themed ""Shining Star"" to the road-trip classic ""Getaway,"" these are all memorable hook-fests that livened up many an AM radio in the 70's. White often had a Utopian vision that he emphasized in his lyrics making these tunes both danceable and uplifting. Bailey's distinguished Falsetto livened the ballads (like ""After The Love Has Gone""), but EWF's real genius was making songs that were irresistible funky grooves. If you don't find yourself bopping to ""Boogie Wonderland,"" check and make sure your feet are still attached.

Only frustration - missing ""Love's Holiday,"" ""Magnetic,"" ""System of Survival"" or anything post 1983. Could have been a double disc, easily. But really, even without them, this single disc EWF CD is indispensable if you're an oldies buff.","In their seventies heyday , Earth Wind and Fire were one of the hottest touring acts in the world and an unstoppable singles machine .

Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a > , you 'll see a tiny fraction of the excitement when the band performs "" Got To Get You Into My Life . "" 

 Listening to this CD several years after what EWF tunes had been trimmed from my library is a real trip down memory lane . From the opening Black Pride Themed "" Shining Star "" to the road - trip classic "" Getaway , "" these are all memorable hook - fests that livened up many an AM radio in the 70 's . White often had a Utopian vision that he emphasized in his lyrics making these tunes both danceable and uplifting . Bailey 's distinguished Falsetto livened the ballads ( like "" After The Love Has Gone "" ) , but EWF 's real genius was making songs that were irresistible funky grooves . If you do n't find yourself bopping to "" Boogie Wonderland , "" check and make sure your feet are still attached . Only frustration - missing "" Love 's Holiday , "" "" Magnetic , "" "" System of Survival "" or anything post 1983 . Could have been a double disc , easily . But really , even without them , this single disc EWF CD is indispensable if you 're an oldies buff ."

Why? Is this one of those stupid cross-label things? Because those are really annoying. And this contains Boogie Wonderland, most likely their worst hit, either that or Let's Groove. Both are disco.

Plus it adds After the Love is Gone, a worthy addition to any self-respecting EWF hits collection (or at least any one released after 1978), and their greatest song ever maybe. I'd bet on it.

Yes, this is a great intro, but don't stop here. Why? All in All, Spirit, Gratitude, That's the Way of the World and Open Our Eyes are all good picks, that's why.

Although there are times where we see the past as something better than the future. That has been the case with acts putting their music into musicals like Billy Joel for Movin' Out, and John Lennon's music for the short-lived Imagine. That also has happened with Earth Wind & Fire, who recently had there catalog of great songs showcased for the upbeat Off-Broadway show Hot Feet. It still has proven that there music hasn't been forgotten by the public at all, and this collection of their music is also not forgotten either.

Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits is a single disc reflection of the group during their 1970's hey day and all of the tracks that are still just shown as True guilty pleasures today. The songs on this collection still stand out today, and they sound better than they did before on this collection. The album includes classics like their standard Shining Star, the soulful and elequent After The Love Has Gone, Fantasy, the funky & upbeat September, and Let's Groove. They are just delightful to listen to, and still stand out very weel with the essence of Disco, Soul, Funk & R&B.

Although it is a shame that the group hasn't captured what they had back in the 70's, but Earth Wind & Fire are still great to listen to today. Their 1998 Greatest Hits is a truly a really definitive record, and I absolutely recommend this a whole lot for anybody who wants to be a shining star.

A2NADXRZGP014J,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Throughout the 70's a group known as Earth Wind & Fire brought happiness to the radio waves and the dance floors.  This group had some outa-sight funky songs that made you tap your foot and roller skate to the rhythm.  Their songs, reflecting the innocence of the era, were colorful and upbeat.  The direction and genius of Maurice White was responsible for making this funk possible.  Vocally, they were a soulful chorus with Phillip Bailey's Falsetto leading throughout most of these songs.

The opening number ""Shining Star"" is more than a far-out funky tune.  Just listen to that vocal blend and that rousing arrangement.  ""That's The Way of the World"", ""September"", ""Sing a Song"", ""Mighty Mighty"", ""Saturday Night"", and ""Get Away""  are trade mark songs of the group.  Nobody can remake these or has even tried.  Yet, the group has successfully recorded other's songs like ""Can't Hide Love"" and ""Got To Get You Into My Life"".  The highlights that deserve giving more than a quick listen are ""Fantasy"" which is a gorgeous blend of voices,  ""Kalimba Story"" which a totally original song written by Maurice White, ""Reasons"" which is a gorgeous love song with Phillip Bailey in the lead vocal, and last, but not least, ""After The Love Has Gone"" which is a very fine ballad.

One cannot leave out the musical arrangements that accompany the vocal group of Earth Wind & Fire.  While it is extremely rare today to find comparable talent on a recording, it was also quite rare in the 70's era to find such artistry on studio recordings.  But this is what added to the group's sound and what made them so popular.  There were rich sounds from not only keyboards, guitars, drums, and saxophones, but instruments that brought the full experience:  trumpets, trombones, congas, flutes, violins, violas, tubas, harps, and timpani.

This collection of songs is fun for those who remember the funk era and fun for those who just want to experience enjoyable, upbeat music.

The Highwayman tells the story of death and rebirth in four parts, and each part is sung by a different member of the group. The first three characters (Willie, Kris, Waylon) meet their deaths and are somehow resurrected. Johnny's character has already left his former life and is in the process of being reincarnated. His character may also represent all of The Highwaymen.

Or all of us...

Willie:

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bas***ds hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

Kris:

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
With the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner around the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

Waylon:

I was a dam builder. Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell to the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around...I'll always be around

Johnny:

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a Highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain

And I'll be back again...","Jimmy Webb 's epic The Highwayman ( 1984 ) is the song that gave the country supergroup of Waylon Jennings , Willie Nelson , Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson their name ( The Highwaymen ) , and was the first song on their first album .

The remastering is absolutely awesome - - crank up 'September' any time of the year and you're guaranteed to get gone.  It isn't chronological - - the earliest track, 'Kalimba Story', comes smack in the middle - - but this is a party, not a history lesson.  I could do without 'Boogie Wonderland' myself but you can't not have everything, and I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go nitpick on someone else.

A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Although there are several greatest hits packages available for Earth Wind & Fire, most notably the Best of EWF Volumes 1 & 2, their Greatest Hits compliation which was released by Columbia Records in 1998 is easily the best one available. Containing most of the band's hits as well as lesser known tracks that are just as strong, Greatest Hits is the perfect introduction to this talented band's music.

 Simply put, every track here is top notch with most of them hitting the Top Ten on both the pop singles and black singles charts. The tracks ""Mighty Mighty"", ""Saturday Nite"", and their only #1 pop single ""Shining Star"" are excellent funk songs punctuated by their trademark snappy horn lines. The tracks ""September"", ""Serpentine Fire"", and ""Sing A Song"" are near perfect pop songs with soaring harmonies and melodies that stay in your head immediately upon first listen. Their late-70's hits ""Let's Groove"" and ""Boogie Wonderland"" are very strong disco tracks with the former track aging wonderfully compared to most of the music from that genre. While the harmonies are strong on all of their material, harmonizing doesn't get much better than on ""Getaway"", arguably the finest song they've ever recorded. The ballads here are all fantastic with ""After The Love Has Gone"", ""That's The Way Of The World"", and ""Reasons"" being not only among the best recorded in the '70s, but of any era. Other great tracks here include their cover of the Beatles' ""Got To Get You Into My Life"", ""Fantasy"", and ""Kalimba's Story."" This is a phenomenal greatest hits album that should be part of every music fan's collection. Highly recommended.","Although there are several greatest hits packages available for Earth Wind & Fire , most notably the Best of EWF Volumes 1 & 2 , their Greatest Hits compliation which was released by Columbia Records in 1998 is easily the best one available .

A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B00136NUG6,1,1,5,"Mid-1970s black music seemed dominated either by fun, mindless party jams like ""Jungle Boogie"" and ""Skin Tight,"" or dour warnings like ""Future Shock"" and ""Living For The City."" Stevie Wonder sang his share of life-affirming music but Earth, Wind & Fire, here with a definitive one-disc greatest hits, made such positive strength the heart of their musical identity.
Some of the era's most needed, heeded messages ran deep and sweet atop Verdine White's bass grooves (front and center on ""Getaway""), brother and leader Maurice's drum and percussion tracks  honed over years with Chess Records' rhythm section (""Saturday Nite,"" ""Kalimba Story,"" 1977's dazzling ""Serpentine Fire""), Louis Satterfield's horn section scrambling through jazz-rock mazes every track (becoming a 80s rock stalwart backing Phil Collins), and Phillip Bailey's high, clear Falsetto on ""After The Love Has Gone,"" the prom dance standard ""Reasons,"" the soaring chorus of ""September,"" and the elegant ""Fantasy"" which, with ""Serpentine Fire,"" gave R&B one of its best 1-2 LP opening tracks. (It's restored to album length here, with Larry Dunn's superb keyboard intros, after being edited on two previous best-ofs).
Messages like ""You're a shining star...shining bright to see what you can truly be,""  ""If you sing a song today, you will make a better way,"" ""Try to resist all the hurt that's all around ya..."" moved feet and hearts, misinterpreted by spiritual seekers and hedonists alike in the ""Me"" decade's last discofied days. The Whites understood disco's falsity: ""Morning deals a bad hand to a woman who has made too many bets,"" Maurice sings on 1979's galloping disco smash ""Boogie Wonderland,"" adding, ""You dance and shake the hurt."" But by early 1982, needing a hit after a slow-selling double-LP the year before, EWF gave in to the dance grooves and party-down lyrics of ""Let's Groove,"" their last Top 5 hit.
Despite a generous 18 tracks (and an excellent geneology of the group by Kevin Goins), longtime fans will miss ""In The Stone,"" ""Fall In Love With Me,"" ""Head To The Sky,"" ""Let Me Talk,"" and others. These are found on 1995's ""Eternal Dance"" box, the ""Elements of Love"" ballads collection, or two previous best-ofs. This ""Greatest Hits"" packs their best-known pop songs into an exceptionally sounding disc (thanks to Mark Wilder's remastering), providing an essential introduction to one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's most surprising, satisfying member groups.","Mid-1970s black music seemed dominated either by fun , mindless party jams like "" Jungle Boogie "" and "" Skin Tight , "" or dour warnings like "" Future Shock "" and "" Living For The City .

CTA is the REAL deal, and the new songs fit well and show this group has fantastic potential. With all the hubbub about the latest release of Chicago's ""lost"" Stone of Sisyphus, I think I'm going to puke.  The reviews for SOS all sound like old fans trying to convince themselves that SOS is the best since the Terry Kath days and that they should be excited and happy.  It might be best, but it is still a gigantic cry from that early magic. Chicago since Terry Kath's passing and even the ""transitional"" Hot Streets album is a completely different band and should have changed their name.  All the blues and grit from the early days has continued to be replaced with slick production, synthesizers, and seriously stripped down guitar.  California Transit Authority DOES have that early magic, and I hope and pray they can continue to create and perform.  The WORD must get out. And before you get the idea these guys are just an old Chicago cover band, forget it!  They add their own spice and the new songs show they are every bit as inovative and appealing.  Be prepared to be blown away.

It is truly tragic that Pankow, Loughnane, Parazaider, and Lamm are not a part of Danny's new adventure. The songs are polished, the sound is GREAT, and, if they are honest with themselves, as musicians (with any personality conflicts set aside), I would imagine they would be crying inside not having been part of this wonderful project.

When I first heard that the brass sound on the tracks was done on keyboard, I thought it would sound nothing but cheesy.  NO WAY.  No way at all.  In fact, when I listen to the tracks, I cannot tell the difference except on 25 or 6 to 4 which, I believe, was done live.  I can easily imagine that Pankow, Loughnane, and Parazaider made the studio sessions in secret, but due to contractual obligations, they are not credited. Wouldn't that be a gas?!  Anyway, time will tell if the band can pull off some new tunes that equal or surpass Pankow's inovative big brass sound.

The new musicans really, really cook!!!  Marc Bonilla is fantastic find.  Though no one can replace Kath, Bonilla has his own magic and the playing is phenomenal. He definitely HAS the down and dirty blues.  Larry Braggs from Tower of Power is a perfect fit for the group. All the other musicans are just great, and they play tight.

One more comment.  I already knew that Danny was a rock drum genius, but this album makes it painfully clear he was an extremely essential ingredient to the early Chicago sound.

He is also considered one of the great stylists and innovators on his instrument, forging a unique jazz-based rock style that propelled his supergroup through 20 top ten hits, 16 million-selling albums and numerous sold out concerts around the world for millions of fans. After Danny was ""fired"" by the group in 1990, he went into seclusion and put his drums aside.  Following years of production projects in the sudio and even Broadway, Danny got back into form in recent years with the inspiration of top industry musicians.  His jam sessions resulted in the formation of ""CTA"" and now the release of this studio work with a wonderful mix of Chicago classics and originals and other rock standards.  Bottomline: Every track works and every track cooks.  Danny's drum chops are back intact as he leads this band of top flight musicians with the amazing Marc Bonilla on guitar and Tower of Power's incredible Larry Braggs on vocals.  Yes, Danny Seraphine is back, back with a vengeance and showing the world a return to the original musical inspiration that made the early Chicago great.  While his former bandmates earn a paycheck entertaining the wine and cheese crowd with Peter Cetra covers like ""If You leave Me Now"" Danny and CTA are playing real music for the sake of the music itself and blowin' the door down.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00136RFJY,1,1,4,"Alright, take yourself to back in the day, before all the personal stuff, and when Britney ruled the music world with an iron poppy fist. Still not there? Oh well... This song, her last real song that anybody would pass more than a horrifying glance at her. And while not her best vocally, you just can't get away from that beat. Congrats, kudos, and bravo to the producer that created that, because it is simply amazing. Perfect for spy movies, and when it was used in ""Chuck,"" and it's just so darn catchy. You know the opening chords, you know the riff, it's all familiar, and lovable.

As for Britney herself? She's okay, normal dance club fare. Nothing special vocally here. Lyrics? It's Britney, b**ch! Who needs lyrics? Just a beat, and a music video!

So overall, you might want to skip the vocal version, and just get the instrumental version which I am just lovin' up on now. So hurry, get it, use it as a ringtone! Or use it next time you can't get the James Bond/Mission Impossible Theme for your secret spy activities.

By the way, some great covers have been made of this song, and most of them come out surprising well. Some offer a different take, some are fun, some are strange to say the least. Hard-Fi did a great low-fi indie cover of the song, which all but removes the original melody, and just keeps the lyrics, while adding some car effects.

Nickel Creek did a great humorous live performance that you can find in various places. In that version, one of the band members readily admits, ""This song kicks a*s!""

And Yael Naim did a cover of the song, which is very strange and haunting. I didn't care for it, but some will and do.","Alright , take yourself to back in the day , before all the personal stuff , and when Britney ruled the music world with an iron poppy fist .

The place was packed every weekend. I cant even remember the name of it (maybe I will do some research). But my friends and I would go every Friday and Saturday night. Only problem was he drank at that time. Would get plastered before the night was over. But boy could he sing. ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"" is probably my favorite song of his.

A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,"Ever since the early days of MTV, I started falling in love with Cyndi Lauper's music.  She was NOT like any other artist out there.  She was wacky, creative, quirky, fashionable (check out her various outfits) and didn't take herself so seriously.  And that New Yawk accent!!!  Quite simply, Cyndi just wanted to have fun.  But before she became a megastar on the pop map, she had previously fronted a rock band called Blue Angel.  They put out their first and ONLY record in 1980.  It really IS worth checking out.

Once Cyndi became an actual solo artist, her first order of business (aside from being on MTV) was to recruit another band called The Hooters.  They helped her launch 5 mega smashes on her 1983 debut, ""She's So Unusual.""  First, there is the opener, ""Money Changes Everything.""  Cyndi showed the world who was boss and that she wasn't going anywhere.  Next was the most important staple, ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun.""  The whole indescribable nature of the song was what got her noticed in the first place (most notably on Dick Clark's American Bandstand).  Then there was the much more serious ballad ""Time After Time"", which remains one of my personal favorites to this day.  This album was only the tip of the iceberg of what would catapult Cyndi's 30 year career longevity.

In 1985, she released 2 tracks for The Goonies movie:  the theme song (""The Goonies 'R' Good Enough"") and the much faster rocker, ""What A Thrill.""  A year later, Cyndi spread out her artistic talent even further with ""True Colors.""  Each song was a hit on its own, and Cyndi had A LOT of guest stars (The Bangles, Billy Joel, Aimee Mann, and even Pee Wee Herman).  The title track and accompanying video is another one of my personal faves.

In 1988, another minor hit:  ""Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)"" from the movie Vibes.  It's a VERY elusive song to find, if that is even possible.  I actually got it from an 80's compilation disc on eBay several years ago.  It's just one of those feel good songs that you really need to have!!!

Next came 1989's ""A Night To Remember"".  Cyndi was becoming much more serious as a songwriter and performer.  ""I Drove All Night"" had a much more rock feel to it, and it proved that Cyndi was indeed evolving.  Sadly, this was the only real hit on her record; in hindsight, the rest of the songs deserved MUCH more appreciation and should not have been cast aside.  What about ""Unconditional Love"" or ""Heading West""??

In the 90's, Cyndi would release 3 more records.  By that time, she was getting even deeper into her artistry and would even release some non-album tracks.  For example, you may be familiar with the ethereal 1992's ""The World Is Stone.""  In 1993, Cyndi re-teamed with the Hooters for some delicious tracks on ""Hat Full Of Stars.""  There were, again, some minor hits:  ""That's What I Think"", ""Who Let In The Rain?"", and the lilting, hushed title track which is still another of my personal faves.  Unfortunately, the album wasn't getting the right amount of airplay.  But that never stopped Cyndi at all.  She kept having great song after song.

In 1995, Cyndi released her first greatest hits record, ""Twelve Deadly Cyns.""  I loved the candy coated, luscious album cover, and so 3 new songs were added to Cyndi's ever growing repertoire:  ""I'm Gonna Be Strong"" (this was an updated version of the 1980 Blue Angel track), ""(Hey Now) Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" (a sequel to the 1983 megasmash), and ""Come On Home.""

By 1996, this was when Cyndi was at her peak and had started to re-invent herself.  She wanted to be an ARTIST, not a ""hits"" maker.  On ""Sisters Of Avalon"", Cyndi went all over the map (but in a very good way, mind you).  There's the forceful, in your face title track.  2 other minor hits also took notice:  ""Ballad Of Cleo & Joe"" and ""Unhook The Stars.""  Sadly, this particular album was one of her most underappreciated.

Overall, this ""greatest hits"" CD covers Cyndi Lauper's timespan from 1983 to 1996.  Since then, Cyndi would release 6 more albums in 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2010.  No two records were EVER the same.  And that brings me to the 3 reasons that Cyndi is MY favorite female artist of all time.  One:  She created albums on her OWN terms and wouldn't conform to the record companies.  Two:  She played various instruments -- whatever she could find, she would put to use!  And three:  many of the songs were very euphoric and would make a person feel good about himself/herself.

So, if anyone is having a bad day, all you need to do is put on a Cyndi Lauper record and learn how to have fun.  I'm sure glad that I did!!!","Ever since the early days of MTV , I started falling in love with Cyndi Lauper 's music . She was NOT like any other artist out there .

A1EJ9BMB058DRV,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"This compilation of Cyndi Lauper is a pretty decent one, it's got some of her best songs. The only downside I can see with this, having liked a couple songs of hers before buying this, is that a couple of the songs here aren't up to par (particularly her later ones).

There are some treasures on here though and for the price, it's definitely worth picking up if you want to discover her music more or just own some of the best songs she ever made (the Goonies song for instance is amazing and not easy to find).

So for die-hard Cyndi Lauper fans, the Goonies song is probably the main attraction for you. Other than that, you may disagree with the ""greatest hits"" selection.

For people who want to explore her music more after liking a song or 2, this is perfect for you.","This compilation of Cyndi Lauper is a pretty decent one , it 's got some of her best songs .

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00136RVP2,1,1,4,"The Essential Cyndi Lauper really should have been a two CD set. While we get a good number of her biggest hits on this album, there isn't quite enough to satisfy me. Although the material that we do get is wonderful; where are some more very good tunes? At any rate, Cyndi worked hard to produce great music for her fans; and just one listen to this album proves it. In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very well done.

""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" starts the CD off with a huge number that was one of Cyndi's earliest hits. ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" celebrates women who just want to enjoy their relationships with men without long term commitments; and Cyndi delivers this like a pro! The number is full of positive energy and it's great music for dancing even today. ""Money Changes Everything"" was another early hit for Cyndi; this has that mid `80s dance flavor to it and Cyndi's really good diction enhances the number even more. ""Who Let In The Rain"" features Cyndi front and center--right where she belongs! ""Who Let In The Rain"" is a fine number that proves Cyndi can easily tackle a rock flavored ballad to make it take flight!

""She Bop"" was always one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper hits; this hit the airwaves big time during the summer of 1984 and I remember going to dances where the DJs played this very often. ""She Bop"" has a great, power-packed melody that is also rather catchy and it remains one of Cyndi Lauper's best hits ever. ""Time After Time"" also comes from the mid 1980s; and Cyndi does this wonderfully. ""I Drove All Night"" comes from Cyndi's great album entitled A Night To Remember and just one listen proves that Cyndi is a champ! ""Hat Full Of Stars"" is a ballad from the album of the same name; and listen for ""All Through The Night."" ""All Through The Night"" is one of Cyndi Lauper's best hits ever--period. The percussion enhances the musical arrangement and Cyndi's excellent diction makes her performance even better. ""All Through The Night"" is another one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper tunes and it deserves its place on this CD.

""When You Were Mine"" comes from Cyndi's first album entitled She's So Unusual; and Cyndi's cover of the song originally done by Prince really shines bright. ""True Colors"" comes from the album of the same; Cyndi does this with great sensitivity and the guitar work enhances the melody quite a bit. Awesome! ""Unhook The Stars"" plays with major and minor keys as Cyndi sings this very well; and the album ends strong with a great number from the movie The Goonies entitled ""The Goonies 'R' Good Enough."" I agree with other reviewers who write that this last number is a most welcome addition to this album.

I always liked Cyndi Lauper; so while I love the tunes on this album I must admit that it's not as complete as it should be. There should be several other songs here. Specifically, I would have wanted extra songs like ""Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China);"" ""My First Night Without You;"" ""Ballad Of Cleo & Joe;"" ""Boy Blue"" and maybe even one or two more. That's a missed opportunity; and I can only hope that we get a better Cyndi Lauper ""essential"" collection two CD set soon. Nevertheless, I still recommend this album for Lauper's fans; and it makes a great starter CD for people just discovering Cyndi's talents. It's also a fine CD for people who merely want a small sampling of Cyndi Lauper's incredible artistry.","The Essential Cyndi Lauper really should have been a two CD set .

That ambition also lead to Cyndi's activism. ""True Colors"" has become something of a gay anthem, a call to recognize yourself as the person you are. It became the Nom De'Tour of Cyndi's summer 2007 tour for the Human Rights Campaign (along with Debbie Harry and Erasure, among others), and her tireless work on behalf of the Matthew Sheppard Foundation and other causes. Her timeless music couples with her work for the future.

Her attempt to broaden the style works OK on ""Sisters of Avalon"" and ""Unhook The Stars,"" but I would have happily traded them (or ""When You Were Mine"") in for ""What's Going On."" All is forgiven however, by finally finding ""The Goonies R Good Enough"" on a proper US Cyndi Lauper CD.

AE42JLYPXUI45,B00136RVP2,1,1,5,"Cyndi Lauper has been another one of the most successful female solo artists of the early 80s. Her career started to take a fall with the release of 1989 album, A Night To Remember. After the unwanted failure of A Night To Remember (1989). In 1993, Cyndi released another album that failed entitled, Hat Full Of Stars.
  In 2003, she was able to release, The Essential Cyndi Lauper, her second greatest hits compilation since Twelve Deadly Cyns ...And Then Some (1994). I definitely call it a must-have album.
GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have loved this song since my years in middle school. I love it's fun-filled energy and I love it's crazed vibe. It's a classic all the way.
MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Another great song, but in my opinion, not among the best. I hope you know that it's True that money, in most ways, most certainly does change everything.
WHO LET IN THE RAIN
  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). The album Hat Full Of Stars (1993), as for I know, only had three songs I ever liked and they are That's What I Think, Hat Full Of Stars, and Who Let The Rain In. This is a moving ballad and I recommend that you all listen to it.
SHE BOP
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I still can't get over the fact that this one talks about female masturbation. Nobody wagged their fingers at Cyndi for making a song like this, but if Madonna recorded this song, the critics and parents would have been down her throat. This is a great song. I remember watching Cyndi's Behind The Music on VH1. When they were talking about this track and all the controversey, Cyndi said that her mother called her up and said, ""Is this song about... that?"" I was laughing for days.
TIME AFTER TIME
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have always enjoyed this song because of its moving arrangements and vocal arrangements. Everytime I see Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow dance with Alan Cumming to this song in 'Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion', I cry after laughing so hard, even though they did a great job with the choreography. I know shouldn't be laughing because they danced so great, but it's just that they chose a romantic ballad that requires slow-dancing and they decided to use ballet as their dance.
I DROVE ALL NIGHT
  From the album A Night To Remember (1989). This is one of the best songs I have heard from Cyndi Lauper and it came from the best album Cyndi Lauper has ever recorded, A Night To Remember. The album did not get the recognition it deserved, it is her best album by far.
HAT FULL OF STARS
  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). Another great song from the Hat Full Of Stars album. I knew from the moment I read the title that it would be a great song and I was right. I love it when I'm right.
CHANGE OF HEART
  From the album True Colors (1986). This is one of the three songs from the True Colors (1986) album that I like. The True Colors (1986) album is not a favorite album of mine, all though I love the front and back covers of that album. This song has a great vibe to it and the lyrics are well-written. Cyndi's voice was amazing on this one to begin with, but The Bangles', who provided back-ups, vocals thicken Cyndi's voice, making her voice sound like it has more enthusiasm.
SISTERS OF AVALON
  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). This is a good song, but it's not like her original sound. If she decided to change her sound, she shouldn't have made it sound like this. I know she has the talent to better than this.
ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). This is another song with a moving sound. The vocals are incredible, the music is incredible. Who would not love this song, except for people with no brains?
WHEN YOU WERE MINE
  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Although, this is a great song, I don't like the fact that it was originally done by Prince. I literally hate Prince with a passion. In my opinion, he's a great lyricist, but he and his music can go straight to hell because I can't stand him or his music.
TRUE COLORS
  From the album True Colors (1986). The second of three songs I like from the True Colors (1986) album. The guitar arrangements are incredible.
UNHOOK THE STARS
  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). She did reinvent her sound for the Sisters Of Avalon (1997) album and not well at all. This is a song I always skip. I can't waste my time listening to a song that sounds like crap.
THE GOONIES 'R' GOOD ENOUGH
  From the original motion picture & soundtrack The Goonies (1985). The Goonies has always been one of my favorite movies. The movie was filmed and released in 1985, the year that I was born. It's hard for me to believe that this movie is as old as I am and I still get a kick out of it. This song is amazing and Cyndi was the right choice to record it. The movie, original motion picture score, and this song all remind me of Wildwood, New Jersey. I don't know why, it just happened. This is one of the best songs from Cyndi Lauper and I'm happy to know that it was included in this incredible collection.
  If you are a Cyndi Lauper fan, then you need to buy a copy of this collection. It's worth all the money you pay and you are guaranteed to be impressed.","Cyndi Lauper has been another one of the most successful female solo artists of the early 80s .

The big complaint was that for so long, american fans couldn't get ""Good Enough"" from ""The goonies."" Well, FINALLY it's included. Whether or not Cyndi likes the song, it's an 80's movie song classic and was a top 10 hit. Eight of Cyndi's top 10 hits are on here including the classic ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", ""She Bop"", ""All Through the Night"" and ""Time After Time"" frm her debut. all four of these were massive radio hits and still heard to this day. ""True Colors"" and ""Change of Heart"" were big hits off of her sophomore album. Her last top 10 single is included too from ""A Night to Remember"" which is ""I Drove All Night"" *recently Celine Dion did an amazing cover of it.* ""Money Changes Everything"" is graciously included also which didn't hit the top 10, but was still a big top 40 hit. The non-hits are also very worthy. ""Hat Full of Stars"" is gorgeous and ""Sisters of Avalon"" is very catchy.
So why 4 stars? As outstanding as this collection is, ""What's Going On"" *a top 10 hit from ""True Colors""* was left off as was the minor hit ""Hole In My Heart."" These are minor gripes but would've really put it over the top. Still, it's a great hits collection and well worth the money.

Hole In My Heart,  You Don't Know, Ballad Of Cleo And Joe, Disco Inferno, and Shine are all left out while Unhook The Stars, and Sisters Of Avalon are included.  Not sure why they do not really make a collection with True hits and remixes of those latter hits.  Well I guess you ahd to buy the singles when they came out to get it.

The song is definitely one of those songs that still does not go out of style, even with Marvin's classic from his Motown era. I definitely still love this song so much.

ADS5APY1NKTL4,B00137G8OG,1,1,5,"If anyone is looking for an introduction to Marvin Gaye at one of his finest hours, vocally, ""Sexual Healing"" is a prime example. For starters, that hypnotic ""Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up"" hook that is softly whispered over the rhythmic beat calls us into the theme of the track. Marvin's voice is like that of an ecstatic angel living with one foot in the clouds and another in the entrance way to the bedroom. I can picture hips gyrating, beautiful women dancing in the background, red satin sheets, candles, rose petals and the whole bit.

In all my years of listening to music, never have I heard a song quite so stirring and smooth. Marvin states in no uncertain times that he is seeking some sexual healing from his partner (or partners) and is not shy about laying his cards right out there throughout the duration of the song. The song starts beautifully and truly ends too quickly.","If anyone is looking for an introduction to Marvin Gaye at one of his finest hours , vocally , "" Sexual Healing "" is a prime example .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137GHF6,1,1,5,"When it has came down to Journey, they've honestly been one of the best guilty pleasures in Rock music. While it is honestly a shame that they haven't scored well with anything new after the abrupt departure of Steve Perry, they do know that they have a legion of fans that never get tired of their classics. That is honestly the case with many of their songs including Don't Stop Believin'. The song is such a great classic of 80's Rock, that it simply never really gets too old. I love a lot of those classics that Journey made from that time, and it truly is a must to have as part of their music library, if you want it, any way you it for your MP3 Player.

this song already is changing lives and making people think! I hear on youtube a lot and in real life sometimes that, ""this song makes you think about your life..."" and ""it makes me want to change and never take anything for granted.""

now that's soul. when it touches you deep, deep down and won't let go.

for all those living under a rock, this song is about loving someone like it's the last time you'll see them. a great thing to say, but how many of us will actually and actively do this? follow through?

not enough. and that's ok! it's the human condition to take for granted things in your life, daily; friends, lovers, family, mothers, dogs and cats; hell, even ex's!

but this song is about looking at what things mean to you and what's most important. it's like a lullaby w/ a back beat! just listen to the production. i can listen to it all day and i really don't get tired of it much. alicia has helped produce a bunch of bangers; girlfriend, how come you don't call me, mr. man (2001), you don't know my name, diary, slow down, if i ain't got you, samsonite man, nobody not really, the interlude (on the album) (2003), unbreakable, every little bit hurts (2005) and finally, no one, superwoman, sure looks good to me, the thing about love, lessons learned and finally, this masterpiece. it's definitely her best track yet and i don't see her getting much better than now. but has any of her main albums ever disappointed? hardly, for the fans!

6.25 stars.","... did i mention there wo n't be a song to touch this , this year ? there seriously is n't gon na be a better song . i do n't need no psychic nor a phony like miss cleo to tell me this ! alicia 's album is pure F I R E and out of 14 tracks there 's one that i do n't listen to . classic . this song already is changing lives and making people think !

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137GK12,1,1,4,"When it comes down to it, Alicia Keys really does know how to conjure some beautiful songs. After the souful success of No One from As I Am, her fourth album, she shows absolutely no signs of ending her reign in R&B. Her latest single, Like You'll Never See Me Again, the second single from that album shows a softer side from her voice that remains strong from the soul, and still shows a pitch in her voice that has grown with her style in writing. I really think this one follows the way No One helped make As I Am shine. This track works better than anything from wannabe artists like Fantasia or Jordan Sparks. I definitely know Alicia really will make her next single just as good as this one.

This list starts simple enough with the title traits , but quickly extends to a series of qualities as unrealistic as the airbrushed qualities of a centerfold .

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00137IDUS,1,1,5,"Cake is a unique group to say the least, where the singer doesn't sing, he just talk to a rhythm and a beat. However, this arrangement and quirk works perfectly for them and their style. Can you imagine a song like this being sung by anybody else?

This song is about what girl the singer wants, and it's a rather long list, and like a child's Christmas list, it starts off general and reasonable, but by the end it gets very specific, ""She's changing her name/From Kitty to Karen/She's trading her MG/For a white Chrysler LeBaron/I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket."" And when the song gets to the Na Na Na Na Na part, then you're instantly hooked, dancing, and singing. This song is amazingly catchy, and brilliant. You won't hear lyrics like these from Beyonce, or anybody else, except for Weird Al.

Overall, a great song that shine with its subtle poise, humor, wit and brilliance. This is a excellent song not only for Cake, but for music in general.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00137IDW6,1,1,5,"After her radio-friendly first album that just seemed too much like it was hacked over and created by a producer, rather than an artist, Clarkson comes out with this track, the best from her album, and the best of her career thus far. This song really brings out the best of Clarkson, and to my knowledge, it's not a breakup song, so there's no anger, just plain Kelly and her vocals. The song is well-crafted, the lyrics are good, and the vocals shine.

I'll always remember the song by a little moment I had with the song a few years back. Riding through Orlando, Florida at 4 o' clock in the morning, moving to my new house in NC, I was flipping through the radio and came to this song. And there I listened to it, in the back seat of a car, the lights of Orlando outside, and I just stared out my window. That's the atmosphere this song creates. And the song is a classic, and Clarkson's best in its own right.","After her radio - friendly first album that just seemed too much like it was hacked over and created by a producer , rather than an artist , Clarkson comes out with this track , the best from her album , and the best of her career thus far .

For some strange reason Amazon encoded this song at the bizarre rate of 247 kpbs. No matter, buy this song! Listen to the fade out at the end of the song. James sings ""I feel good"" as a reference to his 1965 popular song. Also, James's reference to ""Eddie Murphy eat your heart out"".

AK0CENM3LUM28,B00137GGZC,1,1,5,"Hips Don't Lie (Shakira) / B00137GGZC

Shakira is a truly talented singer and dancer, and this song definitely shows off her lovely voice and the dance rhythms that she is rightly famous for. I don't really care for the duet aspect of the song - I would have been much happier with more Shakira singing and a lot less Wyclef (nothing against the man, I just prefer her voice to his), but I still love the song and can't hear it enough. The beat is so compelling and alluring, it's hard to *not* dance when this comes on. Give it a listen and see for yourself.

Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.

Throw in a straight up metal jam in the middle that sounds like an entirely different song, with Buck Dharma squeezing the last note of his solo to death as the majestic riff returns, ushering in the final verse, and you have an exhilarating rock classic.  Long before every band mixed genres, Blue Oyster Cult was boldly embracing folk rock (heavily electrified), heavy metal, the cowbell, and unabashed romance, and then compacting them all into five minutes of genius.

Classic guitar riff, anyone who plays rock guitar has probably practiced it at some point in their lives. And of course there is the COWBELL! That SNL sketch was so brilliant, Christopher Walken 'THE Bruce Dickinson.' Yeah, the cowbell is fairly non-stop but it's low in the mix and often falls into a sonic blind spot so it tunes in and out of my consciousness. I think I almost typed couscousness there, ha ha that's what I was thinking...weird.

The guitar solo is pretty classic as well. Sometimes I wish they hadn't let the last note sustain so far into the verse, but not a deal breaker, Blue yster Cult. What a great name for a band. When I was younger, I thought they were scary, based on the cover of the 45 I had of Burnin for You. Ha ha, these guys are goofy. Where does one find blue oysters anyhow?

Everything is restrained until the wonderfully explosive guitar interlude about two and a half minutes in.

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B00137ILRS,1,1,5,"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad ""Total Eclipse of the Heart""; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.

Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.

""And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever

Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly.

Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B00137ILRS,1,1,5,"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad ""Total Eclipse of the Heart""; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.

Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.

""And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say

A young boy's mother sending over thing to this lonely old man. A young boy sitting on the porch swing listening to the wisdom that his friend has earned. Passing on the wisdom he learn from reading the bible; ""the words written in red"" was mentioned. Some versions of the bible had Jesus's words printed in red, so the bible reader knew who was speaking. This old man said to the boy, he would see his wife and child soon. He also said as he aged he drew more strengh from the words written in red.  He didn't believe that life ended in a slow ride in a hearse.  He knew of a place that Jesus said he would prepare for his followers who remain faithful a place where his own wife and child were already there.

Then the Boy grows up and he is in college, his Mom and he were talking about the thing happening in the small town he grew up in. Finally she tells her son that the old man who was his best friend had died.

Later in bed that night he says to himself, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry.  He knew his old friend was home with his family he had lost so long ago. I would guess the young man did a bit of both, laughing and crying.","I purchased this song or album or both , because it tell of a old man , a veteran who lost his wife and child during the time he was off serving his country .

If you like pop-rock and haven't heard this yet, I strongly recommend it! Kelly's vocal power is shown once again, and that keeps me coming back to this album about once or so a week.

Walk Away's video is silly too. The lyrics are a bit grown up on one specific line but most have already heard this on the radio more than once before.

AK0CENM3LUM28,B00137KSGU,1,1,5,"Beautiful Liar (Beyonce & Shakira) / B0018Q16DU

Beyonce and Shakira both have incredible voices, so this duet is nothing short of perfect blend of perfect talent, and is worth listening to for that fact alone. But I also dearly like the lyrics - the song is between two women who find out that the man they trusted has been seeing them both, secretly. Instead of the more common musical fight over who will win him in the end (see Brandy's lovely&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boy-Is-Mine/dp/B000007NCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boy Is Mine</a>), Beyonce and Shakira ask one another if they can't just consider themselves lucky for finding out when they did, and can't they just laugh it off and go on with their lives? What, really, have they 'lost' beyond a ""beautiful liar""?

What's really meaningful is that though the two women recognize that the best response would be to shrug the whole thing off and move on, it's clear that this response is by no means easy and that the process is still unfairly agonizing to both women. It's a rare song that manages to be empowered without being trite, and realistic without being overwhelmed with self-pity.

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00137MFXY,1,1,5,"Judging by the reviews left on this song, it seems that many people were introduced to it via the TV show ""Supernatural.""  While I'd heard the song before, thanks to both my mom (a music nut) and a school bus driver who insisted on keeping the radio on an oldies station all the time, I didn't particularly love it until I, too, started watching ""Supernatural.""  For a show whose focus was on two brothers hunting demons, vampires, ghosts, and other creepy creatures, it certainly features a LOT of classic rock and older but still awesome music.  And at the end of every season the show plays a recap of the season's events right before the season finale... and said recap is invariably accompanied by this stirring number.

I haven't listened to anything else by Kansas, but if ""Carry On Wayward Son"" is any indication, they were a pretty epic band.  ""Carry On Wayward Son"" balances out the more energetic portions of the song with some slightly slower, more low-key bridges that have an almost thoughtful sound to them, and are mostly piano instead of the guitar-and-drums of the rest.  Not all songs can hit this balance successfully, so props to the songwriters for this.  And while no ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" it is a lot more musically complex than most songs of today.  Whatever happened to these songwriters anyhow...

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00137KS2O,1,1,5,"When you are in love, you can feel this song 5 fold. If you're not in love, but a dreamer like me, then you aren't left out.

Alicia picked a good single. Making it her first, to me, at first wasn't the smartest because this was not the song that impacted me on the first listen. The keyboard (or organ) in it is fantastic but it just wasn't what we were used to with her...it was really different. And the video was kinda too.

But the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love with the song! Her voice was (and still is!) very, very heartfelt. It starts out with your basic piano arrangement; pretty; lulling; uncomplicated. Then comes in the ""organ"" and it's nice; fitting. But you continue on, hear the chorus twice, and then the beautiful bridge comes in, and once you've heard it about 5x, you sing along;

""I know-ow....some people search the world..."" ""To fi-ind...somethin' like what we H A A A A V E."" ""I know-ow...people will try...try to define...somethin' so R E E A L. So till the end of time...I'm tellin' you that...No one...""

And that's the part that grips you, and makes you continue to sing it, along with Alicia...

Great tune. Will get stuck in your head after a few listens.

4.5 stars.

End Note: Great tune. Might have to sink in after repeated listens.

Another message - and the main reason why this is an important song for parents, guardians and youth leaders to share - is that when a young woman engages in premarital sex, it isn't always about sex. I believe that, sadly, these lyrics ring True for many females:

She is yearning for shelter and affection
That she never found at home
She is searching for a hero to ride in
To ride in to save the day
And in walks her Prince Charming
And he knows just what to say
Momentary lapse of reason
And she gives herself away

 She is yearning for shelter and affection 
 That she never found at home 
 She is searching for a hero to ride in 
 To ride in to save the day And in walks her Prince Charming 
 And he knows just what to say 
 Momentary lapse of reason 
 And she gives herself away 

 This song is an enlightening truth for Christians with a message of hope for lost and lonely people ."

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B00137MMAU,1,1,5,"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic ""Un-break My Heart""; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, ""Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain..."" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.

Braxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, ""Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!"" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like ""Mourning Becomes Electra"" with the lights turned down.

This in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.

Angel

By Sarah McLachlan

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay

There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard, at the end of the day

I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins

And maybe empty
Oh, and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don't make no difference
Escape one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was fairly cheap on Amazon....69 cents, I think?  But most of the songs I download are free..  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

It has been over 20 years since Toni Braxton took on the music industry, and her success as a part of Laface records still has been a cornerstone of what great female R&B music is absolute;y like. Un-Break My Heart, is honestly one of Toni's masterpieces from the sensual Secrets record. The song is definitely one of those songs that blends beauty, voice and soulfulness all into one, which Diane Warren had beautifully wrote for her. The song is absolutely one of a kind, and still sounds much more beautiful every time I heart it. Something that acts like Rihanna, Mariah Carey and Beyonce' Knowles could take a real page on that female songstresses did like Toni back then. If you have never heard a Toni Braxton song before, this is really the one to go to first. I sincerely recommend it.

AK0CENM3LUM28,B00137MSX6,1,1,5,"Irreplaceable (Beyonce) / B001BKPZPI

Beyonce has the voice of an angel, and this slow beat song really showcases her talents. A fantastic affirmation 'break up' song, the vocalist is in the process of quietly, calmly, and firmly throwing her love interest out of her life. The man in question, who has been unTrue, is blustering loudly that no one can ever replace him in her life, and that she is making a big mistake, and she retorts that he is so foolish that he can't even recognize that SHE is the irreplaceable one, not he. Perfect for anyone who's ever had a painfully similar choice to make.

Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

LYRICS:

I'll be your dream
I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope I'll be your love
Be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do
I will be strong I will be faithful
'cause I'm counting on
A new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

I want to stand with you on
a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining
brightly in the velvet sky,
I'll make a wish send it to heaven
Then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the
pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the
comfort and protection of

The highest powers
In lonely hours
The tears devour you

Oh can you see it baby?
You don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right
before you
All that you need will surely come

I'll be your dream I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope I'll be your love
Be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00137MTF8,1,1,5,"""Smooth"" is a very fun and great pop/rock song done beautifully by Carlos Santana.  I remember being in my senior year in high school when I heard this song. When I saw the video to this song being played on one of the music channels there was something about it that drew me on(I just wish that I can remember if it was VH1 or MTV). Carlos made the right decision when he selected Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty to sing the vocals (Rob has a great singing voice). The reason why I say this is because I noticed that in the music video Rob Thomas really put his spirit and emotion in giving the musical ""Smooth"" a vibrant life of its own. ""Smooth"" is a gorgeous song about a man who is willing to change his life to accomodate the woman he loves, and he is asking the woman in his life to make up her mind about him. He makes this clear with the clever and catchy lyrics ""so give me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it). I love and enjoy listening to Rob Thomas's vocals in this song. In addition, I was imagining who this song was for, especially when Rob Thomas did a good job of using his voice of emphasizing the lyrics ""my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa"" When I found out later on that it was for his wife Marisol Thomas I was very moved and thought that was romantic and heartwarming. I say this because ""Smooth"" came out in 1999. It is posted online that they met in 1998 and married in 1999. At the time of this writing, they are still married (which I think is so beautiful by the way, may they enjoy more joyful and loving years together). I admit that part of the reason why I still find this song enjoyable to listen to is because I enjoy hearing Rob Thomas's singing (Rob's music and vocals first drew me in with the 1997 Matchbox 20 musical hit ""Push""). The best way to choose whether you are going to love this song is if you enjoy music by either Rob Thomas, Carlos Santana, and/or romantic alternative rock songs.",""" Smooth "" is a very fun and great pop / rock song done beautifully by Carlos Santana .

A2W73JAQ4AVCNJ,B00137OD52,1,1,5,"This review is for the single ""Me And Bobby McGee"" as sung by Janis Joplin, lyrics and by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster.

Kristofferson and Joplin had a close personal relationship and, while the song was not written explicitly for her, the tune fits Ms. Joplin's style very well.

Her voice is neither smooth nor melodic - it reminds me very much of Billie Holliday's voice.  And, like Lady Day, with Ms. Joplin it isn't about the tonality she brings to her work; it's the (to coin a too-oft used word) soul she expends when singing.

Many singers can bring feeling into a ballad; very few can make the listener want to weep in sympathy with the singer's obvious pain and loneliness.  Sinatra, most certainly; he spent over 60 years with his main theme being loneliness (or the brief intermission of a new love before loneliness returned).  Billie Holliday; her life was filled with pain both physical and emotional and she brought every ounce of it into her work.  And Janis Joplin, whose body of work is small in the number of recordings but huge in the personality she embedded in the canon.

""Me And Bobby McGee"" (recorded a few days before Ms. Joplin's death in 1970) is a fine example of her music.  While the writing may not be necessarily on a par with, for instance, Cole Porter's work one must consider the different genre that Messrs. Kristofferson and Foster worked in.

I highly recommend this recording - with the caveat that I have a personal emotional tie in to the record.  I was freshly back in the United States (just a few months) from the Vietnam war when Ms. Joplin passed away leaving this last piece with which to be remembered and her passing hit me with nearly the force of a physical blow. I had listened to her songs when I was with the U.S. Army and her loss at the age of 27 was hard to deal with - even though I had never met her in person.

Others who do not have direct experience of the 1960's may not bring the memories that those of us who lived through it to songs of that era - but I think that this particular song of Ms. Joplin's has stood the test of time and stands on it's own merit.

The song is absolutely very bold and brilliant from what the song captures through Toni's voice, and is honestly one of my favorites from Toni top to bottom. While people will always go back into Diane's other big one from Toni, Un-Break My Heart, this song is definitely worth a deep listen from the seductive soul. Tell you the truth, the song was originally written for Celine Dion, but a good thing she passed it up. While many people overshadowed Pulse, this pulse of a intimate guitar is the best from Toni's heat anyday.

While her debut single Tattoo was a fair song, it just hasn't shown that she has stood out well to compete with greats like Alicia Keys or newcomer Chrisette Michele. Her second single from that album, No Air with rising Hip Hop star Chris Brown, doesn't work well either. While the song has a fairly nice beat, it just doesn't seem to be an everlasting song that stands out. On top of that, the duet doesn't actually show that there is complete chemistry like other classics. I just honestly think she has a good talent, but needs to find better footing for the long run. Her next single needs to do a much better job at sealing the deal.

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00137QW4M,-1,1,4,"And I don't think she's writing any of her material but that's OK for now. She just started out.

But my point with the title was that Tattoo was safe. So safe that it bored me. I think I thought it was ""cute"" the first time I heard it but I still haven't seen the video and I don't care. I don't think I'll ever care for that song EVER.

And that's fine with me.

But this single...I heard it a few times and was like ""I like it. I really do.""

It's much more...her. I think. Still don't ""know"" the girl! But it just seems a bit less predictable. Sure, this love thing is tried and True to death, but this song is catchier to me, the production a LOT nicer (like a floating, ""this can't be real"" kinda feel) and it shows more vocal power. I will say at the end though, Jordin literally shrieks a note and it's just too loud. That could've been left out but if you don't mind belting, then this song is good pop music.

The vibe, playful and youthful (the eldest, Chris is only 18 after all).

And even though some of you are sick to DEATH of him (me excluded), Chris does a good vocal job here too. After hearing the SMASH, ""With You"" and a few of his older tracks, I can tell that even though they had no hand in the writing of this track, that at least Chris feels his part. Surely, Jordin does too.

I wish her luck in the future although I heard her album wasn't that great. Guess I didn't miss much!

3.9 stars (compared to the measly 2.25 i awarded the first single, Tattoo).

End note: I like Jordin. She's a sweety, got's a good set of pipes and she's damn pretty. However, I did have many gripes with her actually winning because although she was more marketable than Melinda (who got ROBBED!!!!!!), she didn't have the pipes like her nor quite like Lakisha.

It was sad.

But she won. It's over. Great voice. Hope to see her co-write 2 songs (at least) next go round and I wish her happiness. No surprises here.","And I do n't think she 's writing any of her material but that 's OK for now . She just started out . But my point with the title was that Tattoo was safe .

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00137QSKA,1,1,5,"Words can only partly describe the classic that this song is.  This musical track is a very energetic and dance/pop creation about someone imagining what it would be like to be the lover of someone that they really desire.  Sophie puts alot of soul and energy in this song in a very creative and intense way.  I love how she paints a good story in her songs such as when she mentions while singing that she had a dream that she was the hero of the one she very much wants. She also makes it fun by mentioning about making her fantasy lover ""feel much better"". What makes this musical track even more appealing is that Sophie sings really beautiful vocals to go along with the great lyrics to the song. ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover"" compares to two of the following other songs of Sophie B. Hawkins in a good way:
""As I Lay Me Down""- A great musical track about how she appreciates her lover and intends to always be happy.  This is such a beautiful song, and the video I saw to this on youtube is very good.
""Right Beside You""- This is also another song that showcases her gorgeous voice, and she sings with the same passion and great spirit as ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover.""

  If you happen to like ""As I Lay Me Down"" and/or ""Right Beside You"" then it is most likely that you are going to the fine musical melody that is ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover"".","Words can only partly describe the classic that this song is .

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00137RGS8,1,1,5,"Recently I decided to download this song on my zune player after being captivated by the sound and savoring it.  It turns out that the vocals are sung by Trace Cyrus (Miley Cyrus's older brother).  Although Trace is only 19 years old he really sings this song in a very self confident and mature way.  Admittedly this is a song that you may not want to expose to somebody that is under 13 because the song has sexual undertones to it.  The reason why I say this is because the song still has appropriate language to it but he sings about being on the bed with someone and their clothes on the floor (to his credit creatively).  He also suggests in the song how he will take someone home if he's not left at the front door.  However what makes the song great is that he sings the song creatively, self confidently, and narratively.  The reason why is say that he sings this narratively is because it sounds like he is telling a short story about charming someone he is interested in while making sure to combine the singing in seamlessly.  I agree with the others that say this is a good workout song too because the music is really  upbeat and sounds like something you can easily dance to in the club or a party.  It was also featured on one of the reality tv shows I was watching on mtv one night that features Lauren Conrad.  All in all if you are fine with songs that have a dance pop twist and you are curious to listen to how Trace Cyrus sounds then in my opinion you will like this song.","Recently I decided to download this song on my zune player after being captivated by the sound and savoring it .

This could be the surprise song of the year, in a year full of surprises, because let's admit it, did anybody see this song becoming a national hit? I think it says something about the state of dance music. I mean, any top 10 hit is given a BPM, and sent to the clubs, and sometimes your radio. These songs are cheap shots at great music, and I take them as an insult. I mean, I can't tell whether we're supposed to dance or laugh at these ""re-mixes.""

""Shake It"" is simple on the verses, which is typical of Metro Station, but they bring it on the chorus, and they bring it home in a big way. The chorus is catchy, fun, happy and it could start a new dance craze, if their was more of a dance to create.

So overall, the verses aren't that great, but the chorus is what makes the song. It might not be original, but it's fun. Here's to the continued success of ""Shake It"" and Metro Station. And remember, get your groove on and ""Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake It!""","No , Beyonce or J.Lo . did not make this song , nor is it in yo face sexual .

I mean , any top 10 hit is given a BPM , and sent to the clubs , and sometimes your radio . These songs are cheap shots at great music , and I take them as an insult . I mean , I ca n't tell whether we 're supposed to dance or laugh at these "" re - mixes . "" 

 "" Shake It "" is simple on the verses , which is typical of Metro Station , but they bring it on the chorus , and they bring it home in a big way . The chorus is catchy , fun , happy and it could start a new dance craze , if their was more of a dance to create . So overall , the verses are n't that great , but the chorus is what makes the song . It might not be original , but it 's fun . Here 's to the continued success of "" Shake It "" and Metro Station . And remember , get your groove on and "" Shake , Shake , Shake , Shake , Shake It !

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00137T4WE,1,1,5,"It is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary Whitney Houston, and you cannot commence how beautfiul and soulful her voice showcased to many boundaries. But with I Wanna Dance With Somebody, helping her sophmore album, Whitney, become the first by a female artist to debut at #1 on Billboard. The song is a beautiful anthem that still remains classy and True to her sound. Sadly, though with Whitney passing away on the 25th anniversary of Whitney debuting at #1 on Billboard, it is so hard to celebrate her right now, without grieveing for all of her fans and myself too. While Lady Gaga paid homage to Whitney with Fashion Of His Love for her album Born This Way, nothing will ever replace the smile, joy and love Whitney Houston had with that song, and Whitney will always want to dance with somebody. Now, she is dancing up there with her dad, John Houston whom died 9 years ago. One day, will we all want to dance together with Whitney.

Suddenly , if only temporarily , our sight was focused on the bravery and unselfishness of our military members and we felt a rush of pride as we listened . Here was a song that was not about drugs ... not about sex ... not about money ... it was a song about Americans , both black and white , who were ready to give their all for the rest of us . For a moment we forgot about the troubles ... forgot about the turmoil ... forgot about our differences ... and remembered our heritage . For a moment we were in Camelot ... and the Great Society was real ."

A3SDCMI9Q0XJOO,B00137URS4,1,1,4,"Great song, cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy. In the review for the song itself, allmusic.com wrote ""The lush power ballad ""The Flame"" was penned by two British songwriters, but the band made it their own with Robin Zander's sobbing vocal dramatics and the haunting tones of Rick Nielsen's mandocello chiming behind the guitar and keyboard backing. The lyrics, almost always an afterthought in romantic power ballads, often hint at the Police/""Every Breath You Take""'s school of disguising unhealthy obsession as sentimentality; the singer, unable to let go of his first love, which can be taken either as a scorned lover trying to see his failed romance as somehow cosmically ordained anyway, or as a vaguely disturbing intimation of stalking. It's more likely that the latter interpretation was completely unintentional, though, since the band's straight-ahead reading plays up the heartstring-tugging bombast. It was a perfect fit for the late-'80s' power ballad/happy pop radio, and it was much better crafted than many similar offerings from the same period (most of which were by bands who had been influenced, indirectly or otherwise, by Cheap Trick themselves). While it isn't the most inventive song the band ever recorded, ""The Flame"" is an undeniable part of their legacy, and a well-deserved, better-late-than-never, chart-topping popular success","Great song , cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase .

While her vocals are still good, it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing.

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00137V1SY,1,-1,2,"And I say that SO loosely.

This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.

I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.

First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).

Altogether, I just don't appreciate either of them ripping the Irreplaceable beat off though.

Come on! We heard it ENOUGH in 2006/2007!!!

Second. I will never forget you/You're in everything I do/

(Later)

Just like a tattoo/I'll always have you

For last years victor, Jordin Sparks, she has shown some growth with her debut single Tattoo. The song is a ballad that is fair, but doesn't really show that she stands out unlike past victors like Carrie Underwood did with Before He Cheats. The song isn't a bad one to listen to from Jordin, but she hasn't shown that she stands out completely from the other former contenders.

I don't think I've ever heard such a mechanical sounding background to an otherwise decent song and excellent vocals.  Jordin has such a beautiful voice, and she sings this song so well, it's too bad that every other aspect of this song has no human element whatsoever.

The parts that have that electronic kick drum sound firing off in rapid succession really take the cake (and drive me up a wall).  Every part of the music is so 'perfect', I mean there's not one note even slightly out of place.

In her future recordings, I hope she strays away from these types of songs, even if they happen to be the 'in' thing right now, because she has too good of a voice to waste it on any thing other than beautiful, emotional, human music.","I wonder , is there such a thing as TOO tight ... as far as music goes ?

During those same years, Williams was a dominent force on the Album charts as well. He placed nearly 30 albums in the Top 100 and many of these albums remained on the charts for a year or more! Andy Williams was also the host of his own highly rated variety show on NBC for nearly a decade. You might be surprised to learn that ""Moon River"" was never released as a single.

I must admit that I dismissed this because I was tired of Brit. I was sick of seeing her everywhere and the life that she has led recently has been. Well you know about that!

But this is on the song. The product. To be fair.

It's catchy. And you wanna move. If you don't, you're thinking about it, or you're one of the few that it will have little to no effect on.

It's nothing deep but it's fun. And some people will indeed dance to it. The beat is memorable. But don't expect the old ""I'm not a girl/Hit me baby, one more time Britney...""

The sounds here are more synthesized.

I'm not afraid to say that if someone lent this to me (the album) I'd review it honestly.

I was one of those quick to hate it because it was her. But I'm glad she's trying to recover (in life).

3.9 stars.

end note: Her voice is essentially the same. BUT ON THE ALBUM, there are electronic workings so it doesn't sound like the Brit from her 2001 album, and prior. But the single is still damn catchy.","Even when they 're up against the wall . ""

I remember in 1989 when this song came out I thought the radio station I listened to would wear it out playing it all the time. The reason why I like this song is because it's not to hard rock or too pop, it's perfect. It has a great message and one you can play just about everywhere. I recommend this song too anybody even if your not a fan of Alice Cooper this song ROX. BTW another one of his I like is the song he did for Friday the 13th, Red Hot Summer, these two songs are is best.

Thanks,

While the groups' career has dwindled in the past several years, it still can be just as intimate as when they came alive during that time. It has been 25 years since their debut single I'll Still Be Loving You from their first record, Wheels, which is a part of their 1998 greatest hits record. The song still sounds just as intimate and down to Earth, as it did back 25 years ago. It is a great have your MP3 library if you've been one all these years, or you're new to Restless Heart's music, and just very tired of the overplayed dance acts from Lady Gaga & Beyonce'.

A10DNCYK7YISHU,B000QZWZ2A,-1,1,5,"'The Soul Purpose' was an exceptionally good release from 7L & Eso that was really unfairly hated upon.  It was a 20 track CD filled with a lot of good songs (""Speaking Real Words"" ""Jealous Over Nothing"", accompanied by some average tracks (""You Know The Concept"" ""Mic Mastery""), and a few that didn't come all that well (""Guestlist"")...  It probably was hated upon because of Eso's previous cyborg-android scientific type of material switched over to a cocky arrogant battler with simpler rhyming schemes.
Where ever there were mistakes on 'The Soul Purpose', 'Dangerous Connection' not only corrects them, but PERFECTS everything on the album!  Every single track is banging on this album!!  7L's mediocre production has improved exponentially and Esoteric's flow just compliments the beats even more.  Plus if you felt that there was too much battle type of material on the last album, 'Dangerous Connection' comes with a bunch of good conceptual songs...
""Terrorist's Cell"" - first off ANYTHING produced by Stoupe (jedi mind tricks) will have an off the wall type of beat.  Esoteric's lyrics explain the mind of a 9/11 terrorist going through with his crusade... but after finally seeing his wrongdoing it's too late... This is not only a controversial song, but it is executed INCREDIBLY well (the re-play button will be on this for a few times)...
""Word Association"" - another creative track where Esoteric raps about being a psychotic patient rapping 'word association' with a doctor.  A very humorous track...
""Stalker"" - a hilarious tale about a guy who stalks teenage girls that he has fantasies of... this runs along the same type of humor ""Jealous over Nothing"" had...
""Herb"" - along with teenyboppers and Nelly fans, herbs are something else I detest.  Esoteric arrogantly defines the term herb all throughout the track ...
""Rest In Peace"" - a clever concept song where Eso rhymes about himself passing on and how his music ALL OF A SUDDEN is known, and how there are album profit problems among his family and friends...
And the rest of the tracks are the usual Esoteric battle/android type of material... NOTHING on this material is WEAK by any means (there are no blunders like Guestlist)...  The ONLY thing that annoyed me about this CD is that it was kinda short in comparison with Soul Purpose.  But the REALLY hot beats and rhymes make up for the length... remember its QUALITY folks not QUANTITY

""Beautiful"" is one of the most exquisite, uplifting and moving songs I've ever heard. Christina Aguilera handles this song by Linda Perry wonderfully; she sings the lyrics with genuine passion and that's grand.

The musical arrangement, especially with that cello, fits in perfectly with Christina's vocals.

The message of the song is that anyone struggling with a lack of self-esteem should remember that inner beauty counts for quite a lot and that other people's criticism and lack of respect for someone should be ignored as long as they're a good person on the inside.

I highly recommend this song. It's one of Christina Aguilera's best songs ever; just one listen proves it!","--words by Linda Perry and sung here by Christina Aguilera

I personally didn't like MASH as much as my siblings, it wasn't until I got older and was off to college that I started to watch the reruns late in the evening, the ones where Klinger didn't wear dresses anymore. Klinger actually became my favorite character. I guess at that point I started paying more attention to it, and was also more forgiving of the relentless puns. some of those were so cringe-worthy that I would want to leave the room. I always thought the song was cool, but it wasn't until i learned later that it had words to it. after hearing it with vocals, I started paying more attention to the show itself. also whenever the instrumental played I could now feel the inate sadness behind it.

AHKO7A2ZJJ3VD,B001382L6O,1,1,5,"I had never heard this song before.  It is refreshing to hear a completely new Christmas song.  Two vocalists trade off on this piece (female and male), accompanied by guitar, drum, strings orchestration, and clarinet here and there (I believe).  There's also an blues-style electric organ in the background.

The rhythm is good and pretty evenly paced throughout.  Interesting mix of classical strings, acoustic guitar, blues electric organ and a jazzy clarinet. Each providing a light touch of different genres. Who would have thought of putting this all together and that it would blend well. I like the voices, the male voice is baritone and has a slightly rough edge that is an interesting contrast to his female counterpart (and doesn't sound like all the other male voices I've heard). This could easily have been a non-Christmas piece.

It sold one million copies. That's no surprise. From its bass line to lyrics that capture teenage life, ""Rock On"" is quintessential 1970s rock. Essex gets it done, though, with references to James Dean, blue suede shoes and other 1950s symbols.

Sing along.

A3LEN0P07MGJE2,B00138D2AI,1,1,5,"Jim Nabors has a fantastic classic baritone voice. With this CD and with The Best of Jim Nabors, I think I have a True ""Best of"" collection. The only songs overlapping are The Impossible Dream, The Lord's Prayer, You'll Never Walk Alone, Try to Remember, My Cup Runneth Over, and Sunrise, Sunset and I don't mind hearing those four a couple of times.

The Impossible Dream is such a moving song and it is handled beautifully here. Somewhere, My Love is another floating song that with Jim Nabors singing the powerful waltz beat becomes less of a trite jangle.

Other favorites are Love Is Blue and Jean.

I think if you enjoy older songs and a strong male voice, you might like this CD. For people thinking about Jordan Smith fans and wondering what else they might like, this might be a good choice if they don't mind classic older songs.","Jim Nabors has a fantastic classic baritone voice .

But while their debut was a wonderful collection of terrific songs--""Evil Ways, ""Jingo,"" ""Persuasion""--they were an even better live band.

The only nod to jazz is the Porgy & Bess number ""My Man's Gone Now"".  Although Ms. Simone can tend to be self indulgent at times, she reins in that tendency here with a selection of songs (4 are self penned) that really fit the Blues theme which is very fitting to her style and persona.  The arrangements are also excellent with a tight band that supports but does not overwhelm the songs - no strings, no brass.
My favorite thing here is a rollicking barrelhouse version of ""House of the Rising Sun"", completely unlike the version made famous by The Animals.  While not everything works as well as that, there is never any doubt about NS's commitment to the material.","Nina Simone has always been difficult to classify although this album is pretty close to a straight ahead R&B / Soul outin with some vocal pop thrown in .

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00138D1RC,1,1,5,"Much as it was somewhat intimidating when first eyeballing the recorded catalogs of Stevie Wonder and Miles Davis when I was younger,a similar reaction occurred when eyeballing the breadth and scope of Nina Simone's music. At a time when the world of protest music was largely expressed through folk singers such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs,Nina Simone was one of the very few people to write and sing about the social concerns of the civil rights movement from an insiders perspective. Her distinctive musical style led the way for many generations of jazz and soul music,from the 70's funk era up to the socially aware end of the hip-hop/neo-soul scene today. Interestingly enough,she did all of this by being something of a creative non conformist. So this is the first Nina Simone album I ever put my hands on. And here's how I see it.

  Conceptually this album is quite literal as she explores the blues. This is a genre she might have been mildly embarrassed about. Yet she understood it's True purpose to such a strong degree that ""Do I Move You"",her own composition that starts out the album in a manner that she has a full command of the form and authenticity of it's message. On ""Day And Night"",her own ""I Want A Little Sugar In My Bowl"",""Buck"" and  the ballad ""Since I Feel For You"" she is throwing down some heavy soul with the likes of musicians Eric Gale and Bernard Purdie. Her lyrical and vocal expression reflect both personal and physical longing in almost equal measure. On ""Backlash Blues"" she's back to the 12 bar end of things. Co-written with Langston Hughes,this song realistically deals with the socio-economic inequities bought on from racism that,sadly we're still very much dealing with in the present day.

  While that is a personal favorite of mine here,another is her take of ""House Of The Rising Sun"",interpreted with the full gospel power of the sanctified church and not the typically folksy take on the song whatsoever. She ends the album with ""Blues For Mama"",her collaboration with Abbey Lincoln dealing with unfaithful and abusive men. Of the bonus tracks,the standout for me is the uptempo soul of ""Whatever I Am,You Made Me"". Much as with Miles Davis,the in your face assertiveness of Nina Simone pours out through your brash and sometimes howling vocal instrument and projects an attitude that may not be everyone's cup of tea. However for those who hunger for the soul laid bare,Nina Simone stands out among the Etta James and Aretha Franklin's of her era for her naked expressions of emotion and consciousness. An absolutely revelatory album and highly recommended to those just getting into Nina's music.","Much as it was somewhat intimidating when first eyeballing the recorded catalogs of Stevie Wonder and Miles Davis when I was younger , a similar reaction occurred when eyeballing the breadth and scope of Nina Simone 's music .

Let's just say it allows me to return to a better time when my sons were still kids, my marriage hadn't broken up, and life was a whole lot less complicated.

Sometimes, a little nostalgia does the soul good.","This song was bought as part of the content for ' The 80s Ate My Brain ' Cloud folder .

A1ALPL858XSDE,B00138F364,1,1,5,"Clint Black arrived on the country charts in 1989, the same year Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, and Travis Tritt released debut albums.  Black's Killin' Time initially established him as the biggest of the new stars, with hits like ""A Better Man,"" ""Nobody's Home,"" and the title track.
 These songs showcased Black's clever wordplay amid fairly traditional honky tonk arrangements and a Haggardesque vocal style. While it wasn't long before Black was surpassed commercially by Brooks and Jackson, his music maintained a high standard during his RCA tenure that was highlighted by 29 top ten hits.
 Black's two Greatest Hits volumes were both frustrating affairs whose new material - aside from the haunting chart-topper ""Like The Rain"" - was subpar.  This chronologically arranged, 20-track collection concentrates on his biggest chart hits, including the lush ""Loving Blind"" and the heartbreaking ""Where Are You Now"" (number ones inexplicably left off those other sets).
 The only non-single found here is the jazzy Bruce Hornsby duet ""Dixie Lullaby.""  As it sounds a lot like the enclosed Steve Wariner pairing ""Been There"" (which it precedes), its selection is suspect.  Had the compilers included ""When I Said I Do"" - Black's award winning, # 1 collaboration with wife Lisa Hartman - instead, this retrospective might have merited its Ultimate title.","Clint Black arrived on the country charts in 1989 , the same year Garth Brooks , Alan Jackson , and Travis Tritt released debut albums .

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B00138F11Q,1,1,5,"As the title might imply, this is a very mellow album that might send you to sleep if you are in any way tired. But if you were to fall asleep while this CD is playing, you'd miss some great music. The book from which Shawn selected these carols and lullabies obviously contains many songs that are rarely heard these days, making this particularly interesting for those looking for something different, though there one song here that is famous all around the world - Silent night, which works as a lullaby as well as a carol.

The opening track, In the bleak midwinter, is a wonderful old English carol and it's great to hear this sung by an American - a rare occurrence. Rocking is another old English carol, one that is particularly suited to this album, being both a holiday song and a lullaby. All through the night is a carol I've heard before but recordings of it seem to be even rarer than Rocking and In the bleak midwinter.

Elsewhere, there are beautiful songs such as Windy nights (words by Robert Louis Stevenson), All the pretty li'l horses, Little road to Bethlehem and Love came down at Christmas. The final track is Close your eyes, so it seems that Shawn really does want you to fall asleep after that.

This is definitely not a typical Christmas album but very soothing - and very satisfying.","As the title might imply , this is a very mellow album that might send you to sleep if you are in any way tired .

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00138F4IQ,1,1,5,"Having released live albums in 1968 (""At Folsom Prison"") and 1969 (""At San Quentin""), this previously unreleased 1969 live show from New York's Madison Square Garden still manages to illuminate another side of Cash's performance. Given the pressure of the prison shows, not to mention their tailor-made set lists, this recording finds Cash less on-edge, providing a more accurate rendering of his then-current stage show. Everyone but a very pregnant June Carter Cash is on-board, including the Tennessee Three (Marshall Grant, W.S. Holland and Bob Wooten), Carl Perkins, Tommy Cash, The Statler Brothers and The Carter Family (including Mother Maybelle, and daughters Helen and Anita).

The set list covers many of Cash's most beloved songs (including a quartet of prison tunes, and a barn-burning take of ""Wreck of the Old 97""), plus a generous helping of historical and folk classics, including Jane Bowers ""Remember the Alamo"" (recorded throughout the '50s and '60s by The Kingston Trio, Donovan, Willie Nelson and others). He provides contemporary commentary about the Vietnam War (""when you watch the helicopters bringing in the wounded, that might make you a dove with claws"") and sings Ed McCurdy's ""Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream"" (a standard of the '60s folk revival, sung by The Weavers, Chad Mitchell, and Simon & Garfunkel, among others).

The ease and confidence with which Cash presents himself on stage is astounding, and more in evidence than in the live prison recordings. Spoken introductions to songs like ""Five Feet High and Rising"" pull everything together into a seamless presentation. Similarly, Cash's generous revue staging allows his compatriots -- each headliners in their own right -- to shine brightly. Carl Perkin's blazes through ""Blue Suede Shoes,"" The Statler Brothers sing a lively version of their crossover hit ""Flowers on the Wall,"" and the Carter Family performs a beautiful pair of songs from A.P. Carter's catalog (""Wildwood Flower"" ""Worried Man Blues""). Cash's sister-in-law, Helen Carter, provides a wonderfully warm introduction to the Carter Family segment.

The closing medley provides each member of the troupe a chance to give their twist on a Cash landmark. Johnny and his brother Tommy sing ""Do What You Do, Do Well,"" The Carter Family sings ""I Walk the Line,"" The Statler Brothers take on ""Ring of Fire,"" and Carl Perkins finds the rockabilly heart of ""Folsom Prison Blues."" Cash closes out the show with a snippet of ""The Rebel - Johnny Yuma,"" and yet another reprise of ""Folsom Prison Blues."" The crowd's thunderous applause draws an encore of ""Suppertime.""

This is a beautiful (and generous: 77 minute!) stereo recording of a stage master at the peak of his powers, singing and speaking to an enthusiastic sell-out crowd. It is at once incredibly intimate and incredibly grand.

A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00138F4IQ,1,1,5,"Cool!  An entire album of prevously unreleased live Johnny Cash goodies from his commercial heyday in 1969, repeating the success of his earlier concert albums, but here performing for the city slickers in the Big Apple.  Johnny is joined by the reconstituted Carter Family, brother Tommy Cash, the Statler Brothers (who he was a patron of...)  and fellow Sun Records veteran Carl Perkins (as we hear on a  track intro at the very end of the album, June Carter Cash wasn't able to attend as she was six months pregnant at the time...)  It's an efficient, professional  presentation, yet one that gives some nice glimpses into Cash's inner life, mostly through the spoken introductions that accompany many of the songs.  The most telling is the intro to ""Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream,"" in which Cash addresses the thorny issue of the Vietnam War.  Stumbling nervously, hoping not to offend anyone one way or the other, Cash recalls how he and his show went to entertain the troops overseas, declaring, ""I may not be a hawk... But maybe I'm a dove with claws...""  He also introduces a few songs with asides about his down-home background; back then, these monologes may have been a bit hokey, but they've added resonance as Cash has gotten older and his legend increased.  Also of interest is an angry, emotional reading of his Native American rights protest song, ""As Long As Grass Shall Grow,"" which is one of the most powerful performances of Cash's career.  There are also plenty of religious tunes, which he also puts his heart into.  There are some rushed moments, but on the whole, this is an album well worth checking out, and certainly a delight for longtime Cash fans who have never heard this material before.","Cool !
