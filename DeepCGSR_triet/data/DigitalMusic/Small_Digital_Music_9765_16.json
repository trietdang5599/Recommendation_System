Nor are any minor or perhaps spurious works. But pretty much everything else of consequence is included. It's a motherlode of music for the harpsichord by perhaps the greatest composer the instrument ever knew. Tons of great stuff, from the English and French Suites, to the Partitas and Toccatas, to both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier, to the Goldberg Variations and Inventions. My one quibble is that this music can get very repetitive very quickly. Of course, there is no way of playing dynamics on a harpsichord, so there is no real difference between soft and loud. Work after work can sound pretty much the same. Thank God Bach was such a stupendous genius!\n  Martin Galling is a name that I'm not too familiar with, but he plays wonderfully, if a bit sewing-machine like at times. This is something the real Bach freaks will love. Moderate classical music listeners might like it too for it's immense size (over 15 hours says the label on the front). Glenn Gould fans should run away, run far away! But overall, I can't really say much more than: Recommended.---------------------------PEACE","summary":"It's a motherlode of music for the harpsichord!","unixReviewTime":1508198400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Katie Bernstein's voice has a bit of a twang, but not in an even remotely country and western style.

It's one of those instrumental discs that rise to a short list of playlist favorites.  The musicianship of the players is first rate.  The songs are distinctive.  For example, \"Gliding\" is a lovely track that starts out wistfully and reflective and then changes into a lighthearted piece filled with exhilaration and a sense of freedom -- as if one were gliding over the earth.  Perhaps a companion piece to that track is \"Running On Joy\" which has lighthearted piano trills with Heather Rankin's wispy vocals and will Ackerman giving an underlying buzz on the Australian didgeridoo.  \"Antarctica\" has a stately classical feeling.  \"Naked Love\" is a bittersweet melodic track with Rebecca Daniel's gorgeous violin sending the track into the stratosphere.  Fiona Joy Hawkins has done a masterful job on letting the music take us to different moods and planes.  The cover photograph by Andy Wilson and the artwork by Warren Scott that turns a glacier into a piano keyboard sets a stark but inventive tone for this excellent disc.  Enjoy!","summary":"Gliding","unixReviewTime":1409529600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.\n  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE","summary":"Good for the Manfred, the Orchestral Suites and the Piano Trio.........but not much else.","unixReviewTime":1497571200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I love Pitbull. The song is good, has a good beat, very good to dance too. Great groove.\n\nHowever.\n\nThrift Shop was clean compared to this. The content of this song is lets say..for the mature listener. I have a friend with tween and younger teenage kids (11-14). Before they buy any music, it has to be screened for inappropriate content. This is one of them.\n\nIf you are an adult, no issue. As I said Pitbull and FloRida  are the best of the best. But be aware that this is age appropriate music only. Screen it before you allow a younger person to purchase. Of course that is up to each individual, they make the choice for their own. They make a \"clean\" version I hope. Otherwise as Pink would say, F---ing Perfect\"\n\nJust wanted to ensure you screen it first.

Im also lucky to have been able to hear this song online and on radio station across the various states that my husband and I have lived (florida, Maryland, Virginia). From my perspective, all mixed up by 311 appears to be about figuring out the wisest actions and the best ways for an individual to go along in their life while successfully separating a sea of both critical and well-meaning people who may be trying to steer a man or woman another way. With the lyrics, trust your instincts, Im guessing that all mixed up by 311 symbolizes tuning into your intuition as the smoothest way to go when trying to successfully separate what a person wishes to personally do in comparison to what their critics, friends, and\/or family members may tell them.","summary":"rock anthem for intuition?","unixReviewTime":1420675200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's relaxing, lovely, and well worth owning as a single.\n\nAnd yes, I know this is the very song that features in those tear-jerker ASPCA ads... but that doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the song.","summary":"Relaxing yet emotional song from a masterful songstress","unixReviewTime":1500508800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I guess you could say that his last album before this (not counting the one he did with Bow Wow),&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/21\/dp\/B000H30BW2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">21<\/a>&nbsp;was in a similar vein. HOWEVER, although \"21\" talked about sex too mostly it had bangin', current beats to accompany the songs. That is the difference that ultimately makes this more mediocre than his last solo project.\n\nSo in the end, this project unlike \"21\" is pretty skip-able. There aren't really any money tracks at all although if you like your typical topics of R&B in 2010 and beyond, you might be right at home with this album. All I know is that he's capable of more.\n\n3 stars.","summary":"I like Omarion. However, this isn't his best release.","unixReviewTime":1353715200,"vote":null,"image":null}

However after a good first album, he followed it up with the equally bad 21 which did nothing to show off his vocal talent. With Olluison, Omarion is singing songs that truly show he was and always will be nothing more than a studio singer.","summary":"Horrible Album By A Once Promising Singer","unixReviewTime":1284422400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Made To Love, the third single from his album Love In The Future, is alright but it doesn't actually ignite to the best that matches with his other tracks from the album like Who Do We Think We Are and All Of Me had shown. Still, it isn't a bad song but not really as good as I have heard from John before.

But sadly, she has been overlooked in the credibility in favor the annoying Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna. Her collaboration with Erykah Badu Q.U.E.E.N. from her sophmore album The Electric Lady is definitely a great collaboration. I love how rhythmic Janelle brings her voice into the song and the rhythm staying connected to the artists of soul that had inspired her to sing. It shows that she has a great rhythm into the song for old school and contemporary R&B that many of today's artists disregard well. This is a great song to dance to, and a nice follow-up to what she had with Tightrope a few years ago.\n\nSong: B","summary":"Her Majesty","unixReviewTime":1379030400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Quite apart from the sheer visual and tactile whack of this thing - the big news for fans is brand new remasters from first generation tapes by TIM YOUNG in conjunction with the band at Metropolis Studios in London. We should talk about the REMASTERS because they're fabulous. Tim Young's notes in the \"Extras\" 3-disc set explain that \"Rope\" has had the first generation tapes used for the first time to his knowledge - so I immediately went to my favourite track \"Guns On The Roof\" - and WOW is the only appropriate response. It sounds just incredible with all that guitar power you always thought was buried in the mix somewhere now to the fore. \"Drug-Stabbing Time\" and \"Stay Free\" are even better - leaping out of your speakers with renewed venom.\n\n\"London Calling\" is like a different animal (\"Jimmy Jazz\", \"Death Or Glory\" and \"Train In Vain\" are unbelievably good with \"Train\" running out longer by about five seconds) - but to my ears \"Sandinista!\" feels the least improved. It's definitely clearer on the bass and rhythm section (\"The Magnificent Seven\" and \"The Call Up\" and Timon Dogg'svocal on \"Lose This Skin\") but the differences are not as stark as the first 3 LPs - they're just subtler. Despite the sprawl of \"Sandinista!\" - I've always loved it precisely because its like \"The White Album\" or \"Exile On Main St.\" or \"Physical Graffiti\" - you can dip into it and still seemingly find something new every time. The choral brass arrangements at the beginning of \"Somewhere In England\" is now gorgeous while the game-machine noises on \"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe\" are even more manic. \"Somebody Got Murdered\" and their take on Eddy Grant's \"Police On My Back\" are much improved - ballsy as they should be. Back to \"London Calling\" and I'm impressed with \"Lost In The Supermarket\" and \"Brand New Cadillac\" - comparing them against my 1999 versions - there's more going on with the high hats, drums and bass. And that Rock 'n' Roll guitar as \"Brand New Cadillac\" begins punches way above its former weight now. I also love the way each of the CDs has their original vinyl bits reproduced - the \"Armagideon Times\" for \"Sandinista!\", the inner sleeves of \"London Calling\" made into one fold-out lyric poster - the inner and poster of \"Combat Rock\" combined in the same way - and all the CDs are black like vinyl LPs. The driving backbeat behind \"Combat Rock's\" Side 2 standout \"Overpowered By Funk\" is a little improved but I can't say I hear much difference in \"Should I Stay Or Should I Go\".\n\nI own the Singles Box Set on CD so I compared the remasters and again the \"Extras\" versions are far superior - that guitar into on \"Clash City Rocker\" and distant Strummer vocal are better - and the balls of \"I Fought The Law\" is truly fantastic (a cover of an old Bobby Fuller Four hit). And my favorite B-side ever - their genius take on Willie Williams reggae tune \"Armagideon Time\" sounds like its going to do your speakers harm. That amazing bass and percussive beginning of \"The Magnificent Dance\" (the 12\" remix) has jaw-dropping sound quality as does the US 12\" B-side \"The Cool Out\" (an instrumental version of \"The Call Up\") - both with meaty rhythm sections. The early Polydor demos show a band getting there and the expert Glyn Johns produced that amateur feel out of the first album. I'm not sure I like them having loved the originals for all these years. Other disappointments include the outtakes on Disc 2 like \"The Beautiful People...\" and \"Kangaroo Court\" which are wholly dismissible and \"Sean Flynn\" has huge hiss levels on it. But I'm glad to see that Metropolis again mastered the DVD because the picture quality on the Don Letts and Clash On Broadway segments is brill (you get a sense of their danger live).\n\nTo sum up - \"The Last Gang In Town\" and \"The Only Band That Ever Mattered\" - there's been an awful lot of knob written about The Clash across the years (what about the Ramones, The Pistols or even Television) - and \"Sound System\" conveniently exorcises out the infamous and horrible end of \"Cut The Crap\" in 1985. You could also argue that you'd be better off just spending twenty quid on the simpler \"5 Studio Albums Box Set\" released in tandem with this - but I'd say if ever a band deserved this kind of over-the-top celebration - then England's heroes The Clash are the boys. And when you think of how EMI has consistently cheaped-out Stranglers fans with card sleeves and little else - thank God Sony stumped up. I love the care and attention that went into \"Sound System\". So there you have it - all those old bits spangly new again and presented to us in a fabulous setting.\n\nTim Young has described remastering The Clash's six years of output as a 'labour of love'. Well - while the future may indeed be unwritten - I suspect his brilliant work here (in conjunction with surviving members of the band) will be written about for decades to come. Well done and Career Opportunities to all involved...\n\nPS: as of December 2014 - Amazon's price has fallen from over eighty to sixty four quid - perfect gift territory for the Clash City Rocker in your life...","summary":"\"...Something About England...\" - Sound System by THE CLASH (2013 Sony Box Set)","unixReviewTime":1417996800,"vote":"14","image":null}

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWhile a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE \/ CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","summary":"LOVE","unixReviewTime":1474243200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It is very atmospheric, and is something that I would expect to hear playing in the background of a movie about ghosts, as the tension is building towards the climax.  The second half of the song is a bit more upbeat, with a quicker tempo and more metallic highlights, but it would still be quite at home in a ghost movie.  It seems to drag on a bit longer than what seemed realistic for a song of this type, since the tension cannot last forever.  The weakest part of the song played out in the last 10 seconds or so, with seemingly otherworldly transmissions that didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the song.  But it was offered as part of a free promotional download, and for that, I'll round the rating up to four stars.","summary":"Rates 3.5 Stars","unixReviewTime":1387929600,"vote":"2","image":null}

It has jazzy, relaxing, swinging music with an exotic sound and hypnotic beats. The vibe of the first track \"Nothing Without You\" sets the mood for the entire recording as he mixes in a variety of smooth acoustic and electronic sounds over an infectious beat, mixing in guitars, keyboards, and saxes which trade leads. But he 'ups the ante' with the laid back beauty of \"Inside You\" with the 'call-response' of sax and guitar. Other outstanding tracks include \"Every Good Thing\", the soothing mixture of synth and guitar on \"Like A River\", the funky flutes, synth, and guitar on \"Beautiful Day\", the arian-sounds of \"That's Life\", the oriental sound of \"Good Morning\" and the floating sax notes of \"Blue Pacific\".

Very nice bass that maintains your attention behind quality male vocal over good sounding band. Nothing fancy song that sounds great. Wikipedia says Alt. Country, they sound better than that label. Like it a lot. These guys have been around a while, every song encourages you to listen to more.\n\nPendulum by Pure Bathing Culture. Love the smooth opening, slight Christopher Cross vibe (do not hold that against them)I also felt an I'm Not In Love by 10cc vibe, because I'm old. Very cool, echo female vocal over quality synthesizer rhythms that ebb & flow w\/great low key choral background. Song maintains cool slight psychedelic feel for the duration. No idea what the rest of their music sounds like. Absolutely love this track.\n\nGMF by John Grant. I should be too old to find this simple s\/sw song brilliant, but I do. Low key acoustic guitar & controlled synthesizers behind male lead vocal telling his story. The hook is what GMF stands for. It's included as the chorus of this okay singer songwriter number. Do not play with the kids in the car. Play for your old enough friends & surprise them. Greatest m f that you're ever gonna meet.\n\nThings Will Change by Treetop Flyers. Hate to compare new with old, 'try to do it only to compliment. This song sounds like an updated version of any classic by America (the band). Strumming acoustic guitar, tight backing band, similar male lead vocal, great lyrics, great sound, good production, quality song. Love it.\n\nNerve Endings by Eagulls. Brilliant punk opening, vocal & song. Sounds like past punk greats.(Not gonna compare) Strong back beat, great guitar & neat straining lead vocal. Song never strays from it's core of excellent. Absolutely love it.\n\nWaiting by The Dismemberment Plan. Neat lightweight Indie, post-punk revival, math rock, post-hardcore, experimental rock (thank you Wikipedia). Open male vocal over bopping band. Nice.\n\nParted Ways by Heartless Bastards. Recognizable, slightly shrill male lead vocal way in front of good sounding band keeping up with lyrics, allowed to play a little, couple of times. Noisy ending, nothing wrong with this song, you will love it.\n\nThey Told Me by Sallie Ford & The Sound Outside. Love the throbbing opening, strong female vocal over ongoing rocking band that threatens & defends the singer throughout. Very nice.\n\nLos Angeles by Emily Wells. Per Wikipedia Folk, Folk rock, Folktronica, Acoustic. This track is breathy female vocal over guitar w\/neat lyrics and not much else. You will love it, she has done much more.\n\nDogon Genesis by Lumerians. Great simple opening, vocals start, psychedelia ensues. Too many genres in Wiki to list, neat feel, deliberate vocal over speedy guitars including relentless bass. Superior version of modern progressive track. Like it(they mentioned 'Silver Machine' how not to like?).\n\nBermuda Highway by Christopher Denny. Female sounding vocal, appears he's not, let's say Roy Orbison. Acoustic guitar, deliberate spoken vocal that sings to us all, harmonica spurts, quality lyrics, complete sound. Like it.\n\nThis superior sampler from Partisan Records is worth money right now. Download a fantastic free collection of quality songs from a mix of genres, you may not like them all, someone you know will love the songs you don't. Excellent collection, this sampler is the good stuff, get it while it's free.","summary":"Excellent collection of quality songs, mixed genres dl for free now","unixReviewTime":1381017600,"vote":"4","image":null}

Antonio Carlos Jobim had gone from Brazilian Bossa Nova legend to a big name regular in the Creed Taylor CTI Jazz stable.  I was one of those who picked it up even though Frank Sinatra was my Fathers music, he was still cool and probably more so in the 70s because he went from covering My Music (Heres to you Mrs. Robinson, ooby dooby doo) to doing some stand up appreciable real jazz and resembling the towering mighty man who fronted Harry James and Tony Dorseys orchestras and rose to superstardom in the 50s and made cool-jazz music with His Highness Basie.  The only way to lay your hands on this prize was as an import in places like Tower Records or if you knew of its existence you could have your mom and pop record store order it for you at a price.  Only Jobim fans and extremely serious Sinatra fans knew about it from articles.  The other way to get this material was to back order the old Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967) and Sinatra & Company (1971) but you were still left without three of the tracks they did together: \"Bonita\", \"Sabi\", and \"Off Key (Desafinado)\".  The 10 track Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim, arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, accompanied by a studio orchestra, is very nice but the real prize was the eagerly sought other half of the Sessions arranged by Deodato (stable-mate of Jobim in CTI, and 2nd greatest Brazilian jazz man after Jobim alongside the Joo Gilberto family) and conducted by Morris Stoloff.  Of particular note: Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, but lost to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Darn those Beatles!  Sinatra and Jobim worked together for a final time in 1994 on Duets II, recording a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" if you want to be complete you will have to get that one too!\n\nThe original collection of Sinatra & Jobim tracks on their collaborations included two recordings which do not actually feature Jobim, \"Drinking Again\" and \"Manh De Carnaval.  SINATRA\/JOBIM: THE COMPLETE REPRISE RECORDINGS does not include them, instead you get all 20 original recordings featuring both artists in their work of genius together.

The tunes range in variety from gentle and tranquil to epic and grandiose, and Spaeth's mastery of the keyboard enables him to command different styles and techniques to elicit those diverse moods.\n\nThe album also features Tina Guo on cello and Christopher Luther on violin.\n\nThis is a fine and worthy entry in the solo piano genre.","summary":"The RajMan Review","unixReviewTime":1398556800,"vote":null,"image":null}

With that in mind, I was amazed to learn that his latest release, \"Redemption,\" has been 10 years in the making - one third of his life! The first track entitled \"A Lifetime Spent,\" is an introspective solo piano melody draws us in, slowly building in intensity, and becoming quite dramatic. There is a cinematic air to Paul's playing, although certainly not surprising given his background and education in composition and film scoring. An interesting contrast came towards the end when after a dramatic flourish, the piece appears to end, but after a moment of silence, is followed by the most delicate coda, providing a musical yin yang experience. The next song is an emotionally evocative tune called \"To Say Goodbye.\" Unlike the diversity displayed in the previous track, this one stays more on the bittersweet side of the spectrum, and is sure to resonate in the hearts of anyone who has experienced loss and separation in life.\n\nTracks four and five create a two-part story, respectively titled, \" Prelude to a Lullaby,\" and \"Lullaby for the Mending Heart.\" These are the first of the duets heard on the album, and feature the exquisite cello artistry of Tina Guo. Tina is now performing in the Cirque du Soleil show \"Michael Jackson: The Immortal.\" Another beautiful duet is heard on track 8 with a rendition of the classic \"Amazing Grace.\" This song features the superbly talented accompaniment of Christopher Luther on violin. The final duet with cellistTina Guo is on track 10, entitled \"This Is Our Faith.\" Here, as on his work in general, Paul exhibits his mastery of composition as the piece flows through various movements and feelings.\n\n\"Redemption\" by Paul Spaeth is a deeply personal musical experience that draws inspiration from the well of Life. Capable of spanning vast emotional terrain, Paul's music ranges from introspective and impressionistic, to powerful and dramatic expressions of profound feelings that resonate in the innermost being of the listener. Each composition is a perfectly told story that speaks to the experiences we all share. Emotionally evocative and spiritually uplifting, \"Redemption\" is an inspired work of art from the heart of a gifted composer.","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1386374400,"vote":"2","image":null}

At 17, he premiered his first orchestral piece and then entered the University of Southern Californias Thornton School of Music for composition and film scoring. Since then, he has written music for film, TV and video games as well as the eleven tracks for his new album, \"Redemption.\"  Composed over a ten-year period, \"Redemption\" expresses a young mans personal experiences of life and love, coming of age, and finding ones truth. Seven of the eleven tracks are solo piano and four feature Tina Guo on cello or Christopher Luther on violin. This intensely personal music has been described as soothing and healing (physical, emotional, and spiritual), but it is also simply great music expressed with deep passion and an exquisite piano touch. It gives me great hope for the future of music that young artists like Paul Spaeth can carry the torch and keep their music a pure art form rather than simply a business proposition. This is an amazing album and one I fully expect to be one of my favorites for the year.\n\n\"Redemption\" begins with A Lifetime Spent, a gorgeous piano solo that powerfully expresses a whole range of emotions with passion and intensity. Breathtaking! To Say Goodbye is much more introspective - a bit of musical soul-searching. I expected track 3 to be a piece about rain, but it is titled Reflections. A bit more abstract and free-form, it has a very haunting quality. Prelude to a Lullaby is a duet for piano and cello that provides a gentle massage for the soul. It segues into Lullaby for the Mending Heart, also for cello and piano, and just as relaxing as its Prelude. The Moment After is my favorite track. Very spare and subtle, it conveys so much with so little. Something profound has happened here, and the music expresses tremendous loss and longing - and a naked, personal truth. A New Beginning lightens the mood considerably with feelings of hope and the anticipation of a fresh start. The melody is simple, but sincere and honest. I really like this one, too! Amazing Grace follows as a duet for violin and piano. Very slow and earthy, this well-worn nugget shines as brand new. Passage can mean many things, but in this case, the piece is almost celebratory with a gospel tinge, gathering energy as it evolves and ending with excitement and perhaps triumph. This Is Our Faith is a gorgeous duet for piano and cello, sharing deep from the heart and revealing the soul at its most honest and vulnerable. Incredibly moving and another favorite. The title track ends the album with a piece that is both dramatic and tender, again expressing a personal truth.\n\n\"Redemption\" is an emotional powerhouse, but is never over-the-top or overly sentimental. This is music that needs to be heard, and I hope to be able to spread the word to help give Paul Spaeth the audience he deserves. I give \"Redemption\" my highest recommendation!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1386201600,"vote":"3","image":null}

Emotions pour through Spaeth's masterful piano, like a picnic for the soul.  The opening track \"A Lifetime Spent\" grabs you immediately with its highs and lows, from exhilaration to reflection.  On \"Prelude to a Lullaby,\" Tina Guo on cello and Christopher Luther on violin give counterpoint to Spaeth's gentle soothing melody.  \"Lullaby for the Mending Heart\" is an impressive piece with its orchestral build.  \"A New Beginning\" is well titled, holding hope high.  \"Amazing Grace\" has such a beautiful melody and exudes strength in the interplay between piano & strings.  \"This Is Our Faith\" with the cello is exquisite piece of music, lovely and touching.  At the end of the final title track when Paul strokes those few strong chords, it resounds with such certainty of spirit that we are left with this breathtaking reverberation in the soul.  \"Redemption\" feels like more than music, it is an experience.

Matrix mixes have been around a while but this is the first official Grateful Dead archive release to do this.\n\nThe Grateful Dead had a strong year in 1980. They introduced several new songs at the beginning of the year, celebrated their 15th Anniversary while  playing acoustic sets in September and October. These acoustic sets also saw the return of songs that had been put away for a while. The band was also recording shows that would make two live two l.p. set releases the next year.\n\nThis show marks the fourth show since the Radio City Music Hall show. The band's mini November tour started on the 26 and by the time the 30th rolled around, the band was on a roll.\n\nThe first set starts with Feel Like A Stranger and it takes a few adjustments to get everything dialed in just exactly right. That doesn't stop the band from building this to a high octane jam. Loser starts with a nice tempo and builds to a cool finish. Cassidy is short and well played but the jams are only hinted at during this era. Ramble On Rose is stretched out nicely with Jerry firing it up during the solos. Little Red Rooster gives Bob a chance to show off his blues chops. It's also nice to hear Brent's electric piano up in the mix which doesn't always happen. Next up, a real treat in the first electric Bird Song since September 1973. Bird Song had been brought back in the acoustic sets but this was it in it's new arrangement for the first time in an electric set. The Me And My Uncle->Big River moves along at a nice clip while It Must Have Been The Roses is sweetly played. It's another song that was brought back during the acoustic sets. The first set ends with hot versions of Lost Sailor->Saint Of Circumstance->Deal.\n\nThe second set begins with a hot Scarlet->Fire that, while not a super long version, is still a standout. Samson rocks hard and the ballad Ship Of Fools is very well done. The long second set jam starts with a 15 minute plus Playing In The Band that goes to some cool places before drifting into the Drums->Space segment. I guess that there are some out there that don't like Drums->Space segments but I do. Out of Space, we get a mellow The Wheel and a pretty China Doll. Bob rocks the set to a close with a Chuck Berry medley while Uncle John's Band is a great encore. All in all, everybody is on and it was a very good night for everyone.","summary":"November 30, 1980 at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, GA","unixReviewTime":1383868800,"vote":"7","image":null}

I know some will enjoy the track; I did not.  I had to listen closely to John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to recognize the melody.  This is not a bad set, nor a particularly good one.

This is an album of very clever and adept finger style guitar playing by a man who clearly has a great depth and passion for his music; you can see this on track one called In Search Of. A delightful negative refrain at times, then some very inspired notes give us an emotive but delightful way to start an album.\nThis album has come at a good time for me, I needed to relax and ease back and my life lately as could be yours, has been frantic, to put it mildly. Perfect Imperfection was the perfect vehicle for me to do so and this next piece was superb, its called Meet me in Maui. Laid back and chilled and already through this music I can feel the inner peace beginning to flow.\nWhen I first started working in radio, I came across the artist Al Stewart and I actually ended up with a show called On The Border after hearing Year of the Cat, I would of course find Als other well know composition of that very name and Carleno does a literal walk through of this classic Stewart song and does it with reverence to its originality, but with a fresh Latin feel to it as well, excellent rendition, played and performed with style and grace and yes I was singing the lyrics along with it!\nNow an interesting title, my dear constant readers, you all know I delight in fresh and new ideas and especially innovative titles, so when Welcome To The Milky Way came on I was in rapture. This is played so beautifully and in an almost ancient style that could take the listener back across the eons of time, across that very Milky Way, there are some very pleasant harmonics on this track as well.\nIts time to raise the rhythm and take the whole venture up tempo, using the guitar in every aspect on Working up an Appetite. There was some great use of the frets, strings and main body of the guitar. On this piece Carlino shows his mastery and shows it well, at around two minutes forty, there is a charming quiet passage that sold this piece for me as one of the best on the album and the powerful chords at the end made it an awesome composition that should take you by the ears and drag you to musical heaven.\nBut wait dear constant reader, there is much more, this next track is so mood filled you will not want to miss out on another enjoyable piece called Timberline Tree, as a guitarist myself I sense this is a arrangement that we call, personal music therapy, this composition just seemed to be so organic and had just about everything you want from a guitar based album, there was something about this piece I felt was so deep, it was so moving and so personal to the artist himself.\nI have heard Bob Ardern and others in this genre play like this, but here Carleno seem to flow with the ease of silver, from a mirrored pool of musical delight. A traditional finger picking piece that I know will absolutely delight you and its called Childs Play\nAs Monty Python once said, now for something completely different and to be honest you couldn't get more different than Rhapsody in Blood. Think Hammer Horror films; think Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and Vincent Price and you will have it in one. Lets start my friends with wolves baying in the woods, let us start with the creaking sound of strings, like that old evil door.\nYou really have to listen to this composition to get the full benefit from it, but let me just say that Tom Carleno has brought you a movie styled piece of music here, that would fit superbly into any horror film you have ever watched, but BEWARE, the scream, it had my wife jump from her seat whilst she was editing another show to say to me, Did you hear a woman screaming outside?\nYes Rhapsody in Blood is really a fun piece to play, but I must say that Tom Carleno has not only done a good job here, but also enjoyed doing it, my only regret is he didn't ask me to add some audio  after the wolves, saying that old Dracula classic line Hark, can you hear them? The children of the night Wonderful track, you will love this.\nAlways room for a classic, many have done it recently, but here and rather appropriately, Carleno chooses Imagine by John Lennon, this is a song that for some reason people seem to play more at Christmas and here it sits at number nine on the album. Its respectfully played and one more song that you will want to sing along to.\nA little more time dear reader, to sample some of the perfection which we can now call Carlenos finger picking guitar on the piece Brief Encounter, before we fall into the lap of the last piece off the album called What A Difference A Day Makes. This is a gentle track to end with and in all honesty this is a delicious album and being an unbiased guitarist, I would recommend this to anyone, I would urge all guitarists to buy this, its has everything you might want to learn from, but more importantly everyone can enjoy a well performed album, produced and brought to us with such care and attention.\nAt times Carlenos style reminded me of Greg Lakes acoustic work on his days with Emerson Lake and Palmer, it has a little light and shade, it has a little night and day, and a little shadow and sunlight about it and this last piece almost confirms that.\nOverall Perfect Imperfection is the type of album that should get a lot of airplay from radio, it will do from ours and it should completely take the listeners imagination to a place that will be a most pleasurable location. Dont miss out on this album; its a rare gem that glows brightly in a world that seems to have lost its musical soul.","summary":"An album to take your imagination to a place that will be a most pleasurable location","unixReviewTime":1390780800,"vote":null,"image":null}

His intricate fingering is precise, yet fluid as it moves from one passage to another. I couldn't help but notice, not only in this composition, but characteristic of his playing in general, are the unusual chord changes and progressions he comes up with. I liked the occasional unpredictability of it and enjoyed not knowing where it might lead next. While most of the 11 songs on the album are originals, Tom does offer his take on a few cover tunes. The first is an intriguing version of Al Stewart's \"On The Border.\" The original arrangement is an epic composition with vocals and full orchestration, so I was interested to hear how Tom would play it on solo guitar. But he did an admirable job, and I enjoyed hearing this familiar melody in a more elemental form.\n\nAnother cover song is one that I, and probably everyone on the planet, is familiar with - \"Imagine\" by John Lennon. Tom's gentle and respectful version captures the peace and love vibration that marked much of Lennon's writing. The last two compositions on the album, in a way, bookend Tom's career, highlighting past and present. \"A Brief Encounter,\" written in 1985, was his debut fingerstyle composition and is about first love and first heartache. The album comes to rest with a new song called \"What A Difference A Day Makes.\" This is one of my favorite pieces on the album and has a meandering bucolic feel, like a Sunday drive on a country road - a sublime ending to this wonderful recording. There is no doubt that Tom Carleno is a masterful fingerstyle guitarist. His songwriting is innovative and often intriguing, full of unexpected twists and turns. \"Perfect Imperfection\" is perfectly wonderful instrumental guitar music.","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1384128000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Carleno has been performing with his acoustic jazz ensemble, Perpetual Motion, for more than twenty-five years and has recorded five albums with them. \"Perfect Imperfection\" is a real showcase for Carlenos varied and passionate style of acoustic guitar playing and composing. A retrospective of eleven songs composed over the past twenty-five years and recorded over a four-year period, the pieces range from the serene Meet Me in Maui to covers of Al Stewarts On the Border and John Lennons Imagine to Childs Play, a spirited duet for guitar and spoons, and Rhapsody in Blood, Carlenos homage to the horror films of the 1930s and 40s - complete with sound effects! A master of his instrument, Carleno tells stories without words and paints vivid pictures without a canvas, sharing experiences and having fun in the process.\n\nThe album begins with In Search Of, a piece that Carleno says seemed to be trying to find its own way as he was writing it, sometimes going in different directions than he expected. Easy-going and relaxed, its a great opening. Meet Me in Maui is in memory of Carlenos mother, who also loved to vacation in Maui. Very tranquil and calming, it feels like a warm breeze blowing over a peaceful ocean. Beautiful! On the Border is one of Al Stewarts classic signature pieces. Originally released in 1976, Carlenos cover version is a great tribute to the British rocker! The graceful Timberline Tree was inspired by a painting by Carlenos mother, Joan Hagen Carleno. The piece is gorgeous, and a copy of the painting graces the back of the CD cover. I love Childs Play, a  playful and lighthearted duet for guitar and spoons (performed by Carlenos wife, Josie Quick). Rhapsody in Blood is a trip! Inspired by the spooky soundtracks for early horror films, this 6 1\/2-minute tour de force includes some great sound effects, many (all???) of which were created on the guitar - creaking doors, howling wolves, bone-chilling screams, thunder, and other sounds of dark foreboding. From there, we go to the gentle simplicity of Lennons classic Imagine - an exceptionally nice arrangement! Brief Encounter was Carlenos first finger-style composition, written in 1985, and What a Difference a Day Makes is a lovely new piece composed specifically for this album.\n\n\"Perfect Imperfection\" is a wonderful album that is excellent for focused listening as well as in the background. Well, Rhapsody in Blood isn't too good as background music, but the rest of the tunes are! Great stuff!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1383955200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Never mind the fact that her self titled 3rd LP \"Debby Boone\" is, in my opinion, a pop vocal classic (\"I'd Rather Be Alone\" is a classic in and of itself, but her version of \"Choosey Beggar\" is an alltime favorite of mine!) or that her country remakes showed a talent bigger than her one-hit-wonder status, Debby was the squeaky-clean religious daughter of Pat Boone and nothing was going to change that.  How sad she records so little and how sad we miss out on hearing more of those amazing vocals on a variety of genres.  We turned our backs, basically stating that nobody wanted to hear from her again.  Oh, how wrong we were.\n\nBut, lucky for us who have been paying attention, as Debby recorded music last year which is both fun, flashy and yeah, pretty darn fantastic.\n\nUptempo tunes show Debby's fun side, which (I think) few people think she has.  The most fun for me is \"Get Me To The Church On Time\", \"Sway\" and a jazzy\/swinging version of \"These Boots Are Made For Walking\".  But once again it's Debby's voice on ballads such as \"Cry Me A River\" and \"More Than You Know\" that sets my heart a-flutter.  She's sounds as crystal clear and darn near perfect on these songs as she did 37 years ago, showing True talent endures through the ages.  Simply put: BEAUTIFUL!!\n\n(The only slight hic-cup for me is a version of \"Mack The Knife\", which in my opinion truly suits a males voice a bit better than a females.  So, it's more of a song choice than an issue with the vocal.  This song, however, no way effects the CD as a whole or it's well deserved 5 star rating.)\n\nNow, however, comes the painful task of waiting years upon years for another wonderful masterpiece from this talented singer.  Let's hope NOT!!!","summary":"How sad it is that one blockbuster song ..37 years ago...defined her career!","unixReviewTime":1400457600,"vote":"4","image":null}

She delivers these 14 songs with a personal style that comes from years of living some of these songs. I remember she sang \"That Old Black Magic\" in a huge medley on television a few years back - it is great to hear her voice re-visit it.  \"These Boots...\", \"I'm Gonna Live...\" and especially \"Mack The Knife\" show a sassy side of Boone that is endearing - listen to the delivery of the line \"did that boy do something rash?\" - she brings her theatre experience to these songs and they all benefit from it.

Besides containing wonderful Baroque music, this particular edition also has some Medieval and Renaissance music.  In fact, included within this set is an informative \"Instruments of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.\"  It begins on track 305. This portion contains narration, information on particular instruments, followed by a piece on that given instrument.  I was very pleased when I heard this; I have the original 2 CD set on \"The Instruments...\"  and I have used it in my classrooms.  If, however, you want 11 hours of straight music, the narration might be a bit distracting.\n\nIf you are a fan of Baroque music, then I highly recommend this.","summary":"Besides containing wonderful Baroque music","unixReviewTime":1429488000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Dunner","reviewText":"Generally judged as one of the better psychedelic revival bands, Temples tosses its debut in the ring.  Electric twelve-strings and trippy lyrics dapple Temples walls, and a cathedral of reverb shovels a shadow of gauze atop the bands sunny, garage-rock blast.  While the foggy production keeps any one of Temples 60s\/90s retro mix from standing out, a heavy Revolver-period Beatles influence is evident, as the opener Shelter Song echoes Tomorrow Never Knows, right down to the boxy snare.  However, Temples is not a Dukes of Stratosphear, wherein every tie-dyed reference is a tongue-in-cheek overstatement.  Instead, theres a reverence for its forebears, as much of Sun Structures suggests to what Journey to the Center of the Mind might have evolved, had Amboy Dukes founder Ted Nugent not gone wango-tangoing off the right-wing rails.","summary":"One of the better psych revival bands . . .","unixReviewTime":1489363200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers that has really been more of a product, than a actual songstress of the heart. It is just so sad, because the more stunts she has pulled, or the more she is severely overplayed like Michael Jackson was, the more her songs are not worth listening to anymore. It is sad. Flawless has been one of those songs to where she is trying ti be more street than really rap alone, and tragically she has not been able to deliver around the voice alone. I personally found this song to be just as wasted as when she tried to deliver on rap with songs like Video Phone and Diva from her I Am... Sasha Fierce. Overall, if you are a die hard fan or new to Beyonce' Knowles music, I would suggest you pass this song up, and go to her songs when she was a part of Destiny's Child, or play Crazy In Love to death.\n\nSong: D-","summary":"Musically Flawed","unixReviewTime":1458777600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Flawless, one of her songs from the Beyonce' album is honestly terrible. She doesn't actually ignite in her voice and it sounds more like a robot than a real songstress. I really did not find the song to actually deliver, instead I honestly feel that she brought in her hip hop style, and took it for a tailspin down.

It explodes like a bomb hitting the ground in one of those WWII aerial films - simultaneous heavy guitar, bass and cymbal crash. While the chord sustains, a few more bombs are seen falling beneath us, through a grey sky towards a black and white city below. Listen to the guitar at 0:07, this kind of hammered-on note an octave above the root. It is like the sudden moment of impact, with the waves of destruction rippling outward. Away to the west, tanks crawl slowly across farm fields, prepared to blow away anything in their way. At 0:31 a warning siren in a nearby town calls for everyone to evacuate.\n\nAt 0:52 the pace quickens with sharp stabbing chords and pulse-quickening hi-hat. Ozzy Osbourne begins to sing at 1:03:\n\nGenerals gathered in their masses\nJust like witches at black masses (or my preference, 'smell each other's stinky asses')\n\nI like the double meaning of 'mass'. Similar to 'please please me' by The Beatles. The rest of Geezer Butler's lyrics are good, and it's a great anti-war song but, you know what? I've never liked Ozzy's voice all that much. That's all I'm going to say about it.\n\nTony Iommi plays fantastic guitar throughout: those triplets at 1:29, the trill at 1:34, the descending chords at 1:48, the little bend at 1:50, the chug and slash part from 2:08-2:17 and the riffs that accompany Politicians hide themselves away. Beginning at 3:30 he plays several solos that overlap until around 4:20. I love those pitch bends from 4:13-4:18. A very clever guitarist.\n\nBill Ward plays excellent drum fills everywhere, particularly at 1:38, 1:52, 1:57, 2:02 and on and on, through Iommi's solo, and 5:28-5:30. Geezer Butler holds it all down with his mighty bass playing.\n\nThe final 2:12 is a section called 'Luke's Wall'. It's a pretty cool way to end the song. Some great drums in this part, too. And bonus for me: no Ozzy.","summary":"NOV 28","unixReviewTime":1498176000,"vote":null,"image":null}

The categories are even more varied if you count the second release which includes contemporary pop (Adeles Someone Like You) and some old school 80s rock (Phil Collins In the Air Tonight).  There are ten songs over two releases and this first release accounts for six of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward.  My favorite of this lot would be their cover of Metallicas Nothing Else Matters wherein Smith soars to add that emotional punch right at the right moment.","summary":"Shinedown members cover a surprising range of rock hits.","unixReviewTime":1527379200,"vote":null,"image":null}

There is a lot of interesting trivia surrounding this group. For one thing, the group got its unusual name from none other than John Lennon of The Beatles? How did this happen? Well, The Cyrkle was the only American group managed by Fab Four manager Brian Epstein. In addition, the groups wildly successful debut single was co-written by Paul Simon (who was living in London at the time) and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers. This was before either Simon & Garfunkel or The Seekers became famous. Red Rubber Ball remains one of most popular singles of the 1960s.

Her songs from her work with LaFace like Un-Break My Heart have ultimately withstood the test of time, but when word came out that Toni was going to collaborate with Babyface on a new set of songs, the question was would they be good? I Wish, the second single from their album Love, Marriage & Divorce isn't a bad ballad that shows the elegance of the piano through Toni's voice. While it does feel a bit corny through some of the lyrics of the songs, but nevertheless Toni does deliver through the song well through Babyface's piano playing. Still Toni is a much better singer than the idiots female singers of today like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, who have not shown beauty in voice through the song alone. This isn't a bad song as a wish that could be boldly granted.\n\nSong: B-","summary":"Toni's Wish","unixReviewTime":1391644800,"vote":null,"image":null}

However, both also do suffer from a hard flow that sometimes does not go over their beats well.\n\nJones' album suffers from an uneven flow, and his track beats are a little weak in my opinion. I was not eye-popped by any of the tracks on this album; they were all listenable and ok. The best of the bunch were Your City, Kingdom Figures and WOG, but Mouthpiece and Bizzle really bailed the first two songs out.\n\nOverall this project was ok. If you really like Christian Hip Hop, you can pick it up. Maybe it will sound better to you, like it did for these other reviewers. For me, I wasn't dissappointed, but I wasn't impressed either.","summary":"A decent album from a CHH vet","unixReviewTime":1405641600,"vote":null,"image":null}

There has been so many poor songs from Rihanna and Beyonce' where the quality of the voice from the heart has died, and the feelings of the song isn't there. For Aloe Blacc to breakout in real soul, he showed that well when he released The Man earlier this year, but the big question is how can he follow-up such a great sampled song. His latest song, Love Is The Answer, the second single from his second album Lift Your Spirit, isn't as strong as was with The Man. His voice at times within the song sounds shallow and out of tune to the song. I was shocked, compared to his past songs like I Need A Dollar. It almost sounded like he needs to fine tune his heartstrings and find his heart again. Hopefully, there can be better songs from his down the road, that doesn't feel out of tune.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","summary":"Love Isn't Always The Answer","unixReviewTime":1404259200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It was soothing, yes, but also haunting and mystic, hinting at strange mysteries that a younger me couldn't help but fall in love with.  The eerie Celtic-inspired music and the singer's dreamy vocals are entrancing, and weave a vivid picture in one's mind.\n\nI've heard people compare Loreena McKennit to Enya, but in my opinion Enya is more saccharine to the ear.  McKennit isn't afraid to let the slightly darker and more haunting aspects of the music come to the fore, and for that I applaud her.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye (ear?) out for more of her music in the future.","summary":"Haunting yet soothing and beautiful Celtic-inspired number","unixReviewTime":1490659200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Because Heaven only knows where the CD is at this point.\n\nSo, I have loved Loreena Mckinnett for years, and this album is another one of my long standing favorites.  She has a beautiful, ethereal voice.  Her music is evocative and passionate and soothing all at the same time.  I love the infusion of poetry in her lyrics. I haven't heard a single thing of hers I haven't loved.

Actually it is more likely a metaphor for taking us listeners into new, unexplored dimensions of thought, not new territory for the expansionist thinker Kid Cudi. The album is enveloped in Cudi's deep, uninterrupted singing voice with one rapping verse inserted in the thick of the album. It is quite the experimental pop\/rnb affair, hardly a hip hop album to be correct. Cudi is in typical form lamenting, crowing, and going on in that jazzy, stylistic way of his about his mental separation from society. When he is not singing and besides the one rapping verse on the album, large swaths of intergalactic instrumentals mellow out the proceedings. Satellite Flight: The Journey To Mother Moon definitely has Kid Cudi's patented musical vibe even if it cannot be classified or critiqued as a rap album. Within the genre that Cudi has invented for himself, whatever the name, the album is a respectable one.","summary":"Is Kid Cudi's 'Satellite Flight' out of this world?","unixReviewTime":1488067200,"vote":null,"image":null}

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!

They don't take themselves serious, they are all about having fun, and about glorifying the 80's.\n\nTheir single of their latest album hits all of those elements, and makes their lead singer into the fun-loving stalker you have to keep your new girlfriend separated from, for fear of what he's going to do.\n\nThey manage to reach the level in production where you're about to say it's too noisy, but then keep it right underneath that.  Meanwhile phaser stabs from the keyboard, and toms are going off in succession, while he's claiming how crazy he gets inside, while trying to maintain a calm outside.\n\nEnjoy it, because it's typical Chromeo, but somehow better than the previous work.","summary":"A serious topic, sort of taken seriously by the kings of not being serious","unixReviewTime":1419811200,"vote":null,"image":null}

For some reason they decided to split up their Acoustic Sessions into two parts and the first entry  is even more diversified but if I had to pick a favorite between the two I would go with this second, shorter session due to the strength of the Adele coververy moving and strong and I don't even listen to Adele; does anyone else want to see these two maybe perform a duet?and PJs impassioned tune.  I was surprised that my least favorite track was the one I anticipated being my favorite as I have always really enjoyed the slow-burn power of In the Air Tonight but with the percussion and in spite of their best efforts to provide that rising punch its just not there.  There are ten songs over the two releases and this second release accounts for four of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward.","summary":"Anyone else wanna see a duet from Smith and Adele???","unixReviewTime":1527379200,"vote":null,"image":null}

He has had so many highs  and achievements that no singer will ever replicate & lows that could've derailed his life & career. But through it all, his legacy will always be beyond the yellow brick road. He has had so many bountiful generations come to him, and why he is still standing strong, where others like Michael Jackson & Prince died so young. You can listen to any of Elton's songs, and they still sound better than what is on radio right now. But nevertheless, the one album many people will always go to is his 1973 double-album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which bridged so many divides in the music industry. The title track, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is just very timeless to listen to, produced by the dear Gus Dudgeon, as a timeless portrait of what a musician's soul is like when he finally meets his future and runs with it for a new light at the end of the tunnel. If you are new to Elton John's music, after all these generations or a very dear hard core fan, you'll absolutely want to go to this track as one of the first to listen to.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Long & Celebrated Road","unixReviewTime":1522540800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, the namesake cut from its album, is not only a fine tune in its own right but is one of the best hits to come out of the 1970s. Many critics consider this gold blockbuster to be Elton John's finest song. It is an amazing song but in my opinion, Elton John did a number of hits equally as good. Nevertheless, this is an essential hit sung in ballad form.","summary":"One of the Best of the Best","unixReviewTime":1498953600,"vote":null,"image":null}

That being said, after first listen I was disheartened.  However, after repeated listens, it's quickly grown on me!.\n\nThere are many great songs on 48:13: Eez-Eh, Stevie, Bumblebee, Treat, Bow.  I do feel these would have been great-ER had Serge, the creative mastermind behind Kasabian, who also took on the role of Producer for 48:13, done less production work with dubbing, overdubbing & electronics. Both Tom's (lead singer) & Serge's (backing & some lead) vocals are in fine form.  The lyrics are a bit repetitive.  Serge is definitely flexing his creative \"muscles\" on 48:13 & I have to believe that's a good thing which will continue to carry Kasabian forward rather than repeating themselves.  It is definitely more electronic than earlier releases, but it does work after all!  Just don't be anticipating another West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum or Velociraptor and if you don't discount it after the first full listen, you'll probably grow to appreciate it very quickly.  Kasabian don't usually release the same sounds twice; 48:13 just goes a little further \"left of the dial\"!!  I'd strongly recommend going for the 48:13 Deluxe version which comes with a bonus live DVD because Kasabian live are always a \"Treat\"!!!

First I'd like to talk about the title track which has a mesmerizing quality to it. Loved, loved the bell like tone of the piano, cello and violins in counterpoint. An unusual combination for sure, with a haunting melody to match, this is purity of music at its very zenith :-) The stateliness of \"Dines Waltz\" is sublime number with a very very calming influence on the mind. \"Faith\" with its English horn, violin, flute is an inventive melody with fantastic performances by the musicians all around. \"So Much To Say\" has a pensive feel to it and is perfect for the times when one wants to think quietly with no distractions :-) I absolutely loved the little flourishes Calandra produces on the piano in \" A Quiet Spark\". This is a lovely composition, brilliantly performed :-) Another track I want to mention here is \"The Dreamer\". What a track! It just transported me to a land of gorgeous soundscapes. Magnificent keyboard tones, and the violin solo was breathtaking. This album is so much more than just a collection of beautiful tracks, its music composition at its best! :-)","summary":"Music at its best!","unixReviewTime":1470873600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Calandra seems to like abrupt shifts in his music, from the throbbing to the contemplative and back again.  As a musical construction, \"Faith\" has similarities to \"The Wayfarer\" & is another gem.  \"Dine's Waltz\" is a lovely piano melody with synthesizer textures for context.  The CD's opening track \"Clyde & the Pearl\" brings the listener in with the cymbals percussion and the lovely keyboard themes.

Piano and keyboards are prominent in all of these pieces, and Calandra is backed by an impressive list of guest musicians on an assortment of instruments. I think the most remarkable thing about this album is that Calandra is so comfortable with and adept at such a broad spectrum of musical styles that range from classical to jazz to pop and fusion. Calandra's goal with \"Inner Circle\" was \"to touch the listener's heart, to strike an emotional chord, while also exploring my wide-ranging musical interests.\" Mission accomplished! \"Inner Circle\" is Calandra's fifth independent release, and should bring him out of the background and into the spotlight. In addition to his soundtrack work, he has also played keyboard for an impressive list of Broadway productions and has music published and playing in sixty countries around the world. He has also played and recorded with the New York Pops Orchestra and artists that include Dee Dee Bridgewater, Aretha Franklin, and Allen Ginsberg.\n\n\"Inner Circle\" begins with the intriguingly-titled \"Clyde And The Pearl,\" a jazzy confection that features Calandra on percussion, keyboards, and piano. Upbeat, rhythmic, and very catchy, it's a great opener! \"Dine's Waltz\" goes in a different direction with a light and very graceful dance for piano and strings. The first movement of \"The Wayfarer\" reminds me a bit of early Yanni with darkly intense strings and a powerful pulse that evolve into a sweet interlude that returns to a variation on the original theme, adding haunting, passionate vocals - one of my favorites! \"Better Angels\" is an evocative piano solo that relies on deep emotion rather than fancy finger-work to convey its message. The title track begins as a duet that mixes a sparkling keyboard with silky-smooth strings - very beautiful. \"Faith\" is another favorite. It begins as a soulful duet for oboe and piano and easily transitions into a chamber work by adding violin, cello, acoustic bass and flute. Themes are alternately serene and more energetic, building intensity all the way to the end. From there, we go to a sweet and tender piano solo called \"So Much To Say.\" To show he still hasn't run out of new directions to take his listeners, \"A Quiet Spark\" is a gently ambient piano solo that comes directly from the heart. \"The Dreamer\" is atmospheric and hypnotic with a single low tone that runs through the whole piece along with keyboard and strings that cast a peaceful, magical spell. The last track is another surprise called \"Chorale,\" which pretty much says it all. Joy Askew overdubbed multiple vocal tracks, singing soprano, alto, and tenor parts and bringing the album to a close with an elegant wordless hymn.\n\nDespite the varied styles of music on this album, it holds together really well and takes the listener on an aural journey. Recommended!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1399507200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Reffett","reviewText":"Heartfelt, passionate, strong, and beautiful!  This music speaks to the heart like a lover speaks to their beloved.  From the opening track beginning with the cello and violins, the mood is passionate and longing, but then it changes over to powerful rhythm of drums and a male and female choir with a dramatic theme like a mighty army coming closer to its target.  Then, the music and the voices abruptly stop and you hear the echoes die in the spaciousness of what I picture as vaulted ceilings.  This music could well be used for a battle scene with intermittent cut scenes going back and forth with the main character remembering the person that he left behind.  This is the first soundtrack that I have bought from Audiomachine, and it will probably not be my last.  They know what they are doing, and they have truly produced some epic music on this album.  Some of the composers that Paul Dinletir and Kevin Rix like are Mozart, Beethoven, Debussy, Hans Zimmer, and Harry Gragson-Williams which are composers I like as well.  One of the elements that I think makes music great is the phrasing of the themes that the composer comes up with and the variations of the themes that they make after they have stated the main theme.  Another element that I believe makes music great is not just the notes, but the silence between the notes.  Claude Debussy stated, \"Music is the silence between the notes,\" and J. Krishnamurti stated, \"Listen both to the sound of the bell and to the silence between it's strokes.\"  I like the phrasing that the composers have used of silence in their music, and they have created some great music.  As a case in point, take Track 2 with the beginning string's and the two-beat base, and they then add the theme with a female voice that hauntingly goes above this background rhythm like a crow flying over a desolate forest and landscape.  To strengthen the theme, the composers then use trumpets and horns to bring the theme more power and strength.  Then, unlike the first track, the composers do not go completely silent, but have about 4 measures with only the two-beat base going.  After that break, the music comes back with a heroic feeling of determination, like an army fighting against powerful odds.  I love piano music, and to me, it is like a violin, bringing out feelings of love and tenderness.  Track 3 starts out with just the piano playing a theme that denotes sadness, like someone may have just died, but soon it is joined by base, cello, and drums.  After this, a female voice begins the lament; powerful drums with a driving beat then pick up the pace.  Then, the musical journey begins over mountains, fording rivers, through dark valleys to reach the end of their quest for peace and some kind of meaning out of the sorrows of life.  I will not go through each track for music is meant to be listened to and felt, more than described and analyzed.  Each tack is wonderful to listen to, and it transports you wherever you let your imagination go.  Enjoy!","summary":"Unbelievable Beauty!","unixReviewTime":1408406400,"vote":"2","image":null}

And that is saying a lot. If you're not a fan of down south crunkish production then that's probably the only reason you wouldn't agree. Reconcile is a solid emcee, wit unique, gritty delivery that's clear. Honest without sacrificing the message of Christ. The album is diverse in songs, though primarily targeted for the inner city. His imagery is clear enough so that if you didn't grow up in the hood you'll be gripped. He's versatile, crunk, laid back, romance, the struggle, repentance and deliverance are all covered.

Ultimately the decision was made that Hank would sing the song and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" was released as the\"B\" side of \"My Bucket's Got A Hole In It\" in February 1949. C&W deejays discovered the song anyway and it quickly became a favorite on Country radio and a staple of Hank's \"live\" shows. Still a large segment of the record-buying public remained unfamiliar with the tune. That all changed in 1966 when a young pop-country singer from Texas named B.J. Thomas re-imagined the song for mid-60's pop audiences. \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" by B.J. Thomas and the Triumphs would race all the way to #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April of that year. For my money this continues to be most moving version of this song ever recorded.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"B.J.

Jazmine Sullivan has been one of those singers who has honestly been unappreciated and overlooked with having great songs and honestly her music has shown some highs that brought out the best in her voice. But honestly, she also has had some songs that just really have been a miss in her work from the heart. Her lead single from her album Reality Show, Dumb, isn't actually one of her better songs.  I really think the song isn't actually one of her good songs, but the video of puppets and humans having affairs and make-outs is honestly one of the creepiest videos I had ever seen. I really hope Jazmine Sullivan has good music with Reality Show coming out, but this song is honestly a must have for your music library.\n\nSong: D","summary":"Could Be Brighter","unixReviewTime":1419465600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Calling his music atmospheric music takes it in a somewhat different direction from new age or ambient because its both and yet neither from a purist standpoint. With elements of prog rock, the album features Luttrell on acoustic and electric guitars as well as keyboards with twelve songs that follow the theme of exchanging dreams. In the liner notes, Luttrell explains: Throughout our lives we share our dreams with family and friends, and they share their dreams with us. If we're lucky we can help them activate and achieve their dreams and also work on achieving our own. How wonderful it is to experience and share in this Dream Exchange. A lifelong musician who has lived and absorbed cultural influences from all over the world, Luttrells music reflects many of these influences and gives him a very distinctive sound.\n\n\"The Dream Exchange\" begins with Orange Sky, a piece that combines dreamy atmospheric sounds with a gently-floating guitar melody and a lively rhythm that comes and goes - a very effective opening! The Sphere contains a variety of styles and is possibly one of the more prog rock pieces. From Hawaiian guitar to electric rock guitar over ambient musical and atmospheric sounds, it has no hard edges while continuously evolving as it develops. Dreamcast is a favorite. Slow and graceful with a shimmering beauty, it reminds me of watching a sunset by the ocean. The title track opens with the sound of rain and thunder and then the electric guitar enters, evoking images of the sun breaking through the storm clouds. From there, guitars express tones of peaceful calm and tranquility - also a favorite. I love the title Somnambulistic Journey, and the misty, dreamy music is the perfect accompaniment to a peaceful sleepwalking expedition. Ethereal Raga combines a catchy rhythm and mysterious ambient sounds to create colorful images that dance slowly in atmospheric clouds - fascinating! Inland Returned is light and fanciful with acoustic and electric guitars leading the way with a gentle smile. With You brings the album to a close with an easy, swaying rhythm and feelings of blissful contentment.\n\n\"The Dream Exchange\" is quiet, relaxing music with plenty of substance to hold your interest while letting your imagination fly.

I don't mind Brantley Gilbert making a song about the undeserved death of a soldier, since most of his material released as singles is either mediocre or absolutely horrible (I give 'Bottoms Up' credit for at least being catchy even though there are things about it that I don't like), but trying to express the emotion of th death of a loved one in a song, and then using the most trite, horrid, and annoying high-pitched guitar solos all over the song make the person the song is about ashamed. In fact, this is worse than what Gilbert has put out with any of his other singles. At least songs like 'Read Me My Rights' & 'Stone Cold Sober' show that Gilbert is making music correctly even though the instrumental elements of the songs may not be done well.\n\nBut, when Radio Stations fumble with what gets played on the radio, and then choose a very annoying and terrible song to play, thats what should be abolished for eternity.  Even worse is when they play a bad song ad nauseum, you predict they probably won't play a song that much to elavate your anger, but they do anyway, no matter how you feel about the song, and it never stops until you start hating the song with a passion, and THEN they start to cool down with that song. Instead of just stopping with the song right when you feel like they need to stop. That is a method in radio, not just country, that needs to be abolished from reality for eternity.\n\nWe need a Brantley Gilbert song that isn't so boring, bland, trite, or not what you want to repeat on Spotify. His new single isn't helping because besides the country pop and rock stuff that you saw in 'Bottoms Up', Gilbert ends up using some of the worst cliches and overused phrases. Instead of thinking to yourself 'Finally, a song from this guy I can actually tolerate beyond chart movement', its always the same feelings about a whole new song all over again.\n\nSo overall, listen to Toby Keiths 'Ameican Soldier' instead of this stupid Def Leppard, Guns N Roses country garbage with lyrics.","summary":"A song with a great story that is awful....","unixReviewTime":1470614400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Jana Kramer.\n\nWell, i never heard of her before this (Media, always keeping young-uns from the public). And man, what a shame.... what shame, because this song is so beautiful and has a feeling of reaching. Like searching and knowing that the treasure is just around the corner. Kind of like at the end of Thor (the movie) when everything has happened and the last line, \"She searches for you...\" Oh my gosh.  One of the best kinds of \"epic\" ever...\n\nLove is about searching for it. Searching for love and where it may be hiding. We always feel heart break, and imposters always come our way.... but we keep searching, knowing it will just be around the corner. That hope pushes us forward. Like an adventure.\nAnd that's what this song sounds like. An adventure right on the border between sad and hopeful. Jana Kramer sounds amazing. The lyrics are fantastic (though the beginning may or may not be cringeworthy). The beat and the melody is beautiful. And the feeling it gives you is the same feeling i experienced at the end of Thor. \"She searches for you...\"\n\nIncredible. Buy it.

They are at the core of the culture's goals alongside having a good time, challenging popular thought, and expressing oneself artistically and creatively. Already well experienced in the rap game, Queens, New York emcee Cormega makes effective use of his time by employing these principles in Mega Philosophy, a collaboration album with the legendary Large Professor serving as producer. Cormega is by far more mature than he has ever been. He stresses many points including achieving inner peace through questioning, keeping an open mind, persevering, and taking personal responsibility. In fact the whole album revolves around the theme of maintaining a strong mental state, which is the secret to life. Cormega's smooth flow of intelligent rhymes coupled with the Large Professor's no-frills beats make for classical hip hop listening, and the guest emcees, Redman, AZ, Styles P, Nature, Raekwon, and Black Rob, all contribute very hot, very smart verses. If Mega seems to get redundant, he is only paraphrasing, putting his lessons in other words to get through to his listeners; thus, he never gets dull. Driving his points home in a little more than thirty minutes, he is also concise with no fluff or fillers. Cormega and the Large Professor have not invented any groundbreaking formulas but instead simply combine their talents to make good, authentic hip hop for what might be one of the year's best rap albums.","summary":"Cormega's philosophy serves as a powerful reminder in 'Mega Philosophy'","unixReviewTime":1488067200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The Naxos version led by Martini is the most complete of all but compromised by by some unattractive singing and Germanic accents.\n\nI acquired to Somary Messiah years ago on LP when it was considered the \"last word\" in style - pre-period instruments. It features an outstanding solo quartet and good choral and orchestral work. I also have it on CD, along with the Judas Maccabeus. Alexander Young's heroic Judas is still the benchmark against which I judge his more recent rivals. Hyperion's version of Judas does, however, offer a colorful version of the score on period instruments. Deutsche Harmonia Mundi has a very pallid hero.\n\nThe Semele is OK but is outclassed in modern instrument performances by Nelson's DG version with Kathleen Battle in the title role. Nelson also offers more of the music as does Curnyn (with period instruments) on Chandos Chaconne although Rosemary Joshua's singing in the title role has drawn mixed response. (I happen to like it.)  Gardiner recorded a somewhat cut version on Erato that is well sung and played on period instruments. With the upheavals in the classical recording industry over the past few years, any or all of the CD based versions may be difficult to find.\n\nThe Jephtha is also a good performance that I've owned on Vanguard Cardinal LPs for years. It has serious rivals in more recent period performance offerings but Helen Watts' over the top Storge is still worth the price of admission - along with Young. (I bought the present set to supplement the noisy LP surfaces of the Cardinal pressings. I also have the Theodora on CD and it has held up well despite Maureen Lehane's lack of a trill (as Irene) and Maureen Forrester's sometimes hooty vocal production.\n\nAt the price, you can't go wrong.","summary":"The performances have help up well over the years","unixReviewTime":1439769600,"vote":null,"image":null}

I say over six years because I had first heard this song either when my husband and I were living in Mayport Naval Base Florida or Orlando Florida. I have also heard a version by Tom Jones before on one of his greatest hits collection. Around 2015,I then heard it on iheartradio and this version of Black Betty by Ram Jam grew on me after hearing it enough times on my personalized favorites radio station especially because of the guitars and the well timed lyrics with the music. This song could best be described as hard rock\/classic rock.","summary":"Strong Guitars","unixReviewTime":1466467200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Blige, she has had some really great songs, and others that haven't been able to hit the nail on the head. The songs that she had made over the years have been both hit and miss. Twenty years ago, she was able to hit the nail on the head with having a song hit big from the movies, with Not Goin' Cry from Waiting To Exhale back in 1995. The song really was a great song. But her latest set of songs, honestly aren't as good as what she had before. Suitcase, the lead single from the Think Like A Man Too soundtrack, isn't exactly as a saying, \"I am leaving you,\" song, as strong as some of her other songs had shown before. Hopefully, there will be better songs from Mary down the road, because this song really was a waste from the heart, and that is saying pack it up and get away from this song.\n\nSong: C","summary":"Pack Up & Get Away","unixReviewTime":1405555200,"vote":null,"image":null}

However, this album is very beautiful and adds to the eclectic music of TSFH. I want to point out that Thomas Bergersen composed this entire album but it was released as a TSFH album since many of these songs were released on previous industry albums. I would not recommend buying this if you are new to TSFH as it does not represent what they are most famous for. However, I would recommend buying this if you prefer softer pieces and songs that almost sound like pop music (I think Thomas created a new genre of music with this album - \"epic pop\", listen to \"My Freedom\" and you'll see what I mean), or if you have everything else from TSFH and want more. This is definitely a must if you are a diehard TSFH fan. If you are new to TSFH I would recommend Battlecry, Vanquish, Illusions, or Sun. The former two if you want epic courageous music, and the latter two if you primarily want epic emotional\/beautiful music.\nHighlights of this album include: Miracles, Compass (especially the bonus track), My Freedom, Fountain of Life, Color the Sky, Breath of Cold Air, Wind Queen, Lost in Las Vegas.","summary":"Awesome softer pieces and epic pop songs.","unixReviewTime":1487980800,"vote":null,"image":null}

They include Big Beethoven Box, Big Handel Oratorio Box, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music to my digital library. This album is very good. It features over four hours of Johann Sebastian Bachs orchestral music, including all of his Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites, as well as several concertos. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I don't think it quite rises to the level of the finest albums of Bachs orchestral music, many of which I also own. (Those include: Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites by Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert; Keyboard Concertos by Murray Perahia and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields; and Oboe Concertos by Christian Hommel and the Cologne Chamber Orchestra.)\n\nThe performances found on Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music appear to date from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate a very high degree of artistry and musicianship. However, these performances seem (to my ears, anyway) to lack some of the driving tempos and pungency found in later historically informed performances of Bachs music that I prefer. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings, the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well balanced.\n\nDespite my minor concerns about Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music I still think it is a good sampler of Johann Sebastian Bachs orchestral music. With its excellent performances, well-rounded musical selections, and good audio quality, and with its low price of 99 cents, I can easily recommend this album.","summary":"Excellent performances, well-rounded musical selections, and good audio quality.","unixReviewTime":1526860800,"vote":null,"image":null}

In this considerable gap of time, the guys have kept busy doing various, individual side albums, collaborations, and other projects. Apparently the timeout must have inspired member appreciation of how valuable their combined chemistry really is because this 2014 Directors Of Photography album ranks equally with any one of their previous albums, which set a more ambitious standard for conscious hip hop with each consecutive release. The hallowed LA triumvirate are essentially back to their specialty, kicking tight, crafty hip hop rhymes and lyrics over elegant, soulful beats that are expertly put together, samples included. Fans can look forward to more life lessons on which to ponder and more unique attitudes, opinions, perspectives and philosophies to consider. In addition to the mental, metaphysical goodies on the album, Rakaa and Evidence also dabble in some tough-talk rapping, which means they believe in what they're saying, they are not speaking on some loose whim, and they can back up their words with strong reasoning. Every track on the album is a gem, but a few really stand out. \"Show Me The Way\" sounds like it could be a radio song. It's motivational, and it's got a great beat, a great hook, and great lyrics behind it. \"Figure It Out (Melvin's Theme)\" is notable for its screwed, scratched beat, which sounds like the old East Coast-influenced West meets DJ Screw's Houston, a great hip hop cut. The gang are not without worldly awareness in \"Century Of The Self\" where they analyze the corrupt, selfish tendencies of human nature on earth. The Dilated Peoples have always been proponents of building mentally and expanding minds. They have always come original and never copied trends or tried to be something other than themselves. Directors Of Photography is all those things at once, and as a result, everyone wins.","summary":"Dilated Peoples are at the top of their game with 'Directors Of Photography'","unixReviewTime":1488067200,"vote":null,"image":null}

This not the Cupid Shuffle revisited but still a song that you put on at a party to get people up to dance.

And he candidly crafts a song that questions whether or not he has the surefire approach to it all.  Is he scared of the acclaim, has he not been a forthcoming as a disciple of Christ?  Will he hear Jesus say to him \"Well done my good and faithful servant\"?  In the song \"Fear\" he carefully weighs those options, and the bass, keys, drums acoustic guitar to the multilingual translation of Psalm 23 are a introspective look at Lecrae's understanding.  And Natalie Lauren's beautiful voice offers encouraging advice to Lecrae's verses to be unafraid.  As people of God we know that the fear of men is a snare, But the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.

Featuring the Barchet Quartet, this is a very good MP3 album that contains over 10 hours of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts string quartets and quintets, all very artistically performed.\n\nThis MP3 VoxBox Edition contains all 23 of the string quartets in Mozarts oeuvre, plus all 6 of the string quintets he also composed. The works are placed in chronological order by their assigned K&ouml;chel (K) number, quartets first, followed by quintets. This allows listeners to hear the progression of Mozarts musical thinking and development over the years of composing in this genre.  Without question, each of these chamber works is a Mozartean masterpiece.\n\nThe Barchet Quartet was a German ensemble founded by violinist Reinhold Barchet. Other members of the ensemble were violinist Will Beh, violist Hermann Hirschfelder, and cellist Helmut Reimann. Violist Emil Kessinger joined the Barchets as a second viola for the string quintets. The musicianship of these players is generally excellent, although on occasion the violins sound a trifle over-bright, and display a bit more vibrato than my ears prefer. The audio quality is certainly crisp, clean, and precise, but the recordings thin string timbre and lack of fine detail make it obvious that these are older recordings that date from the 1950s and 1960s. However, this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.\n\nWhen Mozart: The Complete String Quartets and Quintets first came out at Amazon.com in 2014, it apparently sold for 99 cents  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at nearly ten times that price ($9.49) I think it remains an excellent classical music value. With its low price, very fine performances, and good audio quality, it is certainly recommendable for any digital music library.","summary":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts complete string quartets and quintets, all very artistically performed.","unixReviewTime":1506643200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I admired these on Lp and the sound quality -- although variable from performance to performance -- basically has held up well. For $0.99, this collection is a steal, but don't expect the virtuosity of more modern string quartets like the Alban Berg or Hagen or Emerson. As compensation, the playing is consistently warm-hearted. Think Bruno Walter's late recordings on Sony or Josef Krips and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra for similar approaches to Mozart's symphonic works.","summary":"Good performances and a great bargain","unixReviewTime":1453507200,"vote":"2","image":null}

Gauthier","reviewText":"If you're looking to pummel your senses, then this is the album for you.  Considered the leading doom metal band all across the globe, Electric Wizard carefully crafted another reminder that they have no intention whatsoever of relinquishing their throne.  My first Electric Wizard album was \"Black Masses,\" which I love for its heavy Black Sabbath influences (and who happen to be one of my all-time favorite bands), but \"Time to Die\" is another beast in itself.  Other reviewers have compared it to \"Dopethrone,\" which I have not yet heard, but this album is MUCH heavier than \"Black Masses.\"\n\nIn fact, the album is so heavy that the guitar, bass, and drums can be a little overwhelming.  The lyrics on several songs are practically indecipherable and wind up sounding like witches chanting (in a good way).  With the exception of \"Destroy Those Who Love God,\" \"SadioWitch,\" and \"Saturn Dethroned,\" every song on this album is either close to or over 10 minutes in length, which is enough to loosen even the sturdiest of brains.  And of course the band lays on the Satanic schtick, adding audio clips involving cult killings and the like throughout the album.\n\n\"I Am Nothing,\" \"We Love the Dead,\" \"SadioWitch,\" and \"Lucifer's Slaves\" are my personal favorite tracks, but you can't treat this the same way you would another album.  Listening to Electric Wizard is, in and of itself, a completely different experience than just simply listening to your average album.  Sometimes it requires dimming the lights, lighting some candles, burning some insence...you get the idea.  Now enjoy!","summary":"Electric Wizard Return...with a Vengeance!","unixReviewTime":1431648000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Ghost is also a song that draws a listener in because she is singing about someone who has left an impact on her and is singing about her though process of trying to figure out how to best deal with it. Henderson also carefully projects her voice during the song in a way that conveys she is really putting all of her spirit and emotion to the song.

Gauthier","reviewText":"If you're new to Red Fang and their music, I think the easiest way to describe them is to compare them to the Melvins.  Their style of sludge metal\/stoner rock is very similar, though they have a much more serious edge to their lyrics.  They've described their music as being for head-thinkers as well as head-bangers, and I would wholeheartedly agree.  There is a level of social commentary to their lyrics that cannot be ignored, and it serves them well.\n\nWhat we have here are three acoustic versions of songs available on two of their full-length albums, \"Murder the Mountains\" and \"Whales and Leeches.\"  Following the acoustic versions are the original album versions, provided perhaps in an attempt to establish greater contrast between the two versions.  Either way, these songs kick some serious ass.\n\nThe session starts with \"Failure,\" which can be found on the band's most recent album, \"Whales and Leeches.\"  The two songs that follow--\"Human Herd\" and \"Malverde\"--can be found on their sophomore album, \"Murder the Mountains.\"  Both albums are available on Relapse Records, and I strongly recommend you check out this free EP if you're at all interested in the music of Red Fang.","summary":"Red Fang Go Acoustic for an Intimate Look into Their Music","unixReviewTime":1445558400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Jimmy Page called it \"waking up the army of guitars.\" It also prevents Robert Plant from sneaking up on us - we are ready when his voice bursts out of the speakers. The song is about a lustful old black Labrador Retriever that lived near Headley Grange during the recording sessions.\n\nThe precision of the music is indeed reminiscent of a military close-order drill. The main riff, written by John Paul Jones, represents the guitar army, layers of them, marching together, inspiring awe and respect. They even create a brass timbre somehow, at least to my ears. The call and response pattern lasts until 0:42, when the riff gets twisted up and discombobulated before righting itself at 0:52 as we head into the oh yeah break. Jimmy plays some nifty descending runs and we head into the second verse: I gotta roll can't stand still got a flamin heart can't get my fill.\n\nAt 1:27 we get a calming set of ah ah ah etc from Robert, but then at 1:38 John Bonham's drums explode with awesome power. This is a tremendously exciting moment, one of my favorites of any song. The levels are perfect: attack, loudness, reverb, emotional effect. Whoa. It takes us into another new part, the hey baby whoa baby I-don't-wear-pants-and-I'm-a-lecherous-black-dog part. This goes on until 2:04.\n\nThe song cycles back through the basic layout once more, adding a sweet guitar double helix at 3:07. Finally, at 3:37, the general of the guitar army proudly shows off the skills of improvised battle strategy, as the troops continue their parade with no signs of tiring.","summary":"SEP 15","unixReviewTime":1497225600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The (erstwhile?) member of the great Be Good Tanyas has been quite active since the Be Good Tanyas went on (forever?) hiatus in 2007. Ford issued a well-received solo album in 2010 with \"Obadiah' and the followed that up with this album in 2014.\n\n\"Indian Ocean\" (11 tracks including the \"hidden\" bonus track; 47 min.)  opens with \"September Fields\", about as accessible as anything Ford has done before. Immediately apparent in the sound are the warm horns. Turns out this is non other than the legendary Hi Rhythm Section, holy cow! Things slow down a bit on \"You're Free\". The album has a pretty nice overall R&B feel to it, check out \"Done\" (1st radio single) as a great example. Side B opens with the deceptively slow \"You Got Religion\". Another highlight deeper into the album is the hard-charging \"Natural Law\". But it all leads to the epic (and album-closing) title track, a 6+ min. journey (with observations like \"You come again and again\/And you, you're sorry\/You're sorry\/For what you've done\"). The \"hidden track \"September Fields\" is an acoustic version of the album's opening song, just Frazey and her guitar. Bottom line: this is a delightful album on many levels. I have no idea whether the Be Good Tanyas will ever come together again, but it's clear that Frazey Ford has found her own path and voice.\n\nJust this past weekend I saw Frazey Ford in concert at the beautiful Nelsonville Music Fest here in Ohio. Ford and her band played an hour long set in the late afternoon on the main stage, and the crowd absolutely loved her. She played mostly from \"Indian Ocean\" but also a couple of tunes that I didn't recognize and am quite certain these are new songs. Given that it took her 4 years between the first and second solo album, here's hoping we'll get a new album next year (at the latest!). If you have a chance to see Frazey Ford live, don't miss her!","summary":"Great album, but we need new music! Don't miss her in concert","unixReviewTime":1496880000,"vote":null,"image":null}

The proficient, dexterous youngster, Bishop Nehru, who aside from emceeing and producing has tried his hand at music video editing and directing, has learned, adapted and shined through with the tools that the experienced emcee\/producer MF Doom has handed him. Their collaborative album, NehruvianDOOM, blends crafty lyrics from Nehru, eclectically made beats by Doom, and an optimistic tone from the two artists combined. Considering his youth and scant years in the industry, Bishop Nehru surprisingly has a very clear, confident perspective on life, an unclouded vision, and a maturity that surpasses his years. In the face of others' jealousy and envy, he lays out his philosophy with strength in his delivery. Although Bishop Nehru mentions having to adjust to a dog eat dog world on \"Caskets\" (MF Doom provides a rap verse on that song), he counters this stark tone with words of love on \"Mean The Most.\" Ultimately, NehruvianDOOM would not sound as unique as it does if not for MF Doom's multifaceted production skills. Doom layers light and heavy sounds on top of each other and characteristically inserts obscure sound bytes to reinforce the album's mission. Bishop Nehru embraces his youth for the time being, but he also proves to be a threatening contender to his emcee peers. The youthful smarts in Nehru's skillful lyrics plus Doom's very special beats make NehruvianDOOM a fresh, underground treat.","summary":"Veteran hip hop artist assists aspiring wunderkind on 'NehruvianDOOM'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Im one of the millions of kids who grew up with the original trilogy. I ran around with chopsticks taped to my back as you do when you're 4, pretending to be a ninja turtle. The turtles have been revamped before, and not too long ago hit theaters as an animated feature. The great thing about this ever-lasting franchise is that they have no musical identity (maybe the original TV theme song and Vanilla Ice sadly) so it becomes an open canvas for a composer. I mean, how many of you remember John Du Prezs scores for the original trilogy? Or even Klaus Badelts awesome score for TMNT in 2007? The scores worked in the moment, but never became attached to these characters, and this allowed for Tyler to build a simply damn awesome orchestral action score from scratch.\n\nBrian Tyler reunites with director Jonathan Liebesman for their fourth feature together here. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is simply just a fantastic orchestral approach to the typical summer studio tentpole. Everything about this score moves with fluidity, intensity, awe and a warm heroic glow. A simple theme acts as the lifeline of the score. It carries the weight of the films much larger action scope with ease. It can turn one way and feel heavy and dramatic, but it can also flip to be uplifting and heroic. Tyler affectionately refers to it as the TMNT March. The whole score is nothing really complicated, it propels the action and gives it an old school adventure vibe. Parts of it reminded me of Jerry Goldsmiths The Mummy, it had that kind of adventure spirit. Some parts also reminded me of Hans Zimmers Man Of Steel, mostly Zimmers main theme and the track Terraforming. Tylers action writing is not too different from Zimmer though, they do approach things similarly which is fun because their stylistic approaches are very different. Even if there was a little case of temp track hangover, Tylers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is its own fun ride. Its melodically charged and gives the film a big adrenaline rush without being contrived or unnecessarily loud. The flow of the adventure is so smooth, and with long tracks you get a feel for the scores structure. The theme is used a lot, but I never got a one-note type feel. The only thing lacking is some emotional and structural depth.\n\nBrian Tylers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is all types of fun. Its a great action score done in that great orchestral fashion that Tyler is known for. A simple theme holds the dramatic weight of the film, plus adds heroic flare. You won't find deep emotions or anything much beyond the main theme, but thats all the score needs to do here. There are plenty of great moments, superb action builds and the music flows with ease. The score delivers all that you need in order to watch this incarnation of the turtles fighting the baddies in an action extravaganza.\n\nKaya Savas for filmmusicmedia.com","summary":"Great Old Fashioned Adventure Score","unixReviewTime":1416268800,"vote":null,"image":null}

In the album, he deals with how he has evolved with hip hop over the years, his having to overcome obstacles in and out of the music business, and even his recent weight loss and lifestyle change to increased physical fitness. Joell Ortiz is obviously in a healthy place in life, considering the fact that he is performing this self examination with a grateful attitude. He is still that creative, hard edged emcee who raps with advanced lyricism. And for every filler track on House Slippers, there are three or four intelligent tracks to make up for them. In other words, the bulk of the album is made up of smart material. Ortiz has invited some rappers and some singers to appear on House Slippers and has even brought his Slaughterhouse group mates (Royce Da 5'9'', Joe Budden, and Crooked I) into the studio for \"Brothers Keeper\" to show that besides being a rap quartet, they are also a family. The production is handled mainly by The Heatmakerz and gives the album a sparkling yet rugged sound. This time around, Joell Ortiz is a more self aware artist who spits fire on the mic over nice hip hop beats. House Slippers is a good addition to his growing body of work.","summary":"'House Slippers' marks a time of comfortable reflection for Joell Ortiz","unixReviewTime":1488067200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I think it could have been a decent song if it had fewer artists, and the beat didn't stay the same the whole time.  I love the fact that there are Christian rappers, but I can't give five stars on a song review just for that.  With that said, I heard enough in this song to give me interest in seeing what else these artists have to offer.  I actually just recently downloaded a 116 song featuring Tedashii called \"Now they Know\", and I really enjoy it.

My Mom would have the radio on and I would lay down and watch as the various neon lights of fast food chains were reflected on the window. We might head to McDonalds for some 'food' or a 'milkshake'. There is a down to earth late night quality to this song, the reverb on the vocals and music, the simple jangly guitar chords, the drum fills. I always liked the name-checking of the various cities in the US - Phoenix, Tacoma, Philadelphia, Atlanta, LA. When I got older I often wondered why Tacoma was included, since it's way smaller than the other ones. I thought it might have been a nod to the Tacoma Dome, but that wasn't constructed until 1983. It must be that it sort of rhymes with Arizona. Arizona - Tacoma - Oklahoma - Bologna. Catchy stuff, Steve Miller. He includes all of northern California in his lyrics. Why limit himself to one city when 'the girls are warm' in an entire area? There were probably a lot of girls in northern Cali who heard this song and thought, \"Hey, I live in northern California and I'm warm.

Though the mountain seems insurmountable and the process seems difficult, the words of this simple song reassures me that Im not alone my God is with me.

Many times it doesnt work out the way Ive thought or planned but I have resigned myself to say He reigns as my God and my God alone.

Released in October 2014 by hip hop trio Diamond District (producer Oddisee and emcees yU and Uptown XO) under Mello Music Group, March On Washington just might be the perfect album to reserve for February, Black History Month, to review. Although it doesn't explicitly make race an issue, this crystalline-bright LP, inspired by the event during which Martin Luther King Jr. made his famous I Have A Dream speech, has a sense of vigor and urgency that mimic the 1963 civil rights gathering which it is named after. When the three artists on the album wear their Black pride on their sleeves however, they do so with a good measure of modesty. Boiled down, March On Washington is simply amazing music for all people, irrespective of skin tone. You could listen to this beautiful album a dozen times and still need more plays to capture and appreciate all the gifts it intends to bestow upon its listeners. It's that good.\n\nOddisee, yU and XO hail from the Washington DC area, or the DMV (DC, Maryland and Virginia) as some call it. They're not shy about representing their area with pride, but they're also not obsessed with the practice either thankfully. March On Washington is basically a clarion call to live healthfully. The album's wisdom easily takes the cake, and this wisdom is not the boring, snooze-inducing type but the cool, useful, knowledge-based sort aided of course by a preponderance of superlative rap flows by yU and XO. Each stanza flourishes with excellent lyrical rhymes and undisturbed thoughts on everyday life. Areas explored include the differences among people, critique of the mainstream and lots of bubbly, effervescent proverbs. Diamond District wish to share their preternatural skill, talent and ways of thinking, and the richness and captivating nature of March On Washington prove the group's success to this end. The album is smart but also fun, never losing its lyrical weightiness. The ride is smooth yet hypnotic, as everything rests comfortably on Oddisee's soul-drenched samples and crisp drum set beats. Look out for a few surprises like \"Working Weekends\"' squeaky, chirpy alt. sounds. The variety they provide will come in handy.\n\nAlthough only their second album as a group following 2009's In The Ruff, Diamond District have the hip hop heart and substance to make them instant breakout hit makers. Each of the three members are proving themselves singly with outside projects, but together they might be even more special. March On Washington is exciting and philosophical, with lots of slow-bopping replay value that is street tested and boom-bap approved.","summary":"Diamond District bring The Dream to life in 'March On Washington'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The Beauty Of Independence is a great showing of solidarity from G-Unit, considering the fact that all four original members are on the EP. When nature dictates that groups tend to disband over time, this complete reunification is a feat in and of itself. The gang are essentially back to their old antics, and this consistency proves to be a fitting formula. The opener, \"Watch Me,\" brings listeners up to speed and establishes the current level of musicality with which the group is comfortable and proficient. It is gangsta through and through, and as an introduction to G-Unit in 2014, it screams to audiences everywhere, \"Here they are!\" The follow up track, \"I Don't F--- With You,\" is more real gangsterism over concert style cornets, giving way to \"Digital Scale,\" a track almost exclusively dedicated to the subject of drug dealing, a topic which is touched on again in \"The Plug.\" Nowhere is this G-Unit crew more eloquent, however, than on \"Changes,\" where they discuss reversals of fortune and how nothing ever really remains the same over time. Overall the guys do a good job of being lyrical on a competitive level, and some nice, new territory is explored production-wise throughout. The Beauty Of Independence is a nice EP with high marks for having good energy and perfect attendance.","summary":"G-Unit reunite for 'The Beauty Of Independence' EP","unixReviewTime":1488067200,"vote":null,"image":null}

In hip hop, Compton, California instrumentalist, producer, disc jockey, and rapper DJ Quik is one of those continuously exceptional artists who is legendary to his coast and hip hop as a whole. Producing and rapping since the eighties and playing instruments since a child, Quik, or David Blake, has assembled some of the most gorgeous funk and soul beats of all time and has always been an interesting emcee on the mic. He has worked with many figures in the biz from Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube to his frequently recurring collaborators, AMG, 2nd II None, Hi-C, El DeBarge, Suga Free, and Playa Hamm, some of whom appear on Quik's ninth solo album, The Midnight Life. Quik of course infuses his signature funk and soul into the album but puts a different twist on them just for this collection of songs. Cool, original guitar, piano, and horns with strong drums and claps are layered upon each other for a rich, voluptuous audio experience from start to finish. Quik has added some talk boxing, an unusual instrument (by hip hop standards) in the second track, and a jaw dropping concept beat in \"Trapped On The Tracks.\" His lyrics are again stimulating and diverse with rhymes, and in addition to the familiar guests are some new ones, Bishop Lamont, David Blake II, and Dom Kennedy. Quik runs the gamut of speaking topics from personal philosophy to natural social phenomena, but his main aim is to have a great time in the musical process. Amongst his various talking points, he hits upon the mark he has made on the game, the beauty of living fly, his seniority in hip hop, just deserts for promiscuous women, and relationship communication. DJ Quik has such appealing, easily identifiable style and flavor that are unique enough so as to require little maintenance over time except for the necessary experimentation for freshness and modern day relevancy. He has put all those things in The Midnight Life, so the new dawn for the Compton raised, music virtuoso looks very bright.","summary":"DJ Quik raps ceremoniously over luxurious new beats in 'The Midnight Life'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The Michigan-bred beat maker Brown has constructed a great set of productions that are just as complex and interesting as Ras Kass' lyrics are. As the title suggests, Blasphemy starts with Ras Kass making critical arguments against popular religions, especially Christianity, in \"How To Kill God.\" He will continue in this questioning fashion for other tracks, like \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" where he discusses various historical violations of The Golden Rule. Although proclaiming himself a fallen angel, he boasts wisdom all over Blasphemy by preaching clean living (\"Please Don't Let Me\"), racial equality (\"Strawberry\") and moral rules (\"48 Laws Pt. 1\"). As always though, Ras Kass still finds time to brag, strut and celebrate his gifts. His lyrical game is still sharp after all these years and so is his storytelling, as evidenced by \"Too Much Of A Good Thing\" and \"Francine,\" two songs about demons coming back to haunt mischievous women. Making the perfect beats to match the high caliber lyricism of Kass is no easy task. That's why Apollo Brown has combined eclectic samples, elegant instruments and East Coast style drum beats for a super nice audio event that can claim bits of orchestra, soul and r&b music within its mix.\n\nBlasphemy contains three power-packed posse cuts, but with all the mighty guest verses on the album, they never seem to outshine Kass and his enormous lyrical prominence. Apollo Brown and Ras Kass are both respectful of the hip hop culture and the rap game, even if Kass is picking on industry giants one moment (\"Humble Pi\") and saluting deceased legends the next (\"Bon Voyage\"). They make for a very compelling duo on the risky yet entertaining Blasphemy.","summary":"Apollo Brown and Ras Kass prove compatible in the daring 'Blasphemy'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Released by Rhymesayers Entertainment, the same label that released HHM's first LP, Are You Gonna Eat That?, Bestiary contains a more digestible form of its fore- album's bizarre, complex lyricism of wacky, oddball imagery and situations. Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic are unruly, aimless badasses, rapping all over the place and in all directions. With their ill rhyme styles, they explore the nature and philosophy of life and death, and their wild, artful rapping accurately mimics the chaos of the world. Taking its name from the word meaning a written account of real and fantasy animals, Bestiary contains some animal imagery but just lots of other imagery too, like art gallery-scale imagery. Despite all the craziness and a few dark undertones, there is a sense of purpose, hope and levity in Bestiary thanks to the \"fund raiser concert\" skits and their do-it-yourself subtext. Coupled with the intelligent, left field lyrics, the samples, scratches, diverse synths and hard rocking drums make Bestiary a truly eccentric specimen of underground, alternative hip hop. It marks a new level of comfort for Hail Mary Mallon that just might prove comforting to audiences as well.","summary":"Hail Mary Mallon's fantastic jumble 'Bestiary' connects and resonates","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Their newest platter and first with RCA Records was released November 1971 on both sides of the pond - but barely managed a No. 100 placing in the US LP charts with a big fat zilch in the UK.\n\nBut then again 1970's \"Lola Versus Powerman...\" and 1971's Soundtrack to \"Percy\" (both on Pye) hadnt bothered British LP charts either. In fact - excepting obvious crowd-pleasing hit singles between the LPs like \"Lola\" and \"Apeman\" and despite the musical-excellence of what Raymond Douglas Davies & Co. was collectively producing - the public seemed utterly indifferent  especially in their native Blighty. I can recall this album being in bargain bins for decades. Commercially this most British of bands were adrift in arguably their most creative period...\n\nAnd that's where this rather excellent 2014 'Legacy Edition' 2-Disc reissue of \"Muswell Hillbillies\" comes in - determined to get us all to see the error of our fatuous ways. Armed with nine Bonus Tracks and a new DVD of period recordings on Disc 2 (all restored) - here are the cups of tea and pints of beer in the Archway Tavern...\n\nUK released 19 December 2014 (10 November 2014 in the USA) - \"Muswell Hillbillies: Legacy Edition\" by THE KINKS on RCA\/Legacy 88843093772 (Barcode 888430937727) is a 2-Disc Reissue and Remaster [1CD + 1DVD] that plays out as follows:\n\nDisc 1 CD \"Muswell Hillbillies\" - The Original Album (72:30 minutes):\n1. 20th Century Man [Side 1]\n2.

Oklahoma U.S.A.\n11. Uncle Son\n12. Muswell Hillbilly\nTracks 1 to 12 are their 11th album \"Muswell Hillbillies\" - released 24 November 1971 in the UK on RCA Victor Records SF 8243 and in the USA on RCA Victor LSP 4644.

Sunny Afternoon\n7. The Virgin Soldier March\n8. She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina\n9. Alcohol\n10. Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\n11. You Really Got Me\n\nWhat the track list on the rear cover of this Legacy 2-Disc issue doesn't advise is that there's more footage on the DVD in-between tracks than is listed above. \"The Virgin Soldier March\" section includes the whole of the (rather rough) opening credits to the 1969 John Dexter movie \"The Virgin Soldiers\" starring Lynn Redgrave, Hywel Bennett, Nigel Davenport, Nigel Patrick and an uncredited David Bowie as a soldier (Wayne Sleep is credited). It features Ray's music playing throughout with the Mike Cotton Sound being the brass band accompanying him. There is also a short interview with Carl Foreman (clearly a fan of Ray Davies and his articulate writing) discussing how Ray's incendiary British lyrics were re-written\/softened by the American studios so as not to offend or illicit riots in Washington (marches that didn't materialise). There is also interviews with the clearly bemused\/amused owner of the grimy Archway Tavern Pub in North London and patrons supping pints being asked how they feel now that they've been immortalised on the gatefold album cover (cue more laughter). The Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble are also introduced by Davies to the live audience at The Rainbow and play with The Kinks on three tracks -  \"She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina\", \"Alcohol\" and \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\".\n\nThe three-way foldout digipak offers a new period photo on the left flap with tape boxes pictured beneath each CD and its see-through tray. The 28-page colour booklet is a pleasingly well-endowed affair - pictures of Ray alongside black and whites\/colours of the decidedly longhaired five-piece band. The booklet's front and back cover reproduce that photo where the 'Cats On Holiday' shop is all but obliterated by aluminium sheeting. The four-leaf foldout display of centre pages shows foreign picture sleeves for \"20th Century Man\" (Japan) and sheet music to \"Supersonic Rocket Ship\" as well as trade adverts and reviews - it even has a 26 June 1972 ticket stub for the Free Trade Hall in Manchester with Steve Goodman as the support act. IRA ROBBINS of New York provides the very entertaining and well-written liner notes - examining the album's themes of Her Majesty's Government interference in normal people's lives - inner city alienation - people in red coming to take him away - all of this working-class British angst wrapped up in American imagery of Shirley Jones, Errol Flynn and Doris Day.\n\nANDREW SANDOVAL - who handled all of the Universal 'Deluxe Editions' for The Kinks Pye years - is the Project co-ordinator once again. But the big news is a new Remaster - the first generation tapes transferred by RICHARD WHITTAKER at FX Mastering in London and the Remastering carried out by the vastly experienced VIC ANESINI at Battery Studios in New York. Anesini is a name I actively seek out - he's sprinkled his knob-twiddling fairy dust magic on the catalogues of Elvis Presley, Simon & Garfunkel, The Byrds, Nilsson, Santana, The Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mountain, Carole King and many more. This album was always a muddy mess to me - compounded by that 'Flexi' vinyl crap RCA engaged in at the beginning of the decade. There are hissy moments still on this remastered CD (the acoustic beginning of \"Holiday\" is just one of them) - but those slide guitars on \"Holloway Jail\" and the barroom piano on \"Have A Cuppa Tea\" now have more oomph for damn sure. That drum and guitar intro to \"Skin And Bone\" has fantastic punch all of a sudden - and there are other moments too. A good job done that's allowed the LP to breathe anew...\n\nAs Ray sings \"...I was born in a welfare state...ruled by bureaucracy...controlled by civil servants...and people dressed in grey...\" on the brilliant opener \"20th Century Man\" - you gather our Douglas is concerned once again for England's no-longer green and pleasant land and especially its increasingly homogenised and divided populace. Many critics commented on the depth of the song themes and lyrics (there's a lot of them) and their social commentary and insight  but it didn't seem to move the buying public in the same way. Just after the albums release - RCA put the song \"20th Century Man\" out as a US 45 in December 1971 (RCA Victor 74-0620) with the equally hard-hitting social consciousness of \"Skin And Bone\" on the B-side. But despite the lyrical\/musical strengths of both sides - there were few takers. RCA Britain didn't even bother to support the album with a 7\" single - their first UK 45 on RCA Victor being the new \"Supersonic Rocket Ship\" in May 1972  which in itself acted as an advance promotion for the \"Everybody's In Show Biz\" double in August.\n\nThe hippy dream is dead and nailed to the wall in the brilliant \"Alcohol\" where some floozy has fleeced a heartbroken sucker - and The Kinks begin to sound awfully like Lindisfarne's \"Fog On The Tyne\" on \"Complicated Life\" (the accordion and guitars are clearer). You also notice how well he's integrated the Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble into \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\" and \"Holloway Jail\". I never was a fan of the 'Hallelujah Rosie Lea' cod nostalgia of \"Have A Cuppa Tea\" - but I'm loving the slide acoustic guitars of \"Uncle Son\" where The Kinks sound like Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance three years before the event. Recorded 17 October 1971 at Morgan Studios in Willesden, London - the album finisher and title track \"Muswell Hillbillies\" could easily be one of those Rolling Stones Country-Rock jaunts they throw so effectively into the Blues-Rock mix of their albums (\"Let It Bleed\" and \"Sticky Fingers\" jump to mind).\n\nAnd as ridiculously good outtakes - you'd have to call \"Lavender Lane\" (a sort of acoustic \"Waterloo Sunset\"), \"Mountain Woman\" and the superb piano pain of \"Kentucky Moon\" - more evidence of the album's greatness (even the rejects were hitting the mark). The 50-second Radio Spot advert tells of \"Album of The Year\" from many American publications - but the public itself thought otherwise. It's also nice to see the Old Grey Whistle Test and Rainbow footage so clean - and dig those credits to \"The Virgin Soldiers\" movie from 1969 with Raymond Douglas Davies credited for the music (his full name used).\n\nI'd admit that the hiss levels on some tracks are disappointing - but as I re-listen to this excellent remaster - I'm digging it more and more and my admiration for the LP has gone through the roof. Fans apparently magic-markered their song requests onto paper plates at gigs - flinging them stage-ward as the Band played. Flick your schizophrenic paper plates this way and hope for a reply...","summary":"\"...Life Is Complicated...\" - Muswell Hillbillies: Legacy Edition by THE KINKS (2014 RCA\/Legacy 1CD+1DVD Reissue and Remaster)","unixReviewTime":1489622400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Officially billed as a definition to the bands crossover albums from the late-\n  1960s, Muswell Hillbillies successfully repeated the influences of Music Hall with the\n  traditional American stylings of country music and bluegrass well thrown in to careful\n  well-structured effect as it focuses the alienation of the working man and takes place\n  at Muswell Hill, a London suburb where Ray and Dave Davies were brought up while\n  it contain songs which focuses on working class life and again, on Davies childhood.\n  With the superlative music brilliantly composed by Ray and performed by the band to\n  utmost empathy, the track set starts off with the supercharged hit single 20th Century\n  Man as it concludes merrily with heart and sensibility on other songs, including Acute\n  Schizophrenia, Paranoia Blues, Holiday, Skin And Bone, Here Come The People In\n  Grey, Have A Cuppa Tea and Muswell Hillbilly (Alcoholic and Skin And Bone are the\n  most atypical classics in The Kinks catalogue).  As one of the bands finest and most\n  beloved masterworks, Muswell Hillbillies was greeted with critical acclaim but started\n  out as a fair accomplishment on the charts upon its official release, then its success\n  soon caught on.  And what made the album as appealing is the album cover that was\n  taken at The Archway Tavern as it shows the band below a signpost giving directions\n  to Muswell Hill which add to the albums truly unforgettable epitomized successone\n  that will remain a captivatingly outright and astonishing work of art. Plus you will hear\n  the albums radio commercial which just wraps up the remastered finishing touch.","summary":"An Unqualified Crossover Success Story!","unixReviewTime":1478217600,"vote":null,"image":null}

To brighten up these rosy realities for Double-M.G., label mate Stalley (Kyle Myricks) has just released his debut solo LP, Ohio, which is of course named after his home state. True to his roots, musical influences and the MMG code, Stalley has filled Ohio with enough hustlin', stuntin' and Midwestern hoo- ridin' so that fans can easily recognize his brand and affiliations. His fluid flow is sufficiently varied in style and vocabulary, and the different inflections of his tone of voice give his rapping an animated, non-mechanized feel. Stalley discusses his hard times coming up in life but also mellows out by indulging in the club scene, lady loves, fashion and cars, particularly the sporty, high-performance type. Speaking of cars, Stalley has created an intriguing interpolation\/remake of Eazy-E's \"Boyz-N-The- Hood\" single, called \"Jackin' Chevys,\" about getting it on in hot, stolen cars. Ohio is a relatively singular affair for Stalley except for guest appearances by Nipsey Hussle, Rick Ross, August Alsina, Ty Dolla Sign and Rashad, who produced much of the album's music. As a pleasant surprise, Stalley has also brought legends De La Soul out of retirement to spit a few bits of wisdom for listeners on \"Navajo Rugs.\" The productions contain some real instruments and original beat loops but several sound like recreations of trap\/drill standards, not necessarily a bad thing considering the album as a whole has a very unique, distinct sound beneath the lyrics. The most important fact to note about Ohio is that Stalley has not fully fallen prey to commercial, music market appetites. Instead, he has mixed up his content and style with new concepts and fresh rhymes and music, making for a solid enough solo debut.","summary":"Stalley's 'Ohio' provides a pretty good mixed-bag of hip hop delights","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It has always has seemed to me, that each compilation released, has been thoughtful in its sequencing,to eventually create a unique listening experience. And more importantly , that the artist was present.  The same could be said for Nothing Has Changed. The reversed chronology of the album, and the different versions , plus the bonus or unreleased material , makes this required  Bowie listening for the die hard and the novice. This is not a schlock-y, hastily put together, jukebox-y collection of single edits for mass appeal. It's a thoughtful walk with Bowie through his entire career, and the many moods, and aural experiments we we were privileged to hear.","summary":"Not A Jukebox Collection.","unixReviewTime":1507507200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Since his move, Landon has established Healing Piano of Sedona which offers a unique sound healing experience to create mental, physical and emotional well-being. Landon is a Steinway Artist who has toured internationally and has released seventeen albums, eleven of which are solo piano (one is a best of). He has been using the techniques of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky for spiritual development since 1980. Healing Piano of Sedona was created to help people live life joyously, passionately, stress- and disease-free.\n\nThe thirteen tracks on \"Healing Hearts\" were created spontaneously to assist individuals in their emotional and spiritual well-being. I have to admit that in the past, I have had a strong preference for Landons more composed music, but he is improvising and performing so much now that his spontaneous music is incredibly cohesive and complete and the emotional content is rich and sincere. Landon has performed house concerts in my series every year for the past seven years and while his music has always been exceptionally good, now its often breathtaking in its beauty and honesty. Nothing is held back, coming from the purest source of creativity. Im blown away by the music on \"Healing Hearts\" and am certain that it will be the second of Landons albums on my Favorites list for 2014.\n\nMost of the tracks overflow with peace and serenity. In fact, Louis calls his home studio The Peace Palace and I can see why! A couple of pieces are a bit livelier, but the entire album is perfect for a warm and soothing background. However, be sure to treat your mind and soul to a blissful hour of calming music that can effortlessly heal the spirit and wash away the cares of the moment, the day, or life in general - at least for a while.\n\nAll of the tracks are exceptional, but Ill mention a few favorites. Amys Song is a breath of fresh air - graceful, tender and very warm. Gorgeous! Desert Peace is somewhat more ambient and so peaceful. I love the title track, which is more minor and a bit darker, but so poignant and compelling. Now or Never seems to be offering support and encouragement to move forward - gently but firmly. Sacred is almost hymn-like. The Great Unknown is dedicated to a young family member who passed away recently. Dark and sometimes painfully sad, there is hope as the healing process takes place - an amazing piece of music! The Painter expresses the passionate spirit that can flow from one artist to another. Unstoppable begins quietly and simply, gradually building energy, strength and power. Unstoppable, indeed! A great, upbeat ending to a fantastic album!\n\n\"Healing Hearts\" is a must-hear!

Four highly regarded mixtapes of Southern flair and wisdom have done more than create a buzz for K.R.I.T., and his 2012 studio debut, Live From The Underground, secured his position as one of The Dirty's top rap prophets of the new era.\n\nThis Cadillactica LP is a full examination of god, life, love and pain from K.R.I.T.'s unique perspective in which he explores many topics. He places great weight on the love and cohesion of family when he laments about the anguish of broken, disconnected families in \"Soul Food.\" Additionally, his gentlemanly side comes out in \"Pay Attention\" and \"Third Eye\" where he raps about fine, refined ladies. K.R.I.T.'s planet of abstract thought, or what he calls his Cadillactica, is a serene, confident mind state that makes obvious the name of his favorite make of town car. Cadillac imagery pops up in \"Cadillactica\" and the allegorical \"Do You Love Me For Real\" about the love that a man has for his woman and his ride. Toward the end of the album, he gets critical of music industry trends and encourages having an open mind. At various points, K.R.I.T. takes the liberty of jumping around with subject matter but remains logical and makes everything come together as relatable under the same roof. He has a refreshing fighting spirit of hopefulness that appropriately remedies the sadness and adversity in his surroundings. At the same time he is exceptionally lyrical, poetic and metaphorical with his swaggering flow. Because of his brainy, philosophical rumination, one might think the man too soft, but the moments where he gets tough and vicious instantly invalidate that idea.\n\nBig K.R.I.T. has produced some of the album, but he has also invited several other producers to give Cadillactica a very original musical vibe. Perhaps not as sample heavy as some of his mixtapes, Cadillactica contains fresh synths, throwback loops, an 808-style bass line or two, and other funky instruments like the jazzy, muted trumpet in \"Mo Better Cool,\" which also contains hip, danceable, drum taps. All the sounds light up the album like stars in a night sky. Several talented singers and rappers contribute verses but never asphyxiate K.R.I.T.'s artistic expression.\n\nCadillactica is a colorful, comprehensive mosaic of musical influences. It's not hard to identify the different rappers who K.R.I.T. has drawn from for his style, but rest assured, his is a unique, one of a kind style that can hold up on its own. As the title to the seventh track suggests, K.R.I.T. is a rising king of the South who is giving other South stars like T.I. and Lil Wayne a run for the money. His talent and exuberance in Cadillactica make for an album that will have a special place in the hearts of fans \"4eva.\"","summary":"Big K.R.I.T. cruises across the heavens in 'Cadillactica'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

For this, it was a deviating shocker. Hearing about the tragic death of Malcolm Young, one of the musical virtuosos of AC\/DC, was just a devastating shock. Hard to believe he passed away after leaving the group 3 years ago, and privately battling with dementia that crippled him. Now with his death, he joins his musical brother Bon Scott, who died over 35 years ago, after he had long-fronted the group. But with Brian Johnson taking the helm, AC\/DC hit their commercial peak with Back In Black. Through that album, AC\/DC had a lot of great songs through that album. But nevertheless, the group had a lot of wonderful anthems, and You Shook Me All Night Long remains one of AC\/DC's finest. The song is a real feel-good boogie rhythm that still ignites today from the heart and soul of the music. Whenever I hear this year, I think of all the joy AC\/Dc brought to a mass appeal that no rock group had ever been able to do before. Now, with Malcolm Young passing on, his legacy is enshrined with some of guitar's greatest heroes like Jimi Hendrix and Chicago's Terry Kath and B.B. King. May Malcolm Young be forever remembered, shaking us all night long.\n\nMalcolm Young: 1953-2017\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Foever Shook All Night Long","unixReviewTime":1510963200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I mean, EVERYONE has heard of AC\/DC. AC\/DC's sound; so distinct, so clean and tight, so \"RAW ROCK\" that each new generation that comes along hears the unique, universal, driving sound, and the newbies pick it up and makes this band their own. I've listened to this band for more years than I'll ever admit to, and I have every album they ever made. Through the years, behind the music, there was a story that is still being written. I'm reviewing this one because it was one of the best featuring the original singer, Bon Scott. Bon had a cynical but humorous outlook that was loved by all. He took care of the band like raising his kid brothers. His tongue in cheek bravado, kept the band together. His unwavering confidence in his boys was absolute. Just listen to the lyrics. In the beginning they barely earned enough money to eat, or clothe themselves. Their sound was distinct and catching. During an interview, someone asked Angus Young what kind of \"effects\" did he use to get his sound. Angus replied that he didn't; he simply plugged in his Gibson SG Custom (that guitar costs about $7000 nowadays, and was\/is one of the only Gibson guitars that ever came out of the factory with a tremulow bar. The custom has pearl inlay, double humbucker coils, and Gibson guitars is one of the few guitars that are built out of SOLID mahogany, topped off with a lock nut, that will NOT, even after an hour of being tortured, GO OUT OF TUNE!) Angus took this, arguably, best guitar ever made,  and plugged it into a monster Marshal stack and turned it up as loud as it would go...and that's it. No effects or mixing. Just balls to the walls Rock. And one last thing: Angus' brother Malcolm. If the truth be known, Malcolm's PERFECT rhythm guitar playing MADE AC\/DC's sound. While Angus, the band's \"gimmick\" --dressed in his (for real) school uniform-- ran around out front, amazing the crowds, playing some of the best riffs of all time, with his small stature, the crowd thought it was a CHILD eating this guitar alive. While getting all of this attention...well, it was MALCOLM that carried their sound. He stayed off to the side in the shadows, his head bowed in concentration, he never looked up, no one paid any attention, but Malcolm had this incredible timing and that big fat rhythm sound, and he never EVER, so much as missed a single chord!

She had honestly grown her voice, but also showed some really great songs over a career that still ignites. She has definitely shown a sweetness in her voice that still ignites all of these years, after she went on her own. But nevertheless, many people do not know her well with cover songs. But No More \"I Love You's\" honestly remains one of my favorite cover songs of her career that is a sweet, haunting, somber but beautiful song that still ignites from the soul of her voice. She definitely made a cover work even better, and it is honestly one of my favorite tracks Annie had recorded back in the 90's, that really is worth listening too. If you have honestly loved her recent cover of I Put A Spell On You, than you absolutely will love this classic cover she did from her Medusa album. I sincerely recommend this classic song.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"More \"I Love You's\"","unixReviewTime":1438732800,"vote":null,"image":null}

But honestly, so many of those simply legendary divas have either retired, stopped making music, or just passed away. That has been the case with so many pop divas from Whitney Houston, or Tammy Wynette. And there have been some divas that have never gotten the credit they rightfully deserve. Phyllis Hyman was one of those divas. Hard to believe that it has been over twenty years since she tragically committed suicide and just left behind a mark that was never given the commercial success that acts like Patti LaBelle or Aretha Franklin have garnished. When I think of what Phyllis had as a singer, I think of so many of her brilliant songs, and Living All Alone is one of them. It is just a soaring ballad that speaks so well from the soul that is haunting and beautiful. Phyllis had sung so soulfully, that she really could have been able to move mountains, but no river was cast over stone for the populace. I would say many of today's divas that have no voice or soul whatsoever like Beyonce' Knowles, Rihanna or Ariana Grande could learn a thing from what Phyllis had recorded over the years. This is a great song, and a beautiful download for new and die hard fans of the great Phyllis Hyman.\n\nSong: A 1\/2-","summary":"Left All Alone","unixReviewTime":1466121600,"vote":null,"image":null}

That being said, the album's subject matter can be quite repetitive with most of the album being drugs and money, but its his pop-rap vocals and pop infused hip\/hop beats that will keep you entertained, and isn't that what an artist who been out for over a decade should aim to do. The album is filled with drug and money references and plenty of male ego (without the misogynistic of most rappers). I especially love the song \"Invisible Set Baguette\" a song bout his grillz, especially with lines like \"every time I smile my grandma catch the Holy Ghost\" and \"diamonds in my mouth dancing like Debbie Allen\".

A viable Southern hustling emcee of yesteryear, Paul Wall has made contributions to hip-hop through his records with the Swishahouse label and most recently with Paul Wall Music. Wall's seventh LP, The Po-Up Poet, is more material of Wall's archetypal style, filled with notions of weed, money, cars, ladies, jewelry and lots of \"drank.\" Never one to blow minds with advanced lyricism, Paul Wall has historically received regards for his raps of steady rhyming, and this same modus operandi is applied faithfully by Wall in Po-Up. He is still that same on-the-grind hustler with expensive tastes, focused on staying on his toes and having fun in between time. Worthy of notable mention are the tracks \"No Favors,\" a lesson in self-reliance, and \"Codeine Heartbreak,\" where Wall discusses his love\/hate relationship with extra strength, prescription cough syrup. The guest line-up is predictable, offering up verses of Dirty South flavor, especially from Screwed Up Click rapper Z-Ro, who appears twice on the album. The electronic trap beats match all of Wall's objectives and while formulaic, they are just original enough to be tolerable. At this point in Wall's career, The Po-Up Poet is a subpar effort, only attractive to die hard Paul Wall obsessives.","summary":"Paul Wall is stuck in the past in 'The Po-Up Poet'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It is the very first recordings from rhythm guitarist\/vocalist Susanna Hoffs, drummer\/vocalist Debbi Peterson, lead guitarist\/vocalist Vicki Peterson, and then-bassist Annette Z.  (Michael Steele would join the band in 1984 and eventually left in 2007.)\n\nThis is the first raw, unpolished, rock 'n' roll taste of what the sweet, choral harmonies of the Southern California all-girl band sounded like in 1981 before they hit it big 5 years later with the Prince-penned \"Manic Monday\" and mega-smash \"Walk Like An Egyptian.\"  2 of the songs, \"Getting Out Of Hand\", and \"Call On Me\", were previously released as B-sides to the band's 2003 single \"Something That You Said.\"  2 delicious, savory live tracks, along with several demos, are also included on this disc.  The Bangles have continued to perform live for ravenous audiences 35 years later and they show no signs of slowing down!  :)","summary":"The band's TRUE debut record.","unixReviewTime":1487116800,"vote":null,"image":null}

As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's \"Forget Him\" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again.","summary":"A teen idol's last big hit.","unixReviewTime":1466294400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Kates distinct vocals are front and center on every track and in no way are overshadowed by the modern production, which while quite layered, never comes across as too busy or overproduced, a rarity these days. The arrangements are unusual but catchy as hell and the lyrics are original and clever, which means youll never hear any of these on the radio, ha-ha. Full lyrics are included in the liner notes too, which is much appreciated.\n\nMy favorites include the dynamic opening ode to self-empowerment THROWING DOWN THE ROSES, the irresistible stomper MISTER SISTER that captures the pain of struggle of the transgender experience in only two verses and earworm chorus and BOTTOMS UP, which is the perfect song for cruising with the top down on a weekend afternoon, but each song here has its own unique charms (although I am not that crazy about the final depressing number PULLS YOU UNDER which prevents me from rating this 5 Stars).","summary":"Solo Kate As Good as a New B-52s Album","unixReviewTime":1458345600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Hes created films with classic scores from composers like Vangelis, Jerry Goldsmith, Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams, Marc Streitenfeld and more. But even Ridley is not immune to that infamous Spanish tax credit that studios are flocking to. Theres a reason why Roque Ba&ntilde;os is scoring Ron Howards In The Heart Of The Sea and not Hans Zimmer, theres a reason why Fernando Vel&aacute;zquez scored Brett Ratners Hercules, theres a reason why Lucas Vidal's name is on Fast & Furious 6 and theres a reason why Alberto Iglesias is scoring Exodus: Gods And Kings. These (very talented) composers aren't getting these big breaks because of their creative abilities and match to the films material, no they are getting hired because their country of birth is paying Hollywood some nice incentives to do so. While I love Alberto Iglesias and his work, he ended up on this film because of his nationality and that forces Ridley to work with a composer hes never worked with before. So when you see that two other composers including Harry Gregson-Williams had to chip into this score, maybe studios will realize that creative corner-cutting isn't the best way to pocket some tax breaks.\n\nNow, Exodus is in no way a bad score. This is a fantastically robust and lush score that relishes in its biblical epic genre of music. However, after powering through the mammoth amount of music, one cant help feel a bit of emotional disconnect. The music is beautiful to listen to and at times is gorgeous, but I found a hard time latching onto any emotional arcs. Everything here seems built to embellish and match the bombastic visuals. In that sense you could say the music is theatrical, but given that the film takes itself very seriously one could feel the music is doing too much at times. It took me a while to find the motifs in the score, and I still cant be sure if Im hearing a central theme. When you have that much music, and no clear thematic material then you feel lost and aimless. It has all of the expected structures and elements. You got the big lush orchestrations for weight, you have the Middle Eastern elements to establish your Egyptian setting, big chorus to add gravitas, and percussive action for the battles (thanks to Harry Gregson-Williams). While all the ingredients are there, the score never really establishes its own identity. I never felt emotionally moved or engrossed by the music despite how beautiful its approach was. It almost seemed like a stage performance I was watching, but admiring from afar and never getting pulled into the narrative. The fact that Harry Gregson-Williams was called in for action support and Federico Jusid was called in for support in the spiritual and emotional department, shows that there were lots of leaky holes that needed plugging up. Harry did the same thing for Ridley on Prometheus. However, here Harry would have been probably the most ideal choice here given his masterpiece of a score to Scotts Kingdom Of Heaven. In the end the score is completely adequate, it fulfills its duties completely. However, when you go into a Ridley Scott film, you're expecting a musical accompaniment that is just as special as the story its accompanying. With Exodus: Gods And Kings you will find a large-scale orchestral score with all the expected elements to it, and not much else.\n\nAlberto Iglesias is a brilliant composer, but his talents are better suited for certain films and a Ridley Scott epic is not one of those films. Everything does work, nothing about the score is terrible but nothing is great either. What we have here is a serviceable score that brings the expected ingredients to the table and serves us a dish weve all tasted before. Sure we love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but it would have been nice to try something fresh and new with a little more personality to it. The additional music from Harry Gregson-Williams and Federico Jusid do stand out as stylistically different, but are much needed for support. Exodus: Gods And Kings embraces the biblical epic genre, but in the end the score won't stick with you for long. As a person who believes in continued creative collaboration, I think it's very counter productive for studios to force directors to work with composers just for a tax break. Alberto Iglesias is an amazing composer, but if the main reason you're working on a film is because the studio gets some cash back in their pockets then it completely defeats the purpose of a natural creative collaboration. The final product speaks for itself, adequacy without memorability.","summary":"Beautiful On The Outside, But Not Much Substance Inside","unixReviewTime":1419984000,"vote":"5","image":null}

I've kind of worked backwards with his most recent trilogy, starting with Triplicate, and then moving on to Fallen Angels. Finally, I recently made it to the first album in the trilogy, Shadows in the Night. What at first seemed odd, out of place and wrong, now seems so perfectly right. I just didn't like Dylan in this guise because his voice it seems was always suited to raspy, bluesy, earthy rock numbers. His unique voice is perfect for that. But not for the Great American Songbook material he's been doing recently. I thought (perhaps mistakenly) that you needed a pure, beautiful, golden, old fashioned crooner voice to do this stuff justice. You know, Sinatra, Dino, Ella, Bing, Judy, and the Divine Sarah. Dylan's voice would seem out of place here, and he does sort of miss the notes in a way that sounds like someone who can barely sing. But I kind of knew that if I gave these recordings more time and listening space, I might be able to get them. And I was right, big time.\n  Dylan uses his ragged and torn voice to not just caress these tunes, but inhabit them. Get into their very fiber and core. Find out what makes them tick, and then recreate them all over. And you can have the most ripped up voice in the world and still make these songs magnificent. It takes two things: genius and care. Bob certainly has the genius, and after good, hard listening you see he really cares about this music deeply. It's not a sort of \"Oh this worked great for Rod Stewart so I'll try it too\" thing. Rod has the fantastic voice but just doesn't seem to care much in the music. Dylan knocks it out of the park. I am constantly amazed when an album by Bob that I didn't seem to get and thought was subpar or terrible, turns out to be, after time and care, really good if not really great. Chalk Shadows in the Night up on that very long list.\n  You don't see musicians like this come along every day, and Dylan's like won't be seen again for maybe a hundred years or more. If ever. So this is precious stuff. Pick it up and swim in it's melancholy. It's worth it.----------PEACE","summary":"This is precious stuff.","unixReviewTime":1529884800,"vote":null,"image":null}

There have been more songs about the artists' images, rather than the sincerity from the heart. But it is very rare that a song from television that has stood the test of time even after the fame. That has been the case when The Fray came out in the 2000 decade. They were alright in regards to their music with a few songs. But however, when their songs made it big for shows like Grey's Anatomy. That has shown with one of my favorite guilty pleasure songs from that decade, How To Save A Life. The song really is The Fray's biggest hit at the soul and song at heart. It is one of those songs that really is worth what the money is from the group. They have honestly had other songs that were worth that dollar as well like You Found Me a few years later. But if you really would like to hear one song from The Fray, well this would be the song that you should go to first. I recommend you download this track.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","summary":"Lifesaver","unixReviewTime":1478476800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The first time I heard it was last night though.  My husband and I were talking about my two pairs of pants I bought this week for church, and I told him I was totally going for the more pant like set first because darn it, I've read the scriptures (read them daily even) and there's nowhere in them that says \"Woman, thou shalt only wear skirts to church.\"  But it's become such an ingrained part of the social metaphorical yardstick of faithfulness people like to measure you against in our church that despite what people see me doing every week with our son, it's going to be seen as scandalous to the point of heresy by some when I show up this Sunday...and I don't think it should be that way.  I think we should just love people, because loving them works a lot better and feels a lot better then judging them. But that's just my opinion on the subject.\n\nAnd probably most people won't say anything to my face, but experience has taught me the rat-a-tat-tat of the firing squad will probably be making the rounds behind my back.  And as we were talking about this, my husband said, \"So you're like the color of boom.\"  And I said, \"Que?\" because I'd totally never heard this song, and then I quipped, \"no, I'm more like the color of ka-boom\"  As in fireworks, because I'm not just loud, I'm also glittery and sparkly all at the same time ;)  And he said, no babe, you totally have to listen to this song (because he'd had it on prime music on his phone) because this sounds like you...and I just laughed as I listened, because he's totally right.  And then I bought the song.\n\nI realize the lyrics can have some different interpretations, but I think it also speaks a lot towards people who feel like they might just be out of sync with the people around them because maybe they're the neon color in the box of primary and secondary colored crayons.  Or the one with glitter and sparkles. And maybe like me, they have trouble coloring in the lines, but their heart is in the best possible places, right?  So I love this song, totally love it, and it made my day better.  And I'm going to be struggling to be singing hymns in my head and not this song when I walk through the doors on Sunday.  But I'll try to be good, because I usually do, in the biblical sense anyways ;)","summary":"Super Awesome Song, But I think I'm More the Color of Ka-Boom...","unixReviewTime":1498780800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Gilliland","reviewText":"I've been reading a lot about this guy in the music press recently and decided to get this album and see what all the fuss was about. One of the best albums of the year? Frankly, I was wary. Too many times all the positive hype ends up in me being disappointed. Not so in this case; Ryley Walker is the real deal and this album is a delight!\n\nIf you've read the other reviews, you pretty know much know what to expect. There are a couple of songs that remind me a bit of vintage Nick Drake, but for the most part this sounds a lot like John Martyn during his \"Solid Air\" period. In fact, there is one song on here that sounds so much like \"Real World\" that I thought it was a cover version at first. But as another reviewer suggested, sounding like Martyn is far from a bad thing, and Ryley Walker is not some sort of unimaginative copycat. His guitar playing skills are very impressive, his vocals are pleasing, and he also has a flair for penning intelligent lyrics. What more can you say? This guy is indeed the total package and I'm excited to have discovered him.","summary":"Echoes of John Martyn","unixReviewTime":1454803200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Finefrock","reviewText":"If the names of John Martyn, Van Morrison, Richard Thompson and Tim Buckley quicken your pulse, this is one you should check out post-haste.  Chicagoan Ryley Walker is able to conjure up the sounds of these UK artists circa 1970 with astonishing accuracy.  Walker and his cohorts play with strong chops and are very good at blurring the lines between these influences.  That said, one gets the feeling of tribute here more than harnessing these sounds and talents towards creating something new and fresh.  That also said, it's as good a listen, or better than much of what I have encountered in 2015.  Mr. Walker is one to watch, I hope he sets his talents free next time out and encounters HIS True voice rather than those of his idols.  I believe he has the talent to do something special.","summary":"Ghosts","unixReviewTime":1452384000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Sadly, the songs do not ignite when it really comes to the heart. Yet, he has also made some poor choices in his words and his work. Him marry Kim Kardashian has really made some very bad bedfellows and his songs just haven't been as strong as other rappers. Only One, his collaboration with Paul McCartney doesn't actually hit the strong nail on the head. It actually feels more mixed than actually anything that really has came from the heart. I personally found the song to be less of his professional game than anything that really proved to be strong for everyone.

It reminds me that today .....each day....is Day One of the rest of our lives. For me that is both a sobering and inspiring thought due to the fact, as we all know,  that our days on earth are numbered, and once the day has gone by it is gone, there is no way to go back and relive it or change it. Also we are not promised tomorrow. So this song reminds me to try to live each day to the fullest, to glorify the Lord who holds our times in His hand, and to live each day in such a way that I do not have to repent of ungodly actions or words that hurt my friends, family, or any human being that I come in contact with, in case I'm not here tomorrow to reflect and say I'm sorry. But on a positive note, the song also reminds me that yesterday is gone and it is Day one of the rest of my life so I can determine to make a new start and turn the tide of my life with God's help, so I can be a blessing to those around me and sow to the Spirit so I can reap goodness and blessings in my life and bring glory to Him who saved me. Glory to my Lord Jesus Christ who shed His blood upon the cross and conquered death so we could have eternal life and be cleansed by His blood of all our sins. This gift He offers to all who call upon His name.","summary":"Glory to Our Lord Jesus the Messiah","unixReviewTime":1464825600,"vote":null,"image":null}

She sadly passed away 3 1\/2 years ago, but the heart and soul of her beautiful and enchanting voice had never lost its luster, while she did lose her own soul in singing, largely from every lampooning her and abusing her to death, as the \"Crack Is Whack\" joke, and not looking at whom she had been as a delightful human being. Now, with thinking of Whitney Houston's passing, and the recent passing of her one and only baby Bobbi Kristina Brown, I am constantly reminded of the deep sadness, and sincerity she left behind in each and every note she sung from her beloved heart. I Look To You remains a dominant example, hearing the song for the first time as we were all dealing with the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, and at the same day of his funeral, I really was so reminded of when a voice and song can deeply hit you, and this song really hit the nail on the head.

Female singers have became more like they are products than people. for singers, like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna have really missed the mark when it came down to voice. But out of all the female singers past and present, the great Whitney Houston has been one of those songstresses that not only sung brilliant and beautiful songs, but they all came out when we all dealing with heartbreak. I Didn't Know My Own Strength is one of my favorite tracks from I Look To You. When I first heard the song, I was sincerely brought to tears, as the last notes that Diane Warren wrote specifically for Ms. Houston, we were all dealing with the passing of Farrah Fawcett, Ed McMahon and Michael Jackson all on the same week in June of 2009. The song was not only beautiful first hearing it, but definitely one Whitney's finest during her lifetime. While people don't think of this song as much as I Will Always Love You, it is a song I  sincerely recommend listening to from the deepest soul of \"The Voice's\" Heart. Whitney Houston was a gem, and this song is worth listening to.\n\nSong: A\n\nWhitney Houston: 1963-2012","summary":"Her Deepest Strength","unixReviewTime":1439424000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Ironically, 50 hardly even appears on this The Beast Is G-Unit EP, aside from one: a wooing autotune bit opening the introductory \"Ballin,\" and two: the chorus of \"Boy Boy.\" G-Unit's six year hiatus proved their best marketing tool for The Beauty Of Independence, which overall performed well. The guys were gallantly back on their gangsta schtick with some renewed and newfound spirit. The same is True for The Beast Is G-Unit, except this one suffers the fate of coming after Beauty.\n\nIn relation to before, the repetition in content includes the gangsterism, pimping, worship of big boy toys, and various other infractions of the law that the five-piece crew commit on this round's excursion. The mostly-complete gang of Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck and Kidd Kidd (50 Cent barely contributes) are satisfactorily lyrical for the most part, relegating their gifts to street life matters and proving to fans that they can still band-up after all these years. Notwithstanding that fact, Lloyd Banks, out of all the members, gives the EP the brightest signs of lyrical virtuosity, throwing in different rhythms and tempos and basically just showing the most free-spirited character of any in the bunch.\n\nAside from needing to be there and appealing to a new class of hip hop listeners, the beats walk a thin line between relevancy and redundancy, harnessing the nervous, temporal energy of drill- ticks and a few sounds from G-Unit's past, i.e., organ, wavering electric guitar and ringing piano. Although The Beast Is G-Unit is lyrically on par with anything from the group's past, it still remains skimpy on intelligent, advanced art, making the biggest impact by being stunning, shocking and thrilling as opposed to the aesthetic of being fascinating and intriguing from an intellectual standpoint.","summary":"'The Beast Is G-Unit' puts the group's cohesion and lyrics to the test","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The concept definitely has its appeal: one person betrays another and the betrayer receives a presumably well-deserved dressing-down accessible to thousands or perhaps millions of people. Who wouldn't want that kind of outlet? Though the threat of such exposure likely won't eliminate or even reduce these situations from humanity's intimate relations, it may provide some consolation and opportunities for healing to the betrayed. Of course, the number of people with feasible recourse to mass accusation remains somewhat on an infinitesimal level. Most people turn to the obvious sources of family and friends when confronted with a demeaning and egregious loss of trust in a loved one. Perhaps social media now serves as an additional platform for venting loss on an even wider scale, at least for those seeking it, in our increasingly attention-hungry society. Others may choose to suffer and heal in private, camouflaged from the potential messiah complexes and morbid curiosities that inevitably lurk in any public sphere. Either way, those who both possess a large audience and also wish to share their damaged feelings, warts and all, with a wider population may indirectly assist those without such means in coping with their own deeply personal experiences of amorous disloyalty. The realization that even prominent public figures can face personal acts of shameful dishonesty within their own inner circles might help comfort those more lonely sufferers simply by the mere suggestion that others do experience such wrenching and humiliating pain. These same others also overcome their losses and regenerate their lives afterwards, often for the better. As such, celebrities who outwardly display their emotional upheavals through their work do risk charges of narcissism or puerile selfishness. \"Entertain us,\" some fans may exhort, \"don't whine at us!\" Yet these explicit and seemingly self-serving displays also potentially enrich and support those who seek more from entertainment than mere sensual pleasure.\n\nAlong those lines, some may have rolled their eyes upon hearing rumors of Bjork's so-called \"infidelity album.\" \"Here we go again,\" they may have sighed, \"another celebrity had another inevitable celebrity breakup and she now wants the rest of us to wallow with her in her emotional misery.\" Given some of the history of artists venting their personal frustrations and disappointments through their songwriting, this reaction seems somewhat understandable. Not only that, Bjork often comes under fire for \"pretentiousness\" because of her unabashed artistic and experimental approach to music and image. The esoteric title of the album, \"Vulnicura,\" meaning \"cure for wounds,\" probably didn't quiet the \"snooty police.\" Not only that, some former fans have decried her move away from more \"accessible\" material, often citing the earlier album \"Homogenic\" as a yet unsurpassed peak. Though undoubtedly a fantastic album, Bjork made it clear that she had no intention of simply repeating her crowd-pleasing, best-selling, most talked about efforts. She moved on. Subsequent albums have met with almost equal praise and criticism as the music became even more complex, cutting edge and at times approaching the avant-garde. The rhythms became more staccato and jarring on \"Biophilia\" as the album's ambience seemed to simultaneously encompass both entire chunks of the universe and the most microscopic existential realms. \"Vulnicura\" continues the electronic exploration while incorporating compositional elements of \"Homogenic,\" \"Biophilia\" and aspects of \"Volta,\" but nonetheless it creates something distinct. Many of its pieces and themes apparently emerged via the healing process that accompanied a painful breakup allegedly originating from her partner's infidelity. The album overall avoids myopic individualism in its themes and instead treats them abstractly enough to allow anyone to identify or interpret the lyrics to their own circumstances. \"Vulnicura\" is not memoir.\n\nFar from self-indulgent melodrama, \"Vulnicura\" contains some of Bjork's most stunningly beautiful and moving work. \"Stonemilker,\" an absolutely gorgeous opener saturated with strings, openly and nakedly begs for emotional expression and respect as the strings soar with painful longing. The title's intriguing meaning gets revealed in the line \"What is it that I have, that makes me feel your pain? Like milking a stone, to get you to say it.\" Many people will probably identify with the analogy of \"milking a stone\" when confronted with the emotional betrayal of a loved one. Not only does it appear quite futile, any real effort at drawing milk from a stone would probably result in considerable pain. If only stones could lactate. Oh well. \"Lionsong\" seems to muse on the reaction of the betrayer to the situation at hand while also dismissing any real concern: \"Maybe he will come out of this, maybe he won't, somehow I'm not too bothered either way.\" With equally juicy strings, a similar brooding mood to the previous song also pervades this second track. Such situations present a frustratingly complicated multidimensional matrix, which this song seems to examine. Will he come out? Maybe, maybe not, who cares? Well, I'm curious, but I really don't care. Also, the line \"it's a sign of maturity to be stuck in complexity\" seems to excoriate simple black and white emotional interpretations. These situations cause real anguish, confusion and perplexity that defy words. Music can sometimes get the feelings across, and \"Lionsong\" largely succeeds in communicating the inevitable miasma. The considerably more electronic \"History of Touches\" delves into a remembered intimate moment that in retrospect felt tinged with a lurking finality. But all such moments seem simultaneously omnipresent. A sensuous oneness floats above the staggering and indistinct background keyboards. \"Black Lake\" returns directly to \"Stonemilker's\" themes and mood. A sprawling ten-minute exploration of what went wrong, it occasionally explodes into storms of electronic percussion. It also includes some intriguing passages: \"You fear my limitless emotions, I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions.\" The accusations also come out in full force: \"I did it for love, I honored my feelings, you betrayed your own heart, corrupted that organ\" and \"family was always our sacred mutual mission, which you abandoned.\" Some fairly intense interludes punctuate the verses. A bittersweet string melody closes the piece. \"Family\" uses digital thumps and scrapes and an eerie ambience as a foundation for mourning the death of a family, potentially the already mentioned abandoned family in \"Black Lake.\" A sonically surprising bridge then suddenly interrupts the murky dirge with bouncy staccato strings. This song may represent the acceptance stage of grief. Basically, it's over, bring on the funky strings.\n\n\"Notget\" reaches a cathartic peak. Full of open throated lamentations such as \"love will keep us safe from death\" and \"I will not forget this notget, will you not regret having love let go.\" The song succeeds phenomenally in portraying ominous emotions. It ranks as one of the album's most unforgettable moments. \"Atom Dance\" exudes the cosmic and molecular mood of \"Biophilia\" with plucking strings and lines such as \"I am fine tuning my soul to the universal wavelength, no one is a lover alone, I propose an atom dance.\" Once again, the song quickly transforms with the voice of ANOHNI, who also dueted with Bjork on \"Volta.\" Healing appears: \"we aim at peeling off dead layers of loveless love\" and \"when you feel the flow as primal love, enter the pain and dance with me!\" Then finally some signs of release appear: \"atoms are laughing at last.\" \"Mouth Mantra\" hints at some kind of inexplicable verbal constipation. \"My throat was stuffed, my mouth sewn up, banned from making noise, I was not heard.\" \"Quicksand\" departs somewhat from the album's underlying mood with percussion and digital giant wasp buzzes. The lyrics discuss \"our mother's philosophy\" which \"feels like quicksand.\" Other interesting lines suggest energy sources to carry on: \"locate her black lake, the steam from this pit, will form a cloud, for her to live on.\" This may provide an alternate to the less elegant line \"when life gives you poop, put it on your garden.\"\n\n\"Vulnicura\" presents yet another dimension of Bjork's continuing artistry. Yes, it feels safe to apply that dangerous and now almost quaint word to her work. She sits directly in the tradition of \"music as art,\" arguably traceable to the Beatles, that tries to push boundaries, to not simply repeat past successes, to explore and unearth new ideas, sounds and emotions. This album contains no instantly radio-friendly or easily accessible pop hooks. And that's a good thing. The airwaves have far too much of that already. The curious human brain needs to stray away from safe cultural havens at least once in a while, and Bjork's ever evolving music continues to provide such an oasis. She hasn't stopped either. Apparently fully past the pain of the breakup that inspired \"Vulnicura,\" 2017 will apparently see another new Bjork album titled \"Utopia.\" The first single, \"The Gate,\" certainly points to another indescribable and endlessly fascinating collection of songs, not to mention more stunning surreal imagery. Slowing down certainly doesn't seem like an option for Bjork at this point. \"Vulnicura\" will probably end up as one more step on what hopefully remains a long journey.","summary":"An uncompromising, murky and endlessly fascinating exploration of infidelity and healing...","unixReviewTime":1506211200,"vote":null,"image":null}

In the Words Paint Pictures EP, Rapper Big Pooh (of Durham, North Carolina trio Little Brother fame) and Detroit producer Apollo Brown have come together with the spirit of Mello Music Group to once again describe what they feel are the most exigent problems in society now, namely police-on-black violence, federal government wrongdoing and the prison industrial complex as a second ghetto for blacks.\n\nAll of those moving parts, which blossom from Pooh's golden rapping voice box, play out to the backdrop of Brown's sample-based soul beats, which are nice as always but show little innovative growth and bring to life few new ideas or techniques, just nice new samples. Give him some time though. Brown's a good beat maker.\n\nWords Paint Pictures is regrettably a little one dimensional, and Big Pooh makes hay of a racially beleaguered America, even if his critique on the public sector with Ras Kass is excellent. After \"Promise Land,\" the EP settles into fresh rhymes and cold chillin'. There are nine songs total, but the last two are remixes leaving seven \"originals.\" Other guests besides Ras Kass include Steve Roxx, Eric \"Blakk Soul\" Keith, Marv Won, L'Orange and an awesomely lyrical triplet of Jalen Santoy, Novej and Lute in \"Kings.\"\n\nIt would have been nice to hear Big Pooh suggest curative measures of conduct to combat the flaws of our current social order and system, but his questioning mentality and healthy skepticism are appreciated nonetheless. Likewise, Apollo Brown simply rolls out his music loops rarely with a surprise moment in the fold, but even if it is within a familiar comfort zone that he produces, the beats still possess harmonious, throwback beauty.","summary":"Rapper Big Pooh and Apollo Brown repeat themselves in 'Words Paint Pictures'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The Dave Clark Five started as the Dave Clark Quintet, the history going back to 1957, which is important as far as Beatles comparisons.  While historians rightfully put The Beatles at the top of the heap from this amazing decade, we would be remiss (and wrong) to assume there weren't other outfits who were no clones at all, and doing equally fabulous work of their own.  The U.S. had The Beach Boys and The Four Seasons - Britain of course gave us the fabled British Invasion, with tons of clones of the Beatles, but a few that were genuinely the real deal.  Most folks will probably agree that The Yardbirds and The Dave Clark Five were the top of the line competitors to the Fab Four, although The Yardbirds, who boasted Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page as lead guitarists, were setting the stage for heavy music, especially after Jeff Beck split to form the Jeff Beck Group, and Page formed Led Zeppelin.\n  The DC5 were more pure rock and rollers, and they knew their stuff!  This album was available just in the last few weeks for about $25, so I'm surprised the price has jumped up again.  Dave Clark committed one of the biggest blunders in rock history when, after the band broke up in 1970, he saw fit not to release any material at all until after 2000, by which time LP's had worn out, there were probably very few cassettes, and they don't last either, and radio stations dropped them after their copies were too beat up to play.  This meant a generation would come and go before the public got to hear them again, and by that time only those who were teens in the '60's even knew who the DC5 even were.\n  A splendid PBS documentary did raise awareness, including mine, and although I had heard them before, I had not paid much attention.  I'm glad I did now, because they were great.  Tons of hits here include \"Glad All Over\", \"Any Way You Want It\", \"Sha Na Na Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\", which is much tougher than the more watered down version usually played on the radio, and other great songs that bristled with energy and great playing throughout.  It is interesting to speculate what may have happened had this amazing band continued and started forging new sounds.

Songs such as \"Do you Love Me\", better than the Contours version and the best version I've heard, \"Glad All Over\", \"Bits and Pieces\", \"Can't you See That She's Mine\", both songs titled \"Everybody Knows\", \"Catch Us If you Can\", \"I Like It Like That\", \"Because\" and the previously unreleased \"Universal Love\", which has the same corde progression as Marmalade's \"Reflections Of My Life\". Also loved the lowd haunting \"Ninteen Days\", a nice blues rock song about being lonely. \"Everybody Knows (We're Through\" was covered by Engelbert Humperdinck and both versions are great. Sadly I got rid of the imbossed outer box to this package. I happily have the 28 page booklet included, but I am not fond of the liner notes here because it makes Dave Clark sound very selfish. It only mentions stuff about him and no other band members. I was expecting that to happen as he is a really greedy selfish man who always resists the chance to keep his albums available on CD. When he passes away, there is a better chance of more CD reissues as the masters will be lisenced to his family and maybe we'll see them on CD in the future. I don't really want to say this, but hurry up, Dave and die! so your fantastic music becomes available forever on CD.","summary":"Stress Ball or Dave Clark Five CD from Amazon?

The man was an innovator and a foundation stone of American popular music. I remember watching the Glenn Campbell hour back in the 60s-70s and he always had the coolest acts, so it brought our family together in front of the TV on those nights.  9 times out of 10 my mostly traditional country music DAD would give a nod of approval to what we were listening to, simply because Glen had them on his show, that was a HUGE stamp of approval. Let me just ask you, what music program of the modern era (right now) brings families together like this? This was way before MTV so we didn't suffer from lack of video of our favorite up and coming artists in those days, thanks to Glen's vision. NO he is not a relation to me (that I am aware of) but every CAMPBELL in this family is proud and always loved Glen and not just for his name.

In closing if you love blasting your car radio with bass, good rap lyrics, and mind numbing rock guitars riffs on certain songs then buy this album and see for yourself that Hollywood Undead are still impress their fans.","summary":"Hollywood Undead proves to their fans that they can still mix songs and satify their fans taste for rap, rock, and party songs","unixReviewTime":1502150400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I kind of had a falling out with the band then, made a little bit of an effort to get into Circuital, but I had resigned myself to never hearing much of the soaring, celestial mystery you hear in classics past. Its cool for a band to evolve, sometimes you just evolve in a different direction than they do. No biggie.\n\nThe Waterfall is more of a continuation of my glancing interest in what they're up to, combined with a fatalistic pessimism that weve seen the very best they can do so far.  There are some tracks here, however, that are not only among their very best, but take the bus in a strange new direction that was unforeseen, intriguing, and rather dark in a good way. The first order of business is to get past the first two tracks, which are embarrassingly bad and borderline rival even the most cheeseball moments of Evil Urges.  Believe has absolutely nothing to say and nowhere to go, and Compound Fracture wallows in genericness, a real stinker.  But from there on out, prepare to get your wig blown back by a band on a mission, with the next two tracks being back to back classics, incorporating a wide-eyed, almost childlike wonderment, flirting with the listener, an exhausting journey that reaffirms they are capable of still producing some astounding music. Putting the hypnotic qualities of repetition to use on Like the Rivers middle section and The Waterfalls insistent vocal hook, you honestly don't want those two songs to end. Spring finally does something mysterious and uncharacteristic with Jim James obsession with dance rock, and Thin Line and Tropics throttle way up on a soulful groove that feels startling, uncomfortable, real.\n\nMy high expectations for a real fine closer were dashed, and the album lands where it started at jammy mediocrity. I suppose the one thing we can always expect from My Morning Jacket from now on is inconsistency... Ill take it.","summary":"Back to the egg... sort of","unixReviewTime":1524441600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The main theme recurrent throughout most of the tracks was very similar to the main theme that Masashi Hamauzu used for his Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.  Although somewhat beautiful, the Ori theme so heavily recalled Hamauzu's earlier work that I was unable to enjoy it.  The tracks seemed like remixes of FF13's \"The Promise\" and \"Serah's Theme,\" and it was impossible to dissociate one from the other.\n\nIf Gareth did this by accident, having never been aware of Hamauzu's work, what a dreadful happenstance!  I hope such a mistake never happens to him again--no doubt many composers worry that they might inadvertently seem to be plagiarizing, when they really were not doing so.","summary":"Just bad luck, or Hamauzu influence?","unixReviewTime":1481414400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The son of an African American mother and a Sudanese father, a young Oddisee (real name Amir Mohamed) would split his residency between Sudan and the U.S., witnessing the juxtaposition of the two civilizations firsthand as a small boy. Later in life, with the world at his fingertips, he couldn't ignore his hip hop calling with which producing, or making beats, became his forte. With the help of the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff, the Low Budget Crew, Diamond District and many others, Oddisee gained national recognition and is now thriving to the nth degree with Mello Music.\n\nMaking beautiful music with Mello Music Group since 2008, Oddisee is still very much hungry as his ambition shines through in The Good Fight for 2015. A real hip hop wiseman, Oddisee is overflowing with his feelings on unconditional love, relationship ills and the losses in life. Streams and streams of poignant, pensive rhymes from this natural master of flow testify to an unflinching tortured soul who doesn't hold himself back in the least bit. Oddisee ebbs and flows through his music like the push and pull of everyday life. \"Want Something Done\" explains the blues and joys of being an underground artist, and \"Contradiction's Maze\" documents the tug of war between right and wrong. Like his lyrical heft, Oddisee's beats keenly display the rich delectability his musical style is known for. Elegant, organic music and samples make for soulful, mellow boom bap orchestrated by Oddisee's gentle, talented hand. The Good Fight is another impressive Oddisee album, progressive and very consistent for this intellectual man. It definitely helps Oddisee's evolution as an artist, though not by leaps and bounds.","summary":"Oddisee approaches life's struggles troubled but persistent in 'The Good Fight'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Produced and recorded by Cookie Marenco, founder of Blue Coast Records, Signature is being released in several formats. (My review copy is a standard CD, but the sound quality is still amazing!) A classically-trained pianist from Australia, Fiona Joy has created an impressive collection of recordings beginning with her 2004 release, Portrait of a Waterfall as Fiona Joy Hawkins. Some of her more recent albums were recorded at Imaginary Road Studio and co-produced with Will Ackerman, who refers to Fiona Joy as one of the brightest lights in contemporary instrumental music. Signature was recorded on an 1885 Steinway piano, and every nuance comes through in breathtaking clarity. The album features a solo version of Grace, which was included in the 2014 Grammy winning \"Winds of Samsara\" by Ricky Kej and Wouter Kellerman, and a duet version of Once Upon Impossible that features Lawrence Blatt on acoustic guitar as well as Fionas ethereal vocals. Nine of the ten tracks are purely solo piano at its colorful, expressive best.\n\n\"Signature - Solo\" begins with Ceremony, a lively, upbeat piece that sets the tone of the album and tips listeners off that this is no ordinary solo piano album. Grace is likely to become one of Fiona Joys signature pieces, as it occasionally refers to some of her earlier pieces that haven't been as widely heard as her more recent work. Its a wonderful piece as either a piano solo or an ensemble piece, but I really love the solo version. The melancholy Fair Not has a flowing left hand that gives it a subtle energy. Dark and very expressive, this is somewhat different from much of Fionas other music. There are two versions of Once Upon Impossible - a piano solo that is poignant and heartfelt, and the second that includes Fionas vocals and light guitar accompaniment by Lawrence Blatt, a fine artist\/composer in his own right. Both are exceptional. Calling Earth is a somewhat shortened version of Earthbound from \"600 Years in a Moment.\" Invisible Train is my favorite track. High energy and very spirited, I hope sheet music is planned for this one! The elegant title track is slow, pensive and very heartfelt - gorgeous! As its title suggests, From the Mist is cool and has no hard edges - very fluid and free, colored in muted shades of gray and blue. Little Star concludes this very special album with a sweet and tender piece that tells its story simply and without a lot of embellishment.\n\nI truly hope this is just the first in a series of solo piano albums from Fiona Joy. Her elegant touch and soulful playing have always made her one of my favorites. I have been fortunate to have Fiona Joy perform two house concerts in my home, so I have been able to watch her play several times - always a treat that needs to be shared! Very highly recommended!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1428969600,"vote":"2","image":null}

This album was Fiona's first on the Blue Coast Records label run by award winning producer\/ recording engineer Cookie Marenco who worked extensively on this project at her San Francisco Bay area studio. While Fiona often performs as a solo pianist, her previous releases have featured many well-known studio musicians in the course of her recording sessions with Windham Hill Records founder and GRAMMY winning producer Will Ackerman. However, as the title indicates, the new Fiona Joy release is primarily a solo piano recording.\n\nThe album features Fiona's original composition \"Grace\" which also appears as a large ensemble version on the \"Winds Of Samsara\" CD by Ricky Kej and Wouter Kellerman, which recently won the GRAMMY in the new age category. A track entitled \"Once Upon Impossible,\" which Fiona describes as: \"love that has tried its hardest but cannot work,\" appears in two versions on the album, one as a solo piano, and one as a duet with guitarist Lawrence Blatt, who is the sole accompanist on the album. The duet version also features Fiona's airy Enya-like vocals. One of my favorite songs was \"From The Mist,\" which draws from Fiona's Irish and Scottish roots. It is especially significant to her since it was co-written by her father.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the emotional range and diversity that emanates from her heart and soul into her fingers as they dance on the keyboard.  Fiona's composing and piano artistry and are like a rainbow reflecting the colors of the spectrum. Each tonal shade draws the listener in to what she is feeling and expressing. But no matter what the mood, anything that Fiona plays is marked by an elegance and aesthetic that is evocative and inspiring. In her own words: \"You will hear my feelings in these songs; they are dedicated to saving that small place in everyone's heart, the place where fairytales linger, and where we find the strength to meet our reality...with grace.\"","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1427414400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I know I should always be a soul on fire, but oft times I need a kick in the pants (or the ears) to burn. This song not only re-sparks the anticipation of waiting for my Groom but serves as a reminder of the continual deliverance He brings (Ps. 77:11-12). I can get impatient in this world at times and this song reminds me of both. The anticipation and the deliverance. Praise be to God. So Lord I will readily wait for you but also be joyful in Your glorious presence. I so appreciate - and pray for - the artists who help me in my journey.

On the other hand, I have somewhat mixed feelings about Mourao as a pianist. She isn't as widely known to pianophiles as such VoxBox stalwarts as Abbey Simon, Walter Klein, Peter Frankl, and Guiomar Novaes, let alone the young Alfred Brendel--and there may be a reason for that. I don't much like her in the \"Lyric Pieces\". What strikes me first is a lack of subtlety and finesse in the handling of dynamics. She seems to me to have just two levels of volume: loud and soft. There's not much in her playing by way of a  pianissimo or fortissimo and very little gradation between piano and forte--it's either one or the other. The same it True when it comes to rubato and to a cantabile (or singing) style--which is essentially in these very \"Lyric\" pieces. Nor is there much differentiation in the characterization of each of these pieces, although each is meant to project a distinctive mood: Spring Dance, Cradle Song, Butterfly, Summer Evening, etc.\nI have performed extensive comparisons between Mourao's performances and famous Grieg solo piano discs by Emil Gilels and Arthur Rubinstein. Admittedly, these masters offer tough competition, but these great pianists are not just better--no surprise there!--they are functioning on an entirely different plane from Mourao's (IMHO) rather clunky pianism.\nNow for a change in view--a change that is based on further listening and caused me to revise my rating upward to 4 stars. I'm much more attracted to Mourao's playing in the Norweigan Folk Songs and Dances, and in \"From Holberg's Time.\" I'm not sure why this is. I think she's actually playing better in these works (more dynamic range, more variety in the pacing, more characterization of individual pieces). However, it may be that, because I don't already have these pieces in my collection, I'm not comparing her to the lofty standards of Gilels and Rubinstein. Anyway, this VoxBox is worth buying for the Folk Songs & Dances, etc, alone.\nIf you're shopping for a low priced and well played Grieg selection, you might also want to consider the Grieg: Rise of the Masters set, which is currently selling for $2.19 and which offers a substantial selection of Grieg's music in all genres.","summary":"OK, but I have mixed feelings about Mourao as a pianist","unixReviewTime":1432512000,"vote":"2","image":null}

Vox recordings from that era were typically a bit tinny, probably because they thought nothing of putting 30 minutes of music on one side of an LP.  Most of these recordings are better than that, but some are lacking.  The performances are a bit more schmaltzy and slower in tempo than the more recent recordings of Rachmaninoff I've heard.  The Symphonic Dances are my favorite among these recordings.  Pretty good, but there are other recordings of S R's work that I prefer.

Their self titled Czarface debut became an instant underground smash in 2013 and revealed that the Rebel INS plus 7L & Eso mix very well with each other.\n\nTheir second official release, Every Hero Needs A Villain, is almost a mirror-image of their first, save for a new set of guests (Method Man, Large Professor, Juju of The Beatnuts, GZA, MF Doom, Meyhem Lauren, R.A. the Rugged Man) and all- original rhyme verses in each track of course. In any case, EHNAV is a strong album sustained by epic, raw lyrics and more of 7L and Spada4's industrial and grunge rock-inspired alternative beats. Ambitious on both its vocal and instrumental fronts, the album's main concerns are to appall (with coarse, sometimes violent imagery), impress (with dizzying, nonstop rhyme schemes) and exhilarate (with artsy, indie, experimental production), and by all intensive purposes, they've more or less reached their goal.\n\nDespite having few social implications or a variety of concepts (it truly has only one), EHNAV flourishes by being a rich greenhouse of thriving hip hop excitement, a wild comicbook-like rap album. The most important meaning behind this project however is its continuation of healthy collaboration between two rap acts from substantially different backgrounds, Inspectah Deck from the rough and tumble Staten Island, New York and producer\/emcee team 7L & Esoteric from the more congenial backdrops of Boston, Massachusetts. Both have overlooked some of their cultural disparities to commune on their shared love for hip-hop.","summary":"Underground favorite Czarface unleash second album, 'Every Hero Needs A Villain'","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Ill start our by saying that the sound quality is as exquisite as you could expect being produced by GRAMMY wining producer and Windham Hill Records founder Will Ackerman and engineer Tom Eaton along with pianist\/ composer Kori Linae Carothers. The highly modified Steinway piano at Wills Imaginary Road Studios is legendary and has provided the instrumental voice of numerous outstanding pianists over the years. The opening track, A Day Like No Other, touched me emotionally right from the start with its dreamy and slightly wistful melody. I appreciated the sense of dynamics in Koris playing  knowing when to lean into it and when to lay back, as well as finding the balance between notes and space. This blend of technique and feeling, for me, is one of the hallmarks of a great musician.\n\nI was curious as to what the title track would sound like given its enigmatic name. It turns out to be quite descriptive as the notes in the opening movement fall from her fingers like the first drops of rain in a summer shower. As the composition evolves, the flames are fanned about two thirds of the way through. However, again, the sense of dynamics I spoke of earlier is evident, and just as a fire needs oxygen to exist, there is breath within the blaze as she pulls back momentarily to provide some air and a release from the buildup. The maturity and level of expression in Koris playing are impressive.\n\nThe ability to communicate stories and emotions in her music is a gift that she is eager to share with the world. Kori Carothers is truly an inspiration, both as a recording artist\/ performer as well as in the example she has set in her life becoming a professional musician in spite of being deaf in one ear. She encourages others not let anything deter one from following their dreams and pursuing their passion in life. Fire In The Rainstorm is an eloquent artistic statement from a highly regarded pianist\/composer whose music resonates with heart and soul.","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1436918400,"vote":"3","image":null}

It is her fourth album to date and contains twelve original pieces. With one of the more dramatic album covers of the year, the music is both eloquent and beautiful, fueled by grace and passionate emotion. I thoroughly enjoyed Koris first recording with Ackerman, \"Trillium,\" but it is amazing the depth and honesty that is often revealed when an artist goes it alone with just the piano. Such is the case here. It is interesting to note from her bio, that Kori is deaf in one ear and was told as a child that she would never be a musician. She continued her music studies through high school and college, proving the naysayers to be completely wrong. In a way, she has come full circle and is now donating a percentage of the sales from \"Fire in the Rainstorm\" to Hearing Health Foundation.\n\nThe album opens with A Day Like No Other, a dreamy and slightly melancholy piece that also expresses determination and hope - a lovely way to begin. Flowing and lyrical, it grabbed my attention right away! Nunus Sunrise was composed as a loving tribute with warmth and strong emotions. Its really interesting how the piece starts to slow near the end and then just fades out, unresolved - kind of like life does sometimes. Meadow is a favorite with its relaxed, carefree mood and easy grace. Tidal Rift is a beautiful, heartfelt piece inspired by the ups and downs in relationships - another favorite. The title track is a passionate piece written for a friend whose life has been full of turbulence. The piece begins calmly, gradually building in intensity and drama - very powerful! The Day is a tribute to those who lost their lives on 9\/11. Originally recorded as an electronic piece on Koris first album, \"The Road Less Traveled,\" its a poignant and tender piano solo - another favorite. The Kindly Beast is especially touching, knowing that Marvin, Koris beloved dog, died recently. He followed her everywhere and liked to get in the way of her hands when she was playing the piano (Ive had the same problem with my cats!). Marvins playful antics will live forever in this song. Whispers of the Heart is a stirring tribute to friends and family who stand by through lifes trials and joys. Buoyant yet deeply emotional, its a beauty! When the Trees Fell mourns the loss of a giant tree with five trunks that was taken down by a huge storm. Grief and loss flow throughout this gorgeous piece, ending the album with a sigh and a tear.\n\nKori Linae Carothers has really come into her own with \"Fire in the Rainstorm.\" I hope it brings her the fans and recognition she so deserves! Very highly recommended!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1436140800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Besides being almost painfully traditional for the duo, Lessons includes all new verse-material and original beats, which are conventional and come from an assortment of credible producers (Ayatollah, Hazardis Soundz, Beatz N Da Hood, etc). Their Queens homie and long time collaborator, Tragedy Khadafi (formerly Intelligent Hoodlum), plays a major and perhaps excessive guest-part and is joined by fellow features Royal Flush, The LOX, Anna Shay and Raekwon. Overall, these are loaded spots but uninteresting in their predictability. Capone and Noreaga do convey some different feelings in addition to hardcore street angst (the madness of ghetto crime in many instances of course, homie-love in \"U.M.A.R\" and lady-love in \"Chinese Girl\" for example) but they're in virtually the same format as all their previous releases. With low relevance, so-so rapping and outdated gangsterism and style, Lessons is a dwindling project from the emcees, whose peak is most likely behind them at this point.","summary":"Capone-N-Noreaga's 'Lessons' come from an old recycled playbook","unixReviewTime":1488240000,"vote":null,"image":null}

She had a gripe with her label, and said goodbye to Sony. Overall, she took a step further within her voice, and tried to make a new step in her musical legacy. She went to Warner Brothers, and with the release The Light Of The Sun, she did come back with her song Shame with Eve, and it really did give her a new breath of fresh air in her songs and her musical dynasty. But trying to follow-up what made her brilliant, hasn't been a big leap for her with her Woman album. I found that some of the song didn't ignite the way that songs like Golden and A Long Walk did from her career. Fool's Gold, the lead from Woman wasn't actually a huge song for Jill. But still, it is better than the lackluster songs that she released the passed few years. It is alright, and at least it is better than the joke songs that Beyonce' and Rihanna have came out with. Still, it is alright, and a noble download for any new Jill Scott fans, but not quite for die hard fans of her gold.\n\nSong: C","summary":"Almost Golden","unixReviewTime":1458604800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I suppose I held off writing a review because I vacillate on how I feel.  I still don't feel it's in the same league as \"Synthetica\" (reviewed separately) & \"Fantasies\", which you know you love on first listen!  Other reviewers have noted PAGANS is more eletro\/synth. than others, so perhaps that has something to do with it.  When I do go electronic, I still enjoy hearing guitar(s) too, especially a strong bass line and strong drums.\n\nPAGAN'S opening track, \"Lie, Lie, Lie\" is a terrific one! which would be quite at home on either of the aforementioned METRIC CD\/LP's.  Track #3 \"The Shade\" has that ethereal, haunting beauty and is quite good, as well as Track #7 \"Too Bad, So Sad\" which almost reaches a \"Youth Without Youth\" tone, while Track #5 \"Cascades\", another favorite, veers into an almost Depeche Mode\/New Order sound.  Track #4 \"Celebrate\" isn't as likable, for me, having an EDM (electronic dance music) quality.  While I enjoy some EDM, I just feel METRIC defies genres, mixing & blending expertly to form their unique sound.\n\nI agree that PAGANS IN VEGAS is definitely more of an electronic release.  Aside from some odd zappy eletro-synth. sounds on some tracks,  PAGANS IN VEGAS, while different from earlier releases, is a strong grower!!!  P.S. Upon some research, I've learned METRIC'S newest release is scheduled for late September!!!  Upon hearing first single \"Dark Saturday\" (fantastic!), if that's representative of the whole I'll be captivated with what may possibly be METRIC'S Finest!!  In the meantime, there's plenty of dazzling METRIC music to keep listeners ears happy!!","summary":"PAGANS IN VEGAS VG+..MORE ELECTRONIC..STILL SENSATIONAL!!","unixReviewTime":1534636800,"vote":null,"image":null}

In fact, amazingly not even the slightest tick, pop, or crackle. Absolutely dead quiet on the lead ins and just a super high quality pressing. The book with the song by song descriptions by Tom Petty himself is just icing on the cake. Stellar release! One note, there apparently was an error using the original hype stickers listing 180g vinyl. These in fact weigh in (by other reports I've read) in the 150-160g range and are not 180g vinyl.

But, \"better late than never!\"  They're very talented & innovative, changing-it-up song by song (not only from one release to another) keeping your interest piqued!  I did go in reverse, getting \"In Your Own Sweet Time\" first (reviewed separately) & do like that one better, but I do like EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED!\n\nTrack #1 \"Me and the Devil\" and Track #3 \"Baby Don't You Lie to Me!\" have a similar sound & they're both highlights.  Track #6 \"Dogtown\" is a little weird.  It begins sounding a bit like a faster Beatles' \"Come Together\", but then goes into what reminds me of 'circus music' & both repeat through song.  That 'circus' music I find more than a little odd & for me the song would have been one of my favorites on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED without it - But, again, name of the game for The Fratellis seems to be experimentation & with that, some will work exremely well & some not at all.  And, they have many more in the \"works extremely well\" category!!  Track #2 \"Imposters\" (Little by Little) doesn't work for me, although it does showcase their variety, once more.  Guitar's much too \"twangy\" a.k.a. country-western for me.  Track #8 is a really pleasant, beautiful ballad & jumped into a favorite immediately, which is a complete surprise for me, since I don't usually care much for ballads & by 2018, that's a particularly nice revelation! On Track #9 \"Getting Surreal\" The Fratelli's pump it up a notch!\n\nI didn't go with the deluxe version, because even on my most favorite recordings, I don't appreciate acoustic so much.  I imagine EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED is a must-have for Fratellis fans & I think it's an excellent jumping-in point for newcomers, as there's something enjoyable for everyone.  I would liken The Fratellis, especially on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED to a 21st Century Dire Straits, as they were uber-successful completely disregarding (1980's) trends & doing their own exceptionally talented thing.  The Fratellis don't sound like Dire Straits...the similarity lies in bucking trendy music, having a vast, devoted following & being hugely popular & successful!","summary":"EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED IDEAL TO SHOWCASE THE FRATELLIS CREATIVITY!!","unixReviewTime":1527811200,"vote":null,"image":null}

When I had heard so many songs, I can tell whether or not the sampled song works much better. That very rarely works, especially in R&B when artists like Maze or the great Whitney Houston whom did it very well, because they showed colors can be blossom in R&B. But in pop, that doesn't work so easily. When I first heard Halsey, it really didn't seem like it was anything special. Then, I went back to her music, after I heard one of her songs, which was sampled by Coldplay and Beyonce' for Hymn For The Weekend. Halsey's New Americana was the song they sampled, and listening to it, it was very dark but took a very tough stance on how the younger Americans have not been recognized for the past several years, and with people like Donald Trump whom made them look like there voices never existed. It isn't a bad song, but yet there are other ones that sounded much better taking a stance with he next generations in society around.\n\nSong: C 1\/2+","summary":"The Next Generation","unixReviewTime":1480118400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I recently decided to give Audiomachine \"Life\" a chance. I enjoyed several of the pieces. But I knew that was a lighter album and wanted to hear something that represented Audiomachine's more characteristic style and sound. I randomly chose Magnus this morning and have been listening to to most of the day. All I can say is I am amazed how good the music. I feel silly for waiting so long to try them out. Some of the pieces that really stand out to me as captivating and amazing at this point include Frozen Synapse, When it all Falls Down, Being Alive, Red October...these are the ones I appreciate so much just after one day. If you like epic music such as Two Steps from Hell, don't be a noob like me, buy this album.\n\nEdit: after listening for about a week I can say there are no duds on this album, every piece is exceptionally good and captivating.

Posthumous. I was skeptical that I would have any interest in Audiomachine's foray into epic, orchestral scores.\n\nBut then someone added a few tracks from Audiomachine's album to a youtube playlist and I found myself looping the same songs over again. War of Faith, Sura, Being Alive, just to name a few. I wanted to know more of who the artist was that composed these songs and lo and behold it was from Audiomachine's Magnus album which is absolutely stupendous.\n\nTake for instance War of Faith. The song starts with a slow, almost imperceptible build where you're wondering if you set the audio levels correctly on your device. Then you hear the pianos, the strings, a flourish of cymbals, and all of sudden you're hit with powerful vocals. I was left closing my eyes, bobbing my head, listening to this track over and over until I had to force myself to move onto another song.\n\nSo when I saw that there were 23 tracks left in the playlist, I couldn't help but grin. Magnus is an excellent compilation of orchestral scores and should be a MUST HAVE to any fans of epic, instrumental music.","summary":"Magnus is MAGNIFICENT!","unixReviewTime":1456531200,"vote":"2","image":null}

Astonishing!, the new collaboration album between Mello Music Group producer L'Orange and Ultramagnetic's Kool Keith, is that it comes on the heels of their \"Sometimes I Feel\" joint from Mello Music's wondrous Persona LP so either they built off the creative spark of the song or an album was already in the works and they just wanted to give a sneak preview. No matter how it came about, it's still a dope album. L'Orange has once again put together a breathtaking spread of old time noir beats over which his compadre Keith raps science and swagger with the help of some of their favorite emcee friends.\n\nAs a slick, fourth dimensional rambler, the Kool Keith we witness here is as sharp with his bizarre, fanciful techniques as he was at the height of his Dr. Octagon phase, randomly ad-libbing strange ecological findings in our present time period and in the future. In fact forget \"strange\" because some of the scenes Keith describes are straight up outlandish, some might say crazy even. He may not be the belly laugh inducing character he has been at times, but he sure is every bit the cool, meticulous field researcher of his doctor side, with a new specialty: time-traveling. Nowhere is this more evident than in \"Twenty Fifty Three (2053),\" \"I Need Out of This World\" and \"Upwards. To Space!\", three short glimpses into what is most likely the fate of humankind, or at least where these artists believe it to be headed.\n\nLet's not leave out L'Orange, a growing prodigy in his prime, who for all his skill at assembling his esoteric samples, vintage commercial clips and old movie-music loops still knows how to keep a beat with infectious hip hop drums akin to intelligent dance music. His beats are rapper- ready and at the same time, great all by themselves. Mad props must also go out to all the guests, for if not for them, Time? Astonishing! might just have been a short, sweet, two-man EP and nothing more. From top to bottom, they are J-Live, Mr. Lif, Open Mike Eagle, Blu, Montage One, DJ Trackstar, MC Paul Barman and MindsOne. Time? Astonishing! is alternative hip hop at its finest, and by beginning to explore the future of our species with intergalactic migration and cross-dimensional travel as possibilities, it certainly is venturing into unchartered territory, inside and outside of the music.","summary":"L'Orange, Kool Keith and friends explore far reaches in 'Time?

Featuring the Dekany Quartet and the Fine Arts Quartet, this splendid MP3 album contains nearly 24 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns string quartets, all brilliantly performed by the two ensembles mentioned above.\n\nThis MP3 VoxMegaBox Edition contains all of the string quartets in Haydns oeuvre, including some that are credited to him that he may not have composed. The works are placed in opus number order, from earliest to latest, so listeners can hear the progression of Haydns musical thinking and development over his many decades of composing in this genre.\n\nThe Dekany Quartet plays just over half of the 70-plus works that appear on this album, and the Fine Arts Quartet plays the remainder. The musicianship of these two ensembles is exquisite throughout. They consistently engage their instruments in those finely balanced musical conversations that make well-played string quartets such a joyful listening experience for me. Their interpretations are flawless, showing every bit of the emotion and intellect that Haydn wrote into each one of his chamber music masterworks. There are some subtle differences between the two ensembles in tone, texture, and color, but overall, I find it difficult to tell them apart.\n\nThe audio quality on Haydn: Complete String Quartets is crisp, clean, and precise. My ears can easily detect each of the four lines playing in every string quartet. On rare occasions, the first violin sounds a trifle over-bright, but this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.\n\nWhen Haydn: Complete String Quartets first came out at Amazon.com in 2015, it apparently sold for $2.99  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at over three times that price ($9.49), I think it remains one of the best classical music values to be found anywhere. Its low price, combined with its exquisite performances and exceptional audio quality, makes it a must-have in every digital classical music library. Most highly recommended.","summary":"\"Haydn: Complete String Quartets\" features exquisite performances and exceptional audio quality at a bargain price.","unixReviewTime":1503187200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It came out between my sophomore and junior year in high school and caused me to break a bad habit so I could go after a girl I met in my sophomore English class. Unfortunately (or fortunately) in my junior English class I realized that her beautiful blonde hair was courtesy of Madam Clairol when she went too long between visits to Madam Clairol. But this song has stuck with me forever and I have applied it several women since including the young woman who became my wife who was such a non-Clairol Blonde when we first met that I did not believe she was not a Clairol Blonde for several months. We were never closer than 150 miles during our dating\/courtship until we got married. Summers were were much further apart. So this song has a LOT of meaning for me.","summary":"Life changing song in the past, an anchor today","unixReviewTime":1425427200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Dunner","reviewText":"Over four albums, Grace Potter & the Nocturnals have passed from their folk-rock beginnings to Potter wielding her open-E-tuned Gibson Flying V through stadium-stompers rockers like Paris (Ooh La La) and The Lion the Beast the Beat.  Midnight continues this trend with Hot to the Touch, Alive Tonight, and the rebel-yell Instigators.  However, rumors are that Potter fired The Nocturnals halfway through the album, relying much more heavily on collaborative writing with producer Eric Valentine  who also played nearly all the instruments on Midnight.  This insular approach resulted in quite a number of tracks that don't sound as fully developed as they might have been with input from a fully experienced band.  The drum-machined Delirious sounds like a Gloria Estefan knockoff.  The melody of The Miner bears more than a passing resemblance to Paul McCartneys My Love.  And Your Girl is Prince without the prance.  Lyrically, nothing on Midnight carries the soulful fire of Potters biggest ballad Stars, from her previous album The Lion the Beast the Beat.  If Nobodys Born with a Broken Heart is supposed to be poetically profound, Potters romance with Valentine has clearly weakened her critical judgment as a writer.  And while Potter remains in fine voice, the diminished influence of The Nocturnals leaves Midnight a mixed bag of tricks.","summary":"A mixed bag of tricks . . .","unixReviewTime":1518998400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The answer is a resounding yes. This series takes place in a make-believe town of Vinci in Los Angeles (very close to the image of the town of Vernon) and is an anthology series in which police investigations unearth the personal and professional secrets of those involved, both within and outside the law. The players include Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, Vince Vaughn, Taylor Kitsch, Kelly Riley, David Morse, Lolita Davidovich, Abigail Spencer and a host of others.\n\nThe tie in to this show is the often focused background guitar playing of Lera Lynn whose contributions could not be more impressive. Especially this song My Least Favorite Life. It rings as True as the stunningly intelligent dialogue. A fine script, suberb cast and direction, and the gift of Lera Lynn. Super!

It jumps around in price and it sat in my wish list until it dropped reasonably enough for me.  The album cover looks different from what they are currently showing on Amazon but I actually like the CD cover better which has the silver Terminator skull (with red eye) against a black background.  Call me crazy in this digital age but I still prefer to purchase my music on CD.\n\nThis is my third score by Lorne Balfe.  I've previously enjoyed his work on \"Blackwood\" and \"Sons of Liberty\".  Balfe is part Hans Zimmer's score production company known as Remote Control Productions.  It is home to quite a few composers who are mentored by Zimmer and he often collaborates with many on various projects.  After hearing the past few Terminator scores and not really finding them that interesting, I had high hopes that this one by Balfe would finally bring the scores back from the past and into this future.  I am happy to say that this one certainly does just that.  Lorne Balfe successfully pays tribute to Fiedel while also developing his own themes and style to the score.  Fiedel's epic themes can be heard in a few cues like \"Better Days\" (track 2), \"It's Really Me\" (track 12), and most prominently in \"Terminated\" (track 22).  Balfe's interpretation of the theme in the last track is really outstanding and it's something that fans have been waiting for.\n\nBalfe has created his own original score but you can hear hints of the classic Terminator sound throughout the music.  The composer achieves this through his use of similar keyboard effects, percussion, strings, and heavy brass instrumentation that he spins & weaves into a sound that becomes distinctively familiar to fans of the iconic music from the early films.  To Balfe's credit, he does not merely give us only a repeat of that which has already been done, but he also develops new themes and electronic \"riffs\" of his own that are quite enjoyable.  I really liked the thematic music in track 11, \"John Conner\" and I also enjoyed the new and unusual electronic sounds found in \"Family\" (track 17).  There are few cues that give Balfe a chance to slow things down a bit like \"Sarah & Kyle\" (track 5) and \"Alcove\" (track 13) but this is largely an action heavy score.  Like Fiedel's previous scores, however, I found this one to be full of interesting effects, sounds, rhythms, and ambience that makes for an entertaining listen.  I like scores that allow you to mentally picture a scene and I would say that this one does just that.  Listening to pieces like \"Sacrifice\" (19) does this quite well.  The big swooping crescendos as one character saves another and the almost angelic sounding strings praising the heroic deed can certainly give you the mental images found within the music.\n\nI had to wait a long time to finally get a copy of this but it certainly was worth the wait.  The CD contains 22 tracks and runs around 1 hour and 12 minutes.  There is a 12 page CD insert that contains track listings, production credits, orchestra credits, and a special thanks section from Balfe, Zimmer, and Paramount Pictures.  There are plenty of photos from the movie as well.  Some are two page spreads, full pages, and several smaller photos.  This a great score from Balfe and I appreciate the nod to Fiedel's music, as well as, the excellent original music too.  I recommend!","summary":"Finally...a CD version of this score!","unixReviewTime":1447632000,"vote":null,"image":null}

I can listen to this album over and over from start to finish.  Like I said, I'm new to Stryper, so older fans of the band might not see it the same way, but Yahweh is one of the most original sounding, amazing songs that I've ever heard.  The church-like \"Yahweh\" at the beginning followed by an incredible riff and then it just gets better from there.  I can't get that song out of my head.  My kids are getting tired of me singing it around the house (probably due to my \"singing\" more than anything).  But after that song, there are so many other great songs on here, such as Sorry, Lost, Big Screen Lies, King of Kings...you name it, they're all good.  Stryper isn't as heavy as many of the groups I listen to (Megadeth, Slayer, Kreator, C.O.C...to name but a few), but they more than make up for it in song craft and melody, not to mention an uplifting message (and some nice riffs to boot).

Dunner","reviewText":"Produced by The E Street Bands Steven Van Zandt, this CD is nothing but a good time!  The irony in the album title is that that Love is a well-known shadow singer, having sung backups and harmonies for an array of artists including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Sonny & Cher, Dionne Warwick, The Beach Boys, and even U2.  Her Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home) is a signature holiday staple, which she reprises each year in a NYC holiday show.  She appeared in 20 Feet from Stardom, the 2013 documentary on the lives of backup singers to the stars.  Love turns 76 this year [2017], and, if this album is any indication, shes about as far from a rocker and a shawl as one can get.  Among the Believers (a Van Zandt original) bangs open the doors, and 13 tracks later, Jesus Is the Rock (That Keeps Me Rollin) (another Van Zandt rant) takes the party home with an all-out gospel shout.  In between, new songs by Linda Perry, Elvis Costello, Jimmy Webb, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil, and Bruce Springsteen give Love fresh material to make all her own.  The roots of rock and R&B lace through every song on the disc, giving new power to Loves girl-group origins.  But the hands-down highlight is Loves rip through River Deep, Mountain High, which should come with a warning  it will inspire impromptu air-mic moves that could be downright embarrassing, depending on where you hear this.","summary":"May inspire impromptu air-mic moves . . .","unixReviewTime":1494979200,"vote":null,"image":null}

He has tried to bounce again with Morning Sun, which worked back to his classic sound nicely. His latest song which teams up with cheap rapper Nicki Minaj, whom she does not bring enough into the song, and instead makes it lose its shine for Robin. It is alright, but not a song that has longevity in star power, the way that Magic and Sex Therapy did.

As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.\n\nWith a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.\n\nA generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.\nHis D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.\n\nA minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.\n\nBy another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.\n\nUsing tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.\n\nThe original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.\n\nPlease note that the 2008 edition includes a video bonus track of the bold Allegro giusto from Vranickys concerto in C Major.","summary":"Evolution of the Classical Era Violin Concerto","unixReviewTime":1479772800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Ive been reading some uniformly glowing reviews of the Big Box albums from The Bach Guild, so I decided to purchase one to see if its as good as reviewers say it is.\n\nMy first choice was the Big Haydn Symphonies Box, featuring over nine hours of Franz Joseph Haydns symphonies, for only 99 cents. This MP3 album contains a quite impressive array of music from the composer known as the father of the modern symphony. Haydn composed 104 symphonies during his long lifetime, and 24 of them appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Symphonies Box. They range from his earlier light-hearted works, through his more impassioned Sturm und Drang middle symphonies, and on to his most famous later Paris and London symphonic masterpieces.\n\nThese are all very fine performances from the 1950s through the 1970s. They feature various world-class orchestras and conductors who seem to mostly hail from eastern Europe. These ensembles may not have been as renowned as many of their more famous western counterparts, but their artistry and musicianship are undeniably every bit as good. They consistently do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama of Haydns great symphonic masterworks.\n\nThere are two unfortunate technical flaws in Big Haydn Symphonies Box that prevent me from awarding this otherwise outstanding album my full 5-star rating. There is a short but noticeable high-pitched tone at the 1:19 mark of track 13. Although its not particularly bothersome, the albums engineers should have noticed and removed it. Also, the final movement of Symphony No. 90 is incorrect. Although the tracks metadata correctly lists it as Finale: Allegro Assai, the music is actually a duplicate of the first movement of Symphony No. 91. Again, the albums engineers should have discovered and eliminated this error.\n\nDespite these minor flaws, Big Haydn Symphonies Box is an excellent MP3 album that I enjoy listening to on a regular basis. Highly recommended.","summary":"\"Big Haydn Symphonies Box\" contains an impressive array of Franz Joseph Haydn's symphonic works.","unixReviewTime":1502150400,"vote":null,"image":null}

It lacked a visceral quality; it was very symphonic but it lacked punch and exciting flourish.  Part II is more of the same, but it is better (I think).  While still very symphonic it also puts more emphasis into its punch, its bite.  The guitar work is more present (or at least more obvious to my ears) and a lot more driving than in Part I.  But I discovered a curious thing while listening through the album several times.  When I listened to the album as a whole I thought it was okay to good but still not really great.  Maybe there still wasn't enough distinctiveness between the songs for me to hang my standout moments or tracks on, or maybe the songs blurred together too much.  Whatever it was I still came away from the experiences not feeling fulfilled or whatever I was looking to feel by this release.  But when I listened to the release song by song, focusing on each song individually instead of part of the whole, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this album a whole lot more.  Godmakers Temptation is a classic VP sound, an engaging track, and part of the first half of this release.  The following song Stone Roses Edge breaks into a gallop early on with some delicious guitars and nice keys surrounding them and filling them out, a heavy beat upping the intensity.  The first half of this release is pretty solid in fact.  Where I found myself losing interest or felt that the songs lost either energy or had an unfortunate blending was toward the end of the release.  And I think thats why this was so hard for me to really get into, because the first track (vision eleven as part of the Chronicles story) didn't immediately grab but the following three or four tacks did and then there were about three where the car slowed down before ending pretty well.  Symphonic metal fans, metal fans who like large religiously-tinged fantasy stories, and I suppose VD fans all will be satiated by Netherworld Part II.  For me, I will hope that they strip their sound down at points, and separate their flourishes on their next outing.  3.75 stars.","summary":"Dantes Inferno meets a heavy metal symphony.

I do!  Or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music.  Because Amazon allows you to sample nearly every song\/album that they offer. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads.  Free songs...even free albums.  And more important than free. LEGAL.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music.  But, quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nIf you think you might like this song...listen to a sample first.  No review will help you make a better decision than doing that.  I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was one of the Amazon freebies, previously mentioned.  However, the freebie selection on Amazon is constantly changing, so by the time you read this review, it may have a price attached.  If you are only in the market for freebies, I can make that super easy!\n\nCurrent selection of FREE AMAZON SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nCurrent selection of FREE AMAZON ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","summary":"Great song!

However, there are some that do miss the mark in its entirety. Rachel Patten has been one of those artists that has really came out of nowhere with her breakout song Fight Song this past year, that has really worked for her. But trying to follow it up, is more than met the eye overall. Rachel's song, Stand By You, the second single from her debut album Wildfire, isn't actually one of her better songs. I really didn't find the song to have the longevity that could've been shown beyond the words of the soul. I personally wasn't moved with this track at the spirit. Fight Song really was a song that grew on you. Hopefully, there will be more from Rachel down the road, and something that will make her more than a one-hit wonder in spirit.\n\nSong: C","summary":"Almost Stood By","unixReviewTime":1475366400,"vote":null,"image":null}

So far, I've listen to them on repeat for extended periods of time, one at a time, to get my feels.\n\nI believe Fatal Illusion was the first video (audio track) tease\/release.  I like it around the :58 mark when it gets past its fills (Ellefson's bass is sweet). So from there until the end, it is just killer and guttural.  It got me excited to see what Megadeth (this version) would put out.\n\nThe Threat is Real reminds me of old school Megadeth. It doesn't have the classic step-down like Peace Sells or So Far, So Good(1986.1988), but sounds like it could fit with Youthanasia (1994).\n\nTitle track, Dystopia, has an updated feel for Megadeth. This doesn't always prove to be a good thing, but I think they nailed this one.\n\nMegadeth is one of my all-time favorite bands.  I was 'with' them since Killing is My Business...but I'm not the biggest fan after Risk.  I did come back for Thirteen, though. So, so far, Dystopia is lining up to be a solid album.\n\nI eagerly await the full release.","summary":"Favorite of the Three Released (thus far)","unixReviewTime":1453075200,"vote":null,"image":null}

All the others appeared in a previous Bach Guild Box: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00C0QHX02?keywords=bigger%20bach%20set&qid=1446778470&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1. If you don't already have that release, I would definitely recommend buying it before this one. It's a great set, with very fine performances of the St. Matthew Passion, the Goldberg Variations, and other major works.\nIf you do have that set, then it comes down to whether it's worth 99 cents to get Cantatas 12 & 29. It was for me. It turns out, however, that these performances have been mis-labelled. They are not conducted by Michael Gielen but--as one reviewer theorized-- by Mogens Wldike, leading a fine group of soloists (Netania Davrath, Hilde Rssel-Majdan, Anton Dermota, and Walter Berry) and the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. These are very good performances, and especially because I happen to be a big fan of Wldike, I think he and his forces should get the credit they deserve.\n\nHere's a link to the bach-canatas page, showing that Wldike made the recording in May 1960. There are cover issues of different releases of the recording over the years: http:\/\/bach-cantatas.com\/Performers\/Woldike.htm","summary":"Two new cantatas--but conducted by Woldike, not Gielen!","unixReviewTime":1446681600,"vote":"2","image":null}

That album is also fantastic.\nThis record much like TLIL is using a singer that sounds nothing like RJD which is the absolute right way to go. I'm a fan of RJD and if they would have emulated him it would have been odd.\nCraig Goldy is an amazing guitarist along with a solid rhythm section. The drummer being Vinny Appice( he also plays on TLIL record) is simply one of the greatest drummers in hard rock\/ heavy metal.\nThe vocals are done well by Chas West.\nI really wish the radio would play this stuff like in the good ole days when rock radio was cool.\nWe are all treated to very cool HR and HM these days, you just have to look for it. Don't depend on radio.\nThis album is as good as anything great back in the day.\nI usually don't point one one particular song in my reviews. But the track Path Of Love ( 7) is just outstanding. I listened to it on the way home from work and kept rewinding( showing my age, old cassette tape term for any young ones that may be reading this) and I don't do that very often. The keyboards, guitar, the hook and everything else about it is perfect. In the chorus there's a drop down sound when the vocalist sings \" and to sing my desperate song\".

Varley","reviewText":"Not perfect but there's a lot here worth your time and certainly your 99 cents.\n\nThe high points:\n  Howard Shelley's Beethoven ##3 & 5 and he's the pianist in the Triple Concerto.  He takes fairly swift tempi but doesn't rush and his Beethoven has plenty of spirit.\n  Bruce Hungerford's Beethoven #4 - OK, it's mono and an unnamed orchestra but this is the only recording of Bruce Hungerford performing a Beethoven concerto and it's quite good.\n  Mozart Piano Concertos - 6 are here in quite good to excellent performances.  I had the Denis Matthews #20 on LP and am only sorry it's discmate (#24) wasn't included in this collection.  There is one big question mark - see below.\n  Rachmaninoff #3 - a very fine performance by Vladimir Viardo (NOT Viarto), Eduardo Mata and the Dallas Symphony\n  Tchaikovsky #1 - a memorable performance by John Ogdon, Pierre Monteux and the London Symphony, recorded live in Vienna in 1963.\n\nGood performances:\n  Chopin #1 with Rosa Lhevinne\n  Brahms #2 with Peter Serkin - not great but his suits him better than #1\n\nProblem performances\n  Brahms #1 with Peter Serkin.  Sorry but I've always heard this as \"angry young man\" music, not disgruntled senior citizen, which is what comes across here.  My model for a Brahms #1 is the 1958 recording by Gary Grafffman, Charles Munch and the BSO - which not only has fire but also sounds a lot better than this effortful recording from about 25 years later.\n  Grieg & Schumann with Russell Sherman - These are sabotaged by poor sound.  The piano is all treble and the orchestra often sounds muddy.  Plus Joseph Silverstein's conducting cannot match Ormandy, Giulini, Reiner or many others in the Schumann.  The last movement of the Schumann doesn't dance it lurches.  There also seems to be a digital hiccup at the start of the 3rd movement.\n\nSaint-Saens and Liszt with Emil Gilels and Kiril Kondrashin - definitely sound their age.  Disappointing considering how well the Oistrakh Dvorak and Glazunov Violin Concertos of roughly the same vintage sound in the \"Big Violin Concertos Box\".\n\nThe obligatory Bach Guild Box errata list\n  As noted by others, the labels on the last movement of Mozart #21 and the Beethoven Triple were swapped.\n  As also noted by others, the \"Mozart #26, \"Coronation\"\" is not that at all but the Mozart #27\n  Please BG, try to spell the performers' names correctly- the soloist in the Rachmaninoff is Vladimir Viardo\n\nMYSTERY - Who is performing the mislabeled Mozart #27?  I haven't been able to find a listing for a Peter Serkin recording of this work, even though BG gives him credit.  I've also looked for recordings of it by Bruce Hungerford, Howard Shelley and Russell Sherman but nothing turned up.  The Larghetto clocks in at > 10 minutes, which is about the most leisurely traversal I've heard.  Any guesses as to who we're hearing?","summary":"Some excellent performances, a few duds and a mystery","unixReviewTime":1463184000,"vote":"5","image":null}

This, however, is a really strong effort from the Cult.  I won't say it is an equal to their earlier albums (Love, Electric, or even Sonic Temple) but it is a really good album.  Better than their last two efforts.  These guys (Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy) invented \"alternative\" music.  Heavier than their New Wave counterparts, but more soulful, lyrical and smarter than heavy metal, the Cult have always been a bit of an acquired taste, primarily for those who are a bit more hip than the common trends in music.  I think that with Hidden City they solidify their status as Alternative Gods.\n\nBirds of Paradise, GOAT, Deeply Ordered Chaos and Dark Energy are unquestionable Cult classics, sitting just one notch below Love Removal Machine, She Sells Sanctuary, Rain and Sun King.","summary":"Pleasantly Surprised","unixReviewTime":1493942400,"vote":"3","image":null}

I'm now about halfway through it, and the highlight so far is a fabulous performance of Gluck's \"Orfeo e Euridice.\" Maureen Forrester, the greatest contralto of her generation, is downright awesome as Orfeo. I don't think she ever sang any better than this. Teresa Stich-Randall is fine, as ever, as Euridice, and the young Charles Mackerras wields a supportive and sensitive baton as he conducts Bach Guild's standby Vienna State Opera Orchestra. This performance alone is more than worth your 99 cents. Check out the reviews of the earlier CD release here, where it's selling from 3rd parties for $39.99:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Gluck-Orfeo-Euridice\/dp\/B0000023D4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gluck: Orfeo & Euridice<\/a>. Now admittedly, Gluck's Orfeo is not a baroque choral work, but I'm not complaining!\nAnother favorite is the Pergolesi Stabat Mater--I started with this because I like the soprano, Stich-Randall, and mezzo Elizabeth Hngen. The recording also features Anton Heiller on organ and Mario Rossi conducting the VSOO. It's gorgeous!\nI've also enjoyed the Vivaldi Dixit Dominus (Vivaldi could really write for voices as well as he could write for fiddles) and John Blow's impassioned \"Ode on the Death of Henry Purcell\". Blow had been Purcell's teacher and sponsor and so this work is especially personal. Also lovely is Charpentier's Magnificat--a graceful and melodius setting.\nI haven't hit a bad performance yet, and I'm looking forward to exploring further.\nUnless I've missed something, there are no duplicates with previous Bach Guild releases, which is a bit of a feat in itself, given how much music Bach Guild has given us in the past few years.","summary":"Yet another great set from Bach Guild!","unixReviewTime":1446249600,"vote":"13","image":null}

We moved further in time to the Baroque period - but we discovered that if we did a Big Baroque Choral Music Box, it would, generously put, be about 75 hours long (no exaggeration). But it is named as a follow up to the Renaissance Choral Box, so we can move into Volumes 3 and beyond (and we will). So we cut out for the time being Bach, Handel and Purcell, all composers who we have covered with their own individual boxes. And we still left out quite a bit.\n\nWhy did we leave hours and hours of recordings off of this box? Well, for this box, we wanted to focus on Bach Guild recordings that had been buried in the vault for a while. The two juicy nuggets in this box are a long-forgotten recording of Israel in Egypt - one of the first Bach Guild releases (BG 521 to save you the trip to your LP collection). Sung in German, this is a rare bit, and The Bach Guilds first recording of a Handel oratorio. The second juicy bit is a complete recording of Glucks Orfeo and Euridice, made in Vienna (one of the last Vanguard recordings made in Vienna) in the mid 1960s, with a superb cast and conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras (BG 686, stereo version BGS 70686). This was released on CD in the early 1990s but has been out of print for (we estimate) nearly 20 years.\n\nAlso getting their Bach Guild digital debuts are the wonderful recording of the Kraus Funeral Cantata for Gustav, the Charpentier Te Deum with Jean-Francois Paillard (with Maurice Andre playing trumpet in the famous opening movement) and several other Baroque choral and vocal works featuring Alfred Deller, Maureen Forrester and other well-beloved members of the Bach Guild roster.\n\nKudos to the executive producer of The Bach Guild for tireless work resurrecting the Vivaldi Dixit Dominus RV 594. We often have just bare threads of information on the older recordings, and hunting down the old LP (and this is the 11th LP The Bach Guild released) can be very difficult, although we do have an extensive library, we don't have everything. The information was sketchy and misleading, and we tried to include this recording in the Big Vivaldi Box but we really couldn't piece the work together. This time, we were able to locate a score and place the tracks in the proper order (the information we had actually indicates that this was a different Vivaldi Dixit (there are two). So this recording, probably out of print for 50 years is now featured, in all its glory. We cant confirm this, but this release probably represented the first complete recording of the RV 594. We put the release date as 1952 (original LP number: BG 678, in stereo as BG 70678 - we only had the mono master at our disposal).\n\nAnd snark aside, we meant glory as in loud and glorious. This collection does not feature any historically informed instrument-based performances. You will hear full-throated choirs, and the Vivaldi never gets performed like this in our era, so its a surprise and surprisingly beautiful to hear an operatic choir throw themselves into this work now essentially in the possession of much smaller early music groups (not that theres anything wrong with that, either way).\n\nAgain, theres a lot more we could have put inbut we tend to cap these at 10-12 hours (yikes). This one is 8 hours and 54 minutes. Thanks to all who contacted us for all the suggestions for repertoire in the past year.","summary":"from The Bach Guild","unixReviewTime":1446163200,"vote":"8","image":null}

He honestly has been one of the greatest singer\/songwriters in regards to R&B music. Yet, he has been absent from making decent music for quite awhile. He came back from a long absence from making music for himself in regards to good music. He came back with Toni Braxton a few years ago, and they both released Love, Marriage & Divorce, which wasn't a bad record for the two of them. But for himself, he has needed to write better for his solo work. We've Got Love, which is the lead single from his latest album, Return Of The Tender Lover, isn't a bad song for die hard Babyface buffs, but overall not a must download for new fans of his music. The song does show his style nobly but not really anything to thrive into that \"wow, I must own this song\" factor. Still, he has had great songs before, like When Can I See You Again. But overall, there can be better from Babyface down the road.\n\nSong: C+","summary":"Almost Love","unixReviewTime":1449532800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I've enjoyed other albums by Teddy Thompson in the past, but this could be the best thing he's done yet. These two singers are a perfect musical fit.\n\nBut darn it, why couldn't they have given us an extra song or two? This is much too short. I still shudder at the thought of spending so much money for only 25 minutes of music. That makes this more an EP than a proper album. I shouldn't complain too loudly; the songs here are truly first-rate, but it's not exactly value for the money. Is there a reason that it's not being sold at a much cheaper price?","summary":"Great tunes and harmonies ... but much too short!","unixReviewTime":1508630400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I used to sit in our comfy brown swivel chair next to the stereo with the headphones on and read the lyrics and look at the gatefold photo. I'd sit there and wonder how the one kid got to be on the other side of the fence. And the kid in the middle looked sad and kind of out of place, but he seemed pretty cool, too. I always liked how Ringo was at kid height, all hunkered down. The lyrics to the songs were printed on the sleeves, so you could follow along. I really liked Paperback Writer because it told a story and I liked books, and it wasn't about girls and all that hold your hand stuff. The way the vocals cascade all over themselves from the top, and the way they echo around after writererererer....so trippy .The guitar riff is great, but i don't think I appreciated it at the time. I could also imagine the Monkees doing this one, my favorite lunch time entertainers. Anyhow, it's a fun Paul song.

I had a musical epiphany because I was really locked in to Paul's bass. It was almost like I was hearing it for the first time, especially on the fade out chorus. I'd always appreciated his playing, but this time it really hit me how great it truly is.\nI love when John's vocals take on that faraway hue on 'cellophane flowers...', it's like OK, Dorothy opened the door from her black and white world and entered the colorful land of Oz. Well, in this song, we start out already in Oz and on the cellophane part we open a door into an even more amazing land - John's imagination! This is psychedelic pop at its best.

There isn't too many things I can remember when I was 7 years old but I still remember watching The Ed Sullivan Show way back one Sunday night in February of 1964 when the Beatles appeared causing a sensation bringing Beatlemania from England across the Atlantic to the U.S. Their music was like nothing ever heard before and would influence songwriters and musicians to this day.\n\nTheir songbook seems to be endless from all the great hits they had during their time together. To try to list all their greatest songs would take too much time and space for this review. For me though even more time consuming would be trying to pick which is my favorite song by the Fab Four. Just too many outstanding tunes to choose from. Most times you could say my favorite Beatles song is whichever one of theirs I happen to be listening to at that moment. If on the other hand you were to ask me to come up with a top ten list of the Beatles best songs there is one song in particular that would in my book make it somewhere on that list, the song is \"Rain\". A really great Beatles song that is while a great one is little known and overlooked by many fans.\n\nOne reason is it never charted. It also never appeared on any of the Beatles albums. In fact it was released in 1966 as the B side to the Beatles hit single \"Paperback Writer\". This is however I feel a song that deserved to be the A side on any single. It has everything a great song needs insightful lyrics, great beat, great guitar work that combined grabs your attention.  This was recorded at the time the Beatles were transitioning their sound from the mop top \"She loves you yeah yeah yeah\" kind of music to being more experimental with their sound and creative with their words. For the True Beatles fanatic this is certainly one of their songs that has to be considered for download onto your iPod or smart phone.","summary":"A Great But Overlooked Song","unixReviewTime":1508716800,"vote":null,"image":null}

This song has some really cool moments from Ringo and Paul; Ringo's quick rolls at :33 on 'into the shade' and at :45 in the way he extends the drum fill beyond the end of 'when the sun shines', and Paul's bass line at 1:18 during the 'I can show you' verse. And then at the end we get the 'let's play stuff backwards' moment. I always think John's vocals sound like 'still drippin on memory...'

All in all it's a decent album but doesn't top Blessing in Disguise as my all-time favorite. Maybe if I'd have gotten the albums just prior to Howe's return I'd have a little more appreciation for this one.\n\nEDIT: I went back and purchased the previous 4 albums with Ronnie Monroe on vocals, and after listenening to them a few times chronologically, I felt I needed to revisit this review.

Tracks 2 and 3 A Cloud in a Box and the Dead Can Dance are typical b-side tracks with the first being the better one by far. Finally track 4 is the Stuart Price  remix. The TRUE GEM in the cd version is the inclusion of an ultra rare (previous only available on a limited vinyl run) Inner Sanctum Carl Craig C2 Juiced remix that is made for the clubs and is a pure delight.\n\nThe three digital mixes should have been available on the cd version. The Offer Nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the versions out there. It is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of It's a Sin or Can You Forgive Her - the glory days when all mixes appeared either in vinyl or then cd \/cassette forms.\nA Cloud in a Box is a good b-side track with a techno dub feel a la 80s flavour. Say It To Me Stuart Price version is nearly identical to the album version but has been slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there. It is the second-best version of all the remixes.","summary":"A Missed opportunity","unixReviewTime":1474329600,"vote":null,"image":null}

They are returning to rock after a short jaunt into country that was not accepted.  They lost their name, and now they are trying to move into mainstream rock.  They have exceeded even some of their early albums that were hit oriented rather than quality.  Eventually this album will be recognized for the wonderful songs that never get old.  The band is recovering from the forces that would take them away from what they are good at, and I'm sure some of the band members also are questioning the direction they're going now.  Sometimes it's a step process, and this was a very good first step.  I've listened to these songs over and over, and only then do you appreciate the effort that went into making them.

Kesler","reviewText":"This is a rather difficult review to write, first because Im rather fond of Gaslight Anthem, and secondly because I dearly want to be inspired to like this solo project from Brian Fallon.\n\nIf theres one characteristic that Fallon carries around with him and refuses to let go of, its his penchant for spending too much time looking in his rearview mirror, over his shoulder, and his downright desire to be anyone other than who he actually is.  As to the rearview mirror aspect, if one listens to the mans lyrics on both the Gaslight Anthem albums and this solo outing, Brian seems to fear that his past is creeping up on him, and in so doing, that past is eventually going to catch up with him, and at that moment in time, hes going to have to come face to face with the present, the here and now, and his place in it.  When that time comes, Im sincerely hoping that his visions are focused on the future, because essentially there is nothing one can write about that happened a mere two hours in the past, over breakfast, so hes gonna have to face a future, and write about some things hed like to see happen, about dreams he longs to have come True, rather than resurrecting a past for which no one can do anything about.\n\nAs to him wishing to be someone else, on The 59 Sound, a song by Gaslight Anthem, he waxes longingly that he wishes he looked like Elvis, and then goes on to allude to Sam Space in Casablanca on the album jacket, while Gaslight has yet another song entitled Steve McQueen.  Of course wed all like to be someone other than ourselves at times  but theres a genuine difference between that, and not coming to grips with the fact that we are who we are.  Of course one could easily point to Springsteen when it comes to either of these aspects, yet Bruce wasn't so much living in the past, its more that he was revealing himself to us, telling us his stories, what made him who he is as he moved into the present.  And yes, one could certainly infer that Springsteens most interesting and beloved albums came from viewing his past.  And while thats all well and good, Bruce accepted those nostalgic characters, those struggling years, owing them, making them his own, while Fallon seems to be trying to out run them, as if by giving them voice, they will turn to dust, no longer being present to torment his mind.\n\nTheres no mistaking that Pain Killers obsessively belongs to Brian Fallon  its chocked full of idyllic images of an America that no longer exists, and probably never existed as Fallon has come to romanticize it; with that romanticization shading both the good and negative aspects of his plagued memories.  Frankly, Fallons become sort of a parody of himself, after all, how many girls named Maria, and how many times can he image a late night diner before actual cracks appear, and folks begin to think that they're hearing their the same old songs through a new set of speakers.\n\nI so wish that Brian Fallon would grasp the idea that even the losers get lucky some times [to paraphrase Tom Petty], because I actually like hearing the man sing, investing myself in his visions, and listening to his narratives.  Each song from Pain Killers feels as if the man is standing outside of not so much himself, but of real life, giving me the sensation that even as Fallon is holding faded photographic images, those images are bleaching in the sun, leaving him with only impressions of not only those images, but of his memory, where nothing can be trusted as truth.\n\nWith all that being said, Pain Killers is the sort of thing that draws me in, like a cheap pulp novel you read and leave on the seat of the crosstown bus when you're finished.  Nothing here is a keeper, but what Fallon does do is linger in my mind, where his memories mesh with mine, where I feel not so much alone knowing that Brian Fallon is out there reminding me that perhaps in this day and age, the past is not such a bad place to stake a claim.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","summary":"I dearly want to be inspired to like this solo project from Brian Fallon ...","unixReviewTime":1480204800,"vote":"2","image":null}

There are some great tunes here and this collection plays better than the snooze fest that was found on the AT LAST CD.\n\nFUNNEL OF LOVE has Cyndis trademark vocal tics and hiccups and they work wonderfully in this context.\n\nDETOUR sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s by Kitty Wells.\n\nMISTY BLUE is a dynamic vocal performance, period. This and HARD CANDY CHRISTMAS are probably the best ones on the CD.\n\nWALKNG AFTER MIDNIGHT is one of the weak links only because no one can sing this like Patsy Cline and the arrangement isn't as atmospheric as the original; the lack of male backup is detrimental. I FALL TO PIECES works much better even though its a carbon-copy version of Patsys.\n\nHEARTACHES BY THE NUMBER has a vocal that is typical Cyndi and an average arrangement.\n\nEND OF THE WORLD is less cringe-worthy than the syrupy Skeeter Davis version.\n\nYOURE THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE UGLY with Vince Gill is a cute duet with lots of funny banter and it works better than the drowsy Willie Nelson duet on the country-blues number NIGHT LIFE.\n\nI WANNA BE A COWBOYS SWEETHEART is noteworthy for the yodeling if nothing else.","summary":"Is There Any Genre She Can't Conquer?","unixReviewTime":1528761600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Gilliland","reviewText":"Another good but inconsistent album by Parquet Courts that leaves me a bit frustrated. There are times when this band sounds great, like a top notch outfit, but at other times, they slip into mediocrity and frustrate me.\n\nMost of the other reviews give you a good gist of what this band sounds like. You can hear plenty of Velvet Underground influence, a bit of Pavement, and I also hear a healthy dose of old Dream Syndicate in some songs. Obviously, those are some very good influences. But Parquet Courts also have this maddening tendency to talk-rap in some of the songs, as if they are just too lazy to actually sing the song. The lead singer has a decent enough voice, so I don't know why they do this so often. Other than those infrequent musical hiccups, there are some powerful, riveting songs on this latest effort. I'm just waiting for this band to really show what they are capable of and give us a truly great album. This isn't quite the one.","summary":"Still waiting for this band to deliver the goods","unixReviewTime":1488153600,"vote":null,"image":null}

They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Mozart-Box\/dp\/B00B5Q7M90\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Mozart Box<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Haydn-Box\/dp\/B00CMAM8QA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Haydn Box<\/a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Bigger Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the second of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including a comprehensive offering of his piano sonatas, his only violin concerto, his complete Diabelli variations and piano concertos, four of his nine symphonies, as well as dances, songs, rondos, bagatelles, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Bigger Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I am slightly less enamored of it. This is mainly due to two reasons:\n\n1. There are no string quartets or piano trios on \"Bigger Beethoven Box.\" Many of Beethovens greatest chamber music masterpieces belong to these two sub-genres, and I think the fact that  none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.\n\n2. The albums engineering is not quite as good as it is on other Big Box albums  especially Big Mozart Box and Big Haydn Box. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.\n\nDespite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience. Recommended.","summary":"\"Bigger Beethoven Box\" is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethoven's music.","unixReviewTime":1502928000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Putting out nice albums like his latest, That's Hip Hop, makes it even harder. You can tell how great he would sound in the group again because his rhyme game is so tight here, and after all, he's obviously been working on it continuously. The Brooklyn backpack bomber comes off of 2014's House Slippers and 2015's Human with Illmind for this very retro, throwback-themed project, and it's got a lot of hardcore rap cats on it just doing their thing, with production that is True-to-the-pit boom bap. That's Hip Hop was released Tuesday, March 15 on the record label of the same name.\n\nThe album was clearly designed with the pure rap\/rhyme addicts in mind. Like a typical Joell Ortiz set, it is not loaded with messages and really only aims towards a social end when Jo describes his urban N.Y.C. milieu and community across a handful of songs, when he tells a woman's sob story for her in \"Precious\" and when he tells some of his own war stories of hard times in \"Trouble.\" Everything else is pretty much a lyrics-fest. Experienced, respected guys like Kool G Rap, Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P. start that good golden-era fire, and some neo-shine is cast by new jewels like Raven Felix, Chris Rivers and Token, the last of whom has a very double-edged verse in \"Kill at Will\" - it's very fast, very nimble and very impressive delivery-wise, but as insane rap mouthpieces tend to do, the search for meaning and message gets lost in his ravishing rapacious technique.\n\nJoell's well tuned machine-mouth works just fine here, but those offensive, shockingly controversial bits and pieces that all hip-hop heads know, love and look for are few in That's Hip Hop. Without making striking statements that are anti-status quo or anti-establishment, like he should, he depends on his striking yet easy obscenities and profanities to turn heads. And it was just like this on his last two albums as well. Many of us look to talented and skilled emcees like Joell to spread awareness about the world's problems, but sadly there's too little of that in the correct form here. Technically, Joell Ortiz is a beast and so are his features, and the producers have properly and impressively fashioned their beats into that vintage '90s style of hip-hop production, but if you're looking for new enlightening messages, you may not want to spend a lot of time on this disc.","summary":"'That's Hip Hop' - Joell Ortiz strikes back in fifth album proper","unixReviewTime":1458259200,"vote":"3","image":null}

Unfortunately, Chrisette Michele has been one of those songstresses that does deserve more credit because of her soul from the voice alone, but somberly she has never gotten it, in the severe overexposure of others like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles, whom are more products than people. Hard to believe that it has been a decade since she came out of the bloom with her debut album, I Am, and she still has had better music than most of the jokes on radio today. Sadly, Chrisette has such a beautiful soul but she still never has gotten the credit she deserves with her work. Her latest single, tries to show that Chrisette is going for a more modern R&B sound that really does work in her favor, where she has had several songs from the past few years not work in her favor. Unbreakable, the lead single from her 5th album Milestone, is short and simple but shows she is still making better songs than what is out there in radio today. This is a nice download if you have followed Chrisette Michele for the past decade, and if you really enjoy her work.\n\nSong: B 1\/2-","summary":"Broken, But Still Strong","unixReviewTime":1467158400,"vote":null,"image":null}

While the past decade has brought her some ups and downs, with her own work, she is still holding steadily in her crafts. She has had some excellent albums with I Am and her second album Epiphany. But the later albums haven't been able to ignite in sales with Better and Let Freedom Reign, which had some songs that weren't up to par like The Goodbye Game and the haunting Charade, which was a real departure from her past works. She did come back soulfully with Together last year, but she is still trying to get back into the R&B game. Unbreakable, is definitely a good stepping stone, and shows a more edgier sound from Chrisette that mostly works to her own craft in song. While it isn't like Fragile was in song, it still is all Chrisette Michele. If you have loved her past work, you'll definitely be eager to hear what Chrisette has been up to.\n\nSong: B-","summary":"Unbroken","unixReviewTime":1461024000,"vote":null,"image":null}

When Fifth Harmony came out the past few years, I honestly was not very thrilled at the songs that they had been able too come out with in heart and soul. I was not excited of the songs Sledgehammer and Worth It, which showed the gals were not very strong at the soul, and sounded more like they were little children at the mike for the first time than divas at the heart. Their latest single from their second album 7\/27, tries to bring in more of a reggae feeling to their songs, but it didn't work overall. All In My Head (Flex) their latest single, doesn't actually deliver at the heart of the matter to what they really could've deliver, as a more sultry and seductive song to turn to the kids, into sultry songstresses. I really was not very impressed with the song, and hopefully, when the gals grow further into their music, Fifth Harmony will have much more down the road to sing about.\n\nSong: C-","summary":"Almost In The Head","unixReviewTime":1471824000,"vote":null,"image":null}

But with some tracks that I had heard from This Is What The Truth Feels Like, I wasn't completely impressed with the songs that she had already came out with the album. Misery, the third single from her album, isn't actually a strong and poppy song that really drove in the way that she had from her earlier solo songs like The Sweet Escape and Rich Girl.

We have lost a lot of those artists from drugs, alcohol, and self-doubt on whether they can be who they are today, as they did back then. This past year, we lost Prince, Pete Burns of Dead Or Alive and David Bowie to just name a few. But of all of the acts that have passed away, there has been some that really have came back strong personally and professionally. Phil Collins has made the ambitious decision about coming out of retirement, and coming back musically, and personally, and the decision has been both brilliant and personal. He re-released his entire catalog and his work has definitely sounded better than ever. But back in 1985, he was someone that took on a lot of heat when he sampled Prince's 1999  with his massive hit, Sussudio. But the song today sounds just as strong and vibrant, as it did back then. The song still makes me want to just get up, sing and dance. It is one of those fee-good anthems that really is worth the soul.

But after his first two records which were more dormid and dark reflecting on divorce, Face Value & Hello I Must Be Going, he needed to have something more poppy and upbeat in his career. Than his landmark 1985 album, No Jacket Required came along, and earned Phil a lot of great acclaim and rewards, including Album Of The Year a the 1986 Grammy Awards. Now, looking back at Phil's legacy, I have always loved his brilliance in song, but also the choices he has made in song have been very strong. Even when he took a notorious use of Prince's music for Sussudio. The lead single from No Jacket Required, which took on a sample of Prince's 1999, actually is one of those uplifting songs that have been strong from the soul, and definitely upbeat in the rhythm at heart. It is a great song worth listening too, and one of those tracks that really was a game changer for Phil in the 80's that is still fun to listen to.

After 30 years of making humorous albums TMBG just seem to spin their wheels now. Don't get me wrong, I like them, have all of their albums, but it's just not the same anymore. They're not fresh anymore. I hardly pay attention now, and that's something I used to do with \"Lincoln\", \"Flood\" and \"Apollo 18\". Heck, even \"Mink Car\". And, sure, \"Nanobots\" was pretty good, a strong turn around, but overall, since 2001's \"Mink Car\", the guys have felt stale. They need something new. You know, Franz Ferdinand collaborated with Sparks last year to great effect. It was completely unexpected, and strangely, it worked very well. Perhaps that's what TMBG need. To collaborate with an unusual artist that we fans would never suspect. You know it would be interesting. More interesting than \"Phone Power\".\n\n\"Phone Power\" is yet another collection of oddballs, this time from dial-a-song, but it just falls flat. It's just okay, nothing more. I used to get excited about TMBG. I used to want to memorize their quirky lyrics, but now, not so much. They need a kick in the pants. Stop doing children's music, you've diluted your effectiveness.

It appeared to be \"digital only\" but my patience paid off and Sparks & Shadows (which is a record label created by Bear McCreary) finally released it.  McCreary makes a great statement on the Sparks & Shadows website where he says, \"I value the soundtrack experience, because score records are what first led me down the path to becoming a composer\".  He goes on to say, \"I was a fan and a collector long before I became a professional musician. I have always looked for ways to deliver my original scores to fans so they can have the same experiences.\"  Let me say a big Thank You to Bear McCreary for looking out for the fans and collectors!\n\nI rarely get to go see movies in the theatre and out of all the ones that I am eagerly waiting to be released on BluRay, this one is probably the one that I am on pins and needles to see the most.  The reviews are great, the trailer looks mysterious, and the soundtrack is awesome!  One of the great things about the CD release is that it comes with a massive 24 page insert with photos from the movie, photos of the scoring recordings, musician credits, production notes, and a very detailed account of the score creation written by Bear McCreary.  The insert contains a fascinating account of how the score was developed and fun insights into McCreary's creativity as a musician and composer.  Some amazing facts about the score is how much McCreary studies the characters and the fact that he visits the set to get a feel for the movie and it's story.  I know many composers do this, but to hear McCreary's account of going to the movie set to study some of the smallest details like the vents\/air ducts in the bunker and feeling the claustrophobic atmosphere in some of the spaces is pretty intense.  McCreary's goal was to capture the musical sounds of the subterranean bunker and the people within.\n\nThe score opens with the beautiful piece entitled \"Michelle\" (track 1).  The cue begins with a single instrument, the Tanbur.  This exotic Middle Eastern instrument has been used by McCreary before in his \"Da Vinci's Demons\" TV scores.  What's interesting about this single instrument is that this cue and technique is inspired by McCreary's mentor, Elmer Bernstein.  Wow...didn't know that Bernstein was his mentor!  The liner notes state that Bernstein felt that the opening few seconds of a score were the most important because it was here that you would have the audience's full attention before they get lost within the visuals and story.  Bernstein felt that beginning a score with a single instrument that would represent the film, was a good practice and apparently one that McCreary has put into play within this soundtrack.  This opening track really does set up the entire score and I hear a sadness and mystery in it that sets a tone for the film.  McCreary plays with this theme throughout the score and I love the sound produced by this instrument.\n\nAnother interesting fact concerning this score is McCreary's use of a very unusual instrument known as the Blaster Beam.  I never even knew that this instrument even existed, yet I'm very familiar with the sound.  I actually thought it was just sound generated by an electronic keyboard.  It's basically a 12 to 18 foot long metal beam (sometimes made out of aluminum), that has wires under various degrees of tension that are struck with sticks, pipes, or fingers to create some very bizarre and amazing sounds.  Jerry Goldsmith used it for his \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" score as a way to identify V'ger.  I looked it up on YouTube and you can see some video demonstrations of the instrument.  McCreary contacted Craig Huxley, the same guy who played the instrument for the Star Trek film, and used him for this particular score.  A great piece in this score that highlights the Blaster Beam is \"Hazmat Suit\" (track 8).  You can hear this fascinating instrument throughout the score and McCreary uses it masterfully.\n\nMcCreary adds a lot of musical textures to this score including layered vocals by Raya Yarbrough on pieces like \"Howard\" (track 3) and various other unique instruments that create a gloomy, frightful, and mysterious atmosphere within this bunker and the people we are observing.  The score, sounds very classic to me, but with some unusual modern instrument enhancements.  Reviewer Paul Allaer mentioned that the score has a very Bernard Herrmann sound to it and I agree.  It has that Hitchcock movie vibe to it but also an ingenuity that gives it a sound of it's own.  The liner notes even mention McCreary and J.J. Abrams discussions concerning Herrmann and Goldsmith's styles.\n\nIt's simply a fascinating score to listen to and I really appreciate the great liner notes provided by Sparks & Shadows that bring a lot of insight into the making of the music.  Bear McCreary fans will not be disappointed with this release and the composer continues to shine with yet another amazing score.  The CD release contains 14 tracks with a running time of 64 minutes.  The CD insert is wonderful but the thing is so big that it barely fits into the insert slots on the front of the case!  It's a wonderful release and I highly recommend picking this one up!","summary":"McCreary and the Blaster Beam!","unixReviewTime":1462924800,"vote":"4","image":null}

I was struck by the orchestral score and made a mental note to myself that I needed to check it out. When I started looking into it, my search led me to this. The orchestral score is composed by Bear McCreary, best known for his work on various high-profile TV series (The Walking Dead, Outlander, Black Sails, etc.). Here McCreary ups his game a level or two, in ways not seen before from him.\n\n\"10 Cloverfield Lane - Music from the Motion Picture\" (14 tracks; 64 min.) opens with \"Michelle\" (as the movie opens, and Michelle decides to leave her boyfriend and get out of New Orleans). It is a 6 min. mini-suite of sorts, exploring various emotions along the way. What a great way to kick off the soundtrack. And when we get to the next track \"The Concrete Cell\", this is an 8+ min. epic track that enforces the dark mood and desperation that besets Michelle and Emmett. It is rare these days that we get treated to such long soundtrack pieces, and while after the initial two super-long tracks many of them are quite shorter, there still are several other long ones to come still. \"Two Stories\" is one of my favorites on here, with more of that threatening undercurrent that leaves you wondering, almost anxious. It is one of several tracks on here that made me think back of Bernard Hermann's work all those decades ago when he score many of Hitchcock's movies, and I do mean this as a high complement. \"Valencia\" is al all-out action piece. The last track on here is what plays over the movie's end titles. In all, I am very impressed with this score. PLEASE NOTE: this soundtrack contains only the orchestral score, and it leaves out the various songs that appear in the movie, including \"I Think We're Alone Now\", by Tommy James & The Shondellas, in a pivotal scene, but also \"Tell Him\" (by The Exciters) and \"Venus\" (by Frankie Avalon).\n\nAs to the movie itself, it is pretty darn good. Not an outright sequel to \"Cloverfield\", producer J.J. Abrams and newcomer-director  Dan Trachtenberg craft a mystery thriller that keeps you guessing for a very long time (in the best possible way) what the heck is going on. Was Michelle recued? or kidnapped? Come for the mystery, stay for the jaw-dropping last 30 minutes! \"10 Cloverfield Lane\", both the soundtrack and the movie, is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","summary":"Orchestral score reminds me of Bernard Herrmann's scores for Alfred Hitchcock's movies","unixReviewTime":1458518400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Some of the best performances were also in the \"Big Violin Box\". e.g., the Suk recordings of the Mozart Concertos ##2 & 3. the Oistrakh recording of the Dvorak and the Elman recordings of the Lalo Symphonie espagnole (4 movement version).  That also has some of the Szigeti\/Arrau Beethoven Sonatas (##6, 7 & 8) and excellent recordings of the Franck Sonata and Beethoven's \"Kreutzer\" by Oistrakh, as well as a number of encores performed by Oistrakh and by Elman.  This does have a very fine recording of the Glazunov Concerto with Oistrakh , a good (if old-fashioned) Elman recording of a Bach Concerto and very fine (and comparatively modern) recordings of the Bruch Concerto #1 and his Scottish Fantasy.  On the other hand...\n\nThe Joseph Silverstein recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky and Mozart #5 are, to put it mildly, disappointing.  There's just nothing very distinctive here.  There is no \"personality and he often seems rather tentative.  The Tchaikovsky is played with the cuts restored but some of these are rather repetitive passages sound even more forced and repetitive than normal here.  The orchestral contributions (Utah Symphony under various un-named conductors, except for the Mozart, which has the Rochester Philharmonic) add little.  The sound (probably from the 1980s) has less presence than many RCA recordings from the 1950s.  If you don't have the Big Violin Box and\/or have an interest in the Glazunov and Bruch, it's worth it but otherwise, consider carefully.  If these would be your only recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky, you're cheating yourself.","summary":"Mixed","unixReviewTime":1463961600,"vote":"4","image":null}

From the 2016 album blackSummersnight, this is the Grammy Award-winning song by the double Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, musician, producer, and actor Maxwell. He has planned his musical career over long periods of time, followed by his eagerly-awaited albums becoming hits and spawning hit singles. Considering the significant gaps of time between them, up to 7 years, including 2 albums from the trilogy with variations of the words blacksummersnight, his artistry has shown bright throughout his career. This album was preceded by the 2009, Grammy-winning album, Blacksummersnight.\n\nOn Lake by The Ocean, written by Musze (Maxwell) and Hod David, which won the Grammy for Best R&B Song, Maxwell establishes a definite catchy groove that persists throughout the song and drives the simple, repetitive, but brilliant lyrics. Over a deliberate beat from the urgent drums, Maxwell uses his natural range voice to tell the story, switching to his Falsetto voice range to raise the intensity with repetition of the refrain on this song. This song lingers in the mind long after the music has stopped. The musical support group includes the likes of Hod David on bass and other instruments, Robert Glasper on keyboards, Darryl Lil Man Howell or Mark Colenburg on drums, Derrick Hodge on bass, and others.

It contains chamber music works from various composers of the romantic period of classical music, including: Antonin Dvorak, Anton Bruckner, Franz Schubert, Alexander Borodin, and Johannes Brahms.\n\nAlthough I am somewhat less familiar with these composers chamber works than I am with those of J.S. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, I am very impressed with the selections that appear on this album. I think my favorite is Cypresses, a twelve-movement chamber work by Dvorak thats performed to perfection by The Cleveland Quartet. I also find the Violin Sonata in A Major and Piano Quintet in A Major by Schubert to be especially enjoyable.\n\nAs is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 1 is excellent. This album is a winner in every way, and at only 99 cents, its an unbeatable bargain that belongs in the digital music library of anyone who appreciates classical chamber music Highly recommended.","summary":"\"Big Chamber Music Box Vol. 1:\" a most impressive MP3 album of chamber music from The Bach Guild.","unixReviewTime":1510531200,"vote":null,"image":null}

If Volume 1 has a lot of basic repertoire (chamber music-wise), Volume II focuses on works you probably haven't heard.\n\nThere is a really nice variety and a number of welcome rarities.  I'd never encountered Dohnanyi's chamber music before, nor had I heard the Arensky 2nd Quartet or the Clarinet Quintet of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.  This set also contains excellent performance of the Debussy and Ravel String Quartets and several French pieces for winds.\n\nSo a lot of music (outside of the Debussy and Ravel) that may be unfamiliar but very worthy of your time and 99 cents!","summary":"Chamber Music well off the beaten path","unixReviewTime":1465430400,"vote":null,"image":null}

There were 4 more bonus tracks available on the DVD, which were downloadable, for a total of 29 songs. Phil thought that was too many songs, so for this 2016 remaster, he retitled the album \"The Essential Going Back\" and trimmed it down to 14 songs. This is a blunder in my view, no matter how he justifies it. Especially with 2 CDs to fill up. The other 15 songs could have (and should have) been somewhere on this collection, even if they were weaker than the 14 songs he chose to keep (which will be a matter of opinion to each listener). It's sort of like \"Coda\" by Led Zeppelin. The last album, and weakest one, but one you still need to complete your collection. The songs here aren't terrible, the production is great and if I could describe the performances in one word, it would be \"perfunctory.\"","summary":"New version is a blunder","unixReviewTime":1502150400,"vote":null,"image":null}

This isn't a bad album  (Well, except for Keep the Family Close and Pop Style) just one that's so......predictable. Views feels like it's going for the atmosphere and vibe of the much better and more original Take Care, but comes across as an imitation with the energy sapped right out of it. On the comparatively  few instances where Drake raps, he sounds almost disinterested, and his rhymes are some of his least inspired yet. Moments where the rap elements of Views truly come alive (like the great Weston Road Flows) are incredibly few and far in between.\n\nThe singing on the other hand feels like the same old thing. There's the same 80s-sounding pop track, there's the duet with Rihanna, there's the weird sort of dance track featuring Partynextdoor, there's the slow jam near the end of the album......it all seems to be mining familiar territory. And though Fire and Desire's one of Drake's best slow jams and of course it's impossible to deny the catchiness of Controlla and One Dance or the slick production throughout, many of the singing tracks similarly feel sunk by a disinterested-sounding MC and the feeling that we've been here before but better.\n\nDrake's longtime producer 40 (who comes back to the forefront after taking slightly smaller roles on Nothing Was the Same and If You're Reading This It's Too Late) does what he does best, providing a truly ambient and dreamy backdrop that has become Drake's sound. I wish the hip hop-focused If You're Reading This sounded at least close to this good, and while his work keeps Views going, it never really takes off because Drake just never really seems to be trying to do anything other than what's expected of him.\n\nStill, if you're a fan of Drake you should find at least a decent amount to like here; it does have its moments and an oftentimes top notch production. I thought it was solid for a couple of listens, but there hasn't been much for me to come back to. Many aspects seem to be firing on all cylinders, but Drake's uninspired performance and a general lack of anything new makes Views his most forgettable LP yet.","summary":"A middle of the road effort that goes for Take Care but mostly falls flat","unixReviewTime":1507852800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I have to admit, at first I wasn't really \"getting it\", but over time, this album has in turn released its inner beauty and I have been playing this album a LOT in the last couple of months, ahead of the band's return to Cincinnati (more on that later).\n\n\"A Moon Shaped Pool\" (11 tracks; 53 min.) opens with the urgent \"Burn The Witch\", which reminds me of the \"Hail to the Thief\" songs. It is followed by \"Daydreaming\", an introspective tune (and traditional concert opener on the current tour). We then get to \"Decks Dark\", which is my favorite track: I love the gradual build-up, and then the extra kick in the last 90 sec., just perfect, The album is now revved up and in full gear. Not that it means the songs are all loud or hard, far from it, but there is a cohesion to the soundscape as we go from track to track that just feels right. Among other highlights: \"Ful stop\" is mesmerizing, and \"The Numbers\" feels wistful. The album's closer is \"True Love Waits\", the song that has been around for 2 decades in one form or another. The live acoustic guitar version on 2001's \"I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\" is a thing of beauty, but now comes this definitive version, featuring piano and keyboards, rather than acoustic guitar. What a great song.\n\nI've seen Radiohead live a number of times over the years, and had the good fortune of seeing them in concert again this week here in Cincinnati. They played a 2 hr. 20 min. show that can only be described as magical. Playing from pretty much their entire catalog, the sold-out crowd ate it up from start to finish. The 4 songs from \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" blended in nicely. Check this out: Set List Cincinnati 7\/25\/18: 1. Daydreaming 2. Desert Island Disk 3. Ful Stop 4.2 + 2 = 5 5. Myxomatosis 6. Kid A 7.

It contains chamber music works from various composers of the classical and early romantic periods of classical music, including (among others): Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Giacchino Rossini, and Luigi Boccherini.\n\nI am much more familiar with most of these composers chamber works than I am with those featured on Big Chamber Music Box Volumes 1 and 2  (both of which I have reviewed here at Amazon.com).  My expectations for the music on this third volume were therefore very high, and I am pleased to report that the music in no way disappointed. Indeed, I am very favorably impressed with both the selections that appear on this album, and the quality of the performances. My favorites include Haydns Quartet for Guitar and Strings in D major; Beethovens Duo for Clarinet and Bassoon in C major; and, of course, Mozarts incomparable Serenade for Winds in B flat major Gran Partita.  I also find Boccherinis Quintet for Guitar and Strings in E major to be especially enjoyable.\n\nAs is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 3 is excellent. This is a clear winner that I think is hands-down the best of the three Big Chamber Music Box volumes from The Bach Guild. At only 99 cents, its also an unbeatable bargain that deserves a place in every classical music collectors digital library. Most highly recommended.","summary":"Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 3:\" hands-down the best of The Bach Guild's Big Chamber Music Box series.","unixReviewTime":1511049600,"vote":null,"image":null}

For Ariana Grande, she has been trying to mature into diva-hood like the ranks of divas from Mariah Carey to the great Whitney Houston (as her lackluster drive had shown on the ABC show Greatest Hits.) For Ariana, I was not very impressed with her lackluster songs already released from her Dangerous Woman album from Into You and Dangerous Woman. But also her song from last year, Focus didn't even shine her voice brighter, instead her voice sounded more shrill and putting too much emphasis on looking for herself, than a real voice. Her latest single, Let Me Love You, the third from her Dangerous Woman, isn't actually a striking duet. She and Lil' Wayne do not even have enough chemistry to sparkle on this track to shimmer as one of the more classic duets. Perhaps ariana has more growing up she has to do to make the heart firmly fonder. Maybe when she makes another record, it will work for her, but not now.\n\nSong: D+","summary":"Not Loving Her","unixReviewTime":1472515200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Instead of relying on the usual bag of tricks most metal and death metal players use, Davidson threw in more curveballs than you could believe, with quirky choices of notes, delightful off kilter chord patterns and an innovative approach that got the attention of lots of people outside the metal realm.  Imagine Frank Zappa, Adrian Belew and other denizens of very precise yet unhinged playing.\n  The new album \"Great Is Our Sin\" is, like the others, Revocation at their best, but there are some differences here that are worth pointing out.  First, the production seems to be a bit tighter, the guitar interplay a little more refined, making the riffs and hooks stand out a little better.  It still belts out the power but has become less cluttered.  The other is a few sections of clean and harmonizing vocals, a trend many death bands are starting to rediscover, and in this case, the clean vocals are such a welcome addition.  It makes those parts stand out like sore thumbs, especially the harmony parts.  I hope Revocation ditches the screaming all the way around because it will bring more attention to arrangements and hooks.  The whole schtick of grunting is getting old and my prediction is that there will be a fairly sizable reversion back to singing vocals.  It won't be complete, but it will happen.  \"Great Is Our Sin\" is a great metal album, fans of King Crimson and other experimental sounds will be interested, and if their cards are played right, this is the album that could propel Revocation into the big time without sacrificing their signature wackiness and heaviness doing it.","summary":"Revocation show us again why they're among the best metal bands around","unixReviewTime":1473033600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Unfortunately, most of the covers in the past several years have been jokes and not really as classy as the original songs have been. The past several years for R&B have been more of the overexposure of acts like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles. But for classic songs, they haven't really been shown the compassion and care that had been drove like songs did years ago. For Will Downing, he has been one of those R&B singers, known more for his concerts than even having a glance on the radio. But when he has sung a song, it is worth listening to. His cover of Cherelle & Alexander O' Neal's song Everything I Miss At Home definitely is a bright light, in a industry that has been more about flaunting the outers than the inner voice itself. It is a nice cover, and definitely ranks into the few that have been worth listening to the past few years like Musiq Soulchild's version of Maze's Silky Soul in 2010. It is a good song, and a treat for classic vintage R&B that is just missed in this industry today.\n\nSong: B","summary":"Missed On Soul Radio","unixReviewTime":1472774400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Has alot of wonderful vocals from the film, 4 versions of the Ghostbusters Theme, including a rerecord of the original with Ray Parker Jr. That Is  almost indistinguishable from the one on my original Ghostbusters soundtrack. Avid Ghostbusters nuts like myself might notice a slight difference in the way Ray Parker Jr sings. But it's still pretty darn close. There are also versions by Pentatonix and Walk On The Moon (my favorite other than the original) and of Course the new Ghostbusters Theme by Fall Out Boy and Missy Elliot. I also really love some of the other tracks on here, including Girls Talk Boys, Party Up In Here, Get Ghost, and one of my personal favorite tracks on this new sound track, Good Girls. If you're a Ghostbusters fan, either a veteran or a newbie, and you loved the new movie, you will love this soundtrack.","summary":"\"I ain't afraid of no new Ghostbusters!\"","unixReviewTime":1471910400,"vote":"2","image":null}

How when in danger they have heroes to turn to.  The original inspired and entertained.  The music energized fans everywhere, and the Ray Parker Jr.'s voice was powerful.\n\nThis music sucked, and the verses were distort versions of the original.  It wasn't even a single singer doing it.  They had one singer doing the main bit, and then a separate rap singer for some.  And it didn't even seem like singing at many points - just fanatically chanting \"I'm not Afraid\"","summary":"Terrible","unixReviewTime":1468972800,"vote":null,"image":null}
