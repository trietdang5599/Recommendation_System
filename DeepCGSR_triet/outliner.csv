-1,1,5.0,I received the shampoo because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the result from only just one wash. it cleared out the dandruff without drying my hair out. My hair felt smooth and Fresh after just the first wash. I tried aveda spray before but it was useless and waste of money
-1,1,4.0,Good but kind of drying
-1,1,5.0,"It gets messy after the first few times, but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and very small amount of dandruff after less than two weeks of use."
-1,1,4.0,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week.."
-1,1,5.0,"I was using this shampoo from six years and found helpful restoring hair and reducing dryness of psoriasis.
But it was discontinued from three years .Why I don't know .Then I used other psoriasis  shampoos ,which didn't help .scalp still dry and hair falling down. I bought on line but came in small bottle and was costly, and was looks like doublicate not the real."
-1,1,5.0,"It's Bare Escentuals, 'nuff said!"
-1,1,5.0,What the hubby wanted
-1,1,5.0,Wife uses this cream always. Hard to get.
-1,1,5.0,Google the uses and you will be a buyer.
-1,1,5.0,"I'm 63 with still nice hair but so much less than when I was younger, before menopause, so I bought both the shampoo and this conditioner to help strengthen and grow my hair possibly thicker again...the shampoo made my hair feel so stiff it was hard to push my fingers thru my scalp, I wasn't happy, but rinsed and put in this conditioner..........WOW..... my hair turned into silk.....my scalp felt cool like there is mint in the conditioner.....hope it works, I will stick it out because of the conditioner.....I also never understand when a company make the shampoo bottle larger than the conditioner bottle...we all use more conditioner than shampoo, ..i will update in a couple of months"
-1,1,5.0,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."
-1,1,5.0,"Used for years, it has DHT blocker"
-1,1,5.0,as advertised
-1,1,5.0,As expected for price.
-1,1,5.0,"AS awesome as this product is, it HAS been discontinued by the makers. The people selling this on here, including the shampoos and conditioners ARE price gouging you and who knows how OLD it is..  Very Sad"
-1,1,5.0,:)
-1,1,5.0,"I've used this shampoo for years and loved it............. BUT.... the last bottles I bought at Big Lots were only $1.70 for 16ozs.  There's no way its worth $39 a bottle.  Who are you guys kidding? What a scam! There are plenty of other products out there that do a good job for far less money.
Use a nice conditioner (I still have several bottles left that I paid less than $2 for) and you'll still get nice results.  Bah-humbug for those scam artists trying to sell this for 10 times what it's worth."
-1,1,5.0,If they discontinued this scent I would go postal. <3
-1,1,5.0,"I love this scent, and it's no longer being made.
I'm always on the hunt for ""something like it.""
It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.
If the fragrance gods are listening, please recreate this or something like it! I always get compliments on it."
-1,1,5.0,I would recommend this eye cream because it is extremely moisturizing and it only takes a small dab for each eye.  I could tell after only a few times of using it that the fine lines around my eyes weren't as noticeable.
-1,1,5.0,I've been using this product for a couple of years at the suggestion of my hair stylist. Took away the dullness of my gray hair. I like it.
-1,1,5.0,"I was looking for a product that will help minimize the fine lines around the my eyes and only after 2 weeks I could notice an improvement. After 3 weeks my family started commenting on my skin! It does not leave my face feeling greasy nor does it have any fragrance. I feel like it has made my skin look firmer, which makes me looker younger!"
-1,1,5.0,"Before writing this review I used up the entire bottle of the calm shampoo and conditioner. It never made my scalp break out and made my hair super soft. If you are looking for more volume try the argon shampoo and conditioner. I basically used this one when I was wearing my hair straight and using a straightening iron. I would recommend this product. I have color treated hair with a slightly wavy, medium texture."
-1,1,4.0,muy bueno
-1,1,5.0,luv it
-1,1,5.0,"One of my favorite skincare lines. That said, I usually use their other line but since I'm not getting younger, I thought I'd try their more mature line. Strangely, it's LESS moisturizing than their younger line. I'm still using it but next order will be back to their younger line of skincare.

I think the essence in this package is better but the overnight cream and moisturizer in the other package is much better.

I do not use their eye cream, though. Gave it away as it's just too heavy for my purposes and increases milia."
-1,1,5.0,
-1,1,5.0,"I purchased a bottle of this shampoo because it's my favorite, ever. But when it arrived it had been wrapped too tightly and the top of the bottle broke off during shipping. I kept it because I was almost out of my bottle but let them know it had arrived damaged. They were nice enough to replace my bottle and send a very brief apology. You can definitely buy this stuff anywhere, but there's some peace of mind that comes from knowing your supplier will take care of you."
-1,1,4.0,"Love the product, except for the fact that TWO bottles have now broken after being dropped in the shower. The tops needs to be screwed off which I would change to a more friendly flip top which would not require three hands. The product is too expensive to  be wasted down the drain or watered down because the top keeps getting broken off (two different bottles)."
-1,1,5.0,Would buy more of the body cream if moire was available.  This body cream is hard to come by.  I buy anytime I find on a site.  Lotion is easily available but the body cream is difficult to obtain.  This is my signature fragrance.
-1,1,4.0,"I would give it 5 stars but it is way over priced! My hair is looking better and seems to be healthier but I am using the Reflection Chroma Thermique also so who knows which one is working or if it is the combination..I won't pay that price again, if it were cheaper I would keep using it but I am not going to keep using it at that price..Now that my hair is in better shape I think it will be okay, I had damaged it using bleach.."
-1,1,5.0,"Can't get this in the US (not ever made here, as far as I know), and not in Canada apparently anymore either.  Pricey but it's an import...."
-1,1,5.0,I am allergic to a lot of things. I occasionally get a red rash over my body after using some other body washes. This one is an exception. Not a single complain. Perfect!
1,-1,3.0,Good light scent. Have received complements from people that I smell nice after using it. 3 stars because bottle is kind of small for a shower gel (size compariso photo attached) and it doesnt really help me wake up in the morning like other products.
-1,1,5.0,I have really dry skin and Olay ribbons is the only body wash I use. Getting more and more difficult to find in stores - hope it doesn't disappear here as well.
-1,1,5.0,Lovin' them.
-1,1,5.0,AAA+
-1,1,5.0,"For some reason, nowhere near me sells this. Amazon fixed this problem, and I'm now a happy fox."
-1,1,5.0,Loved the products however did think it was priced a little high wanted to get the lotion but the price with shipping and handling was way too much!
-1,1,5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again"

-1,1,5.0,"Actually, at first I intended to order white musk 'lotion', not the body wash.
So I ordered the wrong item without reading the description carefully.
The funny thing is I USE THIS EVERYDAY.
I smelled both scents of the lotion and body wash, and I prefer this one."
-1,1,5.0,"It was what my 16 year old grandson wanted,because he can not fine it in the stores. Please bring it
back to walmart."
-1,1,5.0,Dove no longer manufactures this body wash so I was relieved to find it on Amazon. The price is ridiculous but since I could not find it anywhere else I bought it. This is the only body wash I can use that doesn't dry my skin and make me itchy. If you pair this with Dove's Cream Oil lotion you're good to go.
-1,1,5.0,"I continually get compliments on how wonderful I smell whenever I have used this product- especially when using it with the body lotion. I bought this product at Bath and Body during one of their annual sales a year ago and now they no longer carry it. However, other dealers have it online for $ 45 and the lotion for $45  up to 95? I don't know why Bath & Body stopped selling it."
-1,1,5.0,"This is my favorite body wash of all time. I love how my skin feels, the scent of it and that it comes in non-breakable bottles but, it is not available to purchase anymore. These last few bottles I was able to purchase were ridiculously overpriced yet, I still bought them. I don't understand why the company stopped making this product and would love to find something similar to replace this as my everyday body wash."
-1,1,5.0,I have a sensitive nose when it comes to strong scents and sensitive skin to harsh products so Philosophy seemed like my best bet. I love it. This scent is mild but sweet. Leaves skin so soft. The lotion helps to keep the mild scent all day.

-1,1,4.0,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years..."
-1,1,5.0,"After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor.  Our family doesn't floss much.  The dentist castigated me for this and I said, ""But I do floss!  Twice a year!"" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.  I tried to cut corners once and use the cold water that was still in it from the morning, and it was like cold needles shooting into my gums!"
-1,1,5.0,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!"
1,-1,2.0,"While I like non-alcohol-based rinses, I was not pleased with this. On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).

But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than ""fresh mint"" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.

I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.

If you like really sweet tasting rinses this may be worth a shot. For me, however, it was not something I'd use again."
-1,1,4.0,"From what I can tell, this is the non-alcoholic version of Crest's ""Invigorating Clean Mint"" mouthwash.  Instead of the alcohol, which is a natural (and tasty) preservative, you get parabens.  The user should be aware of this, as some people claim they cause cancer (I'm too uninformed about that topic to state an opinion, but some people might wish to look into it).

Amazingly, this actually tastes very good, whereas every non-alcoholic mouthwash I've ever had before (mostly in hotels) has been horrible.  The ironic thing is that it says they don't use alcohol so that you don't get that burn.  Despite the fact that the burn is what makes me feel like it's doing its job, there is more burn in this than the version with the alcohol!  Admittedly, that burn is slightly different.

Seems like a good mouthwash."
-1,1,4.0,Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse in Cool Wintergreen has a pleasant wintergreen flavor but lacks the invigorating tingling that I enjoy because it is alcohol-free.  It does leave a little aftertaste and it doesn't have fluoride which is helpful for people with sensitive teeth.
-1,1,4.0,"This Crest ""Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse"" is a good mouthwash choice for those needing help with dry-mouth (like me), but it it not very good tasting. My dental health is not the best due to taking prescription medication that dries out my mouth at night, which cavity causing bacteria love. This mouthwash does seem to help with the dry-mouth and also leaves my mouth feeling clean.

Recommended!

1,-1,3.0,"Aside from a couple years in college I haven't used an electric razor until I got this one.  After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant."

-1,1,5.0,I would recommend this eye cream because it is extremely moisturizing and it only takes a small dab for each eye.  I could tell after only a few times of using it that the fine lines around my eyes weren't as noticeable.
-1,1,5.0,I've been using this product for a couple of years at the suggestion of my hair stylist. Took away the dullness of my gray hair. I like it.
-1,1,5.0,"I was looking for a product that will help minimize the fine lines around the my eyes and only after 2 weeks I could notice an improvement. After 3 weeks my family started commenting on my skin! It does not leave my face feeling greasy nor does it have any fragrance. I feel like it has made my skin look firmer, which makes me looker younger!"
-1,1,5.0,luv it
-1,1,5.0,"Before writing this review I used up the entire bottle of the calm shampoo and conditioner. It never made my scalp break out and made my hair super soft. If you are looking for more volume try the argon shampoo and conditioner. I basically used this one when I was wearing my hair straight and using a straightening iron. I would recommend this product. I have color treated hair with a slightly wavy, medium texture."

-1,1,5.0,"One of my favorite skincare lines. That said, I usually use their other line but since I'm not getting younger, I thought I'd try their more mature line. Strangely, it's LESS moisturizing than their younger line. I'm still using it but next order will be back to their younger line of skincare.

I think the essence in this package is better but the overnight cream and moisturizer in the other package is much better.

I do not use their eye cream, though. Gave it away as it's just too heavy for my purposes and increases milia."

-1,1,5.0,"I purchased a bottle of this shampoo because it's my favorite, ever. But when it arrived it had been wrapped too tightly and the top of the bottle broke off during shipping. I kept it because I was almost out of my bottle but let them know it had arrived damaged. They were nice enough to replace my bottle and send a very brief apology. You can definitely buy this stuff anywhere, but there's some peace of mind that comes from knowing your supplier will take care of you."
-1,1,5.0,"Actually, at first I intended to order white musk 'lotion', not the body wash.
So I ordered the wrong item without reading the description carefully.
The funny thing is I USE THIS EVERYDAY.
I smelled both scents of the lotion and body wash, and I prefer this one."
-1,1,5.0,"It was what my 16 year old grandson wanted,because he can not fine it in the stores. Please bring it
back to walmart."
-1,1,4.0,"Love the product, except for the fact that TWO bottles have now broken after being dropped in the shower. The tops needs to be screwed off which I would change to a more friendly flip top which would not require three hands. The product is too expensive to  be wasted down the drain or watered down because the top keeps getting broken off (two different bottles)."
-1,1,5.0,Dove no longer manufactures this body wash so I was relieved to find it on Amazon. The price is ridiculous but since I could not find it anywhere else I bought it. This is the only body wash I can use that doesn't dry my skin and make me itchy. If you pair this with Dove's Cream Oil lotion you're good to go.
-1,1,5.0,"I continually get compliments on how wonderful I smell whenever I have used this product- especially when using it with the body lotion. I bought this product at Bath and Body during one of their annual sales a year ago and now they no longer carry it. However, other dealers have it online for $ 45 and the lotion for $45  up to 95? I don't know why Bath & Body stopped selling it."
-1,1,5.0,Would buy more of the body cream if moire was available.  This body cream is hard to come by.  I buy anytime I find on a site.  Lotion is easily available but the body cream is difficult to obtain.  This is my signature fragrance.
-1,1,4.0,"I would give it 5 stars but it is way over priced! My hair is looking better and seems to be healthier but I am using the Reflection Chroma Thermique also so who knows which one is working or if it is the combination..I won't pay that price again, if it were cheaper I would keep using it but I am not going to keep using it at that price..Now that my hair is in better shape I think it will be okay, I had damaged it using bleach.."
-1,1,5.0,"This is my favorite body wash of all time. I love how my skin feels, the scent of it and that it comes in non-breakable bottles but, it is not available to purchase anymore. These last few bottles I was able to purchase were ridiculously overpriced yet, I still bought them. I don't understand why the company stopped making this product and would love to find something similar to replace this as my everyday body wash."
-1,1,5.0,"Can't get this in the US (not ever made here, as far as I know), and not in Canada apparently anymore either.  Pricey but it's an import...."
-1,1,5.0,I have a sensitive nose when it comes to strong scents and sensitive skin to harsh products so Philosophy seemed like my best bet. I love it. This scent is mild but sweet. Leaves skin so soft. The lotion helps to keep the mild scent all day.
-1,1,4.0,"You know how annoying it is to keep in mind that every 30-45 days you must throw away your old toothbrush and then find the same kind with the same either soft or medium head and it is never exactly the same and you have to get used to it again and then whole cycle repeats itself?

Well, no more. I have an automatic toothbrush and all I do now is put its head in this neat sanitizer and it kills all the bacteria and I can go on for another 20-30 days without having to worry about repeating this process. The product has UV bulb, which is what actually kills the bacteria. There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models). I didn't have troubles putting the holder into the Sanitizer. The cleaning takes approximately 10 minutes and when complete it shuts itself off. It was prebuilt with a drip tray to get rid of excess water. This is a great gift for anyone in your family. Folks, it doesn't get any easier or more practical than this."
1,-1,3.0,"I would have to say that this is probably a good niche product and nice gift for someone who already owns a compatible toothbrush.  It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).

That said, for $50 plus S&H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.
The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

This is a simple to use product that probably does what it says.
But I think I'll give mine to family member who also uses Sonicare brushes and may appreciate more the gadget geekiness of the UV Sanitizer."
-1,1,4.0,Works well but gets a little too hot.  Tend to scaled my scalp pretty quickly.  But I use it anyway cuz this is the only brand I find that offers 3/4 inch size.
1,-1,3.0,"This is a small sea sponge for the price. It's decent, you can hold it in your hand easily in the shower. Exfoliates well too. Just keep it in a well-drained spot in the shower to extend it's life."
-1,1,4.0,"I used and am reviewing the Nail Brush. I had not realized that the reviews for so many different products would be mixed up on
one page.
The nail brush isn't anything extra special, but it is sturdy and well made. I had no bristles fall out while I was using it.
It did what it was supposed to do, get dirt out from under my fingernails.
If it exfoliated my cuticles in the process, I did not notice. I am not too fussy about my nails and cuticles, only caring if my nails are
broken or dirty."
-1,1,4.0,"This might have been a nice product if they had been a usable size.  Even accounting for wiggling wet hands into fabric, these are oversized.  They should be clearly labeled as EXTRA LARGE and their should be a smaller version as an option.  Offering at least two sizes (S/M and L/XL) seems a fair expectation.  Without size options, I expect the size to be ""medium"" not extra large.  This is neither one-size-fits-all or one-size-fits-most.

If your hands are small, these are unusable.  If your hands are average, you will still find this big.

Fabric is soft and washable."
-1,1,4.0,"This review is for the ""Urban Spa Boucle Bath Mitt For Shower, Bath, Exfoliating and Cleansing"" - basically a bath mitt with a natural boucl yarn.
You only get one mitt which has a soft exfoliating surface that is less harsh than a loofah yet still exfoliates effectively.

The mitt is thin and it fits my hand normally if not a little loose. I have large hands.  I was perplexed by all the reviews about these being small.  Maybe this points to a QC issue?

It performs well in the shower - gently abrasing skin.  I use it with a high quality body wash.

Overall - this is a decent mitt but nothing spectacular.  I've used products from my local stores that are as good or better for perhaps less price.  It does work and it does leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  I would recommend it with reservations."
1,-1,3.0,"This is a very standard shower cap. It does the job, but it no different from the ones I have purchased over the years from various drugstores. If you are looking for a shower cap, this one is as good as any."
1,-1,3.0,"this is a cute shower cap. It comes in a little plastic envelope with a snap making it easy to tuck in a suitcase. The teal pattern is pleasant. The cap itself is unlined and made of rather crinkly plastic. The elastic is covered with white plastic. I've been growing out my hair and it is now past my shoulders. I was pleased that this cap was able to accommodate it all. The plastic is waterproof. the cap should fit most head sizes.

I use shower caps when airbrushing makeup and when actually painting the interior of my house as well as for showers and deep conditioning. This one certainly performs as well as any. the pattern is pretty but it is not especially comfortable or well made. especially considering the price point.  It does the job it was designed to do but the quality is on a par with the dollars store or discount beauty supplier."
1,-1,3.0,"This product was one of many in a birthday basket. I have not heard anything negative from the person who received the basket therefore, I am assuming it was good."
-1,1,4.0,"As a shaving cream, this performs well.  It's moisturizing and it washes off without leaving residue.  It works even with razors that are kind of dull (which is good, because I forget to change my razor out as often as I should) -- I didn't cut myself at all.

Because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

This does have a strong smell.  I kind of like it, but I have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  It's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  So if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away."
-1,1,5.0,I received the shampoo because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the result from only just one wash. it cleared out the dandruff without drying my hair out. My hair felt smooth and Fresh after just the first wash. I tried aveda spray before but it was useless and waste of money
-1,1,4.0,Good but kind of drying
-1,1,5.0,I am allergic to a lot of things. I occasionally get a red rash over my body after using some other body washes. This one is an exception. Not a single complain. Perfect!
-1,1,5.0,"It gets messy after the first few times, but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and very small amount of dandruff after less than two weeks of use."
1,-1,3.0,Good light scent. Have received complements from people that I smell nice after using it. 3 stars because bottle is kind of small for a shower gel (size compariso photo attached) and it doesnt really help me wake up in the morning like other products.
-1,1,4.0,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week.."
-1,1,5.0,"I was using this shampoo from six years and found helpful restoring hair and reducing dryness of psoriasis.
But it was discontinued from three years .Why I don't know .Then I used other psoriasis  shampoos ,which didn't help .scalp still dry and hair falling down. I bought on line but came in small bottle and was costly, and was looks like doublicate not the real."

-1,1,5.0,"For some reason, nowhere near me sells this. Amazon fixed this problem, and I'm now a happy fox."
-1,1,5.0,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."

-1,1,5.0,:)
-1,1,5.0,Loved the products however did think it was priced a little high wanted to get the lotion but the price with shipping and handling was way too much!
-1,1,5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again"
-1,1,5.0,"I've used this shampoo for years and loved it............. BUT.... the last bottles I bought at Big Lots were only $1.70 for 16ozs.  There's no way its worth $39 a bottle.  Who are you guys kidding? What a scam! There are plenty of other products out there that do a good job for far less money.
Use a nice conditioner (I still have several bottles left that I paid less than $2 for) and you'll still get nice results.  Bah-humbug for those scam artists trying to sell this for 10 times what it's worth."
-1,1,5.0,If they discontinued this scent I would go postal. <3
-1,1,5.0,"I love this scent, and it's no longer being made.
I'm always on the hunt for ""something like it.""
It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.

1,-1,3.0,"I just recently started shaving again with an electric razor after 40 years of blades. I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-Norelco-1150x-40-SensoTouch-2d-Electric-Shaver-Metallic-Blue/dp/B003V360NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue</a>&nbsp;and absolutely love it. Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. Ha!"

And the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is basically a loofa marketed to guys.  The only thing different from the female in your life's besides the color scheme is the flip side that has a rougher scrubber on it for tougher places on your body like the feet, elbows, etc., but that side just feels like an afterthought and I found myself cleaning those areas with the scrubbing side after awhile.

This does have a strong smell.  I kind of like it, but I have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  It's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  So if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away."

-1,1,5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again"
-1,1,5.0,"I've used this shampoo for years and loved it............. BUT.... the last bottles I bought at Big Lots were only $1.70 for 16ozs.  There's no way its worth $39 a bottle.

Use a nice conditioner (I still have several bottles left that I paid less than $2 for) and you'll still get nice results.  Bah-humbug for those scam artists trying to sell this for 10 times what it's worth."

I think the essence in this package is better but the overnight cream and moisturizer in the other package is much better.

I do not use their eye cream, though. Gave it away as it's just too heavy for my purposes and increases milia."

I kept it because I was almost out of my bottle but let them know it had arrived damaged. They were nice enough to replace my bottle and send a very brief apology. You can definitely buy this stuff anywhere, but there's some peace of mind that comes from knowing your supplier will take care of you."
-1,1,5.0,"Actually, at first I intended to order white musk 'lotion', not the body wash.

-1,1,5.0,"It was what my 16 year old grandson wanted,because he can not fine it in the stores. Please bring it

-1,1,4.0,"Love the product, except for the fact that TWO bottles have now broken after being dropped in the shower. The tops needs to be screwed off which I would change to a more friendly flip top which would not require three hands. The product is too expensive to  be wasted down the drain or watered down because the top keeps getting broken off (two different bottles)."
-1,1,5.0,Dove no longer manufactures this body wash so I was relieved to find it on Amazon. The price is ridiculous but since I could not find it anywhere else I bought it. This is the only body wash I can use that doesn't dry my skin and make me itchy. If you pair this with Dove's Cream Oil lotion you're good to go.
-1,1,5.0,"I continually get compliments on how wonderful I smell whenever I have used this product- especially when using it with the body lotion. I bought this product at Bath and Body during one of their annual sales a year ago and now they no longer carry it. However, other dealers have it online for $ 45 and the lotion for $45  up to 95? I don't know why Bath & Body stopped selling it."
-1,1,5.0,Would buy more of the body cream if moire was available.  This body cream is hard to come by.  I buy anytime I find on a site.  Lotion is easily available but the body cream is difficult to obtain.  This is my signature fragrance.

My hair is looking better and seems to be healthier but I am using the Reflection Chroma Thermique also so who knows which one is working or if it is the combination..I won't pay that price again, if it were cheaper I would keep using it but I am not going to keep using it at that price..Now that my hair is in better shape I think it will be okay, I had damaged it using bleach.."
-1,1,5.0,"This is my favorite body wash of all time. I love how my skin feels, the scent of it and that it comes in non-breakable bottles but, it is not available to purchase anymore. These last few bottles I was able to purchase were ridiculously overpriced yet, I still bought them. I don't understand why the company stopped making this product and would love to find something similar to replace this as my everyday body wash."
-1,1,5.0,"Can't get this in the US (not ever made here, as far as I know), and not in Canada apparently anymore either.  Pricey but it's an import...."
-1,1,5.0,I have a sensitive nose when it comes to strong scents and sensitive skin to harsh products so Philosophy seemed like my best bet. I love it. This scent is mild but sweet. Leaves skin so soft. The lotion helps to keep the mild scent all day.
1,-1,3.0,"I just recently started shaving again with an electric razor after 40 years of blades. I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-Norelco-1150x-40-SensoTouch-2d-Electric-Shaver-Metallic-Blue/dp/B003V360NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue</a>&nbsp;and absolutely love it. Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. Ha!"

-1,1,4.0,"If you share a bathroom with a female, be it a wife, girlfriend, daughter, are roommate, you know what a loofa is because it is most likely hanging from your shower head right now.  And the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is basically a loofa marketed to guys.  The only thing different from the female in your life's besides the color scheme is the flip side that has a rougher scrubber on it for tougher places on your body like the feet, elbows, etc., but that side just feels like an afterthought and I found myself cleaning those areas with the scrubbing side after awhile.  In the end the Ax Shower Tool does get the job done and basically you need to ask yourself, ""Do I want another loofa hanging on my showerhead?"""
-1,1,4.0,I like it and it smells good but the scent doesn't last long at all.
-1,1,4.0,"Finally seeing results.  But don't get the wrong idea.  This result-delay is probably not a CLEAN & CLEAR problem.  For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

No irritation, easy to use, and the salicylic acid is working to make considerable changes in his complexion."
-1,1,4.0,"Clean & Clear sure knows how to make a cleanser feel gentle.  It's not sudsy like a soap.  It's more like a lotion.  The scent was hard to pinpoint, but I'd say it's a bit like cucumber.  This has salicylic acid, folks, the stuff that's in acne treatment.  I should have known, I mean ""Clean & Clear,"" right? My face feels clean afterwards. The one star deduction is for the scent, which I don't think is the greatest."
-1,1,4.0,"I do.  I always tell the girls that.  Really, lipstick and mascara!  Nothing else is needed!  So, yes, I had the talk with the teenage girl again.  ""Stop putting the makeup junk all over your face!!!  Your face is beautiful!  Why make it all funny colors?""

She liked the way this one felt when she cleaned (all the gunk off) her face.  She said it didn't feel like it was all burning like one of our recent experiments.  (Don't ask, don't tell.  LOL.)  She said it felt more lotiony.

I hope this one works better at cleaning her face.  I wish she would stop putting stuff all over it."
-1,1,5.0,"This toothpaste is a translucent gel with the sweet flavor and fragrance of old-fashioned bubble gum.  It is green rather than pink, which seems just as odd to me as purple ketchup.

The convenient pump dispenses the correct pea-sized dose that is recommended for brushing.  Children should still be supervised to make sure that they don't swallow the toothpaste to avoid fluoride toxicity.

The plastic container stands upright and holds 4.4 oz. or 124 g.  It has a cap that is easy to remove and replace but which smears any excess toothpaste left on the pump dispenser.  The dispenser opens and closes automatically so that the cap is not needed in routine use.  The safety-sealed containers that I received have an expiration date 16 months from receipt.

Active ingredient:  Sodium fluoride 0.24% (0.14% w/v fluoride ion).

Inactive ingredients:  Sorbitol, water, hydrated silica, PEG-12, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate, flavor, sodium saccharin, mica, titanium dioxide, D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Blue No. 1."
-1,1,4.0,"This floss does feel softer in the hands. It is just as strong, doesn't shred and glides between teeth just as smoothly as original Glide.

I could do without the mint flavor. I don't taste the flavor at all, but it makes the floss smell medicinal, not so pleasant. Usually, mint floss is refreshing, but not here. I would like this floss without flavor and will try Glide Comfort Plus Unflavored next time."
1,-1,3.0,"I'm only giving this a neutral rating because it smelled lovely but arrived crushed, leaking and unable to be used. Very nice light fragrance - non irritating which is unusual as I tend to have a lot of allergies. This is not overpowering. Has an almost romantic and nostalgic fragrance."
-1,1,5.0,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it."
-1,1,5.0,"This lavender water is very floral and spicy, yet when it is dispersed as spray on our sheets, it is very delicate.  Such a pretty color, too.

It is not a sweet or cloying scent, and is a natural, clean and fresh scent.

Just to test its clarity, I sprayed it on my face.  It just evaporated as I expected it to, leaving no sticky feeling.

I do not have the Pre de Provence spray bottle, just picked up a small 8 ounce spray bottle from the drug store.  Any spray bottle with a very fine mister will do.

This is a plastic bottle."
1,-1,3.0,"I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms."
-1,1,4.0,"Who doesn't love the fragrance of lavender?  This is a large cellophane bag of the dried blooms, which look a bit like brown rice.  The fragrance is strong, even before opening the bag.  Little bowls of this placed around the house provide a lovely fresh atmosphere without being overpowering.  The 5.3 ounces is about two cups.

If you're looking for dried flower blooms for scented decorations, this isn't your product.  It's not pretty, but it does smell wonderful.  I'm waiting for someone to ask why I have a dish of rice on my coffee table!"
-1,1,5.0,"I never considered a scented water for ironing or steaming my clothes until I saw this product.  What a great idea!  I added this to my garment steamer as well as my steam iron and both impart a lively French Lavender scent that remains long enough to get noticed.  My bottle did not come with a sprayer but I guess this would be another way to use the product:  spritz over fabrics like couches, beds linens.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

In terms of potency, the product I received for this review has a very noticeable lavender scent.  It does not appear weak or understated at all.  Since others have had this concern, it does make me wonder about the company's QC.

Overall - this is a nice product which lends a nice fragrance to my clothing.  I would recommend it."

-1,1,5.0,"I purchased a bottle of this shampoo because it's my favorite, ever. But when it arrived it had been wrapped too tightly and the top of the bottle broke off during shipping. I kept it because I was almost out of my bottle but let them know it had arrived damaged. They were nice enough to replace my bottle and send a very brief apology. You can definitely buy this stuff anywhere, but there's some peace of mind that comes from knowing your supplier will take care of you."
-1,1,4.0,"Love the product, except for the fact that TWO bottles have now broken after being dropped in the shower. The tops needs to be screwed off which I would change to a more friendly flip top which would not require three hands. The product is too expensive to  be wasted down the drain or watered down because the top keeps getting broken off (two different bottles)."
-1,1,5.0,Would buy more of the body cream if moire was available.  This body cream is hard to come by.  I buy anytime I find on a site.  Lotion is easily available but the body cream is difficult to obtain.  This is my signature fragrance.
-1,1,4.0,"I would give it 5 stars but it is way over priced! My hair is looking better and seems to be healthier but I am using the Reflection Chroma Thermique also so who knows which one is working or if it is the combination..I won't pay that price again, if it were cheaper I would keep using it but I am not going to keep using it at that price..Now that my hair is in better shape I think it will be okay, I had damaged it using bleach.."
-1,1,5.0,"Can't get this in the US (not ever made here, as far as I know), and not in Canada apparently anymore either.  Pricey but it's an import...."
1,-1,3.0,"Obviously, cellulite is not affected by a brush. Simple biology reveals the massive flaws in this idea. If what one is truly seeking is to improve cellulite, one wants a cellulite creme with caffeine OR with any form of retinoid. Or a plastic surgeon. This whole topic was just explored on an episode of The Doctors.

However, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! One can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). This will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.

The brush is well-made, looks nice, and has held up well this week (it appears brand new even though it is hanging in my shower).

Overall, while one doesn't want to by this for the purposes of reducing cellulite (that's not how it works), it is phenomenal for exfoliating!"
-1,1,5.0,"I'm very pleased with this mitt. It is large enough to comfortably fit my hand, but not so large that I feel it was designed to wash a car. The soft side feels like it is made of microfiber, and is quite cushy and mild on my skin. The rough side is composed of fabric loops that are rough enough to get some serious scrubbing done, but not as rough as some loofah mitts I've used that feel rather uncomfortable (or even downright painful).

It's put together well with no loose seams, and has a small but usable loop so you can hang it up for proper drying.  All in all, an excellent mitt."
-1,1,5.0,"I got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results."
-1,1,4.0,"I think I may be in the minority here. I really love the ""clean"" feel of Listerine (a product that is heavily endorsed by my dentist and hygienist), and genuinely missed it here. But I also use ACT ... so, I am used to products that don't necessarily provide that exciting tingle (my dentist has me use Listerine in the morning and ACT before bed). So, I replaced my Listerine with this and while my mouth didn't feel as excitingly clean, it claims to protect enamel, so that might be a nice bonus.

After this bottle is gone, I plan on returning to Listerine (I supposed it is a part of my routine now ... and I am always loathe to deviate from the course of action my dentist plans for me). However, this seems to do no harm and could be great for those with a low-threshold for strong products like Listerine (there is a person in my family who does not use Listerine because they find it painful ... this would be ideal for her). So, if this is you, give it a try. (If you like it, then consult your dentist)."
-1,1,4.0,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years..."
-1,1,5.0,"After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor.  Our family doesn't floss much.  The dentist castigated me for this and I said, ""But I do floss!  Twice a year!"" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.  I tried to cut corners once and use the cold water that was still in it from the morning, and it was like cold needles shooting into my gums!"
-1,1,5.0,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!"
1,-1,3.0,"I have problems with my teeth so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse. I have tried a few of the Crest Pro Health products. This version is alcohol free and is geared toward people 50 and older but has the same active ingredient as the Pro Health Invigorating Clean Invigorating Mint  alcohol based mouth rinse. It does not have fluoride.

I wish Crest would better explain how this is different from the products geared toward people under fifty.  For instance people of any age can have plaque, bad breath and inflamed gums. I think most of the Crest mouth rinses work against these issues so what makes this special for people over 50.

I did find this sentence on the back label of the bottle. ""This rinse was selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.""  I am not sure what ""a unique sensation"" has to do with being over fifty.  If that is the only reason it seems like other Crest Pro Health alcohol free products would work the same.

I like the taste of this product. It does not have the bitter alcohol flavor that  many alcohol flavored mouth rinses have. I don't notice a unique sensation.

I am troubled that the only reason Crest lists for this being for people over 50 is it has no alcohol and has a unique sensation. For this reason I gave this three stars."
-1,1,5.0,"Over the last 52 years I have made demands on my body and backed it up with miracle products. I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy, somehow my body got confused - with opposite results, so I have flat, yet still frizzy, hair. In the meantime I'm at that ""I need a haircut"" stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it, so it's sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

I'm very pleased with the Tono&Guy (Liked the shampoo too, but that's another review) and my plump hair, now if my tummy would just get the memo I'd be set."
-1,1,4.0,"This product is dispensed from an aerosol can. On the face of it I thought it was a mousse product. Fortunately, I read the instructions. While the product didn't indicate that the can needed to be shaken, I shook it and then dispensed a small amount in the palm of my hand and worked it through my towel dried hair. I left it on for 3 minutes and then rinsed thoroughly. I lightly towel dried my hair again and blow dried my hair with a rounded hair brush starting at the roots. My hair looked as though it had more volume, but I subsequently repeated the process this morning and applied my regular mousse before styling. My hair looked better despite the initial benefits of just this conditioner alone."
-1,1,5.0,"To starts, I am so glad I checked the reviews here for the experience of others. Like a lot of others, I put this in my hair and left it, like one would do with a leave in product. And that was actually okay for my hair, since it's not that I have fine hair, but that I've cut it from being long and thick, to a shorter and thick hair style. A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don't get the desired effect.

But that's not how this product is designed to work. It's supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can't use any conditioner in her hair. She's at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.

This conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues. It also has a very nice citrus cent to it. This is so nice I may just keep buying this for her, as it's definitely made for her hair type more than my own."
-1,1,5.0,"I am in love with this conditioner. The foaming aerosol device is fun and easy to use. I have to use conditioner daily since I have very silky, straight hair that tangles really bad. My biggest issues with conditioner is that I use WAY too much. I don't really mean to, it just comes flying out of the bottle into my hand. I waste a lot of it. That doesn't happen with this aerosol foam formula. I press down on the top and the perfect amount comes foaming out. Awesome. This conditioner also washes out of my hair quickly. It doesn't feel heavy and thick like some other conditioners.

The conditioner itself smells amazing. It leaves a nice citrus aroma in your hair. Unfortunately, the scent does not last all day. After about an hour or so, I can no longer smell it. It does leave my hair feeling amazing. I didn't notice a huge volume improvement, but my hair is pretty thick to begin with. It did help with my frizz and my tangles. After using this conditioner, the brush runs through my hair very easily.

Overall, this conditioner is not perfect, but I love it. I would definitely buy more of this conditioner."
-1,1,4.0,"Easy to apply with minimal prep involved (you basically affix a strip to the tooth in need of soothing and let it sit for 10 minutes) these strips are good for medium grade and below tooth sensitivity issues. As far as results go your mileage will vary but I do have one tooth in particular with mild, persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice. The strip does tone done the sensation by approximately 50% in my estimation so not necessarily an insta-cure but good enough to be noticeable.

Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each. The strips also do not 'stick' very well to the tooth so you'll need to be patient during the 10 minutes of application and try not to talk or move your mouth around. Also, I really like the convenience of having each strip individually packed making it easy to keep one in your bag/wallet while you're out and about should you ever need one."
-1,1,4.0,These strips work to numb pain or cold sensitivity on teeth where the gum exposes a tiny bit of the dentin at the base of the tooth. Sometimes acidic foods can irritate this area and cause sensitivity. These strips are very easy to use. You just press one of the straps against the tooth and gum that is hurting and leave it in place for 10 minutes. I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days. I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again. I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour so that may contribute to the strips not lasting as long. But I still think they offer a definite benefit and start to work quickly. It Is a product that I will keep on hand from now on.
-1,1,5.0,"Great product. Will take a few weeks to see how it works, but I have sensitive teeth, and it hasn't made them worse, so fingers crossed. YMMV, of course."
-1,1,4.0,"I noticed a difference the next day, after I used these.  I used it on one side of my mouth, on my lower back teeth which is the most sensitive spot in my mouth.  The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

I am going to try these a week before my next dental cleaning, in January.  If I notice a difference, I will come back and change my review to 5 stars, and you will all be hearing about it!  For now, I recommend giving these a try."
-1,1,4.0,"A few years ago I was head butted by a pit bull while volunteering at an animal shelter. No damage according to my dentist but I do suffer from occasional sensitivity in the area where I was hit. I've used specialized toothpaste but the transient nature of the sensitivity makes it hard to justify.  These tabs do seem to provide relief. They are small and adhere without issue. Leave them on for ten minutes and abstain from eating or drinking for another half hour. The effect is supposed to last for up to a month.

So far these have provided relief and  are as effective as the toothpastes. They don't cover a large area and it takes some dexterity to get them in harder to reach places. I would check with a dentist first to make sure the problem tooth isn't crack or cavity. But all in all, a fast and effective way to get some relief from sensitivity."
-1,1,5.0,"These seem to actually work. They help bring down tooth sensitivity a bit more effectively that just tooth sensitive tooth past. They're more concentrated, and you leave them in your mouth for a longer period of time (10 minutes). They are just small strips, meant for applying to portions of your mouth. It's not a whole mouth piece for all your teeth. The directions mention it might take a few treatments to get the desired level of sensitivity relief, with at least one day between treatments."
-1,1,5.0,"I like the Pantene Color protect shampoo, but the conditioner that goes with it is not a great match with my hair. Tends to leave me looking flat and a feeling a little dry, so I use a couple of other brands in rotation. This Pantene Volume version may very well be the answer. It smells great, just light and sort of spring fresh to me, not a heavy perfume. It rinsed out clean, but my very thick hair was still tangle free while wet. Once dry, my hair looks great! I have thick, lush hair that reaches the middle of my back in a blunt cut - no layers here. The wrong conditioner can make my hair look like a curtain. Nobody wants that. My hair is shiny, floaty and looks like I spent more than three minutes brushing it this morning. I did not. I'm not only surprised, I am really happy. I'll totally buy this in the future."
-1,1,4.0,"Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I'm 50). It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.

All in all, I think this is a pretty good conditioner, but it may work better for someone with younger hair who doesn't need so much in the way of shine enhancement."
-1,1,4.0,"This is nice, rich conditioner and great for detangling, though I would prefer less fragrance. It did not interfere with my curls, either. You don't need to use much, and you do need to rinse well."

-1,1,4.0,"Love the scent of this very large bar.  It lathers well too but the dried botanicals can be too rough for sensitive skin.  When I lathered up with just bar in hand, I found it uncomfortably scratchy on my lower legs near my shins where there's not much fat or muscle.  When I used a wash cloth, nylon shower puff or a nylon soap bag I didn't notice any irritation.  So, for my sensitive skin, I would probably skip this bar."
-1,1,4.0,"At 5.2 ounces, this is a substantial bar of soap!  Its hard to describe the fragrance; Im inclined to say that it smells like Mens cologne  a blend of citrus and spice.  While the fragrance is strong when you lather up, it leaves only a hint of scent once youve rinsed off.  This soap lathers well and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  Its non-drying and doesnt irritate my skin; there are also no rough exfoliating bits like some of the other Pre de Provence soaps have.  This soap does not dissolve like Alka-Seltzer  it lasts much longer than your average drugstore brand soap.

Bottom Line:  Rich lather, non-drying, gender-neutral fragrance"
-1,1,4.0,"I was a little disappointed in this soap because it just didn't have a strong enough Patchouli scent.
If you like to keep scented soaps in your lingerie drawer for a short time before using them to wash with, take this soap and go straight to the shower or bath.
That old fashioned way of scenting your clothes won't work with this one.
You will, however, really appreciate it in terms of cleaning your skin without stripping down all of the natural oils that keep us nice and soft. Patchouli is also a terrific scent for any gender. Even though the fragrance is not strong, a light Patchouli does come across while you're bathing.
The generously-sized bar lasts a nice long time."
-1,1,4.0,"I love Pre de Provence bar soaps, and I love sandalwood.  By reading lots of reviews, I notice that many people do not like potent scents, and prefer light, delicate or unobtrusive fragrances.  I am not one of them.  I don't particularly like heavy, sweet and cloying scents, but I do love to breathe in intense, True fragrances.  (I say all this not to disrespect those who like unscented or light scents, but to let you know where my rating is coming from.)

I wanted to take a deep breath with my nose right up on this large bar of sandalwood and be able to say, ""Ahhh, sandalwood!""  No, that did not happen.  Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.

I have a bar of Plantlife Sandalwood soap that I bought about six weeks ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sandalwood-100-Pure-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B00112DRHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sandalwood 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.

So, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.

A word about the size of this 250g bar:  If you have long fingers or large hands, you will be able to grasp this bar easily.  If you have small hands, you might be better off with the 200g bar,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Shea-Butter-Enriched-Artisanal-French-Soap-Bar-200-g-Traditional-Fragrance-Sandalwood/dp/B001UFZOMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Sandalwood</a>, or the soap on a rope,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Soap-On-a-Rope-Sandalwood-200-Gram/dp/B074QWY7CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Soap On a Rope, Sandalwood, 200 Gram</a>.

-1,1,4.0,"I really like this soap, but I have to say that Shea Butter scent dominates and mutes the sandalwood scent. I love a strong, earthy sandalwood, but this is not that. It is more of a soapy perfume with a hint of sandalwood. That aside, the large bar lathers up richly and when it is finally rinsed off, it leaves me feeling refreshed and clean. It doesn't irritate my skin, but like other Pre de Provence soaps, it cleans so well that it can leave it feeling a little dry. I would definitely get it again, but just wish it smelled more strongly of sandalwood.

-1,1,4.0,"Oh my, this is one of the soaps I new arrived the moment I opened my mailbox because I could smell it already.  Then I took it out of the package, put it in my soap holder in my bathroom and when I went to bed at night, I could smell it just walking up my stairs.  The strength of the smell did die down after a couple days.  And about putting it in my soap holder, this bar is so big it barely even fit, much bigger than your standard bar for better or worse.  Better in that it will likely last almost twice as long.  Worse in that it is almost too big to hold (and probably is for people with small hands; I will not name names).  I guess I never put much thought into what Pomegranate smelled like, and now that I have taken a long strong whiff of it, I cannot say it is my favorite smell.  But more importantly it does leave me feeling clean without drying my skin and that is really all you can ask of your soap."
-1,1,5.0,"I usually don't like fruity or food scented body products. I don't want to smell like birthday cake or strawberries etc. I decided to give this one a try though and am happy with it. It has a soft floral scent on top of the pomegranate and it smells really good. More feminine than fruity. The little bits in it act like a soft body scrub, so you can use the bar directly on your skin and it lathers up nicely and gives some exfoliation benefits, too. The latter is more of a nice milky/creamy lather and doesn't dry out my skin. It doesn't feel like there's a soap film left behind on me and my skin doesn't feel tight. I don't think the scent lasts on my skin and that's ok with me."
-1,1,4.0,"This seems to be a pretty high quality soap as far as feel goes, and how slowly it disintegrates.  However, I do not love it because I do not like the smell that it has.  It seems way too close to that typical ""man's smell"" that disgraces so many products and dudes all over the world.  I mean, it's definitely a higher end version of this smell than, say, Axe body spray or something terrible like that, but it's in that general realm.  It is possible that this smell comes from a real style soap like this and is later stolen by all the cheap brands, but for better or worse, I still don't like it due to all the cheap brands out there using it."

This is definitely larger than most finer soaps and the scent doesn't linger too long but it doesn't go away that quickly either. I would give this soap 4 stars if it weren't for the horrible scent."
-1,1,4.0,"I have the tiare scent of this bar soap. It's not a scent that I can easily break down. It makes me think of brown sugar, lavender and coco butter. The scent is way too sweet for me, but it doesn't linger long.

The soap itself is smooth and lathers pretty well. It is very soft, feels nice on the skin and does actually clean you off. I found that I needed to rinse a little more than usual to get the last residue of it off though. (We don't have soft water) I like this, but I am not convinced it's any better than a regular soap for a lot less money."

I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-Norelco-1150x-40-SensoTouch-2d-Electric-Shaver-Metallic-Blue/dp/B003V360NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue</a>&nbsp;and absolutely love it. Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. Ha!"
1,-1,3.0,"I'm only giving this a neutral rating because it smelled lovely but arrived crushed, leaking and unable to be used. Very nice light fragrance - non irritating which is unusual as I tend to have a lot of allergies. This is not overpowering. Has an almost romantic and nostalgic fragrance."
-1,1,5.0,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it."
-1,1,5.0,"This lavender water is very floral and spicy, yet when it is dispersed as spray on our sheets, it is very delicate.  Such a pretty color, too.

It is not a sweet or cloying scent, and is a natural, clean and fresh scent.

Just to test its clarity, I sprayed it on my face.  It just evaporated as I expected it to, leaving no sticky feeling.

I do not have the Pre de Provence spray bottle, just picked up a small 8 ounce spray bottle from the drug store.  Any spray bottle with a very fine mister will do.

This is a plastic bottle."
1,-1,3.0,"I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms."
-1,1,4.0,"Who doesn't love the fragrance of lavender?  This is a large cellophane bag of the dried blooms, which look a bit like brown rice.  The fragrance is strong, even before opening the bag.  Little bowls of this placed around the house provide a lovely fresh atmosphere without being overpowering.  The 5.3 ounces is about two cups.

If you're looking for dried flower blooms for scented decorations, this isn't your product.  It's not pretty, but it does smell wonderful.  I'm waiting for someone to ask why I have a dish of rice on my coffee table!"
-1,1,5.0,"I never considered a scented water for ironing or steaming my clothes until I saw this product.  What a great idea!  I added this to my garment steamer as well as my steam iron and both impart a lively French Lavender scent that remains long enough to get noticed.  My bottle did not come with a sprayer but I guess this would be another way to use the product:  spritz over fabrics like couches, beds linens.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

In terms of potency, the product I received for this review has a very noticeable lavender scent.  It does not appear weak or understated at all.  Since others have had this concern, it does make me wonder about the company's QC.

Overall - this is a nice product which lends a nice fragrance to my clothing.  I would recommend it."
-1,1,5.0,"This toothpaste is a translucent gel with the sweet flavor and fragrance of old-fashioned bubble gum.  It is green rather than pink, which seems just as odd to me as purple ketchup.

The convenient pump dispenses the correct pea-sized dose that is recommended for brushing.  Children should still be supervised to make sure that they don't swallow the toothpaste to avoid fluoride toxicity.

The plastic container stands upright and holds 4.4 oz. or 124 g.  It has a cap that is easy to remove and replace but which smears any excess toothpaste left on the pump dispenser.  The dispenser opens and closes automatically so that the cap is not needed in routine use.  The safety-sealed containers that I received have an expiration date 16 months from receipt.

-1,1,4.0,"I love essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of it. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light). Nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no cure.

I did two test runs:

Did no nail prep. Just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.

Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: very small chipping to start on dominate hand.
Day 3: chipping on 85% of nails

I remove all polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real gel nails. (Push back cuitical, buf nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great
Day 3: chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: removed

Because I can get a much longer wear than my regular polish I say this is a win. A girl (or guy) that tylically gets a fairly long wear with regular polish may get a 5-7 day wear but 14 days may be a streach!

Beautiful color!!!"
-1,1,4.0,"The polish looks amazing when you first apply it. It has a beautiful shine to it and goes on so smoothly. And compared to my other essie polishes I've used for the past few years, it does seem to stay a little longer without chipping. But I've yet to get 14 days of chip-free wear from it. I can usually get about 3 days before I start to see the first chip. I then touch it up with some polish and put a new topcoat on and that will get me another day, but after that it's chipping badly enough that I need to redo my nails. It's a pretty polish and worth picking up if it's available in a color you love, but it's by far not at all the most chip-free polish I've used."
-1,1,4.0,"Review update:

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips. It can be touched up effectively."
-1,1,5.0,"I purchased a bottle of this shampoo because it's my favorite, ever. But when it arrived it had been wrapped too tightly and the top of the bottle broke off during shipping. I kept it because I was almost out of my bottle but let them know it had arrived damaged. They were nice enough to replace my bottle and send a very brief apology. You can definitely buy this stuff anywhere, but there's some peace of mind that comes from knowing your supplier will take care of you."
-1,1,4.0,"Love the product, except for the fact that TWO bottles have now broken after being dropped in the shower. The tops needs to be screwed off which I would change to a more friendly flip top which would not require three hands. The product is too expensive to  be wasted down the drain or watered down because the top keeps getting broken off (two different bottles)."

-1,1,5.0,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."
