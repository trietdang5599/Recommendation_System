The re - mastering was done very well and does n't seem to take anything away from the original flair ; it does not unduly alter anything either . Good job . It sounds great . It really brings out Buck 's and Don 's vocals . Occasionally , I listen to it , my mind reaching to much younger years . In the late sixties , I had the good fortune to meet Buck and Don after a life performance I attended . What great guys they were . This CD does them justice .

His records sounded so clean and featured twangy Fender guitars . His band leader , Don Rich was a model of restrained professionalism . Clean and accurate picking , not fast or flashy . Buck was an outstanding singer and his two part harmonies were his trademark . All these songs were No . 1s on the country charts and date from Act Naturally in 1963 to 1988 's Streets of Bakersfield with Dwight Yoakum featuring Flaco Jiminez on accordian . WOW ! What a great CD this is . There is n't a bad cut on it ! If you only want one Buck Owens CD , this is the one ! It 's too bad most younger people only remember him as a cornfield clown on Hee - Haw , because Buck Owens was truly one of the greatest country stars in its history .","summary":"The best Buck Owens CD to own!

This twenty track collection hits most of the highlights of Yoakam 's nearly two decades as a performer . Starting with the Johnny Horton cover of \" Honky Tonk Man \" from his debut through two tracks from his 2003 release POPULATION : ME , Yoakam has had a major impact on country music . If you 're looking for a cheaper alternative to Rhino 's 2002 box set REPRISE PLEASE BABY , this is a winner from beginning to end . The only disappointment is that with a running time of just under 70 minutes , they could have added the only two top 10 singles missing from this set : \" Always Late With Your Kisses ( from 1987 's HILLBILLY DELUXE ) and \" I Got You \" ( from 1988 's BUENAS NOCHES FROM A LONELY ROOM ) . VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED The mp3 download version of this album has different cover art and eliminates the final two tracks from the 2003 album POPULATION ME , making this an all - Warner Bros. collection . ]","summary":"Terrific Single Disc Collection","unixReviewTime":1101513600,"image":null}

I guess a few purists will ignore him , but not many - there are n't many country singers now whose music owes so much to tradition while still selling in large quantities . This compilation covers the whole of career to date , including eight tracks from his compilation of eighties hits ( Just looking for a hit ) , eight tracks from his compilation of nineties hits ( Last chance for 1,000 years ) , Things change ( from A long way home ) , I want you to want me ( from Tomorrow 's sounds today ) and two tracks from Population me ( Late great golden state , Back of your hand ) . Thus , there is no new material here , but this compilation is the strongest single CD of Dwight 's music so far released . Inevitably , some classic songs have been omitted , one example being The heart that I own . Most of the songs here are originals but Dwight has recorded many fine covers , represented here by Little sister and Suspicious minds ( both Elvis Presley ) and Crazy little thing called love ( Queen ) . If you only want one CD of Dwight 's music , make it this one .","summary":"Strongest single CD yet released of Dwight's music","unixReviewTime":1094947200,"image":null}

Philip Bailey has always been a whiner and just because \" If You Leave Me Now \" is a Chicago classic does n't mean that any version outside the original is accecptable . For me , this live cut just sucks . Sorry , ca n't really articulate any other word or \" ism \" to describe my feelings abot this and the other live track , \" After The Love Is Gone . \" The latter is n't a Chicago song at all and is present on this collection because of Bill Champlin . I would have liked to see unedited versions of the \" singles \" on this collection but we are dealing with Rhino , the edit kings .

That has always been the case with love songs collections as well , because there are just so many of them that really do n't seem to showcase enough material that really reflects the best of those love songs . That just is n't the case with Chicago , and their great music collections , because they definitely hit the nail of the head very , very well . Their music has endured extraordinarily well for over thirty - five years . There have been a few successful hits collections that really reflects Chicago , and this one is just no acception . Chicago 's 2005 Love Songs collection , consists of their most well recieved love songs from thier long - time career . The album conists of 18 tracks , and a couple of live rendidtions of classics never before released on any Chicago album as well . The collection contains a lot of great tracks inclding You 're The Inspiration , Will You Still Love Me , Beginnings , as well as classics like Colour My World Hard Habit To Break , and Hard To Say I 'm Sorry . The album also includes a couple of live recording with Phillip Bailey from Earth , Wind & Fire fame , on versions of If You Leave Me Now , and the Earth , Wind & Fire classic , After The Love Is Gone , which really sounds delightful and lively . While there love songs albums that really do n't sell very well , or just miss out on a lot of great songs , Chicago 's Love Songs really displays very , very well within not just its price , but the vast number of classic Chicago tracks here . While many not at all be interested in this collection , it really is a good reflection of Chicago 's best ballads .","summary":"Valentine's Horns","unixReviewTime":1106611200,"image":null}

Grindle","reviewText":"So much controversy has been generated regarding the creative merrit of this album that I truly believe it 's many enjoyable qualities have been forgotton . Not only that but their are many excellent creative elements to this music as well that are even still ignored to this day for the same reason . So instead of concentrating on this album for what it is n't I 'll focus this review on what it is . Throughout his career it 's important to understand that George Benson was always on the cutting edge of vocal soul - pop \/ jazz . Even his earliest albums such as&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/The - George - Benson - Cookbook \/ dp \/ B0012GMW5W \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">The George Benson Cookbook<\/a>&nbsp;featured Benson singing pop songs of the day so I am not going to criticize him on this album for doing what he 'd always done . The main thing that makes the difference here is that George Benson is modernizing his poppy funk - jazz here for the mid 70 's and in terms of music , song selections and just his renowned playing and singing this album certainly takes the cake there . It 's not very long in it 's entirety but the fairly long cuts that are here are all excellent each in different ways and aside from two one vocal number the instrumentals that dominate this recording give enough time for everyone , especially Benson to strech out instrumentally . No matter how many times I 've heard the title song of this album , as far as I know one of only a select few instrumentals associated with Bobby Womack and aside from the rather pretty melody these days I actually really enjoy the bluesy sort of licks gets on the final verses of the song . After having heard the original of \" This Masquerade \" on Leon Russell's&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Carney \/ dp \/ B000002U04 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Carney<\/a>&nbsp;it gives new meaning to this one . Leon 's had a deep bayou flavor to it wheras George Bensosn presents the song as something of an American pop standard with the darkness of the melody baught up to the surface even more along with George 's guitar - scating signiture almost making the song into a Benson original as opposed to an interpretation . In fact the only Benson original here is the instrumetal \" So This Is Love ? \" which , much like \" Lady \" and the Jose Feliciano cover \" Affirmation \" all get a great balance between soul - jazz , funk and R&B with a tempo and rhythm that variates enough to keep it really interesting and involving . \" Six To Four \" is a great pop \/ funk that 's a bit more uptempo and upbeat than the rest of the album and provides a nice change of pace . This album , all and all is not altogether as pop oriented as you might expect despite Claus Ogerman 's flowery string arrangements and the upfront melodies and it actually serves it 's purpose very well in that regard . There are plenty of very musical licks from George , Phil Upchurch and everyone else involved in the making of this album so it 's not just a commercial triumph for Benson but he did n't totally compromise himself artistically either .","summary":"Benson In A Masquerade","unixReviewTime":1273708800,"image":null}

But the guitar work on that particular song is nothing compared to what he throws down on the excellent ( and proper jazz ) songs , \" Affirmation \" and \" So This Is Love ? \" But those two are just my favourites . All six tunes are great and this is another of those CDs I put on repeat anytime I play it . One listen is very rarely ever enough . Great production by the celebrated Tommy LiPuma with the orchestra arranged and conducted by the equally legendary Claus Ogerman . It rarely gets any better .

It introduced a style of jazz that was inflected with r&b stylings that made it appealing to a mass audience who necessarily did n't like the genre . The album hit number one on the Top 200 & r&b charts and stayed at number one on the jazz charts for over a year . The album was spurred on by Mr. Benson 's smooth and elegant cover of \" This Masquerade \" which peaked at number 10 and went on to win the 1976 Grammy for Record of the Year . But in addition to that great track , the album had five other gems including the appropriately titled title track which has a light , airy Latin vibe , the straight jazz of \" Six To Four \" and the sophistication of \" Lady \" .

So when this album came out , in all it 's velvet splendor - it sported a velvet cover , but no single to back it up . After 45 years , I finally downloaded and listened to it , and there were some songs that could have been singles , although they departed from the ' formula ' because they went in a slightly ' country ' direction , an idea from one of the non brother members of the band . The 5 piece band was disintegrating with Robin leaving the group after this release\/   They would come back stronger in the 70 's , but they kept on recording up until the death of the twins . The only song that may be familiar is First of May , but the music and lyrics are top notch . The boys were finding their own voices and style . But when you consider all the good music coming out in ' 69 - Abbey Road , The who , the San Francisco sound was coining to flourish on the charts , this one , probably also because of it 's cost ' was ignored . Maybe that 's why it 's so endearing now , considering that the guys were Justine Beiber and Miley Cyrus 's age when they produced this .

It was by far their most ambitious release and was had a red - flocked cover and included a poster and sticker . At a certain point the title \" Masterpeace \" was considered . The band was still a 5 - piece band at the beginning of the recordings , but before the release of the album in 1969 , guitarist Vince Melouney had left the group . Though not a direct concept album there are themes about the ship Odessa that runs though the songs . Apart from some long , mostly instrumental orchestral pieces , the music is not really that different from the group 's previous releases . To be regarded as a real classic I find the album too uneven , with too many average songs . There are of course a lot songs , too , that ranks with the very best of their early works . I have always liked their music best without the big arrangements that often burdened good songs too much . Simple songs with great melodies like , \" Sudddenly \" , \" You 'll Never See My Face Again \" and \" I Laugh in Your Face \" are still my favourites . I also used to like \" Marley Purt Drive \" , but it seems the songs has n't aged that well . Among the classic ballads \" Lamplight \" is outstanding , and \" Melody Fair \" and \" First of May \" are both great songs . This 3 CD version contains both mono and stereo versions of the original album , and the third CD contains some very interesting alternate versions along with some previously unreleased songs . Many of these are almost as good as the well - known versions , and a few maybe even better ; I especially like the alternate mix of \" You 'll Never See My Face Again \" . The song \" Barbara Came to Stay \" , is the same tune as \" Edison \" , with different lyrics , and also one of the great additions . For fans of the group , this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums , of course is must . Great reproduction of the original cover and a fine informative booklet too .","summary":"The Bee Gees' Masterpeace","unixReviewTime":1240358400,"image":null}

Released at the height of their first popularity and the start of their ultimate eighteen - month breakup , these three musicians , barely out of their teens , produced their only double studio album . Originally coated in a red velvet cover , this is one of the most extravagant re - releases to date . Originally seventeen songs , varying from the near operatic , \" Odessa ( City On The Black Sea ) \" to country flavored tunes like , \" Marley Purt Drive \" and \" Give Your Best \" , the Gibbs cover nearly every style of pop music available , including rock , orchestral , country and R&B. \n\n Originally slated to be titled , \" An American Opera \" or \" Masterpeace \" , this double album epitomizes the height of talent of the Bee Gees boundless creativity . In addition to two new studio songs , \" Pity \" and \" Nobody 's Someone \" , there are alternate and demo mixes that will surprise in their originality , beat and alternate verses . \" Edison \" , \" Lamplight \" , First Of May \" and \" Whisper , Whisper \" all are given special treatment , sometimes twice . \" Whisper , Whisper \" is actually Part Two , a welcome addition to a song that originally ended too quickly on a fast , rock driven pace . Of the three discs ( 57 songs ) , the stereo had been remixed \/ remastered to absolute , crystal clear perfection , bringing out all the muffled sounds that the original LP contained . The Mono mixes present the songs with emphasis on different vocals and instruments , while the third disc contains all the previously unreleased material . Fan Joe Brennan of website \" Gibb Songs \" has this great explanation of Stereo vs. Mono recordings :   \" Odessa was recorded on 1 - inch 8 - track tape reels . Each of the 8 tracks can be played separately , and each might have the input from one or more microphones . Each of the 8 could be recorded at different times and places ( like New York and London ) , or erased and re - recorded . To make stereo , you have to mix down to 2 tracks , and for mono , mix down to 1 track . While doing this you get to decide how relatively loud each track should be . The source is the same 8 track master . Mono was for old record players , and for AM radio , which was where you heard the latest tunes on your transistor radio or car radio \" . With three discs , a poster , extensive liner notes , photographs of the group , handwritten lyrics , single covers and reel - to - reel listings , a T - Shirt and a sticker all enclosed in a nifty red velvet covered box , this limited edition is a fan and collector 's dream .","summary":"Masterpiece!

This album is more of a pop - rock album , but with some unusual instrumentation and deep , dark , and profound subject matter not often found in mainstream music ( even during that time ) . Songs like \" Edison \" and the title track are dark and haunting , while ones like \" Melody Fair \" and \" Suddenly \" are somewhat less lyrically profound , but all of the songs are extremely well - written and performed .","summary":"Before there was disco. . .","unixReviewTime":1194307200,"image":null}

That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my , oh my- -those songs . I do n't know what the rift was over the band 's direction that temporarily broke them up ( a family affair , you see ) , but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious , inglorious Sixties . It was their last of that decade , and everything they 'd done previous to it , great as it may have been , was merely prelude . In England ODESSA was released as a red - velvet two - LP box set ; in the States as a red - velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster - at - sea insert . You could put the thing on your coffee table ( or floor , or kitchen counter ) and let it speak for itself , or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean . Okay , that may be overstating it , but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers ' finest compositions , ranging from the story - telling prog - rock of the title track ( the cello solo is an ingenious touch ) to the lighter - than - air , lovely ' Melody Fair ' to the oboe - chugged , acoustic ' Suddenly ' ( Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor ) to the desperately haunted ' Sound Of Love ' . Heck , they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one , the prescient globalists ! ! And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot ! You want goofy instead ? Okay , ' Give Your Best ' , and ' Never Say Never Again ' ! There ! These guys are awesome ! Now , stop me before I start raving about how incredible CUCUMBER CASTLE is ! !","summary":"Red Velvet Diamond","unixReviewTime":1074643200,"image":null}

Now available on a single CD , it marks the end of the sixties period for the Bee Gees . This was an important time for the Gibbs ' who were maturing ( at ages 19 and 21 ) and already millionaires . The music was conceptual and starting with the title track , it delivers with powerful orchestration and emotional , lyrical simplicity . It is a skewed look at a fabled seafarer lost at sea and emotionally destitute . At least , that 's what the project started out to be . Somewhere during the recordings , egos flared and tempers snapped , so what you ended up with is a collection of half Bee Gees conceptual songs and half individual Gibb contributions . It is still a remarkable recording ! \n Stand - out cuts are \" Marley Purt Drive \" that could have been recorded by \" The Band \" and \" Melody Fair \" , a single in some countries and a well covered track . Most of the other tracks deal with period issues like , drugs , sex , rock ' n roll , psychodelia and why not ? Producer Stigwood unwittingly fueled the tensions by choosing \" First Of May \" as the A - Side single instead of B - Side \" Lamplight \" , which was just as strong . Regardless , the final outcome is a conceptual album filled with an orchestrally sweeping moodiness aligned with perfect harmonies and lyrics envied by everyone . This is one of the few albums of the period with orchestral solos with the Gibbs providing the chorus . It is monumental .","summary":"Beatles Were White - Bee Gees Were Red","unixReviewTime":991872000,"image":null}

Some might like it as it is a nice piece but contained way to much obviously contrived \" music \" in an attempt to lead one 's thoughts . Composed by someone who does not seriously understand what meditation needs . Suggestive little \" ditties \" in an endless chain does not make for or assist meditation , on the contrary it is actuality a hindrance . Meditation is a journey to endless personal simplification . Motionless , silent , unhindered , unending , evolving inner space where love , compassion and understanding permeate . The second piece with passive waves and resonant tones would have been much better except for the interjection of vocals that are identifiable as a human mostly female voice . In places the voice is almost acceptable but for most of the time it has to much personality and attitude . The brain wave sync track is great . The heavy breathing is ridiculous and distracting .

Sherwin","reviewText":"England Dan & John Ford Coley \" were an American pop rock duo composed of Danny Wayland ` England Dan ' Seals and John Edward ` John Ford ' Coley . Native Texans , the duo released eleven albums and nine singles in their career and are best known for their 1976 single , ` I 'd Really Love to See You Tonight , ' a number 2 pop hit and number 1 Adult Contemporary hit . After they disbanded , Seals began performing as Dan Seals and launched a country music career through the 1980s which produced 11 No . 1 hits . \" Another reviewer writes that England Dan & John Ford Coley 's music was along the lines of \" light pop \" with \" a touch of folk ; \" and I agree ! These five tracks are some of their very best music ; I love the way they performed so well ! England Dan & John Ford Coley could harmonize flawlessly and their melodies were easy on the ear and memorable as well . \" I 'd Really Love to See You Tonight \" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and it still sounds great in our time ! \" Nights Are Forever Without You \" is a little masterpiece that is timeless ; it has great electric guitar work and the arrangement overall is very strong . They cover Todd Rundgren 's \" Love Is the Answer \" so well that Todd would surely approve and \" It 's Sad to Belong \" is very poignant . The track set ends with England Dan & John Ford Coley performing their awesome \" We 'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again ; \" this is yet another evergreen classic that I could never tire of hearing ! Big fans of England Dan & John Ford Coley will probably have most if not all of these songs already , so I think this music is best geared toward more casual fans and people just discovering their artistry . True , it 's very sad that Dan Seals passed away all too young ; but he does live on through his music . I highly recommend the beautiful songs of England Dan & John Ford Coley .","summary":"England Dan & John Ford Coley: their music still amazes me","unixReviewTime":1354320000,"image":null}

This somewhat extended version , recorded live in Japan , has , if anything , even more energy than the original . Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple 's catalogue , the song chronicles an actual event . In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux , Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones . During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4 , a fan set off a flare gun , setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground . The flames and smoke drifted over the lake , while the members of Deep Purple watched . The band then had to scramble for a venue to record \" Machine Head \" in , and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel . The song is quite an accurate piece of history , and definitely one of the heaviest , most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded . The song has appeared in various versions ( the most amusing is from Pat Boone 's \" In a Metal Mood , \" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar ) on many albums . I love live music , and highly endorse this version , and I also recommend \" Machine Head \" ( the \" Best Hits \" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price . ) One thing 's certain , though : no musical library should be without this staple .","summary":"Flames From Switzerland To Japan","unixReviewTime":1271203200,"image":null}

Their music is awesome ! \" Summer Breeze \" has a terrific soft rock flavor to it ; this mellow tune could n't have been done any better and it remains a classic song . Like \" Summer Breeze , \" \" Get Closer \" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and just one listen will tell you why -- this sweet tune is catchy and very well performed by Seals & Crofts . \" Hummingbird \" is easy on the ear and \" Diamond Girl , \" as mentioned above , was one of their biggest hits ever . The five tracks end with Seals & Crofts performing the poignant \" We May Never Pass This Way ( Again ) ; \" it 's very impressive ! This is not only an excellent introduction to Seals & Crofts ; it 's also great for the rather casual fan who may not have all of these tracks already -- this music is here for download !

Also , two weeks before those concerts , a member of the Monkees touring crew recorded one of their concerts , probably for his own use . As far as I know , these four concerts are the only recordings of Monkees concerts from the 1960s that exist . Unfortunately , the exact same songs were played in the exact same order at all four shows . Which is not to say that the concerts are exactly the same . The Monkees make different mistakes at each of the concerts . Sometimes they sing the wrong lyrics , sometimes they play the wrong notes . And there are often technical problems with the microphones and instruments . Probably the major difference other than the mistakes is in the ad libs that the Monkees say during the concerts . They even occasionally ad lib a few lines from songs like \" Singin ' in the Rain \" , \" There 's No Business Like Show Business \" and \" Act Naturally \" . So , is it worth owning copies of all four concerts ? Not really , unless you 're an absolute Monkees fanatic . Of course , I own this collection , so I guess you know where I stand .","summary":"Wasn't that great, folks?","unixReviewTime":1172188800,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/411jkdLyXVL._SY88.jpg"]}

For many , this is the only Yes song they 've ever heard - well , this and \" Owner Of A Lonely Heart \" - but it 's arguably the best distillation of everything good about Yes . As was the case with the Doors ' \" Light My Fire , \" many of us first heard the edited 45 rpm version back in ' 72 , only to find there was a version twice as long on the album . Come to think of it , \" Roundabout \" dashes through the door \" Light My Fire \" had opened five years previously . Both employ a prominent Classical - sounding organ riff along with Spanish guitar scales . However , next to \" Roundablut , \" \" Light My Fire \" sounds positively earthbound ( not that that 's a bad thing ) . Maybe the Doors and Yes should have swapped lead singers , just as an experiment .

For some reason , I have heard billie jean by Michael Jackson on the radio enough times for the song to grow on me . I m taking it that billie jean by Michael Jackson symbolizes the journey of a man coming to terms with being the father of a woman who became pregnant at an extremely young age ( I m guessing a teenager ) due to the lyrics she is just a girl . He does not want to believe that he is the father , but he sees that he probably is due to singing about looking at the babys eyes that remind him of his own eyes . From my humble opinion , Billie jean by Michael Jackson still does touch on a relevant issue today because the common societal message that is still being sent is that every woman who is someone becomes a mother , and I do believe that many teenage females subconsciously take in this message and internalize it . I just happen to have made my own decision on what I was going to do after my teenage years when I was tasked with helping my adoptive mother look after the younger children in her care . I have an open mind when it comes to teenage mothers because I myself was born to a woman who had just turned 16 8 days before my entrance into this world . However , that is all that I m going to say for now for a compelling song that touches on a topic that is not going to go away anytime soon .","summary":"classic Michael Jackson pop song","unixReviewTime":1420675200,"image":null}

I listen to radio mostly and frequently I get tired of the same stuff and definitely tired of the over - played stuff ( even if it 's a great beat like Lady Gaga 's \" Poker Face \" ) . I 've never heard of Franz Ferdinand and I first heard \" Take me out \" on Amazon . The more I review songs the more I 'm aware of my alternative music tastes ( especially alternative music reminiscent of 1990 's alternative ) . For me , good alt - music has a rock beat with a twist -- something different , unexpected , experimental even . I think this can be subtle or obvious and very subjective definitely ( in the eye of the beholder or the ear in this case ) . Sometimes a repetitive beat is annoying ( one reason modern country music does n't do it for me ) ; but sometimes it 's classic ( like Elvis Costello 's \" Pump it up , \" Chuck Berry 's \" Johnny B. Goode , \" or Elvis Presley \" That 's Alright Mama \" and even some old - skanky - country like Hank Williams ' \" I 'm so lonesome I could cry\"--old - skanky - country is a term of endearment made up entirely by me ) . By no means am I comparing \" Take me out \" to the classics , I 'm trying to explain how I base my reviews . What caught my ear on \" Take me out \" was the initial repetitive rock beat ( it 's fast with a hint of punk ) guitar and drums dominate ; it 's a great mix with the singer 's voice ( is he singing or screaming -- it 's hard to tell , there 's an angry sound to his voice which is fitting with the punk aspect of the music ) . A minute into it , the beat transitions to a slower , deeper , harder rock sound ( hm , interesting choice of words yes ? If good music does n't make you think sex , maybe it 's not good music . Anyway , a very sexy transition IMO ) . There is n't much variety in the lyrics or rhythm for that matter ; but sometimes that just does n't matter . The beat keeps the song moving along . The lyrics do borderline on the monotonous but it 's an easy song to sing to -- maybe Franz does n't have much to say . It 's the only song I 've listened to from Franz Ferdinand . I like it , a lot . With Amazon 's 20 million songs , there is so much to listen to ! I rated this song 5 stars because I am very happy with my purchase . I love songs that are a change from the mainstream .","summary":"Music gem from unknown artist (unknown to me at least)","unixReviewTime":1344384000,"image":null}

For Billy Joel , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still sound just as vibrant and distinctive as they did when they first came out back in the 70 's , the 80 's , and even the 90 's . Sometimes the distinctive and classic style of a great songwriter still can deliver better than the joke artists of today . That has shown with Piano Man , New York State Of Mind and the classic We Did n't Start The Fire . The song still lights up the flame 25 years later after it originally came out and it still sounds just as driven as it did years ago . I still never get tired of the rhythm and rhyme into a great history lesson through time , as Joel pointed out into the song , and it still is better than the wasted acts of today .

But nevertheless , her voice will always soar past mostly all of today 's female artists because the most important asset any female singer has shown , speaks for itself , beyond what any of today 's artists have shown like Beyonce ' or Rihanna , where many of today 's female R&B singer have lost themselves in voice and soul , and have had to be more products than voice through legacy . But Whitney Houston 's voice and spirit will always live on not just with her fans and family , but through the legacy of heart and soul she had left behind . I Will Always Love You , her rendition of the Dolly Parton song is the definitive example . The song from the Bodyguard soundtrack is still just as iconic and bold today , as \" The Voice \" had done the song over twenty years ago . The song still gives me shivers and emotions heart and sincerely from the soul within . This is a great download for anyone who had never hears a Whitney Houston song before , and I definitely recommend for your music library .

While the music industry has seen dramatic changes , what it has not been able to show is a clearness and depth of someone and their beautiful voice . Whitney Houston showcased more bravado and simplicity in her songs that still withstand the test of time more than any of the songs that today 's acts could reach . That stands with her biggest template , I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard , and off of her hits record I Will Always Love You : The Best Of Whitney Houston . The song still is just as majestic as it was when it first came out 20 years ago , and just the strike of the notes that Whitney had delivered is still with brilliance . This is a must download for anyone whom has never heard a brilliant note from Whitney Elizabeth Houston . She will always be loved .","summary":"Whitney, You Are Always Loved","unixReviewTime":1360540800,"image":null}

Adler","reviewText":"March 4 , 2009 \n\n As a young man finding my way in New York City there were what the residents called public baths . This was a very long time ago but as a music fan even then , I remember a young , explosive female entertainer named Bette Midler who would entertain at these baths accompanied by her pianist , Barry Manilow . Of course they would later break away from each other to become each outrageously loved and successful show business personalities . There were definitive differences with Barry Manilow becoming a much more   conservative recording artist whereas Bette is the nouveau Lucille Ball with a comedic lasciviousness that generations have enjoyed immensely . My wife and I waited in an endless , serpentine line to see Barry Manilow do a show at the Garden back in 1981 . Once inside , we immediately noticed his engaging smile and friendly persona which is nothing short of contagious . His material , as evidenced by the classic Weekend in New England ranks amongst the finest songwriting in American music . In Barry 's case , whether another classic of his I Write the Songs classifies him as a 100 % singer songwriter is irrelevant . We appreciate him as a captivating singer who is an authentic charmer . That is exactly how Barry Manilow can credit his gargantuan success since the days of playing the piano and appearing with Bette Midler in New York 's public baths . I would have to say that his vocals and keyboard playing are indeed highly professional . His strength is to light up any room he walks into and then you have have to add one of the most highly regarded song catalogs music fans have ever appreciated .

He was best known for his 1967 hit single and generational anthem , ` San Francisco ( Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)' ... John Phillips wrote and co - produced \" San Francisco ( Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair ) \" for McKenzie . Phillips played guitar on the recording and session musician Gary L Coleman played orchestra bells and chimes . Hal Blaine played drums . \" \n\n \" ' San Francisco ( Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair ) ' was released on 13 May 1967 in the United States and was an instant hit , reaching # 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 . It was also a # 1 in the UK and several other countries , selling over seven million copies globally . And what a great song this is ! True , the others did a great job helping Scott with this number ; but I 'm particularly impressed with Scott McKenzie 's unforgettable treatment of this song . Scott sings with great sensitivity and captures the musical essence of \" The Summer of Love \" flawlessly . Sadly , Scott McKenzie passed away just 3 days ago ; he will be remembered for quite some while to come . This song is the perfect introduction to Scott 's artistry ; we are better off because he shared his gift with us .","summary":"\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\"...

I would say the Trammps with Zing Went the Strings of My Heart had all the disco elements down including the strings , and that was in late 1972 , over a year earlier . But the Trammps song was minor and The Love I Lost was a huge mega - hit , so it 's known to far more people . Disco evolved out of the Philly sound of Gamble and Huff , and taht 's who Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes recorded for . \n\n But forget labels like disco anyway ( some people do n't like the term ) , and what you 've got is a smooth orchestra , a driving rhythm and Teddy Pendergrass singing his heart out . It 's a great R&B classic and is as fresh today as it was when it was released . There was a long version on the album , but that just had an extended interlude for dancing because dance music was expected to be more than a three minute AM tune . But for just listening I think the single is better as the dance interlude gets a bit repetitious on the long version if you 're just listening .","summary":"First Disco Song?","unixReviewTime":1383091200,"image":null}

The piping sound of the organ , the supporting guitars , the punctuating percusssion , and Dylan 's sarcastic tongue hit me where I lived . The lyrics caused me to examine my own relationships , especially with people who did n't seem to care a lot for me ! In other words , I loved this song as a teenager , and still go back to it when someone disappoints me !","summary":"Dylan Tells It Like It Is!","unixReviewTime":1252540800,"image":null}

But it 's not that easy , there are bumps in the ride and sometimes it gets rough . Mr. Springsteen 's first marriage was failing at the time and the line it is easy for two people to lose each other is quite prophetic as the marriage ended up in divorce . The music perfectly captures the carnival mood of the piece and Nils Lofgren 's guitar solo cuts through the joyful sound like a razor blade acting as the tension that cuts through the rocky relationship .

First of all , I ca n't tell whether this is about a boy she has serious anger issues with , or whether this is about a child - abuser . The latter would make the song more powerful in a lyrical sense , the former on the other hand , would just make the song wrong all the world around . But , in either case , Clarkson does a poor vocal performance here , and somebody totally messed up on giving this song a tune . It 's so bad , it verges on mind - numbing , and annoying . And after you 've heard the song ten times on radio , in the same morning , you 'll verge on convulsions and other serious medical and mental issues . Yes , it 's that bad . Oh by the way , Reba did n't help the song any . In fact , she just made it worse , as if that was even possible . In fact , that version could be the worst excuse for a duet I 've ever heard . In either case , with either song , do n't buy it .","summary":"No Matter Who You Sing With, It's Still Bad","unixReviewTime":1204243200,"image":null}

For those acts , we always will think of Madonna , Michael Jackson and Prince . But , for Billy Joel , he really made the best that was still coming around . 35 years after he broke ground with Piano Man , he has still dominated with his music on the radio . While he has n't recorded an album since 1993 's River Of Dreams , his music still stands the test of time because it is worth while from beginning to end . But for those who seem more interested in acts like Britney Spears and anyone who has been on American Idol , and does n't own a Billy Hoel record , than this is a start to download for your MP3 player . The Essential Billy Joel is a collection of over 30 tracks from Billy 's long and successful career from the 70 's , 80 's and 90 's . The songs here have all been remastered well , and chronicle a innocent man who has made the music of our times . The collection includes a lot of great standards he has made his own for over 35 years like Piano Man , River Of Dreams , We Did n't Start The Fire , the delight diddy Uptown Girl , and The Longest Time , all the way to # 1 hits like My Life , It 's Still Rock N ' Roll To Me and Allentown . There is so much that is great in music , but there are a few of his great songs that were sadly overlooked like You 're Only Human ( Second Wind ) , Modern Woman and a few other good songs . But , those are small complaints , because those songs were only minor hits . Instead , the collectin includes some of his songs from his 2001 classical pop album instead . All in all , The Essential Billy Joel is a very strong and standard greatest hits album from beginning to end that is fun and a joy to listen to , whether you 're a hard core fan , or anyone who is new to Billy Joel 's songs . This album is definitely a great purchase to download off the internet , or buy from your local record store . Even though Billy Joel has n't made anything new in awhile , his music is still making us go to extremes .","summary":"Billy For Beginners","unixReviewTime":1201996800,"image":null}

I purchased an old The Source magazine from December 1994 and saw that was a track for one of their Sure Hot Singles back in the day . Thing was I never paid too much attention to UGK , except for a few songs here and there . Then ended up being the laughing stock at my job , because I told them that I 'm from the A , their recent album&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Underground - Kingz \/ dp \/ B000K7UFL2 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Underground Kingz<\/a>&nbsp;was the only album I owned . So I ended up buying this the very next day . Super Tight is a very southern style album . Both Bun B and Pimp C sound way different back in ' 94 , than they do today . A lot of tracks would bump today as they did back then . Bun B drops a solo track \" Feds In Town \" which sounds real good . \" Pocket Full Of Stones 2 \" and \" Protect & Serve \" are other good songs . \" Stoned Junkee \" is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and features 3 - 2 . The final track \" Three Sixteens \" featuring DJ DMD is a very good way to close out the album . Super Tight is an excellent album . Some of the production sounds dated ( although I have to give mad props to Pimp C for his production ) , but it still bumps here today . It 's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar , especially when other albums from the south such as&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik \/ dp \/ B0000013GB \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/The - Diary \/ dp \/ B000000W6Z \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">The Diary<\/a>&nbsp;dropped the same year . But if you 're a fan of 90 's southern rap ( mainly groups like E.S.G. , UGK , or anyone from Rap - A - Lot ) , do n't hesitate to get this album . I used to live in San Antonio during my high school days ( ' 00-'04 ) , and this album reminds me so much of how it was down there in Texas .

Yet , his music remains in vivid memory as he was still alive today . Something that only few and far between artists whom has passed on can still deliver in spirit . His last major hit , You Rock My World from his lackluster Invincible record still remains very solid with his standard dance songs from the late 70 's and 80 's . It is one of his better songs from Invincible that still stands tall . While it is n't as good as his ballads were like Man In The Mirror or Lady In My Life . Still , it holds up well into why he will always be The King Of Pop . The song still stands taller than most of the junk on radio today .","summary":"Jackson Rocked One Last Time","unixReviewTime":1340928000,"image":null}

I definitely do not think Michael Jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a pedophile and wacko jacko . Still he still had some great songs towards the end of his career and his life . You Rock My World , one of his last hit songs originally from the lackluster Invincible album is still one of those few standouts from that album that is playing well . It showed a more R&B rhythm to the appeal that Michael Jackson wanted to get into a generation that was getting into Destiny 's Child , TLC and when a lot of R&B really was going more into a dance and hip hop rhythm . It really was a good song , but one of Michael Jackson 's last to really hit the nail on the head .

It may be funny initially , but it 's replay value is nowhere near that of the song it introduces . Listeners of at - least the official album versions of these tracks may , in other words , find themselves skipping past , or at - least zoning - out on , the first several seconds . That means the tracks , essentially the songs , would be better without their preludes . In the case of You Rock My World , the title of which does n't come across nearly as corny as it should , the song would also make more sense without it . The dialogue implies that the girl is a total stranger to both Chris and Mike , but the song lyrics have Jackson already romantically entwined with her . \" It feels like I 've finally found a perfect love this time , \" he insists before going into one of his best choruses yet . \" You rocked my world , you know you did , \" it goes , utilizing a harmonic vocal stack similar to the haunting Ghosts , \" Who 'd think I 'd find someone like you to call mine ? \" The words are trite ; on paper the song would read like a high school crush poem ; but the vocal melodies , even on the verses and bridge , are quite awesome . The music , highlighted by dramatic keyboard strings where applicable , is a slinky soul groove that goes back to the relative timelessness of the Thriller album . Despite an unnecessary scratch break near the end ; the ad - lib peak section should take the song out ; it 's producer Rodney Jerkins at his best . It 's not Michael Jackson at his best , but it 's damn close . If the quality of this love theme is any indication , I 'd guess he got the girl . \n\n marcellee.com","summary":"5 of 5","unixReviewTime":1381449600,"image":null}

It has some nice flourishes such as great sax solos , judicial use of cow bell , and one of the nicest drum solos recorded , with ample timbale which lends an exotic flavor . There is great synthesizer throughout with strong performances by all backup musician . The drum solo on this version is a little longer than the radio version ( I like this slightly longer version better ) .

While so many artists like Jordin Sparks and Beyonce ' have taken so much radio airplay , it has been harder to find fresh faces to make good music come alive . Newcomer , Sara Bareilles though has managed to get herself out there and try to make a name for her little voice with her debut single , Love Song . The song actually is very catchy after awhile , and stays with you . It is a pretty good song that shows she has a decent ability who has the distinction of making good songs sound fresh , rather than flimsy and manufactured . I really hope she keeps making good ones for years to come , that really stick to the mind and soul .","summary":"A New Songbird","unixReviewTime":1210809600,"image":null}

She sings great , and her piano work is incredible . The song could be compared to REM 's classic , \" The One I Love , \" in that , the title sounds , well , like a lovesong , but actually it 's like a break - up song . Bareilles does a great job at creating a radio - friendly upbeat pop song . And it all seems to work . Just the other day , I heard the song twice within a span of 15 minutes , on completely different radio stations . Overall , a great little pop tune from a big talent .

Nothing is really at its best when it is separated and distilled . Michael Jackson knew that in his career and refused to be defined . We would do ourselves and the world a favor that doing the same . Black or White contains a message that minds us that we are all human , all important regardless of what we look like .

Cracked has a sketchy record when it comes to recommendations , in my opinion , but given that I loved most of the other songs on this particular list ( \" Eye of the Tiger , \" \" Do n't Stop Believing , \" \" Holding Out for a Hero , \" \" Love is a Battlefield , \" etc . ) I 'll just say ... if you 're an unabashed fan of cheesy ' 80s poodle - hair rock , you will love this song . :D \n\n There 's nothing subtle whatsoever about this song . From the triumphant and soaring synthesizer opening to the epic guitar and drum riffs , this song 's instrumentation is the epitome of goofy ' 80s rock . The lyrics , while simple , are also rather nonsensical , seeming to hint toward a group of astronauts leaving Earth but otherwise defying easy explanation . And the lead singer 's voice is nothing to write home about , though at least he actually tries to carry the tune and does n't just yell into the microphone . And yet somehow , this all WORKS . It 's a goofy song , yes , but it 's the kind of goofy that leaves a huge smile on your face . It 's a song that 's completely over - the - top but in the best possible way , and you ca n't help but want to bang your head and sing along when it comes on . I have n't listened to anything else by Europe -- and from what I understand this is their only real hit -- but they sure hit a home run with this number . This song has found plenty of new fans thanks to \" Arrested Development , \" but even if you 've never seen that show , it 's almost impossible not to like this song . It 's not the greatest hit of the ' 80s , but it sure is one of the most fun ... and yes , one of the most terrifyingly epic .","summary":"Goofy and over-the-top but epic and entirely enjoyable hit of the '80s","unixReviewTime":1439942400,"image":null}

But with time and space , the song has still been as iconic today , as it became a hit back then . When I had heard Fall Out Boy do a cover of this definitive song , Ray Parker Jr. & Huey Lewis got credit for in the 80 's , and the original version is n't bad after all this time . It is definitely one of those movie songs that has still stood the test of time , in the way other movies songs like Purple Rain did for with the late great Prince and Footloose for Kenny Loggins as well .

This song is in itself a classic . Few country singers today can match the voice of Alan Jackson . Sometimes there are certain songs by certain artists that stick in our memories and bring a smile on our faces and this is one of them . Both of my parents were big fans of Alan Jackson and I am as well . Many of his songs bring me back to the days of hearing my dad singing them .

Now I 'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz ( which by definition IS fusion , like in Fused On ) no , I 'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro - Latin Gumbo Rock ! Artists like Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye , The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra , Santana , Traffic , Pink Floyd , Genesis , even Yes and ELP ; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor 's stable of jazz giants . Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers ' label ( not represented here of course ) got word of mouth disease , it was jazzy , funky , rock - drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago , this music was not a stretch at all , especially if you were also a fan of War , with or without Eric Burdon . So this groovy 17 - track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential . The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order , not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music . Listen to Ca n't Hide Love and try not to think about \" smooth jazz \" a decade later , way ahead of its time , way ! This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide . It contains all of The Best of Earth , Wind & Fire ( 1978 ) save the weakish Love Music , six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2 , and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story ( from Open Our Eyes , ' 74 ) and the title epic from Gratitude ( ' 75 ) . Even if you have most of their studio releases , how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life ! The CD comes with full music and track credits , a terrific bio ( The Eternal Groove ) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in - depth history ( The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks ) all packaged with some beautiful artwork ( always a staple of EWF albums ) . Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group , full of positive vibrations and inner peace , Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it . Get a heaping helping right here and you wo n't regret it .","summary":"A Fusion Like No Other!","unixReviewTime":1506902400,"image":null}

But for Whitney Houston doing it back in 1991 , she made it more dominant than what Francis Scott Key could 've ever imagined . It came on the heels of the Persian Gulf War , and hearing how bold and somber it is , sadly after Whitney had died , it is a unparalleled trademark of why someone is that strong . Whitney dominated that song beyond what words could 've ever said , and that lightning in a bottle will never be replicated .

It has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there have been a lot of faults that have n't been able to outshine others . Arguable , the biggest version of the Star Spangles , is definitely from the great Whitney Houston . Her legacy to deliver any cover , has been beyond what words could ever be ignited from the soul of the heart . Her rendition from the Super Bowl back in 1991 , still ignites from the impassioned soul . Whenever I hear this version that \" The Voice \" honorably showcased , I am constantly reminded of how beautiful she still can shine , where so many singers like Beyonce ' Knowles have not even came close to singing and delivering a simple note where Whitney ignited from first to last place .

I must first start off by saying how much I love the fact that that Three Days Grace manages to turn a song about love involving pain into a genius art form . This is another fun song that I have on my zune player and I like how he expresses himself when he sings lyric such as \" trust me and take my hand \" \" when the lights go out you will understand \" and then the song pauses for s split second before he belts out pain among the right timed guitars to help break the pause . He raises his voice some times during the songs but he does it at the right times in the songs such as in the end of it and at one of my favorite moments in the song when he sings \" I 'm always here for you \" \" Iknow , I know , I know , I know that you 'll thank me later \" . The lead singer 's awesome voice goes perfect with this song . Anyhow , the interesting thing about this song is that if you would like to listen to a sensual erotic song that falls under the hard rock \/ alternative rock genre then this song would be a must have in your musical collection . but I am still enjoying it and I am glad to have it as part of my musical collection . This song is definitely recommended for rock music lovers amd even music lovers that may only be lightly into rock but would like to add something different to their musical collection .","summary":"pleasure to the ears","unixReviewTime":1227484800,"image":null}

I 'm one of those die hard fans that wants all of their stuff . That being said , this collection is n't really enough to satisfy my craving for their music . I agree that it covers their essential hits , but I am much more content with buying the original releases . There is maybe two songs max out of discs 1974 - 1981 that i do not have rated 5 stars on my iPod , or even have but that 's it ! As some of the other reviews have said , this is a great compilation for those who just want to start out basic or just have some hits . My dad bought this album , and i bought a copy too ( from Media Play ) just going to show how long i have had this . Since then , i have collected the original albums , plus Live In Rio,&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Greatest - Hits - Earth - Wind - Fire \/ dp \/ B00136NUG6 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\"><\/a>&nbsp;,<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Earth - Wind - Fire - Greatest - Hits - Live \/ dp \/ B0000033Y3 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Earth Wind & Fire - Greatest Hits Live<\/a>(FYE or Best Buy ) and&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/That - s - the - Way - of - the - World - Alive - in-75 \/ dp \/ B0026OIBN6 \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">That 's the Way of the World : Alive in 75<\/a>&nbsp;(FYE ) As well as DVD's&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Earth - Wind - Fire - Live \/ dp \/ B000056N8W \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Earth Wind & Fire - Live<\/a>&nbsp;(Circuit City ) and < a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Earth - Wind - Fire - In - Concert \/ dp \/ B001675YUW \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Earth Wind & Fire In Concert<\/a>(Best Buy ) which my dad also introduced me to on VHS .

This is for the simple fan , but any one else like me I suggest you buy the orginal releases .","summary":"EWF!!!!","unixReviewTime":1361491200,"image":null}

It has released a number of greatest hit compilations so far , but this one is most suited for ordinary music fans who have never bought any of EW&F albums . Earth Wind and Fire is regarded as a disco hit maker because during late 70s to early 80s the group had produced such tracks that might fit well for disco - dancing from slow ballad AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE to dance - pop BOOGIE WONDERLAND and LET 'S GROOVE . But up until mid 70s they created some great spiritual songs with ethreal out - of - the - world chorus . CAN'T HIDE LOVE is one of the good examples to show their chorus style . FANTASY is by far the most successful single release in Japan . KALIMBA STORY and MIGHTY MIGHTY are the funky pop songs representing their early days ' music style .

This is a strong single CD compilation although as others have noted it does n't give you every last one of their hits . However , what we do get is very high quality control music from Earth Wind & Fire ; and that 's great . The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that artwork , too . This came out and hit the airwaves big time ! Earth Wind & Fire simply never sounded better . They really handle this well ; they never skip a beat nor do they ever let go of a superfluous note . The tempo and key changes make the number strong ; and they sing this very well . \" That 's The Way Of The World \" quickly shifts gears for a much more mellow sounding tune ; this features the group squarely in the spotlight -- right where they belonged and still belong ! \" That 's The Way Of The World \" was always one of my very favorite Earth Wind & Fire tunes ; and I think just one listen will tell you why -- this is all THAT good . \" September \" has an awesome beat that would even get the dead tapping their feet to the rhythm ; \" September \" was yet another huge hit that got a lot of airplay when it was originally released . I still hear it sometimes on an \" oldies \" radio station in my area ; and that 's grand . \" Got To Get You Into My Life \" is one heck of a snazzy tune ; they make this a masterpiece and they deliver this with a lot of feeling . In addition , \" Sing A Song \" has them harmonizing to perfection -- and beyond ! \" Sing A Song \" is another major hit on this CD . \" Serpentine Fire \" uses the percussion to great advantage ; and of course another big hit for this group is \" Fantasy . \" \" Fantasy \" charms me with its beauty and it 's truly a stand - out on this album -- how could they ever get better than this ? I 'm amazed . \" Mighty Mighty \" has quite a beat that gets you up and dancing nearly wherever you are ; and listen for \" Reasons . \" \" Reasons \" has a mellow , pensive flavor to it that is absolutely stunning -- and the backup singers harmonize well . \" Let 's Groove \" is another tune that still sounds good all these years later ; and I really like \" Boogie Wonderland \" which Earth Wind & Fire performs with The Emotions . \" Boogie Wonderland \" was a huge success for these artists and I still love to hear it today . \" After The Love Has Gone \" again showcases Earth Wind & Fire at their mellow best ; and the album ends strong with Earth Wind & Fire performing \" Getaway . \" \" Getaway \" has a strong beat that makes me want to dance ; and it also leaves me wanting so much more ! This is a great album for fans of Earth Wind & Fire , but if truth be told they would need other CDs to have all of the hits from this fantastic group . This album is particularly good for the casual fan who wants most of their hits on one single CD ; and it makes an excellent starter CD for people just discovering the fine talents of Earth Wind & Fire .","summary":"got to get them into my life","unixReviewTime":1241654400,"image":null}

It was the group 's signature song , their first # 1 hit single and still remains their most popular song ever . The Highwayman tells the story of death and rebirth in four parts , and each part is sung by a different member of the group . The first three characters ( Willie , Kris , Waylon ) meet their deaths and are somehow resurrected . Johnny 's character has already left his former life and is in the process of being reincarnated . His character may also represent all of The Highwaymen . Along the coach roads I did ride \n With sword and pistol by my side \n Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade \n Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade \n The bas***ds hung me in the spring of ' 25 But I am still alive \n\n Kris : \n\n I was a sailor . I was born upon the tide \n With the sea I did abide \n I sailed a schooner around the Horn to Mexico \n I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow \n And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed But I am living still \n\n Waylon : \n\n I was a dam builder . Across the river deep and wide \n Where steel and water did collide \n A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado \n I slipped and fell to the wet concrete below \n They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound \n But I am still around ... I'll always be around \n\n Johnny : \n\n I fly a starship across the Universe divide \n And when I reach the other side \n I 'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can \n Perhaps I may become a Highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain And I 'll be back again ...","summary":"THE LEGEND...","unixReviewTime":1221004800,"image":null}

Containing most of the band 's hits as well as lesser known tracks that are just as strong , Greatest Hits is the perfect introduction to this talented band 's music . Simply put , every track here is top notch with most of them hitting the Top Ten on both the pop singles and black singles charts . The tracks \" Mighty Mighty \" , \" Saturday Nite \" , and their only # 1 pop single \" Shining Star \" are excellent funk songs punctuated by their trademark snappy horn lines . The tracks \" September \" , \" Serpentine Fire \" , and \" Sing A Song \" are near perfect pop songs with soaring harmonies and melodies that stay in your head immediately upon first listen . Their late-70 's hits \" Let 's Groove \" and \" Boogie Wonderland \" are very strong disco tracks with the former track aging wonderfully compared to most of the music from that genre . While the harmonies are strong on all of their material , harmonizing does n't get much better than on \" Getaway \" , arguably the finest song they 've ever recorded . The ballads here are all fantastic with \" After The Love Has Gone \" , \" That 's The Way Of The World \" , and \" Reasons \" being not only among the best recorded in the ' 70s , but of any era . Other great tracks here include their cover of the Beatles ' \" Got To Get You Into My Life \" , \" Fantasy \" , and \" Kalimba 's Story . \" This is a phenomenal greatest hits album that should be part of every music fan 's collection .

Funk workouts like \" Shining Star , \" \" Let 's Groove , \" \" Boogie Wonderland \" and the classic \" September \" are solid , irresistible works that age like fine wine , and silky ballads like \" That 's the Way of the World \" and \" Reasons \" proved that they could be twice as smooth even when the tempo was half as fast . The band even offers up one of the strongest Beatles covers ever recorded , an irresistibly bright reading of \" Got to Get You Into My Life . \" But their hands - down masterpiece will always be \" After the Love is Gone , \" a simply - perfect cut that boasts flawless vocals , lush horns , and a striking chord progression . Of the songs that were n't crossover smashes , some are revelations ( \" Mighty Mighty , \" \" Saturday Night \" ) while others simply are n't up to snuff ( \" Serpentine Fire , \" \" Kalimba Song \" ) .

He is also considered one of the great stylists and innovators on his instrument , forging a unique jazz - based rock style that propelled his supergroup through 20 top ten hits , 16 million - selling albums and numerous sold out concerts around the world for millions of fans . After Danny was \" fired \" by the group in 1990 , he went into seclusion and put his drums aside . Following years of production projects in the sudio and even Broadway , Danny got back into form in recent years with the inspiration of top industry musicians . His jam sessions resulted in the formation of \" CTA \" and now the release of this studio work with a wonderful mix of Chicago classics and originals and other rock standards . Every track works and every track cooks . Danny 's drum chops are back intact as he leads this band of top flight musicians with the amazing Marc Bonilla on guitar and Tower of Power 's incredible Larry Braggs on vocals . Yes , Danny Seraphine is back , back with a vengeance and showing the world a return to the original musical inspiration that made the early Chicago great . While his former bandmates earn a paycheck entertaining the wine and cheese crowd with Peter Cetra covers like \" If You leave Me Now \" Danny and CTA are playing real music for the sake of the music itself and blowin ' the door down . \" California Transit Authority \" is a superb CD and is a must listen for all Chicago fans and fans of rock music in general . The current members of Chicago could also stand to listen to this exciting work as a reminder of what they set out to accomplish musically in 1967 , while using \" Chicago XXX \" as a coaster for their drinks .","summary":"Danny Seraphine Returns With a Vengeance","unixReviewTime":1217116800,"image":null}

Still not there ? Oh well ... This song , her last real song that anybody would pass more than a horrifying glance at her . And while not her best vocally , you just ca n't get away from that beat . Congrats , kudos , and bravo to the producer that created that , because it is simply amazing . Perfect for spy movies , and when it was used in \" Chuck , \" and it 's just so darn catchy . You know the opening chords , you know the riff , it 's all familiar , and lovable . She 's okay , normal dance club fare . Nothing special vocally here . Just a beat , and a music video ! So overall , you might want to skip the vocal version , and just get the instrumental version which I am just lovin' up on now . So hurry , get it , use it as a ringtone ! Or use it next time you ca n't get the James Bond \/ Mission Impossible Theme for your secret spy activities . By the way , some great covers have been made of this song , and most of them come out surprising well . Some offer a different take , some are fun , some are strange to say the least . Hard - Fi did a great low - fi indie cover of the song , which all but removes the original melody , and just keeps the lyrics , while adding some car effects . Nickel Creek did a great humorous live performance that you can find in various places . In that version , one of the band members readily admits , \" This song kicks a*s ! \" And Yael Naim did a cover of the song , which is very strange and haunting . I did n't care for it , but some will and do .","summary":"Britney's Best?","unixReviewTime":1207526400,"image":null}

Another one is the heartbreaking news that her soulmate and manager Rene ' Angeil died after a severe battle of throat cancer that hurt their love and tore them apart . He battled in 1999 and survived , but it came back to take him for several years . When I think of Celine 's sadness , I think of her song My Heart Will Go On from Titanic . It is one of those songs that really do strike you at the soul of the heart , and even more with the recent death of James Horner , and the hypnotic song that really grabbed you .

She was NOT like any other artist out there . She was wacky , creative , quirky , fashionable ( check out her various outfits ) and did n't take herself so seriously . Quite simply , Cyndi just wanted to have fun . But before she became a megastar on the pop map , she had previously fronted a rock band called Blue Angel . They put out their first and ONLY record in 1980 . It really IS worth checking out . Once Cyndi became an actual solo artist , her first order of business ( aside from being on MTV ) was to recruit another band called The Hooters . They helped her launch 5 mega smashes on her 1983 debut , \" She 's So Unusual . \" First , there is the opener , \" Money Changes Everything . \" Cyndi showed the world who was boss and that she was n't going anywhere . Next was the most important staple , \" Girls Just Want To Have Fun . \" The whole indescribable nature of the song was what got her noticed in the first place ( most notably on Dick Clark 's American Bandstand ) . Then there was the much more serious ballad \" Time After Time \" , which remains one of my personal favorites to this day . This album was only the tip of the iceberg of what would catapult Cyndi 's 30 year career longevity . In 1985 , she released 2 tracks for The Goonies movie :   the theme song ( \" The Goonies ' R ' Good Enough \" ) and the much faster rocker , \" What A Thrill . \" A year later , Cyndi spread out her artistic talent even further with \" True Colors . \" Each song was a hit on its own , and Cyndi had A LOT of guest stars ( The Bangles , Billy Joel , Aimee Mann , and even Pee Wee Herman ) . The title track and accompanying video is another one of my personal faves . In 1988 , another minor hit :   \" Hole In My Heart ( All The Way To China ) \" from the movie Vibes . It 's a VERY elusive song to find , if that is even possible . I actually got it from an 80 's compilation disc on eBay several years ago . It 's just one of those feel good songs that you really need to have ! ! ! Next came 1989 's \" A Night To Remember \" . Cyndi was becoming much more serious as a songwriter and performer . \" I Drove All Night \" had a much more rock feel to it , and it proved that Cyndi was indeed evolving . Sadly , this was the only real hit on her record ; in hindsight , the rest of the songs deserved MUCH more appreciation and should not have been cast aside . What about \" Unconditional Love \" or \" Heading West \" ? ? In the 90 's , Cyndi would release 3 more records . By that time , she was getting even deeper into her artistry and would even release some non - album tracks . For example , you may be familiar with the ethereal 1992 's \" The World Is Stone . \" In 1993 , Cyndi re - teamed with the Hooters for some delicious tracks on \" Hat Full Of Stars . \" There were , again , some minor hits :   \" That 's What I Think \" , \" Who Let In The Rain ? \" , and the lilting , hushed title track which is still another of my personal faves . Unfortunately , the album was n't getting the right amount of airplay . But that never stopped Cyndi at all . She kept having great song after song . In 1995 , Cyndi released her first greatest hits record , \" Twelve Deadly Cyns . \" I loved the candy coated , luscious album cover , and so 3 new songs were added to Cyndi 's ever growing repertoire : \" I 'm Gon na Be Strong \" ( this was an updated version of the 1980 Blue Angel track ) , \" ( Hey Now ) Girls Just Want To Have Fun \" ( a sequel to the 1983 megasmash ) , and \" Come On Home . She wanted to be an ARTIST , not a \" hits \" maker . On \" Sisters Of Avalon \" , Cyndi went all over the map ( but in a very good way , mind you ) . There 's the forceful , in your face title track . 2 other minor hits also took notice :   \" Ballad Of Cleo & Joe \" and \" Unhook The Stars . \" Sadly , this particular album was one of her most underappreciated . Overall , this \" greatest hits \" CD covers Cyndi Lauper 's timespan from 1983 to 1996 . Since then , Cyndi would release 6 more albums in 1998 , 2002 , 2003 , 2005 , 2008 and 2010 . No two records were EVER the same . And that brings me to the 3 reasons that Cyndi is MY favorite female artist of all time . One :   She created albums on her OWN terms and would n't conform to the record companies . She played various instruments -- whatever she could find , she would put to use ! And three :   many of the songs were very euphoric and would make a person feel good about himself \/ herself . So , if anyone is having a bad day , all you need to do is put on a Cyndi Lauper record and learn how to have fun . I 'm sure glad that I did ! ! !","summary":"Wanna have fun??

There are some treasures on here though and for the price , it 's definitely worth picking up if you want to discover her music more or just own some of the best songs she ever made ( the Goonies song for instance is amazing and not easy to find ) . So for die - hard Cyndi Lauper fans , the Goonies song is probably the main attraction for you . Other than that , you may disagree with the \" greatest hits \" selection .

At any rate , Cyndi worked hard to produce great music for her fans ; and just one listen to this album proves it . In addition , the quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very well done . \" Girls Just Want To Have Fun \" starts the CD off with a huge number that was one of Cyndi 's earliest hits . \" Girls Just Want To Have Fun \" celebrates women who just want to enjoy their relationships with men without long term commitments ; and Cyndi delivers this like a pro ! The number is full of positive energy and it 's great music for dancing even today . \" Money Changes Everything \" was another early hit for Cyndi ; this has that mid ` 80s dance flavor to it and Cyndi 's really good diction enhances the number even more . \" Who Let In The Rain \" features Cyndi front and center -- right where she belongs ! \" Who Let In The Rain \" is a fine number that proves Cyndi can easily tackle a rock flavored ballad to make it take flight ! \" She Bop \" was always one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper hits ; this hit the airwaves big time during the summer of 1984 and I remember going to dances where the DJs played this very often . \" She Bop \" has a great , power - packed melody that is also rather catchy and it remains one of Cyndi Lauper 's best hits ever . \" Time After Time \" also comes from the mid 1980s ; and Cyndi does this wonderfully . \" I Drove All Night \" comes from Cyndi 's great album entitled A Night To Remember and just one listen proves that Cyndi is a champ ! \" Hat Full Of Stars \" is a ballad from the album of the same name ; and listen for \" All Through The Night . \" \" All Through The Night \" is one of Cyndi Lauper 's best hits ever -- period . The percussion enhances the musical arrangement and Cyndi 's excellent diction makes her performance even better . \" All Through The Night \" is another one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper tunes and it deserves its place on this CD . \" When You Were Mine \" comes from Cyndi 's first album entitled She 's So Unusual ; and Cyndi 's cover of the song originally done by Prince really shines bright . \" True Colors \" comes from the album of the same ; Cyndi does this with great sensitivity and the guitar work enhances the melody quite a bit . Awesome ! \" Unhook The Stars \" plays with major and minor keys as Cyndi sings this very well ; and the album ends strong with a great number from the movie The Goonies entitled \" The Goonies ' R ' Good Enough . \" I agree with other reviewers who write that this last number is a most welcome addition to this album . I always liked Cyndi Lauper ; so while I love the tunes on this album I must admit that it 's not as complete as it should be . There should be several other songs here . Specifically , I would have wanted extra songs like \" Hole In My Heart ( All The Way To China ) ; \" \" My First Night Without You ; \" \" Ballad Of Cleo & Joe ; \" \" Boy Blue \" and maybe even one or two more . That 's a missed opportunity ; and I can only hope that we get a better Cyndi Lauper \" essential \" collection two CD set soon . Nevertheless , I still recommend this album for Lauper 's fans ; and it makes a great starter CD for people just discovering Cyndi 's talents . It 's also a fine CD for people who merely want a small sampling of Cyndi Lauper 's incredible artistry .","summary":"extremely good--as far as it goes, that is...","unixReviewTime":1238976000,"image":null}

It was what made \" < a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/She - s - So - Unusual \/ dp \/ B000051Y0G \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">She 's So Unusual<\/a > \" so brilliant ; Cyndi was so totally outside the mold that everything on it quaked with the stellar portrayal of the artist as a young woman . From the classic anthem \" Girls Just Wanna have Fun \" to the emotional bulls - eye of \" Time After Time , \" Cyndi and all her friends established the pattern that would follow for the rest of her career . Cyndi found songs to match her one - of - a - kind voice and would deliver them with style . That she had a knack for plucking gems from obscurity also helped .

That ambition also lead to Cyndi 's activism . \" True Colors \" has become something of a gay anthem , a call to recognize yourself as the person you are . It became the Nom De'Tour of Cyndi 's summer 2007 tour for the Human Rights Campaign ( along with Debbie Harry and Erasure , among others ) , and her tireless work on behalf of the Matthew Sheppard Foundation and other causes . Her timeless music couples with her work for the future . Her attempt to broaden the style works OK on \" Sisters of Avalon \" and \" Unhook The Stars , \" but I would have happily traded them ( or \" When You Were Mine \" ) in for \" What 's Going On . \" All is forgiven however , by finally finding \" The Goonies R Good Enough \" on a proper US Cyndi Lauper CD . A quickie knock - off to a Steven Spielberg screaming kids movie , it is all the things great about Cyndi 's hits ; melodic , energetic and sing - along - quirky .

Whether or not Cyndi likes the song , it 's an 80 's movie song classic and was a top 10 hit . Eight of Cyndi 's top 10 hits are on here including the classic \" Girls Just Wanna Have Fun \" , \" She Bop \" , \" All Through the Night \" and \" Time After Time \" frm her debut . all four of these were massive radio hits and still heard to this day . \" True Colors \" and \" Change of Heart \" were big hits off of her sophomore album . Her last top 10 single is included too from \" A Night to Remember \" which is \" I Drove All Night \" * recently Celine Dion did an amazing cover of it . * \" Money Changes Everything \" is graciously included also which did n't hit the top 10 , but was still a big top 40 hit . The non - hits are also very worthy . \" Hat Full of Stars \" is gorgeous and \" Sisters of Avalon \" is very catchy . So why 4 stars ? As outstanding as this collection is , \" What 's Going On \" * a top 10 hit from \" True Colors \" * was left off as was the minor hit \" Hole In My Heart . \" These are minor gripes but would 've really put it over the top .

The song definitely still is a classic today , as it was when it came out back in the 80 's , when Marvin really was coming to terms with redemption , and ultimately lost his life to the man that helped make him alive , his father Marvin Gay Sr . , who murdered him 2 years later . The song is definitely one of those songs that still does not go out of style , even with Marvin 's classic from his Motown era . I definitely still love this song so much . He really placed his signature on this ballad from top to bottom . If you have never even heard a Marvin Gaye song yet , this is one to own for your music library .","summary":"Marvin's Healing","unixReviewTime":1353283200,"image":null}

For starters , that hypnotic \" Get Up , Get Up , Get Up , Get Up \" hook that is softly whispered over the rhythmic beat calls us into the theme of the track . Marvin 's voice is like that of an ecstatic angel living with one foot in the clouds and another in the entrance way to the bedroom . I can picture hips gyrating , beautiful women dancing in the background , red satin sheets , candles , rose petals and the whole bit . In all my years of listening to music , never have I heard a song quite so stirring and smooth . Marvin states in no uncertain times that he is seeking some sexual healing from his partner ( or partners ) and is not shy about laying his cards right out there throughout the duration of the song . The song starts beautifully and truly ends too quickly .","summary":"Classic Marvin Gaye at his best....","unixReviewTime":1382659200,"image":null}

All the misunderstanding aside , the song is both pro and anti America . It takes on the yin and yang that is this country by on one hand , celebrating the majestic and glory of the flag and then the dark underbelly where we send the less fortunate to keep them out of sight .

I loved this song when it came out in ` 82.and I was in my middle twenties . It 's a great song to listen to while driving - keeps me awake and chair - dancing in the drivers seat . Back in those days I recorded it on a cassette as part of my \" driving mix \" . It 's still great driving music and this new copy became part of my driving playlist . Some happy memories and feelings come up when I hear Rosanna and I 'm glad I found this forgotten favorite again . It may not be Kansas anymore , Toto but Rosanna still makes me happy .

I miss you James , your enthusiasm and your talent . Listen to many black artists and they claim influence from James Brown . For example , the \" King of Pop \" Michael Jackson did many of James Brown dance moves . For some strange reason Amazon encoded this song at the bizarre rate of 247 kpbs . No matter , buy this song ! James sings \" I feel good \" as a reference to his 1965 popular song . Also , James 's reference to \" Eddie Murphy eat your heart out \" .

Classic guitar riff , anyone who plays rock guitar has probably practiced it at some point in their lives . That SNL sketch was so brilliant , Christopher Walken ' THE Bruce Dickinson . ' Yeah , the cowbell is fairly non - stop but it 's low in the mix and often falls into a sonic blind spot so it tunes in and out of my consciousness . I think I almost typed couscousness there , ha ha that 's what I was thinking ... weird . The guitar solo is pretty classic as well . Sometimes I wish they had n't let the last note sustain so far into the verse , but not a deal breaker , Blue yster Cult . What a great name for a band . When I was younger , I thought they were scary , based on the cover of the 45 I had of Burnin for You . Ha ha , these guys are goofy . Where does one find blue oysters anyhow ? Or is it a blue cult that worships oysters ? Or does an umlaut over the ' o ' mean something entirely different ?","summary":"SEP 19","unixReviewTime":1497225600,"image":null}

But this song was so special it broke out into an AM singles hit . It was very toned down for Blue Oyster Cult but that 's what made it work . For all it 's theme of death it 's not angry or hysterical but rather uses a mellow , almost folk - like vocal by Buck Dharma ( who wrote the song ) along with tightly harmonized backup vocals and guitar to carry it 's ultimately positive message of accepting the inevitability of The Reaper . Everything is restrained until the wonderfully explosive guitar interlude about two and a half minutes in . The band 's engineers created an echoing acoustic for the instruments that also serves the song well . All in all a melodic and memorable hit .

Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler , whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise . Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart 's content on any given , bleached out , saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad . Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women - warriors throughout the land , who carry torches for their men ( hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts ) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent . \" And I need you now tonight And I need you more than ever And if you 'll only hold me tight \n We 'll be holding on forever And we 'll only be making it right \n 'Cause we 'll never be wrong together We can take it to the end of the line \n Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time \n I do n't know what to do and I 'm always in the dark We 're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks \n I really need you tonight Forever 's gon na start tonight Forever 's gon na start tonight Once upon a time I was falling in love But now I 'm only falling apart \n Nothing I can do \n A total eclipse of the heart \n Once upon a time there was light in my life But now there 's only love in the dark \n Nothing I can say \n A total eclipse of the heart \"","summary":"John du Prey - Classical Review","unixReviewTime":1332979200,"image":null}

Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly . This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \" Total Eclipse of the Heart \" ; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler ; written \/ produced by the gifted Jim Steinman ; backup vocals by Rory Dodd ( who can be distinctly heard singing ` echo ' ) , Eric Troyer , and Bryan Adams . One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the ` backup vocals ' in order to heighten the experience for one and all . Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler , whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise . Suffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart 's content on any given , bleached out , saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad . Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women - warriors throughout the land , who carry torches for their men ( hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts ) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent . \" And I need you now tonight And I need you more than ever And if you 'll only hold me tight \n We 'll be holding on forever And we 'll only be making it right \n 'Cause we 'll never be wrong together We can take it to the end of the line \n Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time \n I do n't know what to do and I 'm always in the dark We 're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks \n I really need you tonight Forever 's gon na start tonight Forever 's gon na start tonight Once upon a time I was falling in love But now I 'm only falling apart \n Nothing I can do \n A total eclipse of the heart \n Once upon a time there was light in my life But now there 's only love in the dark \n Nothing I can say \n A total eclipse of the heart \"","summary":"John du Prey - Classical Review","unixReviewTime":1332979200,"image":null}

And at the end of every season the show plays a recap of the season 's events right before the season finale ... and said recap is invariably accompanied by this stirring number . I have n't listened to anything else by Kansas , but if \" Carry On Wayward Son \" is any indication , they were a pretty epic band . \" Carry On Wayward Son \" balances out the more energetic portions of the song with some slightly slower , more low - key bridges that have an almost thoughtful sound to them , and are mostly piano instead of the guitar - and - drums of the rest . Not all songs can hit this balance successfully , so props to the songwriters for this . And while no \" Bohemian Rhapsody , \" it is a lot more musically complex than most songs of today . Whatever happened to these songwriters anyhow ... \n\n A classic rock number that 's enjoying some newfound popularity thanks to \" Supernatural , \" this is a great song for both classic rock fans and \" Supernatural \" fans to enjoy ... or heck , any fans of quality music .

The keyboard ( or organ ) in it is fantastic but it just was n't what we were used to with her ... it was really different . And the video was kinda too . But the more I listened to it , the more I fell in love with the song ! Her voice was ( and still is ! ) very , very heartfelt . It starts out with your basic piano arrangement ; pretty ; lulling ; uncomplicated . Then comes in the \" organ \" and it 's nice ; fitting . But you continue on , hear the chorus twice , and then the beautiful bridge comes in , and once you 've heard it about 5x , you sing along ; \n\n \" I know - ow .... some people search the world ... \" \" To fi - ind ... somethin' like what we H A A A V E. \" \" I know - ow ... people will try ... try to define ... somethin' so R E E A L.

With that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this song , or . I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool , but make little sense when it comes to music . Music is a personal thing . It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself . Granted it is only a 30 second sample , but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music , or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version . If you want to listen to a sample , simply hover over the track you are interested in , and press the play button . I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was fairly cheap on Amazon .... 69 cents , I think ? But most of the songs I download are free .. That s right ! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums . A great way to construct an entire music library , and admittedly , the way I obtained most of my own music . But quite honestly , a wonderful way to explore new music , too . In fact , some of the songs that I ve obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band , and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag . Anyway ... enough of my rambling . This song is great ! At the very least , give it a 30 - second listen ? \n\n And do n't forget , if you are in the market for freebies , you can always check here \n\n FREE SONGS : \n From Amazon Home page -- > Shop by Department -- > ( Digital and Prime Music ) Deals -- > Songs by Price ( on left side of screen)--- > Free \n\n FREE ALBUMS : \n From Amazon Home page -- > Shop by Department -- > ( Digital and Prime Music ) Deals -- > Albums by Price ( on left side of screen)--- > Free","summary":"love, LoVe, LOVE! this song. :)","unixReviewTime":1452211200,"image":null}

Un - Break My Heart , is honestly one of Toni 's masterpieces from the sensual Secrets record . The song is definitely one of those songs that blends beauty , voice and soulfulness all into one , which Diane Warren had beautifully wrote for her . The song is absolutely one of a kind , and still sounds much more beautiful every time I heart it .

I remember being in my senior year in high school when I heard this song . When I saw the video to this song being played on one of the music channels there was something about it that drew me on(I just wish that I can remember if it was VH1 or MTV ) . Carlos made the right decision when he selected Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty to sing the vocals ( Rob has a great singing voice ) . The reason why I say this is because I noticed that in the music video Rob Thomas really put his spirit and emotion in giving the musical \" Smooth \" a vibrant life of its own . \" Smooth \" is a gorgeous song about a man who is willing to change his life to accomodate the woman he loves , and he is asking the woman in his life to make up her mind about him . He makes this clear with the clever and catchy lyrics \" so give me your heart , make it real , or else forget about it ) . I love and enjoy listening to Rob Thomas 's vocals in this song . In addition , I was imagining who this song was for , especially when Rob Thomas did a good job of using his voice of emphasizing the lyrics \" my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa \" When I found out later on that it was for his wife Marisol Thomas I was very moved and thought that was romantic and heartwarming . I say this because \" Smooth \" came out in 1999 . It is posted online that they met in 1998 and married in 1999 . At the time of this writing , they are still married ( which I think is so beautiful by the way , may they enjoy more joyful and loving years together ) . I admit that part of the reason why I still find this song enjoyable to listen to is because I enjoy hearing Rob Thomas 's singing ( Rob 's music and vocals first drew me in with the 1997 Matchbox 20 musical hit \" Push \" ) . The best way to choose whether you are going to love this song is if you enjoy music by either Rob Thomas , Carlos Santana , and\/or romantic alternative rock songs .","summary":"One Smooth Song","unixReviewTime":1297382400,"image":null}

Kristofferson and Joplin had a close personal relationship and , while the song was not written explicitly for her , the tune fits Ms. Joplin 's style very well . Her voice is neither smooth nor melodic - it reminds me very much of Billie Holliday 's voice . And , like Lady Day , with Ms. Joplin it is n't about the tonality she brings to her work ; it 's the ( to coin a too - oft used word ) soul she expends when singing . Many singers can bring feeling into a ballad ; very few can make the listener want to weep in sympathy with the singer 's obvious pain and loneliness . Sinatra , most certainly ; he spent over 60 years with his main theme being loneliness ( or the brief intermission of a new love before loneliness returned ) . Billie Holliday ; her life was filled with pain both physical and emotional and she brought every ounce of it into her work . And Janis Joplin , whose body of work is small in the number of recordings but huge in the personality she embedded in the canon . \" Me And Bobby McGee \" ( recorded a few days before Ms. Joplin 's death in 1970 ) is a fine example of her music . While the writing may not be necessarily on a par with , for instance , Cole Porter 's work one must consider the different genre that Messrs. Kristofferson and Foster worked in . I highly recommend this recording - with the caveat that I have a personal emotional tie in to the record . I was freshly back in the United States ( just a few months ) from the Vietnam war when Ms. Joplin passed away leaving this last piece with which to be remembered and her passing hit me with nearly the force of a physical blow . I had listened to her songs when I was with the U.S. Army and her loss at the age of 27 was hard to deal with - even though I had never met her in person . Others who do not have direct experience of the 1960 's may not bring the memories that those of us who lived through it to songs of that era - but I think that this particular song of Ms. Joplin 's has stood the test of time and stands on it 's own merit . \n\n HTH \n\n Regards , \n\n Jim","summary":"It's Janis Joplin.

The song is absolutely very bold and brilliant from what the song captures through Toni 's voice , and is honestly one of my favorites from Toni top to bottom . While people will always go back into Diane 's other big one from Toni , Un - Break My Heart , this song is definitely worth a deep listen from the seductive soul .

This musical track is a very energetic and dance \/ pop creation about someone imagining what it would be like to be the lover of someone that they really desire . Sophie puts alot of soul and energy in this song in a very creative and intense way . I love how she paints a good story in her songs such as when she mentions while singing that she had a dream that she was the hero of the one she very much wants . She also makes it fun by mentioning about making her fantasy lover \" feel much better \" . What makes this musical track even more appealing is that Sophie sings really beautiful vocals to go along with the great lyrics to the song . \" Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover \" compares to two of the following other songs of Sophie B. Hawkins in a good way : \n \" As I Lay Me Down\"- A great musical track about how she appreciates her lover and intends to always be happy . This is such a beautiful song , and the video I saw to this on youtube is very good . \" Right Beside You\"- This is also another song that showcases her gorgeous voice , and she sings with the same passion and great spirit as \" Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover . \" \n\n   If you happen to like \" As I Lay Me Down \" and\/or \" Right Beside You \" then it is most likely that you are going to the fine musical melody that is \" Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover \" .","summary":"A Good Song with Fine Vocals","unixReviewTime":1297036800,"image":null}

It turns out that the vocals are sung by Trace Cyrus ( Miley Cyrus 's older brother ) . Although Trace is only 19 years old he really sings this song in a very self confident and mature way . Admittedly this is a song that you may not want to expose to somebody that is under 13 because the song has sexual undertones to it . The reason why I say this is because the song still has appropriate language to it but he sings about being on the bed with someone and their clothes on the floor ( to his credit creatively ) . He also suggests in the song how he will take someone home if he 's not left at the front door . However what makes the song great is that he sings the song creatively , self confidently , and narratively . The reason why is say that he sings this narratively is because it sounds like he is telling a short story about charming someone he is interested in while making sure to combine the singing in seamlessly . I agree with the others that say this is a good workout song too because the music is really   upbeat and sounds like something you can easily dance to in the club or a party . It was also featured on one of the reality tv shows I was watching on mtv one night that features Lauren Conrad . All in all if you are fine with songs that have a dance pop twist and you are curious to listen to how Trace Cyrus sounds then in my opinion you will like this song .","summary":"Shake It to the sound of Metro Station","unixReviewTime":1226361600,"image":null}

Nope , just good old fashioned fun and dance . And it 's catchy , whether this is a good thing , since it got it from its over simplistic nature , is a different story . This could be the surprise song of the year , in a year full of surprises , because let 's admit it , did anybody see this song becoming a national hit ? I mean , any top 10 hit is given a BPM , and sent to the clubs , and sometimes your radio . These songs are cheap shots at great music , and I take them as an insult . I mean , I ca n't tell whether we 're supposed to dance or laugh at these \" re - mixes . \" \n\n \" Shake It \" is simple on the verses , which is typical of Metro Station , but they bring it on the chorus , and they bring it home in a big way . The chorus is catchy , fun , happy and it could start a new dance craze , if their was more of a dance to create . So overall , the verses are n't that great , but the chorus is what makes the song . It might not be original , but it 's fun . Here 's to the continued success of \" Shake It \" and Metro Station . And remember , get your groove on and \" Shake , Shake , Shake , Shake , Shake It ! \"","summary":"Shake It The Right Way","unixReviewTime":1215388800,"image":null}

The three - chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them . It 's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it .

Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy . In the review for the song itself , allmusic.com wrote \" The lush power ballad \" The Flame \" was penned by two British songwriters , but the band made it their own with Robin Zander 's sobbing vocal dramatics and the haunting tones of Rick Nielsen 's mandocello chiming behind the guitar and keyboard backing . The lyrics , almost always an afterthought in romantic power ballads , often hint at the Police\/\"Every Breath You Take \" 's school of disguising unhealthy obsession as sentimentality ; the singer , unable to let go of his first love , which can be taken either as a scorned lover trying to see his failed romance as somehow cosmically ordained anyway , or as a vaguely disturbing intimation of stalking . It 's more likely that the latter interpretation was completely unintentional , though , since the band 's straight - ahead reading plays up the heartstring - tugging bombast . It was a perfect fit for the late-'80s ' power ballad \/ happy pop radio , and it was much better crafted than many similar offerings from the same period ( most of which were by bands who had been influenced , indirectly or otherwise , by Cheap Trick themselves ) . While it is n't the most inventive song the band ever recorded , \" The Flame \" is an undeniable part of their legacy , and a well - deserved , better - late - than - never , chart - topping popular success","summary":"GREAT SONG","unixReviewTime":1357603200,"image":null}

Not only was Blake Lewis 's debut flat - out amazing and underrated , but due to the meat grinder that is radio , this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road . Today , this song blends right into the radio wasteland . While her vocals are still good , it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing . I mean really , I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality , but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo ? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available ? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is .

From 1956 through 1974 , he placed over 40 singles on Billboard 's Hot 100 Singles chart . Eight of these tunes made their way into the Billboard Top Ten . During those same years , Williams was a dominent force on the Album charts as well . He placed nearly 30 albums in the Top 100 and many of these albums remained on the charts for a year or more ! Andy Williams was also the host of his own highly rated variety show on NBC for nearly a decade . You might be surprised to learn that \" Moon River \" was never released as a single . Rather it appeared on Williams ' phenomenally successful 1962 album \" Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes \" which remained on the Billboard Album charts for an amazing 176 weeks . He sang the first few bars of the song each week to open his TV show and decades later would name his theater in Branson , MO after it . Here 's to one of the greatest and most popular \" easy listening \" recordings of all - time !","summary":"His signature song.","unixReviewTime":1467763200,"image":null}

The message of the song is that anyone struggling with a lack of self - esteem should remember that inner beauty counts for quite a lot and that other people 's criticism and lack of respect for someone should be ignored as long as they 're a good person on the inside .

Two vocalists trade off on this piece ( female and male ) , accompanied by guitar , drum , strings orchestration , and clarinet here and there ( I believe ) . There 's also an blues - style electric organ in the background . The rhythm is good and pretty evenly paced throughout . Interesting mix of classical strings , acoustic guitar , blues electric organ and a jazzy clarinet . Each providing a light touch of different genres . Who would have thought of putting this all together and that it would blend well . I like the voices , the male voice is baritone and has a slightly rough edge that is an interesting contrast to his female counterpart ( and does n't sound like all the other male voices I 've heard ) . This could easily have been a non - Christmas piece . If you like country , or blues and\/or light rock , I think you would enjoy this a lot .","summary":"interesting mix","unixReviewTime":1259971200,"image":null}

But while their debut was a wonderful collection of terrific songs--\"Evil Ways , \" Jingo , \" \" Persuasion\"--they were an even better live band .

The booklet included with this is great with alot of comments from Greg Rolie , the original keyboardist and singer .

My only complaint is the measly 38 minutes , I think there could have been more songs added , but other than that it 's a good CD for starters .","summary":"Wow!","unixReviewTime":1182470400,"image":null}

The only nod to jazz is the Porgy & Bess number \" My Man 's Gone Now \" . Although Ms. Simone can tend to be self indulgent at times , she reins in that tendency here with a selection of songs ( 4 are self penned ) that really fit the Blues theme which is very fitting to her style and persona . The arrangements are also excellent with a tight band that supports but does not overwhelm the songs - no strings , no brass . My favorite thing here is a rollicking barrelhouse version of \" House of the Rising Sun \" , completely unlike the version made famous by The Animals . While not everything works as well as that , there is never any doubt about NS 's commitment to the material .","summary":"... always been difficult to classify although this album is pretty close to a straight ahead R&B \/ Soul outin ...","unixReviewTime":1460937600,"image":null}

As Nancy advances toward her September years her voice has mellowed , gotten richer and even more beautiful . Her newer CD RSVP is another fine example of her later talent . On this CD , the song \" Love I Found You \" is the stunner on this set .

Black 's Killin ' Time initially established him as the biggest of the new stars , with hits like \" A Better Man , \" \" Nobody 's Home , \" and the title track . These songs showcased Black 's clever wordplay amid fairly traditional honky tonk arrangements and a Haggardesque vocal style . While it was n't long before Black was surpassed commercially by Brooks and Jackson , his music maintained a high standard during his RCA tenure that was highlighted by 29 top ten hits . Black 's two Greatest Hits volumes were both frustrating affairs whose new material - aside from the haunting chart - topper \" Like The Rain \" - was subpar . This chronologically arranged , 20 - track collection concentrates on his biggest chart hits , including the lush \" Loving Blind \" and the heartbreaking \" Where Are You Now \" ( number ones inexplicably left off those other sets ) . The only non - single found here is the jazzy Bruce Hornsby duet \" Dixie Lullaby . \" As it sounds a lot like the enclosed Steve Wariner pairing \" Been There \" ( which it precedes ) , its selection is suspect .

The opening track , In the bleak midwinter , is a wonderful old English carol and it 's great to hear this sung by an American - a rare occurrence . Rocking is another old English carol , one that is particularly suited to this album , being both a holiday song and a lullaby . All through the night is a carol I 've heard before but recordings of it seem to be even rarer than Rocking and In the bleak midwinter . Elsewhere , there are beautiful songs such as Windy nights ( words by Robert Louis Stevenson ) , All the pretty li'l horses , Little road to Bethlehem and Love came down at Christmas .

Given the pressure of the prison shows , not to mention their tailor - made set lists , this recording finds Cash less on - edge , providing a more accurate rendering of his then - current stage show . Everyone but a very pregnant June Carter Cash is on - board , including the Tennessee Three ( Marshall Grant , W.S. Holland and Bob Wooten ) , Carl Perkins , Tommy Cash , The Statler Brothers and The Carter Family ( including Mother Maybelle , and daughters Helen and Anita ) . The set list covers many of Cash 's most beloved songs ( including a quartet of prison tunes , and a barn - burning take of \" Wreck of the Old 97 \" ) , plus a generous helping of historical and folk classics , including Jane Bowers \" Remember the Alamo \" ( recorded throughout the ' 50s and ' 60s by The Kingston Trio , Donovan , Willie Nelson and others ) . The ease and confidence with which Cash presents himself on stage is astounding , and more in evidence than in the live prison recordings . Spoken introductions to songs like \" Five Feet High and Rising \" pull everything together into a seamless presentation . Similarly , Cash 's generous revue staging allows his compatriots -- each headliners in their own right -- to shine brightly . Carl Perkin 's blazes through \" Blue Suede Shoes , \" The Statler Brothers sing a lively version of their crossover hit \" Flowers on the Wall , \" and the Carter Family performs a beautiful pair of songs from A.P. Carter 's catalog ( \" Wildwood Flower \" \" Worried Man Blues \" ) . Cash 's sister - in - law , Helen Carter , provides a wonderfully warm introduction to the Carter Family segment . The closing medley provides each member of the troupe a chance to give their twist on a Cash landmark . Johnny and his brother Tommy sing \" Do What You Do , Do Well , \" The Carter Family sings \" I Walk the Line , \" The Statler Brothers take on \" Ring of Fire , \" and Carl Perkins finds the rockabilly heart of \" Folsom Prison Blues . \" Cash closes out the show with a snippet of \" The Rebel - Johnny Yuma , \" and yet another reprise of \" Folsom Prison Blues . \" The crowd 's thunderous applause draws an encore of \" Suppertime . \" \n\n This is a beautiful ( and generous : 77 minute ! ) stereo recording of a stage master at the peak of his powers , singing and speaking to an enthusiastic sell - out crowd . It is at once incredibly intimate and incredibly grand .

An entire album of prevously unreleased live Johnny Cash goodies from his commercial heyday in 1969 , repeating the success of his earlier concert albums , but here performing for the city slickers in the Big Apple . Johnny is joined by the reconstituted Carter Family , brother Tommy Cash , the Statler Brothers ( who he was a patron of ... )   and fellow Sun Records veteran Carl Perkins ( as we hear on a   track intro at the very end of the album , June Carter Cash was n't able to attend as she was six months pregnant at the time ... ) It 's an efficient , professional   presentation , yet one that gives some nice glimpses into Cash 's inner life , mostly through the spoken introductions that accompany many of the songs . The most telling is the intro to \" Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream , \" in which Cash addresses the thorny issue of the Vietnam War . Stumbling nervously , hoping not to offend anyone one way or the other , Cash recalls how he and his show went to entertain the troops overseas , declaring , \" I may not be a hawk ... He also introduces a few songs with asides about his down - home background ; back then , these monologes may have been a bit hokey , but they 've added resonance as Cash has gotten older and his legend increased . Also of interest is an angry , emotional reading of his Native American rights protest song , \" As Long As Grass Shall Grow , \" which is one of the most powerful performances of Cash 's career . There are also plenty of religious tunes , which he also puts his heart into . There are some rushed moments , but on the whole , this is an album well worth checking out , and certainly a delight for longtime Cash fans who have never heard this material before .","summary":"Cash and family playing at their peak","unixReviewTime":1031270400,"image":null}
