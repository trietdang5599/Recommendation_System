ACTDPSHFSWRD1,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,"Have you ever just been driving in your car and you hear those first few notes and all of a sudden you are overcome with emotion.  You begin driving with one hand, the other is now a microphone or a very vivid gesturer of your feelings.  Your voice begins without you realizing, singing along with all of the memories of past best friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, and imaginary friends swimming in front of your eyes.  Then you realize that you are crying as you sing at the loudest your emotion allows. Two hands on the wheel now, clinging while you say whoa-oa-oa. Then your hand returns, holding up a hush finger to your memory, ""Don't speak!"" you wail.  The words all come to you and for about five minutes you are overcome.  Wherever you are, red light, freeway, parking lot, side streets, or waiting for the song to end before you leave your car because you are at your destination, you sing.

A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000WTUV7Q,1,1,5,"""One Day at a Time"" is one of my favorite classic country songs because Ms. Lane has such a lovely voice that is both relaxing and inspirational. This is a very unique song because it has an extremely powerful message that everyone will enjoy. It's also a unique song about religion and Jesus' comfort and support which is one of the only songs of its kind to become a crossover top-10 pop hit. I especially enjoy how Ms. Lane picks up her pitch as she sings the chorus. Although the song is almost 30 years old, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys country, pop or inspirational music.",""" One Day at a Time "" is one of my favorite classic country songs because Ms. Lane has such a lovely voice that is both relaxing and inspirational .

This song should have been longer with some sort of instrumental solo in the middle and at the end fading away slowly in conjunction with the other instruments. None the less I like this type of song from Nelly. I've been a fan off Nelly since she started in the late 90's. I was in high school and normally listened to rock music like Guns N' Roses, Metalica, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd etc. I hated when she changed to more ""dirty"" type music. But she had to grow up and wish she would make more of this types of songs. This is more classy Nelly and I like a well orchestrate song with melodies. U need to listen very carefully to the song with your headphones to appreciate not just the lyrics, but the instruments and how they were tied together. GOOD MUSIC!","This is a very nice song .

I first heard this band in 1999 when I purchased their album ""Plugged In Permanent"" on Metal Blade/Hypnotic Records. 11 years later, I am listening to ""This Is Thirteen"" on VH1 Classic Records. evidently, Anvil is more concerned about having fun than making money. also, they have had basically the same image on their albums with the exception of one album. it should also be noted that they are obsessed with the number 3, as all their albums have 3 word titles.

I mean come on.  Both of those tapes were consistently plugged into my car's deck back then.  I have since been able to obtain that early Anvil stuff on CD and I still love it.

So I picked this new one up partly because that documentary The Story of Anvil was awesome!  And I have to say I am impressed with Thirteen as well.  I agree with everything Lips was pitching when they were shopping this record around in the movie, it is great stuff.  The CD cover is blah, but the music is what matters.  I am not going to be overly critical of the music like some people have been because bottom line this is rock 'n roll, it has passion, and some great riffing, and it is Anvil and they are BACK.

Keeping with tradition, Lewis starts out his show by busting on the city he's performing in. This time around he busts on Minnesota and his bit on their cold weather is hysterical. As usual, he's spot on when it comes to tackling issues like greed in big business and society's obsession with health. In particular, his commentary on milk and water are very funny. However, the end of the album is dominated by his views on Iraq. While his commentary is accurate, it does tend to drag at times. All told, Rules of Enragement is a very good album even if it tends to be too political near the end.","Lewis Black 's third album , Rules of Enragement , is his first release where his material really became more political .

A356RFKNIG043B,B000X6ZBCS,1,1,5,"JG has definitely got it all going on here. The material is crisp, his delivery and timing are perfect, and his ""little voice of confused audience member"" thing is a genius idea that he uses to full effect. His wry accents and pregnant pauses are unbeatably tight.

I love all of his dvds and cds, but DMT may be his funniest. [I will say, however, that I've never seen a comedian milk the same bits over and over on so many different cds. Nearly every bit he's ever done is on at least two and sometimes three or four different cds, providing less value than one might want. In that light, I'd recommend this, King Baby and Beyond The Pale, as they have almost every bit from his first four or so collections as well as new material.]

No other American comic seems as adept at pointing out our endless national foibles yet making them seem so endearingly moronic. Hot Pockets is pricelessly funny; I almost fall over laughing every time I hear it. In fact, to avoid that today I woke up and decide to start the week off right by laying in bed five minutes longer and listening to Hot Pockets on headphones. As usual I cracked up time and again, but was fortunately unable to fall over. I did roll over a few times though. Any comedian who can make me crack up time and again at the same bit is clearly doing something right. Bill Hicks and Carlin and Chris Rock can, and a very few others. Jim's in that small group, no doubt.

Great comedy is a combination of smart material, timing, and that x factor that separates the good from the great. Gaffigan's defintiely got them all going on.","JG has definitely got it all going on here . The material is crisp , his delivery and timing are perfect , and his "" little voice of confused audience member "" thing is a genius idea that he uses to full effect . His wry accents and pregnant pauses are unbeatably tight . I love all of his dvds and cds , but DMT may be his funniest . [ I will say , however , that I 've never seen a comedian milk the same bits over and over on so many different cds . Nearly every bit he 's ever done is on at least two and sometimes three or four different cds , providing less value than one might want . In that light , I 'd recommend this , King Baby and Beyond The Pale , as they have almost every bit from his first four or so collections as well as new material . ] No other American comic seems as adept at pointing out our endless national foibles yet making them seem so endearingly moronic . Hot Pockets is pricelessly funny ; I almost fall over laughing every time I hear it . In fact , to avoid that today I woke up and decide to start the week off right by laying in bed five minutes longer and listening to Hot Pockets on headphones . As usual I cracked up time and again , but was fortunately unable to fall over . I did roll over a few times though .

I have been guitly of the Hot Pocket purchase.  Always sound like a great Idea for a quick snack/lunch, but can be exactly as described by Jim Gaffigan.  His newer CD, Beyond the Pale, has The Hot Pocket skit on there as well, but this is the longer edition and original. Also, this is a set with CD and DVD.  Both CD's Are great and have new different material on each, but If you have to buy one, this one would be the first one to pick up.

A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000X6ZBCS,1,1,5,"Comedy CDs are an iffy recommendation.  What's funny today might bore you tomorrow.  Some jokes are only funny the first time.  Jim Gaffigan's CD, ""Doin' My Time,"" scores high on the replay factor.  Perhaps it's his delivery (dry self-deprecation with a twist of smug).  Perhaps it's his avant-garde style of humor (he spends about a quarter of the time pretending to be a critical female member of his own show, weaving ""her"" comments with his).  Perhaps it's just his voice, which has a malleable whine to it that never gets annoying and which makes his self-mockery seem humorously authentic instead of just patronizing or pathetic.

Part of it is definitely the humor itself.  Whether his jokes make bizarre 180's (""I used to smoke.  Yeah.  Smoking's real addictive.  But you know what's REALLY addictive?  Heroin.""), or whether their humor lies in their dead ends; whether they take the ""didja ever notice?"" concept and snap it in half (his ""Hot Pocket"" and bottled water/Mexican food bits are a good example of this), or whether they're just plain crude, grouchy, silly and dumpy, they all stand up to repeated listenings.  There are a few times where you get the impression that the joke -- such as his bit on glasses -- would work a lot better if you could see the man (and, in fact, most of them are like that; Jim is almost as much fun to watch as he is to listen to), but none of them fail to be laugh-worthy because of it.  Pasty, flabby, and grumpy, though he may be, Jim Gaffigan is also a funny, funny man, and this is a funny, funny CD.

(NOTE: This product comes with a short DVD of his Comedy Central appearance, which is much cleaner than the act to be found on the CD.)","Comedy CDs are an iffy recommendation .

A2EA0E30XG0M0F,B000XXZ31K,1,1,4,"Angels & Airwaves continues forward with their 80s-tinged blending of punk vocals, anthemic and chest-beating U2 choruses, and the guitar shadings and conceptual nature of classic Pink Floyd. All in all, some of my favorite musical touchstones that have been part of the soundtrack to my life.

""Call To Arms"" opens in classic AvA style, widescreen and epic, beautiful chiming guitars and pulsing keyboards building up into a huge song with big choruses and gorgeous Hammond organ.

""Everything's Magic"" has become sort've ""our song"" between my girlfriend and I. I heard it for the first time just days before we met, and it was played quite a bit in the car during our first few months. Everytime we hear it come on in a department store or the mall, we give eachother this look and a smile that is priceless. There's a nice pop-punk quality to it (which is different from anything on their first album), although the chorus is a pure adrenaline rush reminescent of early Asia.

""Love Like Rockets"" is another ""classic AvA"" song, with those trademark sequenced keyboards and drums. The intro is perfectly epic, utilising sound samples of President Eisenhower, astronauts, and various radio chatter and feedback that brings to mind the Space Race of the 50's and 60's. Tom seems to be making a parallel between the giddy rush of new love, and launching on a rocket into an unknown frontier.

""Breathe"" is sort've a ballad with nice soft keyboards. ""Sirens"" is fast-paced and frenetic and the chorus reminds me of The Proclaimers. ""Secret Crowds"" has a huge chorus, although I love the music and words during the verses a bit more. ""Star of Bethlehem/True Love"" was originally recorded for a compilation CD in late 2006, and is mixed a little differently on I-Empire. Another mini-epic, with trancey sequencers and Edge-like guitar effects. ""Lifeline"" has a keyboard sound that immediately brought me fresh memories of 1985, considering that it sounded exactly like the intro to Reading Rainbow.

""Jumping Rooftops"" is a cut-and-pasted percussion and keyboard interlude that leads into ""Rite of Spring"", which is another relatively experimental song, sounding more raw and punky as Tom reflects on his teenage life. (He said that he wanted to write a song that would sound like a garage band's first tune, written in high school.) The album ends with ""Heaven"", reprising musical and lyrical themes from ""Valkyrie Missile"", the opening track on We Don't Need To Whisper, effectively ending the two-album concept and bringing things full circle.

The lyrics continue in the same vein of We Don't Need To Whisper, and are positively infectious in their optimistic spiritual outlook, topics of reformation and reinvention, living your dreams, and never giving up. This is a message that I wish more Top 40 bands would preach, and is vastly needed during the hard times we live in. Being a grounded but optimistic person myself (as well as having a love for the 80's, Sci-Fi, and prog-rock), this band is perfect blend of my favorite things.

Overall, I-Empire sounds quite a bit like their last album, although has a couple of curveballs and is a little more organic sounding. New bassist Matt Wachter (formerly of 30 Seconds To Mars) and guitarist David Kennedy don't stand out too much (being buried behind layers of effects and keyboards, not to mention Tom's own playing), but drummer Atom Willard continues with greatness previously seen before, with a fiery, explosive energy, awesome fills, and a rhythmic groove that very nearly puts him in the ""virtuoso"" category. Check out his electronic/acoustic percussion showcase throughout the first few minutes of ""Star of Bethlehem/True Love"" (notably performed just as perfect in a live setting when I caught the band live in early 2008.)

The album artwork is a departure from the last one, instead featuring a painted montage (by Drew Struzan, famous movie poster artist of Lucas and Spielberg) of the band over a sunset horizon. Yet another reference to a positive 80's childhood.

If AvA fans can't get enough of this type of sound, I'd strongly recommend some other prog-rock bands such as Pendragon (Believe or Pure), 30 Seconds To Mars, It Bites (The Tall Ships or The Big Lad In The Windmill), Rush (Grace Under Pressure or Power Windows), dredg, Coheed & Cambria and Asia.","Angels & Airwaves continues forward with their 80s - tinged blending of punk vocals , anthemic and chest - beating U2 choruses , and the guitar shadings and conceptual nature of classic Pink Floyd .

I also wonder if Tom's heart is really in this material considering it was released only a year after their first album.

While none of the songs are bad, the songs that stand out the most are the final two tracks: ""Rite of Spring"" and ""Heaven"". The opening track ""Call to Arms"" is pretty good too, as are the instrumentals ""Jumping Rooftops"" and ""Star of Bethlehem"". I-Empire is still satisfying enough for rock fans, but there's really nothing extraordinary here either. B.I.F.

A26O6MQFA36WBK,B000XXZ31K,1,1,4,"Angels and Airwaves was a band that was created by former Blink 182 singer/guitarist Tom Delonge and his ambition to create something truly different was very admirable. The band's debut CD, We Don't Need to Whisper, was a very good CD that unfortunately suffered from a bit of a slow pace and some weak lyrics. But still, it was a great start and I was very interested to see the band's follow up CD, I-Empire. I-Empire (called by Tom ""the ""part 2"" to We Don't Need to Whisper) is a much faster CD that's a lot more accessible and easier to like. The music on here is really uplifting, and it's perfect music for playing VERY loud, especially on a nice sound system or while driving fast in a car. It's definitely a much better CD than the 1st effort. That said, though, it still suffers from some of the flaws of We Don't Need to Whisper; the lyrics have not improved; in fact, they've gotten even a bit worse. I think Tom needs a new approach to his lyric writing for this band; I thought it was weird during their first CD that the music is this futuristic, very ""epic and different"" in style, and presented itself as a grandoise and epic masterpiece...yet the songs were about ""your best friend is not your girlfriend"" ...it didn't work. I-Empire's faster music fits its lyrics a lot better, but unfortunately, the lyrics on here are often extremely corny, and almost every single song's a love song. I really wish Tom would try to sing about something else, as his ""I love you, you make me feel alive"" lyrics really started to get old for me on this CD. Blink 182's self-titled final CD featured some excellent lyrics and the songs showed real variety in their subject matter; Angels and Airwaves is about love, that's it. Only a couple tracks on this CD seem to deviate from that. That aside, though, this CD shows much more variety in the songs and much more exciting music and it easily makes it a more fun listen.

Call to Arms; 8/10. A very cool start to the CD. Some nice lyrics and a catchy chorus. A good song.

Everything's Magic; 7/10. Another good song, a very fast-paced and fun song; the lead single. Features great music that sounds a bit like Blink 182's Anthem Part 2. The chorus isn't too great, though.

Breathe; 8/10; A very nice song musically. The first slow song on the CD yet it's not unbearably slow. It's a little repetative lyrically, (he says ""I love you"" over 16 times in it,) but it's a really nice and ambient song. Well-done.

Love Like Rockets; 7/10; Although the subject matter of the song's a little stupid when you think about it, it's a cool-sounding and ""different"" song with a pretty cool chorus. The song's got a cool space-like theme to it. The ""imagine"" line's pretty cool. Overall, it works. Has a cool, powerful ending, too.

Sirens; 7/10; Took me a while to get used to this song, (the ""dadadadada"" lyrics got on my nerves at first,) but now it's actually pretty good. The whole song's very catchy and the verses are sung very well. Good lyrics, actually.

Secret Crowds; 6/10; This is more of a ""rock song,"" that sounds like it'd be perfectly played in a football stadium. It's not too bad lyrically, (providing the theme for the CD; ""If I had my own world, I'd build you an empire,"")and the verses are pretty nice, but there's unfortunately no hook here; the big refrain of the song doesn't have any sort of tune, it just features Tom singing slower and louder. It needed more of a tune or a hook. The band obviously disagrees, though, since this is currently the planned 2nd single.

Star of Bethlehem; 7/10; When Angels and Airwaves first played this song live, it was an epic, 6-minute plus song with a very long instrumental at the beginning with the lyrics eventually kicking in at about the 3-minute mark. For the CD, the song was wisely split up; most of the long instrumental takes place in this song, while the rest of the song kicks in on the next track, True Love. This is a pretty cool instrumental, both atmospheric and fast, as well as very memorable. Goes very well with the next song.

True Love; 8/10; Another great song, with a very fast chorus and featuring the continuing instrumental from the previous song. Lyrics are pretty cool. Another song that's definitely got more of a ""rock"" sound to it. Well-done.

Lifeline; 3/10; Really irritating song, the only bad one on the CD. Tom's vocals on this song are horrible; he REALLY strains on it and it just sounds very forced and corny. Really bad lyrics, too. Easily the worst song on the 2 CD's. Musically it's pretty weak, too. The verses have a good tune but unfortunately Tom's strained vocals end up making the song pretty intolerable.

Jumping Rooftops; NA/10; a cool little techno intermission as we transition into the powerful final tracks on the CD.

Rite of Spring; 8/10; It's hard for me to give this an 8/10 because the lyrics are really horrible; it's too bad because it's actually very good subject matter; Tom talking about his life, with a really cool chorus and verses; overall a very catchy and really impressive song musically, but the lyrics are pretty awful. Tom tries to rhyme to really bad results, and we end up with a song that tries to rhyme ""pass"" with ""cash"" and lines like ""it took about an hour to start a punk rock band, to offset my ****** up family land."" Had he not tried to rhyme I think we would have ended up with a MUCH better song lyrically, but still, it's a great song and one of the most memorable on the CD.

Heaven; 10/10; An excellent end to I-Empire with the best lyrics on the CD. It starts by sampling distorted clips from past Angels and Airwaves songs, then speeds up. Very great musically, very good lyrically. Serves almost as a part 2 to the apocalyptic Valkyrie Missile from We Don't Need to Whisper and it's overall a cool closing to the story told on the band's first 2 CD's.

Angels and Airwaves have greated a great ""part 2"" to their first CD that's both faster and more fun. Now that they've finished this story, though, I hope their next CD's something completely different entirely, especially in the lyrical department. I'd like to see this band sing about some different subjects at some point. Easily recommended for anyone who'se ever been a fan of Tom's work in the past of if you like this ""stadium rock"" genre.

That said, I have to end this review on a negative note. After listening to the recently released ""In Defense of the Genre"" CD by rock band Say Anything, I've gotta say that THIS is a band whose lyrics are real, whose lyrics are True to life and whose lyrics are layered and very deep, and whose lyrics really mean something to the band. Tom Delonge's lyrics for Angels and Airwaves, on the other hand, are so far removed from any type of reality and are so formulaic and so cliche'd that it gives his songs the depth of a shallow pool...it's like listening to the boy bands of the 1990's again....yeesh. He just seems unwilling (or unable) to stretch himself at all in this category and it was such a step down on this CD from Whisper, which was itself a step down from where Blink left off from on their excellent final CD. The lack of emotional weight on these songs and True hooks ended up making the CD fairly forgettable. I liked Rite of Spring a lot because despite its horrible lyrics, it was nice to hear Tom finally sing about something that was obviously real life. Despite these complaints, this gets a 4-star rating. It's a good CD and fans of Angels and Airwaves fans SHOULD definitely check it out. But don't expect it to remain in your CD players for long....It's more exciting than Whisper, but just not nearly as memorable. Here's hoping the band switches gears with their next CD.","Angels and Airwaves was a band that was created by former Blink 182 singer / guitarist Tom Delonge and his ambition to create something truly different was very admirable .

I was a fan from their first cd ""We Don't Need To Whisper"" with ""I-Empire"" the guys have firmly established themselves in this music industry and can/will only go up from here.  As this cd is one that can't be ignored by folks at all.  Loving the cd from beginning to end it flows from one track to the next with an ease that you seldom experience.

Its done while having fun and going through different moods from tracks like "" Everything 's Magic "" its fun and irressitible song for them to "" Star of Bethlehem "" a two minute interlude ... unlike other interludes on other albums this one actually warrants listening to . I was a fan from their first cd "" We Do n't Need To Whisper "" with "" I - Empire "" the guys have firmly established themselves in this music industry and can / will only go up from here . As this cd is one that ca n't be ignored by folks at all . Loving the cd from beginning to end it flows from one track to the next with an ease that you seldom experience . First one was all that ... 2nd one is all that and so much more ! !"
A3M97WKI0FP3JF,B000XXZ31K,1,1,5,"Already, I-Empire is one of the best albums of the year (if not THE best).  Of all the CD's I've listened to this year, this one, by far, is very optimistic and uplifting, to say the least.  The anthemic, 80's synth-pop, stadium-rock sound works very well here.  And if it does sound formulaic, so be it!  Very heartfelt and inspirational too!  Tom DeLonge has definitely come a long way from his Blink-182 days, and I'm all the more glad for it!  Instead of the usual bratty, toilet humor, we get mature, ""reach for the sky"" sentiments, that is, keep going, no matter what happens to you in life.  Honestly, I think that's what we need more nowadays.  By the way, forget about that Rolling Stone critic who gave this fine CD only 2 1/2 stars.  According to the review, ""Blink-182 guitarist is all grown up and synth-poppy.  But is that a good thing?""  I certainly think so!

A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B000YBH2UG,1,1,5,"Up until now my favorite Daft Punk album has been the amazing Discovery, but this album is so good it gives it a run for its money. While most convert albums suffer a bit from the ""noise"" of the crowd's cheers, in this case they actually add to the experience rather than distracting.

Discovery was a sweet box of evolving melodies, but this is a driving, thrumming, buzzing beat box of awesome! I always loved how the melodies of Discovery melded into each other, making you want to listen to the entire album. This is a series of Daft Punk's best songs mixed together perfectly with enough wonderous glorious bass to benchmark any speaker system.

If I have a single complaint, it's the that the Close Encounters of the Third Kind opening is missing from the audio recording, and should be included. Other than that, listen to this and enjoy. It's awesome music for just listening, but it's REALLY great for exercise, doing chores, or (obviously) having a dance party. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.

Final note: If you have a record player the complete Alive Boxed Set is totally worth it as it includes a backstage pass, stickers, bonus tracks, a turntable pad, and a gorgeous art book.","Up until now my favorite Daft Punk album has been the amazing Discovery , but this album is so good it gives it a run for its money .

There's a great opener in ""Is There A Ghost"" that mixes both the dream-pop with an eventual cascade of guitsr, combing the band's strength in the best offering here.

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000YN32BM,1,1,4,"Last year, Band of Horses released a truly impressive debut album ""Everything All the time"", containing several instantly classic songs like ""The Funeral"" and ""The Great Salt Lake"". Despite pretty much non-stop touring since them the guys are back already with a new album.

""Cease to Begin"" (10 tracks, 35 min.) is an equally impressive album. The opener ""Is There A Ghost"" starts off very BoH-like, only to crash into electric guitars and very up-tempo about 1 minute into the song, bringing the message that these guys have expanded their musical pallet. ""Ode to Lag"" follows, with equally strong music. The good tracks keep coing: ""No One's Gonna Love You"" is a great pensive tune, as is ""Detlef Schrempf"" (yes, he the German former NBA basketball player), and ""The General Specific"" closes the first half of the album, an exuberrant tune. After a short instrumental, the second half kicks off with a rousing ""Islands On the Coast"", followed by a great, somber ""Marry Song"", with superb underlying keyboards. Yet the best is still to come! ""Cigarettes Wedding Bands"" is THE stand-out track of the album, sure proof how much BoH has matured musically in just a year's time. The closer ""Window Blues"" is too twangy/country for my liking, and the least interesting track on the album.

""Cease to Begin"" is an outstanding album, and equal, if not better, than ""Everything All the Time"". They have not so much abandoned their early-My Morning Jacket-soundalike style, but expanded on it, to great effect. I've had the good fortune of seeing Band of Horses last year during the ""Everything All the Time"" tour, and if you have a chance to see these guys in concert, don't miss them, you will be blown away.

ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,B000YOIQEY,1,1,5,"I've been listening to this album on and off for over a year now, and I just keep coming back to it. It's one of the best recordings of choral music I know. This is quite a remarkable achievement since a pairing up of Mozart and Gabriel Faur&eacute; really shouldn't work. But it does work, and work wonderfully.

Mozart's Vesperae Solennes blends into Faur&eacute;'s Requiem so seamlessly that the first few times I listened to the album, I had to check the track listing to make sure whether the Mozart had ended and the Faur&eacute; begun yet.

They do sound different, don't get me wrong, with over a hundred years between them. But both works, performed beautifully by The Sixteen (the choir) and the Academy of St-Martin-in-the-Fields, radiate a warm tranquility, and this mood carries over seamlessly from one to the other, across a century.

A really great disc, highly recommended.","I 've been listening to this album on and off for over a year now , and I just keep coming back to it .

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000YZSG1Q,1,1,4,"Currently Emilie Autumn's image/music tends towards... well, the best description I can come up with is Tim Burtonesque, industrial-goth-doll. But her debut album had a vastly different flavor -- while it has the same dark edges and spatterings of industrial rock here and there, ""Enchant"" is a more romantic, Victorian/medieval album.

It opens with an ethereal, twinkly expanse of sound, and Autumn intoning the first four lines from Shakespeare's 53rd sonnet. Then she launches into a starry rendition of her own poetry: ""Across the sky/I will come for you/If you ask me to/Demystify/Your uncommon dreams/Stranger things have come True...""

That opening song may give you the impression that Autumn is a sort of Delerium/Enigma artist, but she quickly proves that it's not the case. Instead, she dabbles in a little of everything: hard-rock in ""Chambermaid"" and the blaring ""Heard It All,"" some spacey jazz in ""Second Hand Faith,"" rambling piano ballads in ""Castle Down"" and ""Ever,""  dramatic string-soaked ballads in ""If You Feel Better"" and ""Save You."" It ends with the satiny ""Epilogue: What If,"" which just reinforces that Autumn is not someone you can pin easy labels on: ""What if I'm a snowstorm burning/What if I'm a world unturning/What if I'm an ocean, far too shallow, much too deep?""

Among the best songs are a trio of pop songs  which have a sort of medieval/fairy-tale flavor: ""Rapunzel"" is a bittersweet song about... well, Rapunze; and ""Juliet"" is an exquisite, glittering swirl about... well, Juliet. And ""Rose Red"" swings between a spiky pop sound (""Tell me no stories and I'll tell you no lies/No one wants to hurt me/but everybody tries!"") and a luscious ye-olde one (""Rose Rose Rose Red/Will I ever see thee wed?/Only if you can capture me"").

I probably could have guessed that ""Enchant"" was Autumn's first album without even checking wikipedia -- it sounds like she was experimenting with different styles and trying to figure out which one fit her best. You can hear some romantic goth, classical, hard-rock, jazz and a bit of Regina Spektor's anti-pop here. But ""Enchant's"" different styles flow easily into one another.

This is mainly because of Autumn's classical musical skills -- she winds silken strings of piano and violin around almost every song, along with some shimmering keyboard and the occasional blasts of electric guitar. The entire album has a sort of rock'n'roll Victorian-romantic flavor, and quite frankly that combination is something I wish there was more of.

Her voice is also very lovely and versatile: she can sound punky, angelic, or low and powerful. And her lyrics and poems are very evocative and atmospheric (""But would you tear my castle down/Stone by stone/And let the wind run through my windows/'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose""), and tinged with a sense of bittersweet romance.

While it explores various musical styles, ""Enchant"" has a distinctive flavor that shows off Emilie Autumn's talents -- and leaves you wanting to see whatever else she's produced.","Currently Emilie Autumn 's image / music tends towards ... well , the best description I can come up with is Tim Burtonesque , industrial - goth - doll .

A10S47RQ7EJHX6,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"I've been a fan of Type O ever since I first heard ""Blood & Fire"" on my Mortal Kombat soundtrack cassette when I was 10. When Peter Steele died, I felt like I had just lost an uncle. But enough with the biography, let's get on to the review...

I picked this album up when it first came out, and I honestly wasn't very impressed. I liked the fact that they had gone back to the long, complex song structures, but other than that, I really wasn't feeling it.

Recently, I started throwing this album in more often and found myself loving it more and more. At this point, I would have to say that it's my favorite next to Slow Deep and Hard, and Bloody Kisses. Musically, this album is a complete success. Their maturity really shows, and the gothic Beatles-esque melodies that were absent from Life is Killing Me have returned.

I would go so far to label these songs as ""beautiful"". With the exception of Halloween in Heaven (it's waaaay too cheesey), I would give these songs 9 and 10/10 each. My absolute favorites are: September Sun, These Three Things, She Burned Me Down, and Hail and Farewell to Britain. I may even have to say this album is tied for 2nd place with Bloody Kisses only because this album flows better where BK was kind of all over the place stylistically.

All in all, this is a great swansong to Peter Steele's amazingly unique career. Buy this. Set aside an hour or so and listen to this album as a whole. Loudly, I might add. It will not disappoint.","I 've been a fan of Type O ever since I first heard "" Blood & Fire "" on my Mortal Kombat soundtrack cassette when I was 10 .

ASVNSWIXBV72Q,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"All of Type O Negative's usual elements are still firmly in place on their seventh full-length. For example, really memorable, Sabbath-inspired guitar riffing, good solos, prominent, grumbling bass lines, Peter Steele's masculine yet limpid vocals (including a baritone that is so deep, it almost matches his bass sound), both humorous and depressing lyrics, creepy keyboards, well-written melodies, bullying grooves, gothic overtones, occasional psychedelic sounds, and solid drumming are all definitely very much apart of the band's famous arsenal.

But there is also an intangible something and feeling of greatness present on 2007's ""Dead Again,"" making it easily their finest release since 1996's iconic ""October Rust."" For one, there should be absolutely no question as to if Type O are just phoning it in and/or recycling old material (which was something that some fans believed to be the case on 1999's ""World Coming Down"" and 2003's ""Life Is Killing Me""), because they now sound as inspired, energetic, and all-around strong as ever! Plus, they can't be said to exactly reinvent the genre here, but thanks to the rather broad and sophisticated songwriting on display here, these 10 songs do possess a fairly refreshing  and unpredictable quality. The album shuffles back and forth between several different moods and genres, including really heavy doom metal, sludge, thrash (thus showing-off Steele's roots in the genre, as a founding member of Carnivore), goth metal, industrial, and progressive and traditional rock. It is viscerally heavy and frequently quite fast, yet (in True T.O.N. style), it also retains a certain level of control and tunefulness throughout. Suffice it to say, this is one very rewarding, well-rounded, and epically epic piece of music. In addition, at 77 minutes in length (!), it should be more than long enough to satiate all fans' appetites for the foreseeable future.

The terrifically ominous and choir-abetted intro of the title track begins thins on a creepy note. It then segues into propulsive speed metal territory -- a rollicking groove, strong bass work throughout, and a sing-song-y chorus to add catchiness. ""Tripping A Blind Man"" works similarly: An old-school Black Sabbath-meets-Eighties thrash (i.e., say, Megadeth) piece with a neat gothic keyboard beginning before suddenly becoming almost crushing and breakneck when blazing tempos, fast guitar leads, and an exceptional solo (near the end) slam onto the scene. ""The Profits Of Doom"" falls somewhere between My Dying Bride, Crowbar, Acid Bath, Deep Purple, and Alice In Chains. It is a slow and extremely progressive, slow-burning, brooding, and trance-inducing epic which nears the eleven minute mark and has thunderous, trudging power chords that weigh a ton, a beefy bottom-end completed by noteworthy, and dirty, grungy-sounding bass lines, and vocals that trade-off between growling, eerie spoken-words, and impressive, proper singing.

On the flip side, ""September Sun"" is a very pretty, somber, textured, tranquil, and emotionally-moving Alice Cooper-esque ballad that is peppered with cool piano keys, melodic strings, and warm and powerful crooning. The lyrics are also worth mentioning here, because they are so sad and dark that it wouldn't be surprising if they leave a lump in the listener's throat. Next up, ""Halloween In Heaven"" is much catchier and more accessible than usual. Here, a memorable, driving, stoner metal-ish main riff is accented nicely by soaring, clean backing female vocals. At fourteen and-a-half-minutes long, song number six, ""These Three Things,"" takes the cake for being the set's pinnacle and is possibly the biggest highlight to be found here. It is an extremely dark, goth-y, and stormy piece based primarily on droning guitars and muscular bass work, but it also makes sure to include numerous different facets, and lots of nice subtleties, atmosphere, and mood-enhancers.

Taking a break from their more experimental side, ""She Burned Me Down"" is more proof that, when they want to, Type O Negative can always kick out pure doom metal with the best of them, and is highlighted by excellent, mesmerizing riffage, emotional vocals, and a fiery and winding guitar solo. ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" again takes things into an up-tempo pace; in fact, one could argue it sounds kind of like a Motorhead tune. It is centered around storming (and sometimes almost punk-y) drumming (including a few bass kicks), call-and-response choruses, and a steadfastly meaty and sludgy bass bottom. The curiously entitled ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" boasts a leather-clad rock `n' roll vibe, tasty, crunchy, lumbering guitars, and Ozzy Osbourne-inspired singing. Finally, the closing ""Hail And Farewell To Britain"" once again downshifts into depressive doom territory, with a bass-heavy mix, big, fat, chugging guitar riffs, lock-step-unison rhythms, and a great keyboard solo.

Cutting to the chase, ""Dead Again"" is, quite simply, one very amazing album, and an essential listen. And it is the sound of a band that is easily firing on all cylinders; hence, contrary to its misleading title, it is also proof that this band has never sounded more alive/lively. However, in an oh-so-cruel twist-of-fate, Peter Steele passed away from heart failure in April 2010, at the age of 48. But even if we are faced with the sad truth that we will now never again hear anything new from T.O.N., at least fans can take solace in the fact that the frontman lead a remarkable career, and unquestionably went out on the absolute top.

A1M9WSTQ1M7IGX,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"I reviewed the green-version CD when it came out.  I'm saddened beyond words at the untimely loss of Peter Steele just last week.  I'm convinced he had a lot of great music ahead of him.  That said, it's my opinion that he went out absolutely on top with ""Dead Again"".  When this disc came out, I listened to it nearly continuously for two years--no lie.  I've never had such a strong reaction to any Type O Negative CD, not even ""Bloody Kisses"" and ""October Rust"", my two other favorites.  While there may be some Type O fans who might disagree with me, ""Dead Again"" is so phenomenal that it's practically beyond criticism.  The ""highs"" have never been higher, and the overall level of quality is tremendous, with the exception of ""She Burned Me Down"" which seems to go on a bit pointlessly.  Standout tracks include ""Dead Again,"" ""Tripping A Blind Man,"" ""Profits of Doom,"" ""September Sun,"" ""These Three Things,"" ""An Ode To Locksmiths,"" and ""All Hail And Farewell To Britain.""

I could be barking up the wrong tree, but I've long thought that Peter Steele has to have had significant exposure to classical music.  This isn't a new opinion for me, but his development as a songwriter suggests to me he was drawing on an awareness of symphonic masters.  Two tracks in particular bear this out.

""September Sun"" is an astonishing song that became something of an obsession.  The very first time I heard track four, I literally groaned and said to myself, ""they can't be serious!""  ""September Sun"" starts like a ""hair band"" power ballad, with a simple nice piano intro--totally not Type O. And then it occurred to me, knowing that this is Peter Steele, this has to be a joke and it's going to get turned inside out and trashed. And actually something very different happens.  Steele does something profoundly Brucknerian with ""September Sun""--he takes a very simple basic theme, expands upon it, puts it through a metamorphosis, and it ends up becoming something far more imposing, grander, astonishing, and even menacing, than you can have even been lead to believe it would become, by the time the song is over nearly 10 minutes later, and really takes you somewhere. ""September Sun"" has to be heard in its astonishing entirety, and for me it is an especially imposing, threatening, beautiful, and entirely unnerving piece of music. It haunts me while still blowing me away.

""These Three Things"" is also a musical standout (I usually don't pay attention to the words, and listening to Peter Steele rant against abortion is more humorous than anything else--and it was not intended as a joke).  At just under 15 minutes, it's the longest song that Type O ever recorded.  And unlike some of their lengthier songs which are really just a collection of several smaller songs strung together, ""These Three Things"" takes musical ideas and works them out over the length of the song, transforming them by the end.  Beyond the drone introduction, the initial section of the song is musically one of the most brutal things that Type O has ever done--relentless, overpowering, and raw.  And then the music takes a 180, introduces a new musical theme, and then transforms it over the remainder of the song.  I wasn't overwhelmed by ""These Three Things"" initially, but almost more than any other song on this CD, it grew on me to the point of becoming one of the very highlights.

I've long had the opinion that ""Dead Again"" is Type O Negative's finest work--which is not to diminish ""Bloody Kisses"" or ""October Rust"" in any way, as great as they are.  In ""Dead Again,"" Type O pushed themselves hard, not settling to re-do what they have already done, and I think they made real breakthroughs and succeeded on every level.

To Peter Steele, let me say this:  THANK YOU, Peter, for giving us such outstanding music.  Words will never express how grateful I am.  I also feel very fortunate to have seen Type O play live numerous times.  You didn't do it by yourself, Type O clearly was a band, not a man with three backup players, but you were the creative force, the vision, and the voice.  I will be listening to your music likely for the rest of my life, and I have no doubt it will stand the test of time.  Many musicians have made a name for themselves, but few have had the capacity for such an original vision, and the talent to achieve it.  You did, and I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart.  At the end of several of a number of Type O's concerts, you would say right before leaving, while grasping your heart, ""Thank you, for without you, we are nothing,"" and it never came across as anything but heartfelt.  Hearing more about you after your passing, about your truly humble nature, I am more sure than ever that those words were your truth.  But my truth is, it was not you in our debt, but the other way around.  We are lucky to have had you sharing your gift with us.  Thank you, Peter.  If there is an ""other side"" (and I have a hard time believing there is), I hope you had a good journey and are at peace.  You deserve it.  Peace, Green Man.","I reviewed the green - version CD when it came out . I 'm saddened beyond words at the untimely loss of Peter Steele just last week .

I 've never had such a strong reaction to any Type O Negative CD , not even "" Bloody Kisses "" and "" October Rust "" , my two other favorites . While there may be some Type O fans who might disagree with me , "" Dead Again "" is so phenomenal that it 's practically beyond criticism . The "" highs "" have never been higher , and the overall level of quality is tremendous , with the exception of "" She Burned Me Down "" which seems to go on a bit pointlessly . Standout tracks include "" Dead Again , "" "" Tripping A Blind Man , "" "" Profits of Doom , "" "" September Sun , "" "" These Three Things , "" "" An Ode To Locksmiths , "" and "" All Hail And Farewell To Britain . "" 

 I could be barking up the wrong tree , but I 've long thought that Peter Steele has to have had significant exposure to classical music . This is n't a new opinion for me , but his development as a songwriter suggests to me he was drawing on an awareness of symphonic masters . Two tracks in particular bear this out . "" September Sun "" is an astonishing song that became something of an obsession . The very first time I heard track four , I literally groaned and said to myself , "" they ca n't be serious ! "" "" September Sun "" starts like a "" hair band "" power ballad , with a simple nice piano intro -- totally not Type O. And then it occurred to me , knowing that this is Peter Steele , this has to be a joke and it 's going to get turned inside out and trashed . And actually something very different happens . Steele does something profoundly Brucknerian with "" September Sun""--he takes a very simple basic theme , expands upon it , puts it through a metamorphosis , and it ends up becoming something far more imposing , grander , astonishing , and even menacing , than you can have even been lead to believe it would become , by the time the song is over nearly 10 minutes later , and really takes you somewhere . "" September Sun "" has to be heard in its astonishing entirety , and for me it is an especially imposing , threatening , beautiful , and entirely unnerving piece of music . It haunts me while still blowing me away . "" These Three Things "" is also a musical standout ( I usually do n't pay attention to the words , and listening to Peter Steele rant against abortion is more humorous than anything else -- and it was not intended as a joke ) . At just under 15 minutes , it 's the longest song that Type O ever recorded . And unlike some of their lengthier songs which are really just a collection of several smaller songs strung together , "" These Three Things "" takes musical ideas and works them out over the length of the song , transforming them by the end . Beyond the drone introduction , the initial section of the song is musically one of the most brutal things that Type O has ever done -- relentless , overpowering , and raw . And then the music takes a 180 , introduces a new musical theme , and then transforms it over the remainder of the song . I was n't overwhelmed by "" These Three Things "" initially , but almost more than any other song on this CD , it grew on me to the point of becoming one of the very highlights . I 've long had the opinion that "" Dead Again "" is Type O Negative 's finest work -- which is not to diminish "" Bloody Kisses "" or "" October Rust "" in any way , as great as they are . In "" Dead Again , "" Type O pushed themselves hard , not settling to re - do what they have already done , and I think they made real breakthroughs and succeeded on every level . To Peter Steele , let me say this :   THANK YOU , Peter , for giving us such outstanding music . Words will never express how grateful I am . I also feel very fortunate to have seen Type O play live numerous times . You did n't do it by yourself , Type O clearly was a band , not a man with three backup players , but you were the creative force , the vision , and the voice . I will be listening to your music likely for the rest of my life , and I have no doubt it will stand the test of time . Many musicians have made a name for themselves , but few have had the capacity for such an original vision , and the talent to achieve it . You did , and I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart . At the end of several of a number of Type O 's concerts , you would say right before leaving , while grasping your heart , "" Thank you , for without you , we are nothing , "" and it never came across as anything but heartfelt . Hearing more about you after your passing , about your truly humble nature , I am more sure than ever that those words were your truth . But my truth is , it was not you in our debt , but the other way around . We are lucky to have had you sharing your gift with us . Thank you , Peter . If there is an "" other side "" ( and I have a hard time believing there is ) , I hope you had a good journey and are at peace . Peace , Green Man ."
A1FZA9C5MVIWHE,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Type O Negative definitely sped up their music a notch. their early work, up to October Rust, was slow and heavy, but they have gotten heavier over time. to me, it sounds like they mixed a little Danzig into their music. somewhere, it was said that they were influenced by Sisters of Mercy and Bauhaus. evidently, they are also influenced by Black Sabbath and Danzig as well, the 1st and second songs are faster than previous works, and Peter Steele's baritone voice is replaced by the band's melodic singing. on song no. 3, Peter adapts a hardcore voice at first, and then his signature baritone voice is on and off. he must have been reading the Bible, because the song is about the Apocalypse. one minor complaint is that the lyrics are hard to read, but they make up for it with excellent musicianship. this album is hour and 17 minutes long and the third song alone is 10 minutes long. this is an interesting listen.","Type O Negative definitely sped up their music a notch . their early work , up to October Rust , was slow and heavy , but they have gotten heavier over time . to me , it sounds like they mixed a little Danzig into their music . somewhere , it was said that they were influenced by Sisters of Mercy and Bauhaus . evidently , they are also influenced by Black Sabbath and Danzig as well , the 1st and second songs are faster than previous works , and Peter Steele 's baritone voice is replaced by the band 's melodic singing . on song no . 3 , Peter adapts a hardcore voice at first , and then his signature baritone voice is on and off . he must have been reading the Bible , because the song is about the Apocalypse . one minor complaint is that the lyrics are hard to read , but they make up for it with excellent musicianship . this album is hour and 17 minutes long and the third song alone is 10 minutes long . this is an interesting listen ."
A3BZSCR2JB153Q,B000Z7S78U,1,1,4,"Type O is one of my favorite bands, and their album ""October Rust"" is my all-time favorite album. For a band with such a self-deprecating sense of humor and such a choppy musical history, Type O Negative creates powerful, emotional music that transcends the goth stereotypes it wallows in (and helped create). And Peter Steele's dark vocals, once sort of a gimmick, have become integral to their brooding sound.

Anyway, like I said, ""October Rust"" is the best album ever. But the follow-up, ""World Coming Down"", was rather disappointing. I was losing hope for the band when their last album, ""Life Is Killing Me"", turned out to be a significant improvement. While not as uniformly brilliant as ""Rust"", it had some excellent songs and brought back their sense of humor. So I had high hopes for the newest release, ""Dead Again"".

The album is surprising in a lot of ways. First of all, many of the songs are much faster than previous Type O material. Peter doesn't sing quite so deep and gloomy this time around, and guitarist Kenny Hickey does much more singing than before. A few songs break the ten-minute mark, something they haven't really done since their first record. And while much of their sound remains typically Type O, many of the lyrics deal with new themes and ideas.

According to recent interviews, Peter Steele has returned to his Catholic upbringing, and so much of the album deals with Christianity and religion. ""The Profit of Doom"" uses an asteroid striking the Earth as a metaphor for the Apocalypse. ""These Three Things"" deals with abortion and the Jewish state of Israel. ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" offers a rather twisted version of Genesis. ""Halloween in Heaven"" is a bit lighter in tone, dealing with all the dead great musicians playing a concert in Heaven. And as usual, some of the songs are simply about Peter Steele himself and his personal problems. The title track ""Dead Again"" is about drug addiction, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" deals with his anger management issues.

Thankfully, their sense of humor has not disappeared or been overwhelmed by the serious subject matter. I laughed out loud at some of the song titles, such as ""Tripping A Blind Man"" and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow,"" and several songs have some hilarious lines. Among my favorites:

""I had no pulse last time I checked / I'd trade my life for self-respect"" (from ""Dead Again"")

""Elvis ain't dead, so he isn't here"" (from ""Halloween in Heaven"")

""If only I'd known how cool death is / I'd have killed myself sooner"" (from ""Halloween in Heaven"")

And let's not forget their album liner notes. The band photo from Life Is Killing Me featured four sets of feet with toe tags on them. Not to be outdone, Dead Again shows a picture of four mangled chalk outlines opposite photos of skeletons inside coffins. And in the section for equipment used, it says ""Type O Negative has yet to learn how to use the following equipment."" I always get a kick out of that sort of thing.

Even though I think ""Life Is Killing Me"" had some better individual songs than ""Dead Again"", I think ""Dead Again"" is a better album as a whole.  The whole tone of the album sounds more concise and uniform.  But that's just me.  It is a bit on the long side, but that's my only real complaint.

As a whole, fans of Type O should be happy with this release. The band they know and love has clearly matured over the years, but their style is undeniably intact. However, some people might be put off by the religious content of many of the songs. People bravely hoping for a return to ""October Rust"" territory will surely be disappointed as well.

AMKHSFDQDXDMS,B000Z7S78U,-1,-1,1,"I was very disappointed with this release.  The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band.  The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.

The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'.  I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie ""Wedding Singer"". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like.  I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.

Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better.  Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses.  I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.

A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"Few would have guessed that Type O Negative would still be developing and improving after all these years. Sure, this album may not contain any obvious classics, and some longtime fans may complain that distinctness and variety are missing from the band's most recent work. But at the level of an entire album, Dead Again is the most consistent and accomplished release of Type O Negative's career. The band's wild-and-wooly past achievements, not to mention Peter Steele's darkly odd sense of humor, are still represented here in ""Dead Again,"" ""Halloween in Heaven,"" and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow."" But otherwise, many of the songs on this album show great strides in the Type O game plan, and as an overall statement this album is a punishing display of sonic architecture and mood manipulation. The playing is better than ever before, with guitarist Kenny Hickey and drummer Johnny Kelly toughening up their attacks considerably. Kenny's throat-shredder vocals are also utilized with great success, offering effective counterpoints to Peter's always grave-rattling lower baritone. There is some intrigue in the songwriting department as well, including the dramatic quasi-ballad ""September Sun,"" which includes a surprisingly romantic piano intro from Josh Silver.

Meanwhile, Type O's songs are getting longer and longer overall, and here the lengthy compositions offer the band room for True musical exploration, rather than just repetition. This album's pinnacle is surely the sinister epic ""The Profit of Doom,"" while the 14-minute apocalypse ""These Three Things"" actually manages to stay musically fascinating throughout its entire length (though it tends toward Tool-ness in places). One source of static here may be the lyrics, as Peter's eccentric manic-depressive humor has been largely replaced by esoteric neo-Catholic theology, particularly in ""An Ode to Locksmiths"" and the aforementioned ""These Three Things."" Also, many reviewers seem to be picking out one song that doesn't quite work, and I would nominate the sluggish ""She Burned Me Down,"" which isn't quite the epic slow-burner that it thinks it is. But overall, Type O Negative have nearly two decades of crushing and subversive goth-metal under their belts, and this album shows that they're not even close to slowing down yet.

Dead Again preserves their evocatively best style, with rhythmically crunching and echoing guitars, haunting cathedral keyboards, the darkly erotic inunciations and deep reverberations from Peter Steele, and the hypnotic beat of the drums all combine to create another Goth-Metal masterpiece akin to Bloody Kisses. As is typical TON, each song takes its time, coursing and describing the emotions, while stimulating a sense of sweet euphoria.

Of note, The Profit of Doom, dealing with The Antichrist Beast of Revelation complete with references to the six triumverate; Halloween In Heaven, a jaunty tune featuring a female voice {Tara VanFlower of Lycia} complimenting Steele's well with a pleasing contrast. September Sun, & These Three Things combine ponderous ballad moments with sudden bursts of energy creating a perfect mix of melancholy and rage.

Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find an additional disc contained inside with a Live recording featuring tracks from Bloody Kisses {Christian Woman, Love You To Death, Black No. 1}, October Rust {Everything Dies / My Girlfriend's Girlfriend}, Slow Deep & Hard, {Gravitational Constant}, and Origin of The [...]{Are You Afraid}, all of which sounds extraordinary.

Overall, Dead Again contains a mutiplicity of content from the art {even the thorny vines on the CD itself is a very nice touch} to the quantity of music, which hearkens to Bloody Kisses and October Rust while standing upon its own merit. Highly recommended.

The cover art features Grigori Efimovich Rasputin, Mystic, so called ""Holy Devil"" and ""Mad Monk"", deriving from The Khlysty, a sect who practiced self-flagellation, although he disagreed with their masochistic methods and basically became a renegade monk with a penchant for carnal indulgence - from imbibing in copious libations, passionate dance {it was rumored that he even celebrated a phallic cavort with the legendary ample appendage} , to sensual pleasures with many of the local women who admired his extraordinary abilities, as well as his libertine lifestyle, in which he revelled, and was more than willing and able to satisfy on a frequent basis.

His influence pervaded the Russian Aristocracy, wherein he had the Czar and Czarina transfixed. Briefly, extremely fortunate for them, he attained the power to heal, and used that ability to cure the Czar's son Alex, which gained their unyielding loyalty. From the beginning, there were those who resented him, claiming he was in league with The Devil. Through treachorous subterfuge, he was tricked and betrayed, and eventually excarnated after displaying apparent invincibility, to the fear and trepidation of his detractors.

He lived his life to the fullest, attained a passionate joie de vivre, employing lesser magic principles to charm and confound when it served his purposes, and excelled in his chosen endeavors, all of which designates him a de-facto Satanist, in My estimation.

The album has 10 tracks and clocks in at a dredging 77 minutes of Highs and Lows.  Personal favorite tracks are ""Tripping A Blind Man"", ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"", and the best track for me ""Ode To Locksmiths""  a fast and swinging ditty that even dredges memories of Carnivore.  There are two tracks that move in at 10 plus minutes (Profit of Doom, and These Three Things).  These tracks have about 3-4 tempo changes each and would make for great live tracks.  Halloween in Heaven, Dead Again, and Some Stupid Tomorrow will likely be good candidates for singles to push radio play of the group, being the shorter tracks on the album.  Finally, the track September Sun is a close second for my favorite track, a slow burner that is ballad like in only a haunting type o negative way.  The album is mixed brilliantly, just a great venture for these guys.  Buy this album, good intro to the band, and a must for fans.

FYI: for those of you curious about the 5 live tracks available at a large retail store, The CD clocks in at around 44 minutes, and has the tracks Everything Dies/ My Girlfriends Girlfriend, Are you Afraid/Gravitational Constant, Christian Women, Love you to Death, and Black Number One.

The album has 10 tracks and clocks in at a dredging 77 minutes of Highs and Lows . Personal favorite tracks are "" Tripping A Blind Man "" , "" Some Stupid Tomorrow "" , and the best track for me "" Ode To Locksmiths ""   a fast and swinging ditty that even dredges memories of Carnivore . There are two tracks that move in at 10 plus minutes ( Profit of Doom , and These Three Things ) . These tracks have about 3 - 4 tempo changes each and would make for great live tracks . Halloween in Heaven , Dead Again , and Some Stupid Tomorrow will likely be good candidates for singles to push radio play of the group , being the shorter tracks on the album . Finally , the track September Sun is a close second for my favorite track , a slow burner that is ballad like in only a haunting type o negative way . The album is mixed brilliantly , just a great venture for these guys . Buy this album , good intro to the band , and a must for fans . FYI : for those of you curious about the 5 live tracks available at a large retail store , The CD clocks in at around 44 minutes , and has the tracks Everything Dies/ My Girlfriends Girlfriend , Are you Afraid / Gravitational Constant , Christian Women , Love you to Death , and Black Number One . This is just a really cool addition ."
A3G0U21VBD724P,B000Z7S78U,1,1,5,"This Album is a great comeback adter a 4 year lapse from their last release. September Sun is nothing short of brilliant yet beautiful. The whole album speaks what many ( if not all ) feel on day to day basis. I TOTALLY recommend this album if you are a TRUE Type O Negative Fan. The song ""Profits of Doom"" is basically about the end of the world and wether you believe or not. As a previous comment by someone i will not shame, They did not see the relevence of the lyrics at the beginning of the song and what they had to do with the faster half. Obviously someone knows nothing of biblical history or they would. ""These 3 Things"" Is my favorite song on the entire album. This is 1 of their greatest albums yet. Keep up the good work my friends and if you read other reviews they rank this CD low then they are definitely NOT A TRUE TYPE O NEGATIVE FAN!

Free of the personal demons that created the themes for World Coming Down and Life Is Killing Me(Great albums), Peter Steele and company deliver 77 mins of slow, dirgy sabbath-like metal, with a LOT of punk thrown in this time around(Dead Again, Halloween In Heaven). Kenny does a lot of screaming on this album too...like a lot. It also has its mellow points as well with September Sun. She Burned Me Down is almost like a sequel to Burnt Flowers Fallen, a great track. As a whole, the album will stand the test of time just like their other releases. Great metal record.

After I'd seen that whole show, I got a little interested in the song, and looked it up. Even though I loved the show, I can tell you that Jonathan Coulton's song has now become the much more important to me.

I love it for a couple of reasons. First, it is a tremendously catchy song. It's well played and sung, with a great pop-rock chorus.

Second, it's actually sort of a meaningful song, at least to me. I'm not literally a code monkey, but there's not doubt that I'm a nerd, the proverbial nice-guy who comes in last and can't get the pretty receptionist to pay any attention to me, who works hard in a job that's boring and unappreciated.

Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins etc. He was nicknamed ""Jerry Lee Lewis' brother""

I'm dancing, twirling, laughing, and totally carefree.

But it's also sad, as if saying goodbye to times long past.

I love music that takes me into that gypsy place. It's a powerful place for me, as if in some past life I was there and only remember the happy times.

A kindred song is Boat on the River by Styx , the same Styx that did Grand Illusion and Come Sail Away ."

AC0Z6U9OWFRT0,B0010S8HRO,1,1,5,"Most of the time when I buy a CD, I listen to it a few times and then put it back on the shelf for weeks or months at a time before I give it another listen. There are occasions, however, when I buy a CD and it really grabs a hold of me. On these rare occasions, I become engrossed, almost addicted to the album. Martha Wainwright's self-titled debut has been one of these occasions.

Because of who her family is, it would be easy to immediately dismiss her as ""the sister of Rufas,"" or ""the daughter of Louden and Kate McGarrigle."" This would be a mistake, because Martha Wainwright's music is distinctly unique and she is a huge talent in her own right.

Her voice is gorgeous, but not in a traditional sense. Her voice has a soulful, high-pitched, eerie beauty, like nothing I've ever heard before. In her delivery, there is a real sense of emotion and feeling that really connects with the listener. With most albums, when you are done listening, you are done. When you are finished with Martha Wainwright's album, you feel as though you had just been visited by a presence, and that feeling stays with you, long after the CD has ended.

From the opening ""Far Away"", the listener is immediately swept into the CD. This song is subtle, building up ever so slightly, and is slightly underwhelming, which gives the song the perfect effect. The hauntingly beautiful background vocals add a nice touch. The more upbeat ""G.P.T."" has an infectious, singsong verse before going into its' soulful chorus. The bluesy morose ""Factory"" shows a more vulnerable side to Martha Wainwright. ""These Flowers"" has a kind-of a dream-like lullaby atmosphere. ""Ball and Chain,"" (not a cover of the classic Janis Joplin song) sounds somewhat Janis-Joplin like. It is here that Wainwright lets down all restraints and finally lets all that had been building up inside her explode. ""Why does this always happen?"" she yells, demanding an answer, yet knowing none will come. The album comes back to earth with the beautiful ""Don't forget"" a song about lost love. These types of songs are so clich,' but Wainwright sounds so sincere, and this song feels so lived in, that it's impossible not to be moved. The tongue-in-cheek ""This Life,"" tries to answer the question of whether the monotony of life in general is worth living. The light percussion over the subtle strumming of the acoustic strings creates the perfect backdrop for the song. Although it is asked whether or not suicide is the answer, this seemingly heavy-handed topic does not emotionally drain the listener the way an Alice In Chains song might. It's as though these suicidal ideas are just passing thoughts, not to be taken seriously. The catchy mid-paced ""When the day is Short,"" keeps the momentum going. The brutally honest ""Bloody Mother F***ing A** Hole"" is one of the album's centerpieces. You'd expect a song with a title like that to sound like Hole or Babes In Toyland, but that's not the case at all. This acoustic song starts out very subtle, building up angst as it rolls along, as though the hurt and resentment inside had been building up a long time and now is being vented out. But when Wainwright delivers the main lines ""you bloody mother f***ing A** hole,"" she sounds more hurt than angry. ""I will not pretend, I will not put on a smile, I will not say I'm alight for you, for you, whoever you are."" In other words, she is taking a stand, against anyone who would try to supress her, or not let her be herself. The explicit content sounds especially powerful because it comes out of left field. It's really unexpected. It's not like an Eminem album where every-other word is f*** this and f*** that. The bluesy easy-going ""TV Show"" has an engrossing stream-like lyrical flow. There's an array of strings in the background that are effective, yet subtle. The singsong ""Maker"" is enchanting, especially when the lush array of background vocals in the chorus kick in. The somber stripped-down acoustic ""Who was I kidding"" is heavyhearted, yet not overdone. The elegant piano balled ""Whiter I Must Wander"" is the perfect way to close out the album, ending on a whisper.

Martha Wainwright's debut is a truly wonderful listen, through and through. It's brutally honest, yet not melodramatic, confident, yet never cocky. Martha Wainwright is an amazing and very promising talent. One of the best CDs of 2005.","Most of the time when I buy a CD , I listen to it a few times and then put it back on the shelf for weeks or months at a time before I give it another listen .

Nonetheless, this coffee shop favorite is not set to whither away, with both her parent's fan base and her brother's loyal followers to aid her.

A1C20CN2A2UP99,B0010S8HRO,1,1,4,"On the cover of this, her debut album, Martha Wainwright wears a look of resolve and determination as if to say ""whatever it takes, my music will be heard... but only on my terms"". Upon listening it becomes clear very quickly she has not only the voice but also the songs to back up this confidence.

If I didn't know any better, I'd have just as easily guessed this was from 1978 than 2005, sharing as it does a real kinship in sound to (then) emerging singers like Chrissie Hynde, Debbie Harry and in particular Kate Bush. Like Bush's debut 'The Kick Inside', arrangements here swoon and soar, choruses surprise and there's an almost frightening level of intensity at times, which makes for riveting listening throughout. It's also an album that's unafraid to tackle difficult subject matter, though for me, much of it is simply about attempting to transcend life's limitations.

After all that verbosity, all you really need to know is this is a beautiful collection of songs by a striking new artist - and if you like her brother Rufus, then odds are you'll like Martha Wainwright too.","On the cover of this , her debut album , Martha Wainwright wears a look of resolve and determination as if to say "" whatever it takes , my music will be heard ... but only on my terms "" .

A9I40WFF40R4,B0010UX41G,1,1,5,"Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson and Ricky Skaggs team up on what has to be as good as bluegrass music gets. You will play this one again and again. This hauntingly beautiful CD reminded me once again that most of the so-called music coming out of Nashville today masquerading as ""country"" and/or ""bluegrass"" is pure (junk). No tight jeans and cowboy hats here. Just first class music.

A3R9HPWFF9QWSN,B0010UX41G,1,1,5,"About a year ago, I bought three albums --the latest album by the Blind Boys of Alabama (wonderful), R. L. Burnside's A Troubled Mind (one of the two best I bought from Fat Possum records --the other was Robert Balfour), and this album.  In other words, I bought three outstanding albums, all at the same time.

So which one do I listen to most often? The Three Pickers.

I've been a fan of Earl Scruggs for a long time. His albums with Lester Flatt are incomparable. They're the only blue grass albums that compare to jazz in my opinion, like listening to early Louis Armstrong.

I like Ricky Skraggs, mostly for his background work on the Evangeline album, by Emmy Lou Harris. (I don't greatly like the one album I bought by Ricky with his own group.)

I know that Doc Watson is a giant and I love his voice and manner but I've never spent time listening to him, principally because C&W and folk aren't my first thing. I've spent fifty-five years listening to jazz first and classical music second. It's not that easy changing gears.

I bought this album first because Earl Scruggs was on it, second because Ricky and Doc are premiere players, and lastly because it looked pure and unadulterated, just world class performers playing together for fun.

That's what it is. All three pickers are in good form. They are having fun. It's clear they like being together. All of the songs they play are good, some wondrous.

I like the cuts with Ricky Scraggs' group least, those with the three of the pickers and with Doc and his son most. Doc Watson has a beautiful tenor-baritone voice; he plays fine guitar both in background and solo. Earl Scruggs still plays with the fire and passion he had thirty-five years ago. What technical control he has! Ricky Scraggs is a first rate instrumentalist and very good in ensemble singing, but less successful as a solo vocalist. I wish I liked Ricky's group better --it's good but the cuts with the other groups are better. Alison Krause is on some cuts but doesn't have much to do.

I usually don't like chatter on a music record but here it fits. The love --for the music they are playing and among the three men themselves -- is transparent.  It adds a warm glow to an exceptional record.

A18OBUSMXVE8R0,B0010WLQXW,1,1,5,"This is a supurb collection of Folk Music. It was released in 1998,but is really Folk Music of the 60's ,all of it written by the person who was the central figure of the Folk Music scene at the height of its popularity. It was the music that represented the thoughts,experiences,hopes,fears,dreams,heartbreaks,protests and just about everything that the music scene portrayed during the sixties. However,anyone familiar with this music is in for a big surprise and treat when they listen to this album. While everything ,all 39 recordings,are from Seeger,all but one,""And Still I'm Searching"" are other artist's interpreting Seeger's songs. It will be a great surprise for you,as it certainly was for me, to hear these artists singing Seeger's songs. Also,you will find many songs in this collection that will probably be totally new ,or at least somewhat forgotten.
 There are songs that have become so familiar to long time Folkies as well as mainstream listeners, that when done by others will ,to use an old expression,""knock your socks off"".
 Just to captivate your curiosity,can you imagine:
  Jackson Browne & Bonnie Raitt singing ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine""
  Bruce Cockburn singing ""Turn,Turn,Turn""
  Nanci Griffith and Friends singing ""If I Had A Hammer""
  Bruce Springsteen singing ""We Shall Overcome""
  Studs Terkel doing ""Blessed Be The Nation"" or ""Oh,Sacred World""
  And what would a Folk Music collection be without
Peter,Paul & Mary,The Weavers and ""Wimoweh"",Odetta and ""One Grain Of Sand""
 Then to wrap it all up,Pete tells us what his long journey in Folk Music has been all about with ""And Still I'm Searching.
 If you are a Folk Music fan, or a fan of American Music heritage;you'll treasure this collection. The inserts that are included with these two CD's are excellent and will give you a much greater insight into what was on Seeger's mind at the time and how he came about to compose these songs.","This is a supurb collection of Folk Music .

A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B0010WLQXW,1,1,5,"You'll hear your favorites on this album, and you'll hear songs new to you  that will blow you away.

Besides being a collection of songs honoring  Seeger, these are wonderful on their own. Re-release these as singles, and  they will be hits in the folk-music circles, and could hold their own on  some more popular stations (like Chicago's WXRT).

For me, I loved Studs  Terkel reading ""Blessed Be the Nation,"" Jackson Browne/Bonnie  Raitt singing, ""Kisses Sweeter than Wine,"" and the deeply  haunting ""My Father's Mansion"" as sung by Billy Bragg and Eliza  Carthy in a celtic flavor.

Hearing Donovan's version of ""My Rainbow  Race"" was refreshing, and Dick Gaughan's dramatic rendering of  ""Waist Deep in the Big Muddy"" knocked my socks off. Surprising me  was Tim Robbins' ""All My Children of the Sun."" So he can sing,  too? Amazing.

Listen to Greg Brown singing ""Sailing Down My Golden  River."" He has a Johnny Cash thing going on when he sings it, don't  you think? Check it out. Very cool.

There are others, some 39 songs in  all, and each I honestly liked. No duds, no ""why did they put that on  the album"" songs.

I fully recommend this album.

But I seem to be the only one on the planet who just can't get into this one. I simply don't get it. Mary has been selling millions of albums across the world for 16 years now and that could explain why, to these ears, she's beginning to sound a bit weary. She's been telling us all how she's incredibly happy now, how her life is exactly where she wants it to be and how, whilst going through all the pain in her recent past, one thing she's always strived to do is keep things real with her fans. This might all well be True but I'm yet to see Mary actually LOOKING happy in an interview or a video. (Jill Scott always looks happy for instance, even these days - and she's just been through a divorce!).

But maybe that's just Mary's way. Maybe it's the 'street' or 'ghetto fabulous' thing to; to never smile even if feeling blissful. Her continuous banging on about said bliss is starting to grate on the nerves a tad though. She's a strong woman, no doubt, and a trooper. She does ""keep on going"", as one reviewer said but at what cost? Like I said, the poor woman is probably just really tired.

When she burst onto the scene back in 1992 with songs like ""Real Love"", ""Reminisce"" and ""Love No Limit"", she showed energy, versatility and raw emotion that have long since dissipated. The bittersweet ""Be Happy"" and the poignant ""I'm Goin' Down from her sophomore album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life/dp/B000002OU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life</a>&nbsp;proved she was no one-hit wonder. And let's not forget her star turns on hip-hop classics like ""Can't Knock The Hustle"" with Jay-Z (1996) and ""I'll Be There For You/You're All I Need To Get By"" with Method Man (1995). I for one thought the title ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"" was absolutely well deserved.

But every subsequent album has been less satisfying, and more geared towards what was playing on the radio than the one that preceded it. By the time ""The Breakthrough"" came out, I was starting to lose interest. It was clear to any objective listener that Mary was just treading water and I've barely played the CD three times since I got it. This one I simply couldn't bear and had to take right back to the store and ask for something else.

As soon as I saw the video to her single ""Just Fine"", I had my doubts. The Michael Jackson homage-paying intro (and the video itself) was probably well intentioned but to me, they just fell flat. It just doesn't sound or look like she really means it. She's singing about being uplifted but she sounds (and looks) anything but. Jackson looked ecstatic in the video to ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" but to me, Mary looks like she'd rather be somewhere else, doing something else. It's not so much in her moves, it's in her eyes and her facial expressions.

The female empowerment of ""Grown Woman"" and ""Feel Like A Woman"" sound like the kind of thing that would play well to Oprah's studio audience but this listener just couldn't find the groove - and I'm no chauvinist. It would take too long to list the female empowerment tunes I've grooved to in my time.

Pharrell's multi-tempoed ""'Til The Morning"" and Ne-Yo's interestingly winding ""Smoke"" are probably the only two songs on here that break away from the made-for-radio formula that dominates the album and Mary is probably singing the best she's ever sung - much more control, much less excess - but somehow for me, that just makes her less interesting to listen to. A perfect example of what I mean is the solemn ""Fade Away"". Forget all the almost spiritual wailing and chest beating of the good old days, Mary sounds like she's barely breaking a sweat.

Maybe that's how music is now in the 21st century and I need to either get with the program or leave it alone. Or maybe, just maybe, as listeners, we've allowed our standards to drop to basement level and as a result, anything even slightly passable is lauded as the next best thing. Mary is undoubtedly one of the legends of our time and I'll never even try to take that away from her but I do wonder if the way many of us fans are almost deifying the woman these days, is blinding us to the fact that her music is simply not as good as it used to be. I realise that we're living in an age where creativity and individuality are not rewarded and where studio executives and radio programmers are now telling artistes what kind of music to make so it's entirely possible that Mary's heart isn't really in the music she's putting out, despite all her talk of the contrary. Whatever. In the end, we'll only get the quality of music that we as consumers demand.

Maybe Mary's new life is indeed the happy and peaceful one she says it is. All I know is that while it must be a good thing (especially for her) that all the pain is behind her and all the angst gone, her supposedly newly-found joy is not coming through in the music quite yet. To me, singing songs of empowerment and bliss while looking and sounding utterly miserable just makes Mary painful to watch - and to listen to.

The album will probably still sell truckloads and earn her all kinds of awards, so I know my view is the minority one. I also know that my review is very likely to be unpopular here but I had to say my piece. I didn't want to post the review but a good Amazon buddy of mine (who will remain nameless) encouraged me to do so, so here it is.

A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"As a life-long Mary fan, I had no preconceived notion about how this album would sound.  After so many years it's just nice to still have Mary in the ""game"" putting out good music.

Overall I love this album and have already put quite a few songs on repeat.  I love the album cover & rear cover art with Mary lounging on a classic vinyl collection and I love how each song melds into the next one.

I got the copy with the bonus dvd and while I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the disc included with her LOVE & LIFE cd, I still enjoyed hearing Mary speak about the album's concept and what each track meant to her during the recording of the album.

My favorite tracks are:  JUST FINE - great lead off single, it got me hyped about the album's release

IF U LOVE ME? - produced by Bryan Michael Cox and although his songs are becoming easily identifiable with the pretty piano riffs, this is still a uniquely ""Mary joint""

FEEL LIKE A WOMAN, STAY DOWN, HURT AGAIN, SHAKE DOWN (great duet with Usher), SMOKE, COME TO ME (PEACE), TILL THE MORNING (love the beats & musical production) & FADE AWAY - very moving song, the lyrics made me cry & Mary sounds terrific!

Overall, this is a strong collection of songs, Mary sounds great and I'd recommend it to any any fan whether you're a Mary-newbie or a long-timer.","As a life - long Mary fan , I had no preconceived notion about how this album would sound .

A24N1BAS3CU27H,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Mary J. Blige returns with her eighth studio album, ""Growing pains"". I've been a fan of hers ever since she burst onto the scene singing about ""Real love"". Sixteen years later, she's still as strong as ever; ""Growing pains"" became her fourth US chart topping album and has sold over a million so far. It's the latest instalment in a musical journey, which intentionally or not has chronicled the state of her life at the time of each release.

This is no different. Very much in love (with her husband and with herself), the songs reflect this. From lead-off single, the upbeat joyous hand-clap filled ""Just fine"" where she states she's just that, thank you (from the same team that gave Rihanna her chart ""raining"" hit ""Umbrella""), opening cut ""Work that"" (a song of female self belief/assertion no matter what you look like, lovely song), the more sparse guitar driven ""Grown woman"" (with Ludacris), There is a bit to dance to. ""Roses"" is an angry mid tempo song with unsettling beats (where you wouldn't want to mess with her; she's having one of them days), and closing cut ""Come to me (peace)"" is a lovely song with a hypnotic throbbing bassline and a pop feel (Love it!).

For ballads, we have just about everything else, with lyrics dealing with unabashed love,  or vulnerability; ""Shake down"" (a duet with Usher), ""Feel like a woman"", ""Stay down"", ""Hurt again"" (lovely harmonies), the string swathed ""What love is"", ""Work in progress (growing pains)"" (with autobiographical lyrics, the title says it all), ""Talk to me"" (where she's trying to rekindle conversation in the relationship), the piano sprinkled ""If you love me"", and the pseudo jazz feel of ""Smoke"" (with a slightly off kilter beat).

My favourite cut is her song about wanting to get away from it all when things get tough; ""Fade away"", a dreamy plodding mid-tempo number (a bit like ""Everything"" from ""Share my world"") with soothing harmonies. It's like sailing on a calm sea. Outstanding!

Mary has been on an upward tangent ever since the day she appeared on the scene, a tangent that shows no sign of dipping any day soon.","Mary J.

She has been that same girl from New York that she was when she made her debut in 1992 and for that, we love her!  She was never surreptitious about her ordeals with drugs, abusive relationships and family drama.  The pain that she has endured is felt all throughout her music, which is something else her supporters appreciate.  She is definitely one of the most sincere and real people in the industry of entertainment; there's no arguing that point.  Her album, ""Growing Pains"" is a great offering.  It doesn't have any songs that are quite as memorable as, say, ""I'm Goin' Down"", ""Sweet Thing"", ""Love No Limit"", ""Be Happy"", or ""Not Gon Cry"" (I could go on for days, she has a slew of sensational songs!!!), but it is a good listen and worth purchasing.

 Mary Jane Blige has this unique way of delivering songs; that is, to me, what makes her music so listenable and memorable.  It is not easy to explain, but once you listen to her best songs, you'll understand.  With this album, her delivery is still as it has always been.  ""Talk to Me"" is a prime example of my previous explanation.  She does a nice job executing this track.  She extends her voice quite a bit here, and I enjoyed listening.  Even her faster tracks are heartfelt, for example, ""Just Fine.""  This song was released to radio, and though it took a few listens to lure me in, I was eventually taken in by this track.  The beat and hook are infectious.  It's one of the best moments on ""Growing Pains.""  In short, this song is about a woman who is truly confident with being herself and is not about to change because she's ""fine."" (I suppose that could mean ""fine"" as in mood and/or physical appearance, take it how you want.)  Someone strongly suggested that I listen to ""Stay Down"" and I am so happy I listened to him!  I listen to that song a lot because, lyrically, it is beautiful.  This song is about staying with your mate through the bad times because good times are sure to come and overpower those harder times.  Those who hear this song are sure to gain something from it.  This album is a bit flawed in a few places.  ""Smoke"" is the weakest moment on the album.  The production is not good, the lyrics are just alright; collectively, it's just not a good track.  Usher shows up for ""Shake Down"" and does a good job, but this track doesn't stand out.  Everything about this track sits on the average mark.

 R&B lovers, Mary lovers, and lovers of music, what are you waiting for?  Go get it!  This woman is a True artist and she exhibits that on this album.

A27RIWPJMP3XYD,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Mary J. Blige continues to bring it on practically every album she releases these days. And Growing Pains is no different. She busts out with the highly energetic and super sassy ""Work That"" to lead off the album. Then, like a well-produced mixtape, it seamlessly segues to the equally groove-happy ""Grown Woman"" featuring a decent rap from Ludacris. We are then delighted with the first single ""Just Fine,"" a simple ditty with a happy-go-lucky Mary expressing herself like only she can. ""Feel Like A Woman"" is a slower cut that basically tells men to treat her like a lady. ""Stay Down"" is a more serious track about pushing on through the tough times and not giving up so easily. Those same sentiments are reverberated on the songs ""Talk To Me"" and ""If You Love Me."" ""Hurt Again"" is a smooth track that discusses the inner battle between being in love and not setting yourself up for a broken heart...yet again. Usher has the album's only other cameo appearance for the straightforward ""Shake Down."" ""Till The Morning"" has an old school bounce to it, with lyrics from Mary to match. ""Roses"" is one of Mary's most powerful songs of recent memory, essentially saying that it takes more than just the little things to make a relationship work. ""Fade Away"" speaks about losing a love and having trouble facing the world again and moving on with all the heartache consuming your spirit. ""What Love Is"" is a very deep and analytical song about the different emotions and moods that truthfully depends on your current status with love. ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"" is a self-explanatory track about Mary still being just as imperfect as the next person. Mary gets a little abstract with the simple yet cryptic track ""Smoke,"" leaving room for the listener to draw their own conclusions on what she's really talking about. The subdued power ballad ""Come To Me (Peace)"" closes out the album on a positive note. Growing Pains is definitely closer to her classic material even though it doesn't quite reach those heights on it's own. Nevertheless, MJB brings us another solid effort to enjoy until the next album comes out. And with a formula that is obviously working, Mary J. Blige will certainly bring it once again.","Mary J.

AGAMDS21PJZPK,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"I instantly became a fan of Mary J. Blige once I heard the song ""You Remind Me"".  Her debut CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-the-411/dp/B000002OME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's the 411?</a>&nbsp;was an instant favorite of mine because of the way that Mary mixed r&b songs with hip hop samples.  Obviously, the direction of the production had something to do with that but since I am also a rap music fan, I was able to appreciate Mary J. Blige even more.  My favorite tracks ended up being ""Love No Limit"", ""Reminisce"", ""I Don't Want To Do Anything"" w/K-Ci, ""My Love"", ""Real Love"" and Mary's remake of the Rufus & Chaka Khan classic ""Sweet Thing"".  In 1994, Mary J. Blige released her 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life/dp/B000002OU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life</a>.  This is clearly my favorite r&b CD of all time.  Mary not only surpassed my expectations after her debut CD, but she definitely had gained a fan for life as she did her best to chronicle the good times, the pain and everything inbetween to put together a fantastic CD.  My favorite track was ""I Never Wanna Live Without You"" but I could play the CD in its entirety.  My other personal favorites include ""Mary's Joint"", ""I'm The Only Woman"", ""Be Happy"", ""Mary Jane"" and ""Be With You"".  The alternate versions of the tracks were phenominal as well.  I am sure everyone remembers Smif N Wessun on ""I Love You"", LL Cool J on ""Mary Jane"", and the late Notorious BIG (Biggie) ripping the ""I'm Goin' Down"" (Remix)) which used the beat for the track ""The What"" that was featured on Biggie's ""Ready To Die"" that also included Method Man.  Mary J had plenty of other releases:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Share-My-World/dp/B000002P64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Share My World</a>&nbsp;(1997)
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary/dp/B00000JWQH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary</a>&nbsp;(1999)

From these 4 releases you had my personal favorites such as ""Seven Days"", ""All That I Can Say"", ""The Love I Never Had"", ""Special Part Of Me"", ""Ooh!"", ""Everything"" and ""Share My World"".  Mary J. returned in 2005 with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>.  She enjoyed tremendous success with her 1st single ""Be Without You"".  ""Darkchild"" blessed her with my favorite track, ""Enough Cryin'"" and my other favorites included ""I Found My Everything"", ""Take Me As I Am"", ""No One Will Do"" and ""Father In You"".  Mary's record company got a little greedy with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reflections-A-Retrospective/dp/B000JU8HHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reflections - A Retrospective</a>.  The CD started off with 4 new tracks which included the single ""We Ride"", the title track and ""King & Queen"" w/John Legend.  Then Geffen tried to conduct a greatest hits CD with the rest of the CD which was a mere 11 tracks, with 2 of the tracks being songs that were never on her CDs but were quality collaborations with the remix to Method Man's ""All I Need"", that was featured on ""Tical"" and ""911"" w/Wyclef Jean.

""Growing Pains"" was released on December 18th, 2007.  The CD starts off with the uptempo ""Work That"".  Mary makes an uplifting anthem for the ladies that tells them to be happy with themselves and not to live everyday trying to please other people.  Do your best to work with the best attributes that you have.  Ludacris appears on ""Grown Woman"" to return the favor for Mary J. appearing on the track ""Runaway Love"" that was featured on Ludacris' last release ""Release Therapy"".  In my opinion, ""Grown Woman"" is basically a continuation of ""Work That"".  You have to come to a point in your life where you are happy with yourself as a woman, mentally and physically.  Mary J. has struggled with that fact for many years in her life and she is trying to be a positive example for ladies, young and old around the world.  Luda does a decent job with his verse but he is trying to talk about some things that could be done with this woman instead of adding to the positivity that Mary is trying to bring to the track, with a touch of attitude.  ""Just Fine"" is basically Growing Pains' ""Family Affair"".  It doesn't matter how the week at work was or what trials and tribulations that you went through during the course of the week, it's Friday night and this beat comes on, go out and have a good time or just do the infamous 2 step like I do.  ""Just Fine"" is a nice, uptempo feel good jam.  ""Feel Like A Woman""  has Mary talking to her man about making her feel appreciated as a woman.  Whether it's a shopping trip, making love to her through the night or just making a nice gesture, tonight she just wants to feel like a woman.  The slow jam man, Bryan Michael Cox shows up to produce ""Stay Down"", which is a thoughtful slow jam.  In every relationship, you are going to have ups and downs.  No relationship is perfect.  The relationship is enduring one of those down times and Mary is asking her man to try to keep putting up with these down times so that they can receive the greater award at the end.  ""Hurt Again"" has Mary describing a situation where she is starting to have feelings for someone but she is hesitant in letting him know that because of all the times that she has been hurt in the past.  ""Shake Down"" is tolerable but when you see Usher and Mary J. Blige on a track, you have huge expectations.  Just like when you saw Usher and Alicia Keys on the track ""My Boo"", you expect the artists to make the collaboration memorable.  On ""Shake Down"", it's decent but nothing that you would expect when you have Mary and Usher on the same track.  Pharrell does his best to try to take you back to the 80s on ""Til The Morning"", but for the most part, unless you want to grab some old fashioned roller skates and go to the skating rink, this song won't work for most Mary J. Blige fans.  On ""Roses"", Mary has to get a point across to her man that she is fed up with all of the confrontations with her man and today she is not having it for any reason.  I can definitely relate to this track.  Men:  You're in a no win situation when this day comes so let her vent and this type of day will go by faster and be much easier for you to handle...lol

Clearly, my favorite track on ""Growing Pains"" is ""Fade Away"".  Stargate, who has produced multilple Ne-Yo songs, Joe's ""It's Me"", Chris Brown's ""With You"", Rihanna & Ne-Yo's ""Hate That I Love You"", Trey Songz' ""Can't Help But Wait"" and most importantly to some people, Beyonce's ""Irreplaceable"", produce this memorable Mary J. track in ""Fade Away"".  Ne-Yo co-produces and writes the track as well.  Mary finds herself at times, because of all of her troubles not even wanting to be here on Earth.  That's how bad times have gotten for her in the past.  Although, her life is definitely much better than those times, she may still have moments where she feels like she did before irregardless of her success because of her past transgressions.  Ne-Yo does an excellent job of reaching back so to speak in times in Mary's past to capture these moments.  Here's the bridge: ""Couldn't look myself in the mirror, asking myself how dumb could you be.""  ""Maybe everything would be much clearer, if no one could see me"".  Mary's times in the past were so bad she didn't even want to me amongst the living at times.  There were times when she just want to take herself out of this world and not even be here anymore.  That's where I feel the ""....invinsibility would be great"" part comes from on the track.  ""What Love Is"" is another memorable Mary, Stargate and Ne-Yo collaboration as Mary writes her rendition of what she feels the four letter word means just like Alicia Keys did on ""The Thing About Love"" from her ""As I Am"" CD.  The effects at the end of the track add to the track as well.  ""Work In Progress"" (Growing Pains) is also written by Ne-Yo as Mary walks you through how she is getting through life day by day the best she can.  She is clearly trying her best, but she also wants to let women in the world know that she is just as human as they are despite her success.  ""Talk To Me"" deals with Mary wanting to receive better communication from her man and the benefits of effective communication in a relationship.  ""If You Love Me"" is a decent track but it sounds too much like ""Be Without You"" Part 2 to me.  ""Smoke"" is clearly unlike any Mary J. Blige track that I have ever heard.  This track seems to be a part of Mary J.'s musical maturity. You never would have heard Mary on a track like this in the What's The 411 and My Life days.  As a matter of fact, she would have had a profanity laced tirade ready for Puffy if he even tried to bring her a track like this.  In the end, it clearly works for me and it's nice to see Mary trying different things.  ""Come To Me (Peace)"" ends ""Growing Pains"" on a good note as she is trying to win over the affection of a lost love from the past.

Overall, ""Growing Pains"" may not be Mary J. Blige's best CD, but if you look at her career since 1992's ""What's The 411"" to now, you see alot of progression in her music and lyrics in 2007.  Not only do you see a growth process with Mary as a 37 year old woman but you also hear the growth process through her lyrics and her production.  If you are a fan of the majority of Mary J's releases, then you should also add ""Growing Pains"" to your collection.

A28N19JIB5161D,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I've been a fan of Mary's since 1992, so my review is slanted in her favor. The first single, ""Just Fine"" is a dance hit in heavy rotation on urban radio.  ""Till The Morning"" produce by Pharrell is a strong 5 star song.  ""Roses"" is a Mary Anthem, dedicated to ladies in tough relationships.  ""Fade Away"" produced by Ne-yo is a song about painful change, and ending a bad relationship.  Notice the theme.......Mary brings real emotions in her music, and that's why after 16 years, she's still on top.","I 've been a fan of Mary 's since 1992 , so my review is slanted in her favor .

AE9GUE3HHOX3U,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"I think the biggest improvement Mary J. has made during her last 2 albums is she has remained consistant.  You can now listen to her latest cds without skipping over tracks that interrupt the flow.  Aside from ""What's the 411"" and ""My Life"", her albums were littered with junk that were just plain unlistenable.  Of course every mary J. Blige album has at least a couple of good songs on it, but ""Breakthru"" and ""Growing Pains"" are a complete journey you can play from start to finish.  I don't really like the title of the album though, ""Growing Pains"" reminds me too much of the old 80's tv show and it sounds too harsh like ""groin pains"".  I love the cover of the cd.  I love Mary's pose, it looks retro and Egyptian and she's also laying on a bunch of records which is great for me becuz I used to dj. You go with the shout out to vinyl, Mary. As for the songs on the cd, I love ""Work That"", I could listen to this song a million times, ""Just Fine"", ""Roses"", and ""Til The Mornin'"" are other standouts for me.  ""What Love Is"" and ""Fade Away"" are some of my all time faves from Mary J. ""Fade Away"" sounds a little alternative like Depeche Mode sounding, the background music is moody and deep. Towards the end of the cd, some of the songs go in that direction which is strange considering her R and B roots.  It's unique and groundbreaking, giving her music a fresh sound while remaining innovative.  The only song which doesn't do it for me is ""Grown Woman"".  It's not exactly groundbreaking material, the rap thing is so dated and played out at this point. My favourite lyric on the album where Mary really hits you with it is on ""Roses"". ""Sometimes I need a hug!""  Who doesn't.  Thanks for breaking it down Mary.","I think the biggest improvement Mary J. has made during her last 2 albums is she has remained consistant .

I do n't really like the title of the album though , "" Growing Pains "" reminds me too much of the old 80 's tv show and it sounds too harsh like "" groin pains "" . I love the cover of the cd . I love Mary 's pose , it looks retro and Egyptian and she 's also laying on a bunch of records which is great for me becuz As for the songs on the cd , I love "" Work That "" , I could listen to this song a million times , "" Just Fine "" , "" Roses "" , and "" Til The Mornin ' "" are other standouts for me . "" What Love Is "" and "" Fade Away "" are some of my all time faves from Mary J. "" Fade Away "" sounds a little alternative like Depeche Mode sounding , the background music is moody and deep . Towards the end of the cd , some of the songs go in that direction which is strange considering her R and B roots . It 's unique and groundbreaking , giving her music a fresh sound while remaining innovative . The only song which does n't do it for me is "" Grown Woman "" . It 's not exactly groundbreaking material , the rap thing is so dated and played out at this point . My favourite lyric on the album where Mary really hits you with it is on "" Roses "" . "" Sometimes I need a hug ! "" Who does n't . Thanks for breaking it down Mary ."

Michael Jackson had ""Thriller,"" Prince had ""Purple Rain,"" and Mary J. had the multi-Grammy-winning ""The Breakthrough.""  It is unfair to the singers to always compare each successive release with its predecessor for the artists may have different directions and concepts that they wish to pursue.

Mary J, though traveling some of the same roads as her previous works, branches out somewhat with ""Growing Pains"" with an album that is possibly more pop-oriented than anything that she has previously done, including ""The Breakthrough.""

""Growing Pains"" is a bit of everything that will, no doubt, increase her already large fan base.  Riding high on the strength of the first single ""Just Fine"" and its eye-popping video, the album is a well-crafted blend of R & B, funk, pop, and female angst and strength that can only be done by Miss Mary.

A1S2IY37JU93XS,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Back in 2003, someone apparently thought it was a good idea to bring the powers that were Mary J. Blige and P. Diddy back together, in hopes of re-creating the magic of their earlier works. Well, they were wrong. By no means was the result, Love & Life, a terrible album; however, almost any fan will agree that it's Mary's--for the lack of a better term--worst work to date. Yes, there were some great moments, but most of it was uninspired with some pretty lazy production, courtesy of Diddy. The disc barely went platinum, making it her lowest selling studio album by far. The ever-consistent woman who seemingly could do no wrong made a slight misstep. That's what made 2005's excellent release, The Breakthrough, such a pleasant surprise. With the huge success of ""Be Without You,"" the album's triple platinum status, its record-breaking first-week sales, and its eight Grammy nominations, it proved that Blige was on top once again and wasn't going anywhere. Two years later, she is back with Growing Pains.

From the photos, to the lyrics, to the themes and overall sound, Mary J. is definitely getting her grown woman on. Now a wife, she speaks with brutal honesty and maturity on serious relationships. They involve work, conflicts, disagreements, dependency, compromise, pain, passion, effort, and love, of course. Although it is a beautiful thing and brings much joy to people, to quote her, ""it ain't all roses."" I have read numerous reviews, from proffesionals nonetheless, that simply dismiss some of the lyrics as ""preachy,"" but I would have to disagree. Mary is a woman who has clearly been through many trials and tribulations in her life, and she just wants to share her wisdom and knowledge of the world to her large fanbase, who could most likely benefit from her viewpoints. (If these reviewers really can't hear these True-to-life statements without cringing, then it's probably time they put themselves in check!) The pictures in the album's booklet show Mary keeping it classier than ever.

The stunning back cover shows Mary sitting atop a cabinet of old vinyls. The only vinyl cover that you are able to decipher is Diana Ross' 1981 album, Why Do Fools Fall In Love. It is most likely just a plain coincidence, but it speaks volumes of Growing Pains. This album has the major crossover appeal that Ross possessed back in the day. While Pains will not alienate her solid fanbase that was built upon her original hip-hop/soul (which is still very present), each track, especially ""Come To Me (Peace),"" contains a slight change in sound that could let them be comfortable on almost any radio format, not just simply R&B. This could be due to some fresh producers and songwriters that have shown much promise recently, such as Ne-Yo, Tricky, The Dream, Jazze Pha, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, and the Neptunes, among others.

""Work That,"" as heard in the iTunes commercials, is a great choice for the second single. It is upbeat, inspirational, and infectious. The production by newcomer, Theron Otis Feemster, is simple and melodic, but it suits the song perfectly. On this, and a few other select tracks, Mary has a new swagger in her delivery that almost makes her sound like an MC. ""Grown Woman"" is another example of this. Over the hard-hitting and grungy hip-hop beat, she exudes confidence and pride in her womanhood. ""Stay Down"" speaks on marriage and how ""sometimes when we fight/ it don't seem like God's desgin/ but... I promised I would stand by you."" My favorite line appears in the chorus, when she begs her man to ""stay down/ we're almost to the very best part."" The production, by ingenious Bryan-Michael Cox, complements the emotion and triumph in Mary's strong vocals. ""Roses"" finds her nowhere near being preahcy; it's about those days when you want to be left alone and quite frankly, your lover just fans the fire. In between verses, she speaks, venting her emotions. On ""Talk To Me,"" she urges her man to communicate his feelings over an Emotions horn sample, casuing the track to have a very nostalgic, old school soul feel.

While this album is excellent, it is not flawless. Ludacris' guest appearance irritates me and almost ruins the great ""Grown Woman"" for me. His verse, while not terrible, is a bit vulgar, putting him and his supposed grown woman's bedroom business all out there. Lines like ""we some Stairmasters/ I make her get her exercise"" seem to contradict the classiness that Mary maintains throughout the rest of the track. ""Shake Down"" sounds a bit too much like something Mariah Carey would record. (I love Mariah, I just think that it's not like something Mary would do.) It's not a bad track, though. ""Just Fine,"" oddly chosen as the lead-off single, is a song I can take or leave depending on the day and my mood. ""Till the Morning,"" however, is my least favorite track. The Neptunes' production and writing has become very bland, stale, and predictable to me by this point in time. The song sounds like Kelis-lite during her Kaleidoscope era. The bridge is good, but that's pretty much all I enjoy of the track. ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"" is a musically very good, but the whole I'm-just-like-you-even-though-I'm-a-celebrity thing is getting pretty tired. ""What Love Is"" is also exceptional, but lyrics like ""it feels like joy/ it feels like pain/ it feels like sunshine/ it feels like rain"" are undeniably clich&eacute;.

The bottom line: It is not perfect, but Growing Pains is still a darn good album. Her vocals are on point, the production and songwriting is top notch, and the lyrics are mature and real. Growing Pains has a slightly new sound that will most likely lead to an even bigger crossover than The Breakthrough caused. Still, even her fans from the beginning will feel satisfied. How does she do it? It's a mystery. Mary J. Blige is a truly special and talented grown woman.

AIW5KNFD2114D,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"MJB is a force to be reckoned with. She comes out with amazing CD after amazing CD. How does she do it?!?!  She knows what her audience likes and why fix something that is not broken. She delivers and does it with 110% on `Growing Pains'.
As with everything thing May J. Blige does she puts every ounce of emotion and rawness into every song on this set.  Every song on here is a stand out that it's hard to single out any song. There is everything from classic slow Mary jams to the upbeat dance tracks to songs with a rock twinge fused into them.

My favorites on here include:
""Work That"" which has a great beat to it and promotes a good motto - to be yourself!
""Roses"" is THE cut!!  WOW!  Great melody, great lyrics and amazing vocals!
""Work In Progress (Growing Pains"" is a song that we can all relate to. Very good

I think the biggest appeal of MJB is that she is very relatable. She sings from the heart and it feels like every song was written for us; the listeners. She is your neighbor, your friend, your sister. Mary deserves every bit of success she gets and this CD is living proof of that! Amazing!!

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B00110DT4C,1,1,4,"Let me preface this review by saying that no True Mary J. Blige fan expected Blige to return with an album that was as classic as 2005's brilliant THE BREAKTHROUGH. Blige even commented that she wasn't concerned about outdoing the success of that milestone in her career. While the exceptional GROWING PAINS doesn't trump THE BREAKTHROUGH, it is another solid album in MJB's career.  With that said, Blige does experiment more on GROWING PAINS that she has on previous albums which gives all fans a taste of what the future may hold for Blige. It is a well balanced mixed of adult contemporary styled R&B, hip-hop, and urban contemporary music.

The album starts off on the right foot with ""Work That"", which is honestly the best of the two singles released from GROWING PAINS as of yet.  The production isn't far removed from NO MORE DRAMA's ""Family Affair"" and proves to be a welcome addition to Mary's collection.  ""Grown Woman"" is one of the big surprises of GROWING PAINS in which Blige channels her hip-hop soul roots for a banger that will surely crossover to R&B purists as well as hip-hop savvy listeners.  Ludacris's guest verse is sound here, but Mary J. Blige makes sure that all eyes are on her as she shed's through this albums ""Enough Cryin'"".  The difference? Harder drums and a more spunky vocal performance from MJB.

""Just Fine"" follows and keeps the momentum moving forward.  When I first heard this track, I was actually a bit disappointed.  It took time for it to grow on me and when it did, it was hott!!! Again, ""Work That"" is still the best.  ""Feel Like a Woman"", ""Stay Down"", and ""Hurt Now""  are all strong.  ""Shakedown"" features Usher and while it isn't Usher's best collaboration (that would be ""Same Girl""), it is enjoyable.  ""Til Morning"" is this albums ""Gonna Breakthrough"" or ""You Can't Hide From Luv""  - it's nearly perfect.  ""Roses"" and ""Fade Away"" are solid, but not as exciting as the earlier tracks or the phenomenal ""What Love Is"", ""Work in Progress (Growing Pains)"", or neo-soul inflected ""Talk To Me"" with its six feel groove.  ""If You Love Me"", ""Smoke"", and ""Come To Me (Peace)"" are solid, though they aren't the best of the best of GROWING PAINS. Notably, ""Come To Me"" does features innovative production work combining the best of the adult-alternative pop with R&B/Hip-hop synths.

All quibbles aside, GROWING PAINS is destined to be another critical and commercial hit for MJB.  It may not match THE BREAKTHROUGH, but who cares.  Mary has been representing since circa 1990 and each and every album has been incredibly consistent - she can sing her butt off! Even LOVE & LIFE, weaker than her other efforts, was a shining moment because MJB can make bad material sound better than what it is and that is a gift. 4 stars Mary - Keep working that!!!","Let me preface this review by saying that no True Mary J.

A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B00110DT4C,1,1,5,"Mary J. Blige follows ""The Breakthrough"" with ""Growing Pains"" which to me was an even stronger effort that claims the title of being one of her best, if not the best, albums of her career. She found her footing with ""The Breakthrough"" and any fears that she'd return with a cd that wasn't as strong should be put aside. ""Growing Pains"" has something for all of her fans and new ones, a sound that mirrors old R&B but also goes into territory that music seems afraid to venture into. After listening to the entire album, I found myself saying this was True quality. There isn't really a track to skip here; each song adds something to the mix and covers everything from a dance-vibe to a laid-back groove about love and loss.

Some of the standout tracks are ""Work That"" which is one of the upbeat songs, ""Grown Woman"" that could be this albums ""Enough Crying"" with Mary dishing out her good qualities and what makes her stand out at this point in her life. ""Feel Like A Woman"" is a new kind of song for Blige where she puts aside her reservations about being with someone and shows her most vulnerable of traits in this ballad-like track. ""Stay Down"" stands as my favorite, another turn for Mary J. Blige as she's asking her man to stay through the troubles and paints a picture of better days in their relationship that are to come. ""Roses"" is another track, more hard in sound, with Blige proclaiming she's all right and doesn't need people telling her what's wrong with her. ""Fade Away"" and ""What Love Is"" both are tracks that stand out for their production and the feeling she evokes. In what's perhaps one of her best closing tracks, ""Come To Me (Peace)"", is a big R&B/80s type of song that's a no-holds-barge explosion of sound and is moving and leaves you wanting more.

In all, ""Growing Pains"" is an absolute must own. Where most artist hit their peak at some point and become predictable, Mary J. Blige seems to be getting better with each year. The songs on this cd are fresh, original and yet sound different and a bit experimental for Blige as she matures into her new sound and comfort zone as an artist. Buy this cd, you will not be disappointed.","Mary J. Blige follows "" The Breakthrough "" with "" Growing Pains "" which to me was an even stronger effort that claims the title of being one of her best , if not the best , albums of her career . She found her footing with "" The Breakthrough "" and any fears that she 'd return with a cd that was n't as strong should be put aside .

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00113SLBA,-1,-1,3,"The quest to acquire all of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's music continues... and brings me to his fourth studio album and one of the admitted ""low points"" of Al's career.  After the phenomenal success of his first three albums, it must have been a shock for Al's fans (as well as himself) for his fourth album to be a flop in comparison.  In fact, many critics and even Al himself believed ""Polka Party"" would be his swan song and mark the end of his career.  Nearly thirty years later, of course, we know that's not True, but all the same, this album is often highlighted as a ""valley"" in his career, and most of its songs have been largely forgotten (with at least one outrageous exception).

After listening to this album, I'm inclined to agree with the critics -- while still fun, it's not Al's best, and while I enjoy a few of the songs, others are largely forgettable.

Al is best known for his parodies, and they make up about half of this album.  Of said parodies, my favorite would have to be ""Addicted to Spuds,"" his parody of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love.""  Food songs are practically a tradition for him by now, and this number takes Palmer's energetic original and turns it into an ode to the tuber.  ""Living With a Hernia,"" a parody of James Brown's ""Living In America,"" isn't quite as fun in my opinion, but it's a nice tribute to the original and shows that Al's capable of taking on a wide variety of musical styles.  The other parodies include ""Here's Johnny"" (El DeBarge's ""Who's Johnny""), a tribute to Ed McMahon of the Johnny Carson Show; ""Toothless People"" (Mick Jagger's ""Ruthless People""), which sounds curiously uninspired and without much effort put into the lyrics; and his by-now-customary polka mix in the titular ""Polka Party,"" which includes samples from various hits such as ""Harlem Shuffle,"" ""Venus,"" ""Sussidio,"" ""Rock Me Amadeus,"" and ""Papa Don't Preach.""

The originals are a mixed bag as well.  I didn't particularly care for ""Dog Eat Dog"" or ""Don't Wear Those Shoes,"" but I enjoyed the twangy country-western style of ""Good Enough For Now,"" as well as its hilarious lyrics that pay tribute to a ""just about average"" love interest.  ""One Of Those Days"" would have to be my favorite of the originals, as Al gripes about the various minor and major accidents and disasters that have befallen him today, ranging from losing a sock in the dryer to angry mobs burning crosses on his lawn -- and yes, it's the juxtaposition of the ridiculously major and hilariously minor disasters that make this song funny.

The most infamous number from this album would have to be ""Christmas At Ground Zero,"" the result of his record label requesting that he write a Christmas song -- you would really think that they would have learned their lesson about telling Al what to do from ""Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch.""  A merry and jingly tune carries some of the most disturbing lyrics of all time, detailing a Christmas celebrated after the nuclear bombs drop and reduce the world to a radioactive wasteland... and to top it off, the song ends with an air raid siren.  Even before 9/11 gave the term ""Ground Zero"" its far more tragic second meaning, it's a disturbing song... and yet weirdly hilarious at the same time.  Al may be goofy, but he also excels at black comedy.

Definitely not Al's best album, though a few hits do keep it from being a total wash.  If you're an Al completionist, go ahead and buy the album, but if you just want his best songs, I recommend you simply buy downloads of ""Addicted To Spuds"" and ""One Of Those Days,"" and maybe ""Christmas At Ground Zero"" if you don't mind some morbid humor.  Otherwise, save a full album purchase for ""Dare To Be Stupid"" or ""Mandatory Fun.""","The quest to acquire all of "" Weird Al "" Yankovic 's music continues ... and brings me to his fourth studio album and one of the admitted "" low points "" of Al 's career .

A246BU2DG7JC8I,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,3,"I agree with the reviewer who says he buys every release Rick does... I am the same way, as are most diehard Rick fans.  That said, just because I am a diehard doesnt mean I will like everything Rick does (not saying all diehards blindly love everything he does, but MANY do).  Rick is one of my all time favorite songwriters... I have no reason to be lackluster in any review unless it is how I really feel...

This is not a bad release.  Unfortunately, its not a good release either.  It's a solid ""ho hum"".  It's main problem is it and its songs is generally boring.  The songs are either slow or most are lacking in emotion.  Most are also very close to the originals in arrangement but a lesser finished product... in the way you hear when some studio band cranks out the top 40 hits ""as performed by ____"" that you used to see for $1.99 at department stores.  For me, it makes me think of the originals and why I like them better.  Broken Wings and Waiting For A Girl Like You are great songs originally... but they sound very similar here and in the case of WFAGLY, it was simply BETTER, with Lou Gramm singing it.  Unfortunately, there is not one cover here that I think is an improvement upon the original... (unlike how Rick made ""I've Done Everything For You"" and a few other covers through his career so much better than their originals).  Few here even get me remotely excited.  Here, the standout covers are Human and Baker Street (which is a lighter more heartfelt version than the one put out a few years ago by Foo Fighters).  The whole album is so lacking in intensity.  I know he intentionally chose songs that are mellow, but I just don't think that was wise and it makes for a release that is easy to file in your collection and forget.  There isn't any cover song except Baker Street that makes me want to hear it again.  Rick is a master of intensity in the right places... Shock Denial Anger Acceptance seemed to reiterate that point both to Rick and to the fans.  Had he done a cover CD with some more rocking tunes mixed in, I think it might have been at least more interesting if not downright good... this one just isn't and I can only hope this hasn't kept him from working on new songs for the next real CD.

The one gem on this release is Rick's own song Cry, and that alone really makes it worth something to the diehards (in addition to the fact that diehards will buy anything he does anyway).  It is a very good song that is emotional and has some great vocals upon it.  I find it only adds to my wish that Rick would have spent this time recording his own work than doing this!  Unless you have all other Rick albums already, you are better off putting your money into them than this album.  Especially be sure you have Shock Denial Anger Acceptance, Living In Oz, or Working Class Dog before even considering this one... those are Rick at his best.

(Again, this isn't a bad CD... but Rick's real work is so superior and an average release for Rick isn't indicative of his abilities.  I'd hate to see someone buy this as their introduction to Rick and come away thinking he isn't all that good.)","I agree with the reviewer who says he buys every release Rick does ...

A235NA61RC6YC1,B0011B6UI8,1,1,4,"The Good

There's not much to say about this release really. For the most part Springfield stays True to the original arrangements of the songs, albeit for a different guitar or piano tone here and there. With the songs I recognize, ""I'm Not in Love,"" ""Life in a Northern Town,"" ""Broken Wings,"" ""Baker Street,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" ""For No On,"" and ""Imagine,"" they sound just like the originals versions, except their being sung by Rick Springfield. All of the tracks chosen are mellow and flow nicely together. Rick is in great voice, but doesn't really challenge himself.

The Bad

It doesn't really make sense to include a new song (""Cry"") on a covers album, but at least it fits in with the rest. I would have liked to have heard a couple of slightly different versions or arrangements.

The Verdict

I know I've been a little critical of this album, but overall I like it. They're songs I know, from an artist I enjoy. The best thing about Rick Springfield staying True to the originals is that there's no room to mess them up, which happens sometimes with covers albums.","The Good

AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0011B6UI8,-1,-1,3,"Rick Springfield has been anything but bland, from his breakout ""Jessie's Girl"" to his previous release, SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE.  THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is, unfortunately, a largely bland effort.  Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker (there are some excellent guitar riffs in here), but his voice has gotten worse (worked well on SDAA, but a raspy, spoken-voiced version of ""Imagine""?  Come on).

Therefore, this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans, nor please his old ones (especially since it's a cover album, and he has only one original on here that doesn't measure up to his usual songwriting standards).  The main flaw of the record is this: Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit ""Human Touch.""  In fact, this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record, with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory.  And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality, and while a few of his performances shine (""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Miss You Nights"" specifically), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let-down.  Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield, if not in his finest vocal form, at least writing his own tunes again, and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits, or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA.","Rick Springfield has been anything but bland , from his breakout "" Jessie 's Girl "" to his previous release , SHOCK / DENIAL / ANGER / ACCEPTANCE .

Thoughtful, unusual songs yet sound familiar, and upon a second listen, feel like old friends.  The instrumentation, although relatively spare, sounds full and rich, complimenting Newcomer's lovely, alto voice perfectly, without ever stealing the spotlight.  A few tracks have gentle, sometimes driving rhythms, and there are subtle yet surprising sounds around every bend, so there's enough variety to keep THE GEOGRAPHY OF LIGHT from becoming too somber.  In fact the title and the cover art are quite apt, as the general mood of this wonderful CD does remind me of one of those days when half the sky is dark with a passing storm, yet clear enough in spaces to let shafts of golden sunlight through.

A couple of side notes: not only has Carrie written perhaps the only song ever sung about geodes, but she then ends this elegant album on an upbeat note with ""Don't Push Send,"" a highly amusing ditty about the dangers of writing and sending letters in cyber-space.  Presumably, she calls this a ""bonus track"" because it's so different from the rest of the album, but it works, and I've quickly decided that it's not a throwaway; it belongs here...

I've been listening to Carrie Newcomer's songs for many years, and have most of her albums on CD.  But it wasn't until 2000's THE AGE OF POSSIBILITY that I thought Carrie had finally done a truly solid album.  In 2002 and 2005, respectively, she released two more fine CD's, GATHERING OF SPIRITS and REGULARS AND REFUGEES.  The latter included a single from the previous release, a BEST OF collection, ""Betty's Diner"" which had been inspired by her own short story.  The subsequent album was all about the people she imagined as customers of said diner.  The conceit worked well, and I could hardly wait to hear what Newcomer would come up with next.  It would be a two-year wait, but it was worth it.  I believe Carrie Newcomer has topped herself and turned out her best album yet.  Not a False step here; this is a woman who has hit her stride.  She has always written compelling lyrics, but this time out, the the melodies, music and arrangements rise to their level in just about every instance.  If you like thoughtful, mature songs that are about something, and your taste runs toward the melodic, I can recommend this CD without reservation.","Drenched in guitars and strings , and in a minor key , "" There Is A Tree "" hooked me the minute Carrie began to sing , and from there the album never lost my interest .

It was reissued on an audiophile lp pressing a few years back though. These are fun takes on Mancini originals. Jones sure has a great imagination and is fun. The occasional track sounds dated using sound effects that was popular in the 60's, but on the whole, this album is really fun and is worth checking out. But the big minus is that they didn't reproduce the liner notes in a little booklet. It's reproduced on the cover and is really small. That is a shame since the notes are informative. Other than that, a fine reissue with top notch remastering!","Despite that this does n't have new liner notes , or the little booklet that other Verve by request reissues had , I 'm still giving it 5 stars since this album has been out of print for decades .

A36EW68H08UOCS,B0011Y8IU8,1,1,5,"From what I gather about Jeanne Robertson, she doesn't consider herself a ""stand-up comic"" so much as ""public speaker,"" but make no mistake about it - she is as funny as anyone in the business.  She comes from a little corner of North Carolina, and if Mayberry actually existed, you wouldn't have difficulty imagining that her home must be just up the road a spell from Andy and Barney.

I recently had my first exposure to the Sirius radio network, and tracks from this ""Flat-Out Funny"" recording were prominently rotated between Bill Cosby and Jeff Foxworthy.  It is no faint praise to say that Jeanne Robertson is as funny as any of them.

Her stories are full of wry and hilarious insights into the human condition, and it appears that any obstacle in her life simply becomes ""new material"".  This also seems to mean that anyone in her life is ""fair game"" for inclusion in her routines.  We hear many details about her husband, Jerry ""Leftbrain"", including his hesitation to accompany her on a near-disastrous eight-day rafting trip through the grand canyon, which included recreational opportunities such as hanging precariously from the side of a cliff, using AARP-vintage hands that at home would have difficulty opening a jar in the kitchen.

This recording is an absolute obvious choice for that person or family or group who wants to hear ""flat-out funny"" comedy that is suitable for all ears, but the truth is that she is also as funny as the comedians who use the full spectrum of language.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

And don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here

We don't laugh often enough, do we?  We don't take the time, as Jeanne has done, to actually NOTICE the things that are funny in the world.  Like the absolute greatest masters of the comedic form, Mrs. Robertson doesn't ""make up stuff"" or ""tell jokes"".  She simply lets us take a glimpse at the world at she sees it.  She holds a mirror up to life and finds hilarious that which is looking back.

She has several funny, FUNNY recordings which you can get as audio or DVD recordings, but ""Southern Style"" is easily in her top 2 or 3 and includes perhaps her most famous story of all: ""Left Brain's Grocery List"" could stand toe to toe with Bill Cosby's ""Noah"" or Richard Pryor's ""Mudbone"" or Andy Griffith's ""What it was, was Football"".

Mrs. Robertson's husband is named Jerry, but she calls him ""Left Brain"" and if you don't understand that, as she says, you may be one too...  Jeanne has been drafted into making several of her famous 7-up pound cakes, and needs to dispatch Jerry to the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients.  You'll just have to hear the results, but as the tears roll down your cheeks with laughter the part of your soul that recognizes the truthfulness of things will know there is a little Left Brain in most of us.

Thank Heaven for BOTH of the Robertsons and for Jeanne's gift for sharing her magnificently cultivated sense of humor.

A final word: perhaps most miraculously of all, Mrs. Robertson makes you laugh and laugh and laugh with nary an off-color word.

AZ, perhaps, one of the most underrated lyricists to grace hip hop, returns back to the scene by dropping his new album entitled, A.W.O.L., on his new independent Quiet Money Records label.  AZ is probably best known for his now legendary guest appearance on Life's a Bitch from Nas's classic Illmatic album.  AZ has always released quality material, but he was never been able to really blow up in the music scene.  Was it industry politics?  Bad timing?  Whatever the case is, AZ has never allowed for his lack of notoriety to effect his ability in creating quality music.

With A.W.O.L., rather than following the watered-down movement that's plagued rap for the last few years, AZ stays consistent and refuses to change up his formula.  He still has that smooth flawless delivery that's been blessing listeners since the early to mid 90's.  He's still that wise street poet who somehow is able to construct verses in a nearly flawless manner.  Plus, to further compliment the lyrics, the production on this album is top notch including beats by DJ Premier, Buckwild, and others...  The only weak spot on this album may be Envious featuring Bounty Killer, but that's only due to a clash of styles.

Top tracks include:  The Come Up, Never Change, Still Alive, City Of Gods, and Magic Hour.

Guest appearances include Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Half-A-Mill (recently deceased), Begetz, Bounty Killer, and CL Smooth...",""" [ as ] far as poetry , I 'm Nas , Biggie , Jay , Mos Def / Rakim , Kool G. Rap , Kane , KRS / Pac , Common , and Kanye would say I 'm blessed "" ( AZ - Still Alive )

The first real standout for me is ""Never Change"" a cut where AZ reflects about a friend who died, delivering some memorable lyrics and a premium chorus. Wu-Tang's Raekwon and Ghostface then drop in for a solid collaboration repping their city ""New York"". Backed by a crazy beat, AZ rhymes with hunger on ""Still Alive"". My current favorite is ""City Of Gods"", AZ shines rhyming well and laces this one with another impressive chorus. One of the things I have always liked about AZ is he remains genuine. Half-A-Mil was murdered a few years ago, AZ brings him back for the sad and heartfelt ""Street Life"" feat. Begetz. AZ then tells a short ""Bedtime Story"" remembering past years. It's nice to see AZ getting the production he deserves, Premo hooked AZ up for ""The Come Up"" and AZ shines again. Not a Bounty Killer fan, so not feeling ""Envious"", while the title track is solid. The bonus material is decent, good to that CL Smooth is still around feeling ""Magic Hour"".

Half - A - Mil was murdered a few years ago , AZ brings him back for the sad and heartfelt "" Street Life "" feat . AZ then tells a short "" Bedtime Story "" remembering past years . It 's nice to see AZ getting the production he deserves , Premo hooked AZ up for "" The Come Up "" and AZ shines again . Not a Bounty Killer fan , so not feeling "" Envious "" , while the title track is solid . The bonus material is decent , good to that CL Smooth is still around feeling "" Magic Hour "" . I recently heard another new excellent AZ track called "" Game of Life "" , wish that one had been included on this release . For years people have slept on AZ 's music , I do n't know if that will continue , I do highly recommend checking out "" A.W.O.L. "" ."
A3LEVOCJ6J45LU,B0011YBRFQ,1,1,5,I can go on and review each song/track...  But damn- this Cd is hot!  AZ shines on all tracks.  production is on point.  Nuff said.,I can go on and review each song / track ...   But damn- this Cd is hot !
A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,4,"For those of you who are familiar with the music of The Bangles, they have been called the female equivalent of the Beatles.  Their bright, sweet choral harmonies are enough to capture any listener's attention.  This was one of the bands that I had grown up with alongside Madonna, The Go Go's, and other 80's artists.  After three albums of mega smash after smash, they unfortunately imploded and took a 13 year absence.  Susanna Hoffs would create 2 solo albums, and Vicki/Debbi Peterson would create their own records under the pseudonym Continental Drifters.

So once they reunited in 2003 and released this then-new LP, it was as if The Bangles had never left.  Although their voices sounded a bit older, so has their sound matured.  This CD starts off with a fiery one-two punch of the title track sung by Susanna.  Other songs would be very energetic as well -- Debbi's ""Stealing Rosemary"", Vicki's ""Mixed Messages"", and Michael Steele's 2 very important songs (and my personal favorites as well):  ""Nickel Romeo"" and ""Between The Two"".  Check out the lyric ""a Cheshire Cat in yellow Beatle boots...""  Hint hint, anyone??

The only 2 songs I did not like were Susanna's ""I Will Take Care Of You"" and Debbi's ""Lost At Sea.""  But that is only from my personal taste and bears absolutely NO reflection on the band itself!  I was very saddened/disheartened when Michael Steele eventually left The Bangles permanently, before this decade even started.  So, in other words, you won't hear any of her tracks on the band's 2011 LP, ""Sweetheart Of The Sun.""  I am somehow okay with that, because in all fairness, each one of the four female members DO have a very unique, distinctive voice and incredible instrumental talent that attracted droves of fans in the first place.

Other than Susanna's recent 2012 solo release, ""Someday"", I'm still betting that The Bangles have some more songs left in them for the rest of this decade to follow!!  :)","For those of you who are familiar with the music of The Bangles , they have been called the female equivalent of the Beatles .

A2IAY7YMHDYP36,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,4,"The CD is full of ""nice"" Bangles songs - no home runs or commercial hits, but no duds.  The Bangles show a greater sophistication in composition than prior efforts in this disc.  ""Nickle Romeo"" is a high point for me, with minor keys and harmonies this is clearly one of Michael Steeles' best songs ever!
The title cut is catchy with rather bizarre lyrics, and the whole disc earns a solid ""B"".  As the foursome dissolved after this, it's the last music made by the band as a whole, and should be in every Bangles fan's collection.

I used to have the cd years ago but had to sell it for some much needed cash. I am so glad I bought it again. I almost forgot how much I loved the album. I definitely can hear the maturity in the band's songwriting. Like in the '80s, the women all harmonize perfectly together as well as take turns singing lead. I enjoyed all the songs.

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B0011XW5WQ,-1,-1,3,"I quote the first line from ""Between the Two"", the fourteenth track off the Bangles' latest album Doll Revolution, because I'm wondering if this is going to be their last album. It's been 15 years since they recorded an album together, and when I looked at the liner notes -- actually, there really aren't any, which makes you wonder if they just rushed into the studio to put this album out. Also, this album is on Koch Records, and Koch seems to be the place where everyone eventually ends up -- well, either there or TVT.
All the other three-star reviews for this album are pretty accurate, and each person seems to have a different opinion of which song(s) stands out. To me, the best song on here is the song they have out now, ""Something That You Said"" (its video also appears on the bonus DVD). And ""Mixed Messages"" is pretty catchy despite the lyrical shortcomings. But the rest of the songs aren't that great.
A lot of these songs really could have been written better. At times the lyrics go from lazy (""Ride the Ride"", ""Ask Me No Questions"") to crazy (Elvis Costello's ""Tear Off Your Own Head""). ""Grateful"" is tolerable, but it's the kind of song you'd expect to hear from them when they were still in their teens, not in their forties. And sorry, but the ballad ""I Will Take Care of You"" sounds like a watered-down version of ""Eternal Flame"".
People say a lot of the songs on here sound better live than they do on the album, and if that's the case, then you should just see them in concert. Or else if you're still feeling nostalgic about the Bangles, then just pull out their `80s albums or their Greatest Hits package. The ladies can still play and sing, but I wouldn't really call Doll Revolution a revolutionary album.

A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Al Stewart (had a big radio hit with the song Year of the Cat) said recently that he still has a great fondness for ""jangle-y bands"" -- guitar-based good time pop music that rocks, but not too hard.  What the Bangles have produced on Doll Revolution is a classic of the jangle-y genre.
When a band takes a break of over a decade and then re-forms for a new project, there is always justifiable worry that the old magic can't be captured again. The Bangles proved an exception to the rule by producing the strongest work of their career on this long-awaited new album. Granted, not every tune on Doll Revolution is a solid gold gem, but there are at least ten well-turned songs on this record, which is about the most anyone can reasonably ask.
If you liked the old Bangles, there is no reason you shouldn't be happy with the new Bangles. They can still rock, and sing beautifully produced and sincere love songs. If anything, their harmonies are sweeter and more perfect than ever. The recording does not have state-of-the-art clarity, which is a bit of a disappointment, but the fidelity is at least equivalent to their previous records from the eighties.
There is one sour note, not in the music, but in the fact that if you want the lyrics, you won't get them in the booklet. They are found only on the limited edition DVD version -- on the DVD. So you are supposed to run to your DVD player every time you want to check out the song lyrics? Not cool.
The Bangles have shown that you *can* go home again. They recorded this album on their own terms, took their time, and carefully crafted something they could be proud of. And they should be proud. This is good stuff. It isn't revolutionary, despite the title. They sing of love, loss, confusion, frustration, and loneliness. They make it rhyme, and they make us tap our feet and smile. I can't ask for more than that.","Al Stewart ( had a big radio hit with the song Year of the Cat ) said recently that he still has a great fondness for "" jangle - y bands "" -- guitar - based good time pop music that rocks , but not too hard .

A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"I have long thought of the Bangles as a second tier band, sort of the ugly stepsisters to the more enjoyable GoGo's, and nowhere near in the same league as the Cinderella of all groups, Fanny (still the premiere all-female band). I've always liked the group, I just wasn't moved by them. Too much of the time they seemed like four individuals fighting for the solo spotlight, versus a tight, together unit. Well, all that has changed with DOLL REVOLUTION, the new release from 2003's Most Improved act. Tight, cohesive and intelligent, this is a group to be reckoned with. This is clear right from the start; the disc opens with a blistering cover of Elvis Costello's ""Tear Off Your Own Head."" Susanna Hoff's opening ""HEY!"" only hints at things to come in the rest of the song...hand claps, a pounding rhythm section, tinkling piano and soaring vocals coalesce, resulting in one of the Bangles' best, hardest rocking songs to date. ""Stealing Rosemary"" has a rockin', neo-folk vibe to it, while ""Something That You Said"" has a delicate (yet fresh) techno groove behind it's hushed vocals and tender lyrics. This touching song of True love (""Showing you every weakness and feeling strong for it/I used to run from real love now I long for it/Now I know what I've been missing/Since I've been listening"") features an assured lead vocal from Hoffs, probably her best to date. The same could be said about Debbi Peterson and her aching take on ""Ask Me No Questions."" Gorgeous harmonies round out this beauty. ""The Rain Song"" has to be one of my favorite tracks. A mid-tempo rocker, it sports a gutsy lead vocal from guitarist Vicki Peterson and smart lyrics (""I don't think about us much anymore/Frankly the topic has become a bore"" and ""I don't think about us when I'm sleeping/It doesn't even cross my dreamlike mind/And I don't think I see your face through the curtains/Hell, I don't even miss you half the time""). This is an AC hit waiting to happen! Bassist Michael Steele steps into the spotlight and shines on her groovy ""Nickel Romeo."" This cut is a great example of how much the group has grown into a more unified musical unit. ""Ride The Ride"" is a rollicking group effort, while ""I Will Take Care Of You"" is another gentle Hoffs number. ""Here Right Now"" is a real gem that slowly grew on me. Drummer Debbi Peterson was always kind of ""the kid sister who has to be in the band"" to me, sort of a female Ringo, but she has SO come into her own on DOLL REVOLUTION, both as a vocalist and lyricist (""In and outta town/Time for you to settle down/Stand back, take a look around you/You're runnin' from the pressures of the restless world/Hush for a moment, baby just be still""). Captivating....simply captivating! From here we segue into another favorite, Vicki Peterson's hauntingly dark ""Single By Choice."" With it's opening chorus (""Single by choice/Never married, never ever divorced/Listen to the solitary voice/Tell you I'm single by choice""), one might think there's a bitterness to the song, but nothing could be farther from the truth...as you get deeper into the track, you see there's an intelligence and life-experience to it that's missing from much of today's music (""I know what you're thinkin'/She can't be complete/Til the right kind of man/Comes sweep her off her feet/Well I've been there before/Times four, times five/With the right kind of man/Barely made it out alive""). Brava, Ms. Peterson (kind of ironic, though, that Vicki just got engaged)! ""Lost At Sea"" is another winner from Peterson's baby sister...Debbi once again shines on this heartfelt ballad that builds and soars, with spot-on lyrics that everyone can identify with (""Can we try to salvage what we can/From the weight of water and sand/Lift us up again"", ""Well,you walk/Never ever looking back/One defends and one attacks/There's a thousand reasons to begin again""). ""Song For A Good Son"" is a great story-song from Steele. Intense and propulsive, the lyrics are stunningly visual - sort of a mini movie! - and Michael delivers them with conviction and in a strong, authoritative vocal. ""Mixed Messages"" and ""Between The Two"" are probably my two least favorite tracks on DOLL REVOLUTION, not because they're bad, just because everything else is so strong. ""Mixed Messages"" has a nice enough 60's feel to it, while ""Between The Two"" has a soaring (albeit slightly forced) intensity. The disc closes with the gorgeous ""Grateful."" Be it an ode to her children or a musical thank-you to her fellow band members for a successful second chance together, the song is delivered from Hoffs' heart and gut. Floating out of your speakers, it makes you thankful for unexpected opportunities and small surprises.

A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"I was so thrilled when their reunion album finally happened.  I did not, however, expect it to exceed classics such as All Over The Place and Different Light, and it doesn't, but the songs are as fresh as if hearing them for the first time ever.  After fifteen years... Wow!  Getting this prevented me from tearing off my own head, to paraphrase the leading song. Key=[lead vocalist]
After the phrase, ""One must tear off one's own head,"" comes a quick burst of snarling punkish guitar and Susanna's familiar sugary voice.  I haven't heard the original Elvis Costello version, but they really jam on ""Tear Off Your Own Head (Doll Revolution)""  This opening number makes this yet another classic in the Bangles pantheon of hits.
""Stealing Rosemary"" is a simple song of a woman doing the title action for her man.  What, without parsley, sage, and thyme?  Kidding.  [Debbi]
""Something That You Said"" is another classic, with the solid Beatles/Byrds influence heard with the guitar and the harmony vocals.  The drum machine in the background paints a modern addition.  And Susanna's voice never sounded so good!
""Ask Me No Questions"" has rhythmic overtones of the Beatles ""Rain"" without the feedback guitar.  The main chorus goes ""Oh, I'm in love with you/But I turn away when you look in my eyes/Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies."" [Debbi]
""Rain Song"" sung by Vicki is an upbeat guitar-oriented number where when it rains, she remembers her ex.  And there's a bitter taste with this line:  ""I'm doing fine as long as you stay locked up/Inside a cloud of grey""  Whoa! [Vicki]
That's quite a fancy dresser in ""Nickel Romeo"", someone who's described as ""a Cheshire cat in yellow Beatle boots"".  ""Strange desperation-you gotta cop that fix/Making every little girl is keeping you alive.""  That bad, huh?  [Michael]
""Ride The Ride"" has a similar beat but less ferocious than ""Doll Revolution"".  With signature guitar hooks, call it a close cousin to ""In Your Room"" [all]
Just what I needed, another tender ballad to melt my heart, and my favourite song here.  ""I Will Take Care Of You"" is an affirmative song of support from a loved one who will stand tall alongside through times of fear and sadness:  ""Smile, if you can now/Smile through your tears/Here where your fears are known/
Know you're safe at home.""  Magic! [Susanna, of course!]
Guitar and soundwise, the upbeat ""Here Right Now"" sounds like Green-era R.E.M. and calls for one to slow down.  ""Stand back and take a look around you/Running from the pressures of a restless world/Hush for a moment, baby, just be still/Here now./Spend a minute next to me.""  Amen to that!
The woman in bittersweet ""Single By Choice"" is affirmative of the title, adding ""Never marry, never ever divorce/Listen to the solitary voice.""  Even though she gives bad experiences she had, sad, isn't it? [Vicki]
""Lost At Sea"" details a couple who's lost so far in arguments that it's as if they are lost at sea.  The solution:  ""Take my hand, come to me/Save a life, rescue you, rescue me.""  Another Byrdsy song replete with harmonies. [Vicki]
""Song For A Good Son"" details a woman explaining to her son why she seems emotionally cold.  She is scarred by the loss of her mother, taken by the ocean current.  There are suicidal overtones:  ""Waterside so deep and wide/If I follow, maybe I will find her."" [Michael]
""Grateful"" is a lullaby to one's young son, enhanced by chorus harmonies of ""All we are and all we need is"" while Susanna's whispery sweet voice does lead.
The bonus DVD contains ""A Day In The Life Of The Bangles"" mini-documentary, which basically explains how they felt about getting back together, story behind ""TOYOH"", and their amazement at the large fan base they had, the ""Something That You Said"" video, audio and lyrics pages.
All the familiar elements are there, Susanna's sweet voice, the tight harmonies, the 60's rock influenced sound, the brand of garage pop/rock hybrid.  It's as if they never broke up.  A warm welcome back!","I was so thrilled when their reunion album finally happened . I did not , however , expect it to exceed classics such as All Over The Place and Different Light , and it does n't , but the songs are as fresh as if hearing them for the first time ever . Wow !   Getting this prevented me from tearing off my own head , to paraphrase the leading song . Key=[lead vocalist ] 
 After the phrase , "" One must tear off one 's own head , "" comes a quick burst of snarling punkish guitar and Susanna 's familiar sugary voice . I have n't heard the original Elvis Costello version , but they really jam on "" Tear Off Your Own Head ( Doll Revolution ) "" This opening number makes this yet another classic in the Bangles pantheon of hits . "" Stealing Rosemary "" is a simple song of a woman doing the title action for her man . Kidding . [ Debbi ] 
 "" Something That You Said "" is another classic , with the solid Beatles / Byrds influence heard with the guitar and the harmony vocals . The drum machine in the background paints a modern addition . And Susanna 's voice never sounded so good ! "" Ask Me No Questions "" has rhythmic overtones of the Beatles "" Rain "" without the feedback guitar . The main chorus goes "" Oh , I 'm in love with you / But I turn away when you look in my eyes / Ask me no questions I 'll tell you no lies . "" [ Debbi ] 
 "" Rain Song "" sung by Vicki is an upbeat guitar - oriented number where when it rains , she remembers her ex . And there 's a bitter taste with this line : "" I 'm doing fine as long as you stay locked up / Inside a cloud of grey ""   Whoa ! [ Vicki ] 
 That 's quite a fancy dresser in "" Nickel Romeo "" , someone who 's described as "" a Cheshire cat in yellow Beatle boots "" . "" Strange desperation - you got ta cop that fix / Making every little girl is keeping you alive . "" That bad , huh ? [ Michael ] 
 "" Ride The Ride "" has a similar beat but less ferocious than "" Doll Revolution "" . With signature guitar hooks , call it a close cousin to "" In Your Room "" [ all ] 
 Just what I needed , another tender ballad to melt my heart , and my favourite song here . "" I Will Take Care Of You "" is an affirmative song of support from a loved one who will stand tall alongside through times of fear and sadness :   "" Smile , if you can now / Smile through your tears / Here where your fears are known/ 
 Know you 're safe at home . "" Magic ! [ Susanna , of course ! ] 
 Guitar and soundwise , the upbeat "" Here Right Now "" sounds like Green - era R.E.M. and calls for one to slow down . "" Stand back and take a look around you / Running from the pressures of a restless world / Hush for a moment , baby , just be still / Here now./Spend a minute next to me . "" The woman in bittersweet "" Single By Choice "" is affirmative of the title , adding "" Never marry , never ever divorce / Listen to the solitary voice . "" Even though she gives bad experiences she had , sad , is n't it ? [ Vicki ] 
 "" Lost At Sea "" details a couple who 's lost so far in arguments that it 's as if they are lost at sea . The solution :   "" Take my hand , come to me / Save a life , rescue you , rescue me . ""   Another Byrdsy song replete with harmonies . [ Vicki ] 
 "" Song For A Good Son "" details a woman explaining to her son why she seems emotionally cold . She is scarred by the loss of her mother , taken by the ocean current . There are suicidal overtones : "" Waterside so deep and wide / If I follow , maybe I will find her . "" [ Michael ]

A1TUDA3O519RYJ,B0011XW5WQ,1,1,5,"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from Everything (though this is by no means All Over The Place, Volume 2).
I am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's ""Nickel Romeo,"" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susanna sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (""Something That You Said"", ""I Will Take Care of You"", ""Grateful""). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on ""Ask Me No Questions"" and ""Here Right Now,"" and Vicki sounds great on ""Single by Choice,"" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's ""I Am A Rock."" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on ""Mixed Messages""? As for ""The Rain Song,"" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!
The ensemble vocals on ""Ride the Ride"" and ""Stealing Rosemary"" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.
My only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened Doll Revolution by dropping ""Lost at Sea,"" ""Song for a Good Son,"" and ""Between the Two.""
I understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to Doll Revolution. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?","Fifteen years is a long time between albums , but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien .

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B0011XW5WQ,-1,-1,3,"I think it's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd.  Their last full one was 1989's 'Everything'.  In my opinion it is hard for them to ever top their debut album (not their EP).  You had to figure U.S. record companies must have had similar thoughts since this disk has been released everywhere else since early 2003.
They still have decent songwriting abilities and continue to have great blended harmonies (""Stealing Rosemary"").  Both of these things are their saving grace.
Each member has one very good song. Debbie Peterson has ""Here Right Now"", which should have been the initial single. Susanna Hoffs has ""Something That You Said"", which is the first single and would have been a great follow-up single selection. Vicki Peterson has ""Single By Choice"" and Michael Steele has ""Between the Two"".  There are others that are certainly ok, just nothing outstanding.  Even ""Ride the Ride"" isn't as good as the version I downloaded off the internet (oops) almost 2 years ago.
Overall, Debbie Peterson and Michael Steele are the most consistent on this disk.  Steele has always been under-utilized as a lead vocalist and songwriter. Nothing changes here.  I'm really liking her  ""Song For a Good Son"".  She's at least got the most original material of the four - and always has. I always liked Vicki Peterson's stuff, but it's all just very bland on this disk (""Ask Me No Questions"").  Susanna Hoffs is astonishingly the weakest during this set (except for the aforementioned 'Something That You Said"").  ""I Will Take Care of You"" is just downright lame.
In my opinion, the album closer, 'Grateful', is possibly the worst song the Bangles have ever done.  The chorus is one step away from a bad children's chorale.  And they did nothing special to cover the Elvis Costello title tune.
Supposedly they are working towards a new release, since this has really been completed for a year.  Let's hope they get it together and deliver a stellar disk.","I think it 's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd . Their last full one was 1989 's ' Everything ' .

Now that I have the cd in my hands, it was so well worth the money and wait for the cd to arrive in my mailbox. ""Doll Revolution"" did not fail to disappoint me.

It is the realization that maybe your partner is holding you back, keeping you in pain, and it is time for you to move on.

The chord structures and heart-felt vocals arising up from the core of the lead singer's being break through the barriers of that which we do not wish to acknowledge and allow us to recognize that pain, bringing it forth and at last allowing us to step forward in our inherent integrity and move on.

You will feel empowered, you will cry, you will move to this music in a way that will forever touch you.","This song speaks to us in a way that allows us to come to terms with who we are in these times when relationships are changing , one is becoming awakened and one is not .

A208QEPAI30Z4G,B0011Z0WQU,1,1,5,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

LYRICS:
Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed.
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger,
An endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
And you its only seed.

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance.
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
Who cannot seem to give,
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live.

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long,
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong,
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose.","5 - star songs are * typically * the only songs that make it into my library . With that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this , or .

A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0011Z10UC,1,1,5,"""Smoke on the Water,"" originally from the great Deep Purple album ""Machine Head,"" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat. Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record ""Machine Head"" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.

The song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood,"" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I recommend ""Machine Head,"" but the ""Best Hits"" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price. One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple.",""" Smoke on the Water , "" originally from the great Deep Purple album "" Machine Head , "" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat .

A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B0011Z1D8Q,1,1,5,"""That girl took that song away from me."" It was the summer of 1967. Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival. What he was referring to of course was the way Aretha Franklin had turned his song ""Respect"" into one of the biggest hits of the year. His version topped out at #35 on the pop charts a couple of years earlier. But I digress. Otis Redding was just beginning to hit his stride as summer turned to autumn in 1967. This veteran performer had been around for a while. The fact is that up until this point he had made the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 19 times although his records usually ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the chart. His tunes fared much better on the Soul/R&B charts where 8 of them had made it into the Top Ten. It is really difficult to understand why the man had not had greater commercial success up until this point. After taking a few months off Otis Redding returned to the studio in early December 1967. There he recorded a song he had co-written with Steve Cropper. Everyone thought it was a mistake. His wife hated it. Three days later Otis Redding was dead at 26, a victim of a tragic plane crash in Wisconsin.

When the story appeared in the newspaper I remember thinking to myself ""Who is that?"" And although I had been collecting records for about three years I had never heard of him. Despite his enormous talent Otis Redding had just not quite connected with general audiences. Less than two months later in January of 1968, Volt records released that tune his wife and friends hated so much. ""(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay"" went all the way to #1 on the Pop charts and remained there for a month. Everyone now finally realized just how talented this man had been.  An American classic.",""" That girl took that song away from me . "" Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival .

AV648VU7JR5D5,B0011Z3GFY,1,1,5,"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.

It opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3/4 string/guitar progression accompanied by a 4/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.

My favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.

Kashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.

Most fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door. So much has been written about this song, you can find many online treatises that analyze its brilliance. I prefer to let it all wash over me like an oasis in the desert.","Kashmir is an undisputed classic . The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision .

It grew on me like a feline that keeps coming back, night after night, when at first you didn't think you even wanted a cat around! Then suddenly, you realize it's won your heart.* I love the minor key of this song. I tugs at my heart and attempts to draw my very soul out. I actually visualize the darkened rooms in the evening. Then I see a young man pleading with his girlfriend to take steps toward a commitment she isn't sure she's ready for. Looking back over my fifty years, I didn't appreciate this ballad so much as I do now. I am fortunate that I've been married more than half of my life to the same man. Yet I see so many young kids getting married and I hope that they are doing it for love, not just because they're expected to. I hope that women especially will realize that they are forever someone's daughter. Someday, God willing, they will become a mother and grandmother -- but when will they ever just be themselves?  There needs to be a year or two where they learn who they are, not what they are by how someone else defines them!

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0011Z105C,-1,-1,1,"Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.

Overall, not a great song to say the least. It's radio-friendly (which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on), it's poorly done, and most of all, it's just flat-out boring. Sorry Rob, you've done better. A whole lot better.","Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today , and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs , and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen .

And when I stopped and listened to the lyrics I was shocked at just how sad this song was... and yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life but finding herself reliving it anyhow.

It's not a happy song... yet Tracy Chapman sings it so beautifully.  Her wistful voice is never overwrought or melodramatic, conveying just the right amount of emotion to fit the theme of the song.  And the simple instrumentation keeps the song appropriately low-key.  Sometimes a beautiful song is spoiled by being overproduced or oversung, and it was nice to see the singer and producers resist that temptation here.

I don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.

But youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.

I guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs.","The rating I give is based on how much I like the song . My opinion

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0011Z4YB4,1,1,4,"There is no words to describe the tragic news of today that Prince had passed away at age 57. With a set of deviating deaths in R&B legends we've lost this year with Natalie Cole, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire, but honestly no death is more shocking and sad than the passing of Prince. The guy not only was brilliant, but his sound and song with R&B, funk, jazz and Rock is and will always transcend beyond boundaries in the way that David Bowie kept rolling with the tides years earlier. The guy really had so many memorable, that he had kept changing with time and everyone followed so deeply with the punches, and not bashing him at heart. When Doves Cry is one of his deepest songs from Purple Rain. The song still ignites aflame that can definitely showcase his sensuality in song, with a deep soul from his heart that really showed his sensitivity in song. There will never be a songwriter who was just as gifted, who died young. The doves are deeply crying, and that will never stop with this song.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0011Z5IJG,1,1,4,"It is hard to believe that Seal is celebrating his 20th anniversary since his debut album right now. While he has had a lot of highs, musically and personally, the past several years have been very hard for him. With his marriage to Heidi Klum ending, and his albums not as strong as they used to be, he seems to be at a personal crossroads in his life. Nothing he has done in music has ever had the impact he made with Kiss From A Rose, from the Batman Forever soundtrack and off his second self-titled album. The song is still his biggest opus that is just as good today, as it was when it came out in 1994. It definitely is a great download if you are new to Seal's music, or if you want to hear what a real voice is like, and not something that is weighed down. Hopefully, Seal can come out with something as distinctive as he did back then.

Well when ""Batman Forever"" was released, my three sons raved about this song. With the franchise changing Batmans like the four seasons, my sons like most kids were into it (so was their mother).
Seal's range of vocal talent is very versatile on this one. He sings sweetly & calm, then gradually crescendos to his full range of expression.
I love the Circus sound @the intro, to a guitar solo with violins soaring & swelling to the choral part.
I believe there is a sound of a harpsicord, electronic or not, lovely.
His lyric of ""compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey"" brings it home for me.
The bridge of the song is testament to that. A beautiful tribute to any woman who listens to it, with a British seaside imagined by only the way Seal can give it to us.

And in a world where half-hearted covers of Sinatra and others are common by half-hearted sell-outs trying to make a buck, Mr. Bubl&eacute; puts them all to shame. And it's not just his covers which are good, his originals are great too; ""Home"" was an awesome love song. However, this song seems to fall for the most part, flat. While Bubl&eacute;'s vocals are still as charming and brilliant as ever, the song itself could have been better. It's a simple song saying, you guessed it, you're my everything. Pretty darn simple to say the least. And while you could complain all day about how light and poppy the music sounds, I won't go into too much more depth than that.

So overall, not Bubl&eacute;'s best, and probably not even close. It's a light poppy tune, that keeps it very simple. Whether this is a good thing, or not, is up to you to decide, but this song isn't for people like me, who want a little bit more complexity and originality for our music.","Let 's face it , Mr. Bubl&eacute ; is the Frank Sinatra of today , and he 's darn good at it .

But this song I think is a strong showing of his talent for adding a Blues style to a good pop song. His lead throughout the song is like another singer singing along with his. Good tone, arrangement, production, etc. Great but for the price here at Amazon.","I am not a Clapton fanatic .

So overall, one of those songs that comes out of nowhere and surprises you. And this song is surprising. If you have never heard it before, you might want to give it a try. But, some will not like it, while others will love it. It's a hit or miss song.

But if you love this song, or you hate this song, give The Kook's cover of the song a try. They give it a very interesting, and unique acoustic take to the song. And, the added British vocals give the song another level of charm.","I ca n't remember which summer was dominated by this hit ... 2006 ?

If you are behind the times like I was, GET INTO THIS TRACK. It is extremely hooky and even more catchy is the bridge which goes,

""Rock and Roll, baby
Don't you know that
We're all alone now
I need something to sing about

Rock and Roll (Hey!)
Don't you know, baby
We're all alone now
I need something to sing about

Rock and Roll (Hey!)
Don't you know, baby
We're all alone now
Give me something to sing about""

Might not look like much there, but it is extremely catchy.

The video must also be spoken of because although it's not super-glamorous or anything, it makes listening to the song even better. It features Hayley and the band just jammin' out, her at the mic and them on the drums and guitars just having fun in what looks like a desert.

The song itself is about a boy that Hayley is ""crushcrushcrushing"" on, and he's not there for her. Not until the bridge does he come into the picture as more than just one-way thoughts. But the song itself, I think talks about being alone and thinking of that someone that lights your fire, even if they aren't with you.

Written by Hayley Williams (lead singer) and Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals).

A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B0011Z77TA,1,1,5,"""Crazy,"" by Gnarls Barkley caught me off-guard. I did not expect to like it. It is now a favorite.

At first, it sounds like there is this easy groove, the kind found during long late night drives. Then, it gets going, and you might yourself doing the cubicle strut. You know, the boogie thing you hope no one else sees, but you have to swing with the groove?

""I remember when, I remember
I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo
In so much space.""

I fully recommend, ""Crazy,"" by Gnarls Barkley.

I bought the vinyl album back then and played it frequently using high end turntables connected to an audiophile grade system. Years later, I switched to high end CD players and improved analog system technology. I briefly owned the virtual Red Book CD. It sounded just as good as the vinyl, actually cleaner and with improved dynamic range. The MP3 sound quality of this version is amazingly good for this type of format.

So, you could look at this as their comeback song, and it greatly tides over our thirst for everything MB20. First off, the lyrics are incredible just like they are with any MB20 song, with lyrics like, ""I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world/ but it feels just like every other morning before."" The song is catchy and well-written, and overall just well done. And even though this is a rather successful single, it doesn't really sound it. In fact, most of the best songs on their albums were singles anyhow. The bridge is also great musically, and the only thing that could get me down on this song is the chorus. While it is a great chorus for concerts, and to get you pumping, it just seems like more could have been done to it.

But overall, a great song, a great single, a great group. Here's to hoping MB20 comes back much sooner rather than later.

It is a moving song that I've heard sung so many ways, most of which should be erased from existence.  Like the national anthem, some folks want to put their own style to the song.  What's wrong with letting the song be the star, and the singer the instrument to make it a quality song?  Bette doesn't play around with this one.  She sings the song in a simple fashion, letting the listener focus on the words and melody.  Brava Bette.

This is a beautiful rendition of a classic song.  I love it.  I hope you will too.","It is a moving song that I 've heard sung so many ways , most of which should be erased from existence .

""Bad Day"" is the first major goodbye song on American Idol, and as that was the first season I really became a fan, I started noticing on message boards, and various other entertainments sits, what is the name of that song? I first heard the name on MSNBC's Reality TV questions column, before the song's monumental success. Soon after that column, the song rocketed up the charts, and while I don't think it #1, it came pretty darn close, and still remains a download favorite a couple years later.

The song itself is good, not great. The vocals match and work with the song, the lyrics are good, and the piano works very well with the song. However, it kind of gets sappy after awhile. And again, after the radio long wheres out it's welcome, you're cursing the radio to stop playing that darn song.

So overall, a nice song, but it'll where on you after awhile, but it'll stay long after it's welcome, so beware. And yes, Daniel Powter still shows no sign of follow-up success.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B0011Z8PU0,1,1,4,"It is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and talented passes on, it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically. That happened with Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and John Lennon because of their impacts on music from top to bottom. Now, with the deep and tragic loss of Prince, the world is feeling the same bits of sadness from beginning to end all over again. He not only transformed music with each and every album he had made, every song he recorded, but Prince honestly was one of those artists that never got older with his music, he got better with each and every song. 1999 is one of those songs that still clicks every time when you think of party anthems and celebrations in music. It is still one of those songs that really connects with celebration. Prince was definitely a gem that really transcended music at the soul, where a lot of other artists have stopped. May the Purple One's legacy live on.

Trying to address real problems (poverty apparently, but not clearly, due to oppression), Chapman's lyrics have nothing original about them. She released this as the second single of her career. Considered political aware, it offers nothing but a complaint about the obvious.

For example:

""Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion.""

She whispers ""It sounds like a whisper.""

And she fills in space by repeating ""Run Run Run Run...""

The music is sharply produced, but is stuck in a generic 1980s folk rock beat.

Tracy Chapman tried too hard on this one and delivered a weak song. She has a better catalog than this.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0011Z94XM,1,1,5,"Jason Mraz is definitely an underrated artist in the music world. It's all too easy to write him off as another John Mayer/Dave Matthews type artist. Nope, M.R.A.Z. is a whole nother breed. He has a little bit country, little bit rap, bit adult alt, bit pop, bit folk, the point is, Mraz can do it all. And this song shows all those elements, and the song writing style of Mraz. Even though this song was co-written by The Matrix song writing group, you can tell which parts are theirs, and which parts are Mraz.

First off, the opening lines are awesome, and really set the tone for the verses. They're out of the ordinary, but seem to fit, and most importantly flow. And that's what this song's got going for it the most, flow. The verses, the pre-chorus, the chorus all flow freely even though they all have their unique style. This is accomplished for the most part by Mraz's vocals. The structure is also unique in that it has the verses which are great in of themselves, then you have the pre-chorus which could be a chorus in its own right, and then you have the chorus, which is in True radio-friendly style to grab those radio people, and has the True influence of The Matrix.

In fact, the only thing you could really criticize the song about is the pre-chorus, as it may just be one chorus too many, or maybe it could be a thinly veiled reference to sex or something. In either case, it both works, and it doesn't. I personally think it should have its own song, although it does great in this song.

So overall, definitely not your everyday radio fare. It may have a few of those elements, but it has enough originality to keep you interested and tuned in. Kudos to everybody involved with song. It's well-written, well-sung, and well-structured. This song is just another in the long list of reasons to love Jason Mraz.","Jason Mraz is definitely an underrated artist in the music world .

As for Hero, it has the usually strengths of a Nickelback tune.  Strong imagery, thoughtful lyrics, and a melody you can hum in the car.

I can't imagine Nickelback fans haven't heard this one, but if you haven't, it's good but obviously done with a movie in mind.

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0011ZP364,1,1,5,"I really don't get all the hate directed at Nickelback.  I've heard that they're an obnoxious, repetitive band, that they've supposedly ""sold out"" artistically, and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger apparently gets flak for dating/marrying Avril Lavigne (what, celebrities aren't allowed to marry each other?).  I couldn't judge myself, as I hadn't listened to their music, so when I discovered that one of my favorite songs (on a mix CD given to me by a friend) happened to be a Nickelback song, I was a little surprised.  This song was by the much-hated band?  If this was an example of their usual work, why all the hatred?

I don't know if ""Hero"" is typical of all Nickelback's work or not, but it's a powerful song that gets me in the gut whenever I hear it.

""Hero"" is a rock number that first appeared on the ""Spiderman"" soundtrack, which is befitting.  It's a strong song about the difficulties of being a hero, and being strong in the face of adversity.  It's accompanied by a powerful guitar section, with my only nitpick being that the drum section can sometimes overpower the other instruments.  And it does have a soft, melancholy acoustic interlude that gives the listener a slight break from the heavier guitars.

If this is an example of all Nickelback's work, then I'm going to give the rest of the band's discography a shot.  If it's not their typical work... well, then at least there's one Nickelback song I really like.","I really do n't get all the hate directed at Nickelback .

Anyhow, through glass by stone sour touches on the vulnerability that a human soul can unintentionally get subjected to when so many people are watching them. However, the lead singer also brilliantly adds a sympathetic angle to the song with the lyrics how does it feel and implying that sometimes easy answers are not always obvious.

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B0012235PW,1,1,5,"One of the key factors that made the late Ray Charles Robinson the musical icon he become in the two or three decades before his passing was the fact that,if blues came from the crossroads than Brother Ray was crossing the musical interaction. During his salad years of the late 50's/early 60's there was hard bop jazz,urban electric blues and country/western music all somehow playing on jukeboxes in black communities all over America. Ray Charles had reflected this all. Of course the foundation in all of this,if not overtly was the blues form. And considering,even on his later Atlantic days,Ray was beginning to deal with concept albums as a strong musical possibility. It would simply be the right musical choice to reflect his roots in the blues.

  ""Early In The Mornin'"" and ""I'm Movin' On"" are the two major uptempo numbers here. The melodic form is right there,smack in the center of the 12-bar blues. Yet the rhythm is right out of that Afro-Latin vibe-with Ray's electric piano all making this an extension of the uptempo,funky soul sound he'd pioneered a couple of years earlier with ""What'd I Say"". ""The Right Time"",while nostalgically conjuring up that image of Rudy Huxtable in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cosby-Show/dp/B00GOC74Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cosby Show</a>&nbsp;is an elegant,chunky number full of Fathead Newman's growling sax and the Raelette's singing at their prime. Not to even mention Ray going from his strong vocal lead to impassioned cries at a moments notice.  ""I Believe In My Soul"" starts out with a rather Oriental sounding melody on the piano while Charles own compositions ""Hard Times (No One Knows Better Than I)"",""The Midnight Hour"",""Feelin' Sad"",'Ray's Blues"",""Nobody Cares"",""Mr. Charles Blues"",""Some Day Baby"" and ""I Wonder Who"" are all mid to low tempo straight up piano based jazzy blues numbers.

  With the recent passing of Crusaders pianist/co-founder Joe Sample? I've come to think about how grateful music fans of my age group should really be that currently deceased  musical icons such as James Brown,Ray Charles and even someone as late in the game as Michael Jackson were still around during part of our lifetime. Many were musicians who played,some were masterful performs and some were both. But to people such as myself? They will not merely be a page in a history book. Even though this album was recorded almost twenty years before I was born? The strands of the new music I'd have absorbed as a child are ever present here. The really exciting part is Ray was an originator too-the key architect of the soul genre. And here he is in 1961-paying a vital musical tribute to a genre that he absorbed growing up. And so the cycle continues,and meets full circle. Pretty likely this is going to be one of the finest and most important albums you'll ever hear in your life!","One of the key factors that made the late Ray Charles Robinson the musical icon he become in the two or three decades before his passing was the fact that , if blues came from the crossroads than Brother Ray was crossing the musical interaction .

A35PPJIGPB61UF,B0012235PW,1,1,5,"This is a wonderful work of blues songs both covered and composed/arranged by Ray.
The production is tastefully spare, avoiding overly lush arrangements and remaining raw but still darn smooth.
Mr. Charles has a wonderful ability to draw out and convey seemingly contradictory feelings in the same song; a sad song will be so beautiful  that it brings joy; a song of content carries undertones of trouble and impermanence that creates an insidious edge.
I was turned onto this album when I read that Leonard Cohen played this frequently while writing on the Greek island of Hydra. If it's good enough for Cohen...
I sympathize with those who are familiar with versions of this album with better mastering (original vinyl etc.), but this is the only one I'm familiar with and ignorance is sometimes bliss.

They'd gotten caught up with technology, giving the sound a fuller feel, and the lyrical content became more mature and cynical. The Dominance/Submission roleplay of ""Master and Servant"" (which was the second single) and the sociological blast of ""Blasphemous Rumours"" picked and cut deeper than before.

This was also the album that made Depeche Mode in the states. ""People Are People"" got into the American Top 20, and according the liner notes by producer Daniel Miller, the first thing recorded for the album. Egalitarian in tone, DM apparently even tried to darken the sound of the song lest it be consTrued as too pop.

Like all the reissued back catalog of Depeche Mode, the 5.1 remix of the bonus disc is terrific. It fills the room with both the arena ready music that the Mode was growing into, but emphasizes the industrial samples the band was adding to the music. The clanging metal and factory wheezing leaps from the mix and shows just how ahead of the curve the band was. As for the mini-movie, ""You can get away with anything..."" chronicles the band working on the LP. I doubt I'll watch it more than twice. A pair of B-Sides and a remix of the lovely ""Somebody"" round out the package.

A3SI83LHXQCVS2,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"The first three DM albums are okay, but most of the time from here on, works put in perspective the band's actual potential. The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, ""Broken Frame"" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and ""Construction Time""'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.

23 years later, people can probably still identify with ""Some Great Reward."" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in ""It Doesn't Matter,"" ""Stories of Old,"" and ""Somebody."" 2 of the 3 selections are sung by Martin. ""IDM"" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on ""Stories of Old,"" possibly my favorite from the record. ""Somebody"" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track.

That doesn't mean the other 6 songs aren't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is ""Lie to Me,"" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with ""Something to Do,"" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit ""People Are People."" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen.

Then there's the awesome Wilder composition ""If You Want."" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) ""Master and Servant"" and ""Blasphemous Rumors."" ""Master"" starts with a trade-off a cappella with Martin and Dave saying ""it's a lot,"" ending it with ""like life."" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in ""Blasphemous Rumors,"" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track.

There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'80's, and rightfully so. Totatlly worth the cheap price, or if you want the re-mastered sound, you could go for the CD/DVD version.","The first three DM albums are okay , but most of the time from here on , works put in perspective the band 's actual potential .

A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B0012236SS,1,1,5,"Much of Depeche Modes earlier material was more new-wave synth pop and more poppy in sound but this album is where they would become the dark depressing masters they are now. Some of the songs did stir up some controversy back when this album was released and this album was a major turning point for this amazing band.
Something to Do is a hard edged number that kicks this CD off. Lie To Me is an amazing song that I listen to many times without tiring. The dark melody, the sad sound to it is a treat for my ears. People Are People is a fabolous song with phat beats, killer bass lines and a sort of industrial feel. This song is about all people of all religions, races, etc. to get along regardless of their differences. This song has a great message. The ambience at the ending forever leaves this album in my memory. It doesn't matter doesn't have any major beats but has dingling synths and a both happy and sad sound to it. This song is great. Stories Of Old is another cool song but nto as great as the next one. This song is rather poppy. Somebody is a very sad piano ballad with simply pianos and Martin Gore on vocals. This song is truly a gem on this CD. Master And Servant stirred some controversy back during it's heyday. It's a hard-edged song with a strong industrial feel. This song from what I guess talks about S&M. This is my second favorite. If You Want is my favorite off SGR. It starts off as a creepy electronic song with creepy keyboards and with no drums for the first minute. At 1:30 the drums starts and the song becomes an industrial new wave dance number. Blasphemous Rumours is the one that caused controversy back in 1984. It's a very depressing song about religous doubt and suicide. It's a very sad closer to this amazing album.
This CD marks the turning point for Depeche Mode and all of their latter music. While not as strong as their next 5 albums this is a very good album and should be in every DM fans collection.","Much of Depeche Modes earlier material was more new - wave synth pop and more poppy in sound but this album is where they would become the dark depressing masters they are now .

A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B00122909W,1,1,4,"As a child growing up in the projects of New Jersey, Jaheim Hoagland accumulated more emotional baggage than all of JFK international airport.  Having lost his father at two years old, he spent most of his childhood doing the street thug thing, getting into all sorts of petty trouble while being raised in a single-parent household.  But when his mother passed away when he was 17, the pain of his loss inspired him to aggressively pursue a recording career, and 4 years later his debut, ""Ghetto Love,"" was released.  To be certain, that record wasn't perfect, and it had its share of filler.  But what made it worth the trip was Jaheim's voice, which had me do double-takes to make sure I wasn't listening to a Teddy Pendegrass record.  On his superior, impressive second album, ""Still Ghetto,"" the flava is r&b with a dash of hip hop, but the influences are clearly rooted in the old school.  Throughout its trip of nearly an hour, ""Still Ghetto"" is honest, rugged, and soulful.  Thematically, it's not a huge departure from his debut, as the majority of the songs pertain to relationships and the drama that sometimes comes with them.  Mary J. Blige openly gave Jaheim props in a Rolling Stone article, and she appears in the impressive duet, ""Beauty and Thug,"" in which the Queen of Hip Hop Soul's bruised voice goes hand-in-hand with his husky voice.  He glides effortlessly through the ultrasmooth slow jam ""Long As I Live,"" and I don't even need to explain what the song ""Tight Jeans"" is about.  ""Still Ghetto"" is essentially the record Tank's ""One Man"" should have been.  The latter record suffered from tired beats and half-inspired singing, but on ""Still Ghetto,"" Jaheim pulls it off with flying colors.  He may be a little rough on the edges, and some may even question his choice of words (um, ""Me and My B----,"" anyone?), but there's no denying his honesty.  Some records keep it real, and others keep it right.

Although THIS CD displays his incredible voice and makes him a STAR...I'm saving my FIVE star review for his NEXT CD.  The next one SHOULD make him a SUPERSTAR...elevating him to the Luther and Teddy heights.

I miss Teddy Pendergrass...the Teddy who sang with the Blue Notes and who later had some fantastic solo albums BEFORE the accident.  Where Luther had a touch of female in his phrasing (which made his voice incredible)...Teddy's voice was ALL testosterone, without apologies.  Forceful, direct and demanding, Teddy's singing reminded me of old Southern Negro field hollers.  All due respect to David Ruffin, Eddie Levert, Dennis Edwards...even Gerald Levert (excellent ALL)...but they're urban...they're missing that ""pig feet and hot sauce"".  Teddy had the quintescential southern black, arrogant, macho, R&B song voice...and during the 70's, I'm sure it made many white people (especially women) uncomfortable in various ways.

Jaheim has the same voice...the same approach.  What played well in the 70's...continues to play.  His ""ghetto-ness"" might turn some off...but I hope he doesn't completely drop that thug affect...yet.  It took 25 years...but the torch has been passed.  On his NEXT CD...I hope he pays a tribute to Teddy by remaking a song.

AJK5WHV1GW941,B00122909W,1,1,5,"Jaheim shows the world that being ghetto isn't always a bad thing.  In fact, he makes ghetto look and sound damn good!  ""Still Ghetto"" is Jaheim's sophomore album.  He is a prime example that everyone's sophomore album can be just as good as the debut.  The album's tracklisting is all around great, from the order of the songs to the lyrics and instruments.

 ""Still Ghetto"" is about love and relationships for the most part.  Jaheim seduces and croons his female listeners practically the entire album.  ""Put that Woman First"" is the mid-tempo track that was released and went on to be a hit for 2003.  Jaheim explains that if a man does not make a woman feel that she is at the top of his list, she may leave him for another man who will.  A lot of women and even men like this song.  Jaheim showcases his seduction skills on the song ""Special Day"".  In this song Jaheim tells his woman it is her day and asks her what she would like to do.  It is a slow song with a beautiful message and melody.  ""Everywhere I Am is Jaheim's dedication to his late mother, Julie.  In the song he lets his mom know that whatever he does, he feels her presence, even in the biggest events of his life.  This song is truly heartfelt to anyone has either lost their mother or has a close bond with her.  Another favorite on ""Still Ghetto"" is Jaheim's duet with Mary J. Blige called ""Beauty and a Thug""  This song is about a man and a woman from different walks of life who attract each other. This is a lovely song.

 ""Still Ghetto"" is one of those CD's that anyone who gives it a complete listen is sure to love.  Jaheim takes being ghetto to a whole new level!  HE'S STILL GHETTO BABY!

A2L3WEVFOCA7OY,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Jaheim's (J.Hoaglan) sophomore album ""Still Ghetto"" (2002) is an uplifting album to enjoy. Jaheim is blessed with a wonderful, soulful voice which shines through on this release. Jaheim has shown alot love for Hip Hop so it makes sense that he have Kay Gee (formerly of Naughty by Nature) looking after alot of the production on this. The lead single is the inspirational ""Fabulous"" which is about staying positive and making it through the hardest of times. I like this track, The Rayne's guest appearance is good and having the children sing the chorus adds a different feel to the track. Next two tracks are standout, ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" and ""Put that Woman First"" are about appreciating ones lady. Other early songs like ""Me and My B****"" and ""Let's Talk About It"" follow through well. ""Long as I Live"" is about real love, marriage and commitment. Jaheim goes real deep on ""Everywhere I Am"" a beautiful tribute to his mom, a song where you can really feel his genuine love. Mary J and Jaheim drop a memorable collabration on ""Beauty and a Thug"". Slow love song ""Special Lady"" is another track I like. A few tracks particularly the ones at the end- are more filler material for me. However the majority of the tracks are memorable with good reply value.

ABE14SVILZLNY,B00122909W,1,1,4,"I've always been of the mind state that the term ""ghetto"" is a derogatory word, but Jaheim has taken the word and made it his own. Within his music he celebrates the idea of ghetto, even going insofar as to title his sophomore album ""Still Ghetto"". While I respect Jaheim's allegiance to his roots, sometimes the sheer overload of the ""ghetto"" concept overpowers his musical prowess. Hailing from New Jersey, Jaheim is no doubt a talented singer capable of impressing even the most fickle with his ability. In fact his talent is so strong that it could almost make you angry that he doesn't have material - but images are made for reason and Jaheim has done well with his.
The first cut released from ""Still Ghetto"" was the hood anthem ""Fabulous"" whose catchy refrain sung by kids: ""don't hate on us, we're fabulous"", creeps into you head and seeks to take up permanent residence. From the celebratory ""Fabulous"", the album reflects on love with ""Diamond In Da Ruff"". It is on tracks like this as well as the soul-filled and passionate ""Put That Woman First"" that Jaheim shows you the depths and peaks of his voice. Since his debut, he's been compared to the legendary Teddy Pendergrass, a serious compliment that echoes in every part of Jaheim's vocals.
The album takes a slight turn with the less impressive ""Me & My B!tch"" and ""Tight Jeans"". While they all in their own way have some sort of appeal - it's here where you pity the subject matter. Jaheim has the voice of someone who should perhaps being singing ballads exclusively, but it often feels like his talent is wasted on sub par material not worthy of his voice. Sure, it's okay to appreciate the female form, but someone with this voice - you just know that he's capable of more. ""Backtight"" might have a dumb title - but it's subtlety is definitely a plus. The songwriting leaves you wanting a little more, but sound-wise it's very nice.
""Long As I Live"" is a tad overproduced, but because the vocals are so lush - it's hard to even care. On ""Everywhere I Am"", the crooner calls up the spirit of the older, fatter Luther Vandross (most of you know Luther was a much better singer when he ate Big Macs instead of lettuce). On the track, Jaheim sings out for his late mother and his talent is to be respected on the well-produced and well-sung track. ""Beauty And A Thug"", a duet with Mary J. Blige, tries to be jazzy but ends up just being not so great.
Things get a little more ""ghetto"" with ""Every Which Way"" which should be discarded in the do not put me on an album pile. ""Special Day"" is another of the moments that make you want to root for Jaheim. His voice has so many beautiful elements to it, that you want people to like him - you want him to succeed and more importantly, you want his record label to hire him better writers and producers.
- Final Thoughts -
Jahiem might not be a household name yet, but he has undeniable talent that will keep him floating for time to come. He'll definitely have to refine his talents if he wants to reach a broader audience, but for now he's happy being ""Still Ghetto""","I 've always been of the mind state that the term "" ghetto "" is a derogatory word , but Jaheim has taken the word and made it his own . Within his music he celebrates the idea of ghetto , even going insofar as to title his sophomore album "" Still Ghetto "" . While I respect Jaheim 's allegiance to his roots , sometimes the sheer overload of the "" ghetto "" concept overpowers his musical prowess . Hailing from New Jersey , Jaheim is no doubt a talented singer capable of impressing even the most fickle with his ability . In fact his talent is so strong that it could almost make you angry that he does n't have material - but images are made for reason and Jaheim has done well with his . The first cut released from "" Still Ghetto "" was the hood anthem "" Fabulous "" whose catchy refrain sung by kids : "" do n't hate on us , we 're fabulous "" , creeps into you head and seeks to take up permanent residence . From the celebratory "" Fabulous "" , the album reflects on love with "" Diamond In Da Ruff "" . It is on tracks like this as well as the soul - filled and passionate "" Put That Woman First "" that Jaheim shows you the depths and peaks of his voice . Since his debut , he 's been compared to the legendary Teddy Pendergrass , a serious compliment that echoes in every part of Jaheim 's vocals . The album takes a slight turn with the less impressive "" Me & My B!tch "" and "" Tight Jeans "" . While they all in their own way have some sort of appeal - it 's here where you pity the subject matter . Jaheim has the voice of someone who should perhaps being singing ballads exclusively , but it often feels like his talent is wasted on sub par material not worthy of his voice . Sure , it 's okay to appreciate the female form , but someone with this voice - you just know that he 's capable of more . "" Backtight "" might have a dumb title - but it 's subtlety is definitely a plus . The songwriting leaves you wanting a little more , but sound - wise it 's very nice .

A3RV0VQKIM2HSW,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Jahiem is one of the few new ones on the music scene who's vocie alone is music to hear.(True singing talent) This cd is a must have for those who truley like R+B and a lil hip hop. He did the same thing carl thomas did with his last cd(who is due for another one soon) by putting a new twist on old songs and beats.  The end result is one continuous mix of r+b jams to have your cd on repeat. The tight Jams:
*Diamond in da ruff
*Fabulous
*Put that woman First
*Beauty and the Beast
*Long as I live
*Everywhere I am
*Every which Way
Overall Jahiem surpassed his first one by putting that sophomore slump jinx to rest. Anyone curious to see what the hype is about?..just imagien a cross of vocies between teddy pendegrass and luther vandross and you have jahiem.

AA8HFTJIAQA4G,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Jaheim- Still Ghetto
G H E T T O! What a word. We all know where the word is derived but what does it mean today? Jaheim seems to know exactly how to relate""ghetto"" to everyday life. His first CD was great and this one picks up right from there. Jaheim captures the feeling of soul music. He is what NEO SOUL is supposed to be. I think the music we label as Neo Soul really isn't that. It's a new, fresh approach, reminiscent of the Langston Hughes age in Black America. Jaheim is the 70's revisited, not just in sound but in feelin. His lead single ""Fabulous"" is a great song. Some might tire of the kids participation in the song, but the real strength is the message. It highlights the up's and downs of ""ghetto life"" and how this community accepts it, shakes it off and keeps going. In listening to this song you are aware that it's really not talkin about white America but about our own community. For some reason we've developed a split in the black community, where affluent blacks look down on the ""ghetto"" life. As Ja put's it ""We've got love for yall but yall don't love us"". Good song. It's not being taken as seriously as it should. Jaheim really is a classic balladeer though, making True love music. Music we grew up too. that's where this CD shines. Track 5, ""Put That Woman First"" is reminiscent of Rrah's ""A Woman's Threat"" and uses the same sample that Ludacris used on ""Growing Pains"" from his Word Of Mouf CD. Great song. MJB makes and appearance on ""Beauty and The Thug"". Great song  and this duet was destiny from the moment Ja came on the same. they both embody the soul of the ""ghetto"". My favorite song on this CD has to be track 7 ""Me and My B*tch"". Now before you say anything I know that title might be offensive to some but MANNNNNNNNNN! Dude pulls this off! He makes this work. It has a smooth OJAY's ring to it. Great song. My favorite songs on this CD are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,13,14...This CD works because Jaheim reminds us the beauty in the ghetto, the love and the life. Too many of us have forgot that the ghetto is more than just gunshots and teen pregnancy.","Jaheim- Still Ghetto

AGAMDS21PJZPK,B00122909W,1,1,4,"Watching BET's Midnight Love one night, I was introduced to a r&b singer named Jaheim.  As I was watching his video, I wasn't too impressed with ""Could It Be"" at first.  I saw the song as just another new cat jumping into the r&b game.  However, as I heard the song more often, I began to like the song more and Jaheim's voice wasn't that bad, as it reminded me of the infamous Teddy P singing ""Love TKO"", ""Turn Off The Lights"", or ""Come Go With Me"".  I was still hesitant in buying ""Ghetto Love"" but everyone that had purchased the CD gave me rave reviews so I decided to purchase my own copy.  ""Ghetto Love"" turned out to be one of my favorite r&b CDs of 2001.  I liked how Jaheim used his sharp ""street"" edge to his songs.  My favorites included ""Looking For Love"", ""Ghetto Love"", ""Remarkable"" w/Terry Dexter, ""Ready, Willing & Able"", as well as the rest of his singles:  ""Just In Case"" and ""Anything"" w/Next.  With a title of ""Still Ghetto"" you would expect the same thing from his sophomore CD and ladies and gentlemen that is what you will get.  ""Still Ghetto"" starts off with Jaheim and Duganz doing what they did on a few tracks on ""Ghetto Love"" by rappin' and singin' straight from the streets.  From there, Jaheim does what he does best by lacing his fans with the street anthems and romantic melodies that he is known for now.  His 1st single, ""Fabolous"" is dedicated to the children coming up in the world today.  As Jaheim can tell you, he knows how rough it was growing up and being a hardhead so he is trying to motivate children of today to not walk in the same path that he did.  While the song may not hit you like ""Could It Be"", ""Fabolous"" gets a strong point across and was definintely the right pick for the 1st single.  The majority of the rest of the songs deal with relationships and trying to find the right woman.  The ladies will definitely be impressed with this CD.  ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" deals with a woman that Jaheim wish he would have treated better and now he realizes how much they could have had if he would have swallowed his pride and been a man about their relationship.  ""Let's Talk About It"" follows the same line as Jaheim wants to talk to someone that he dealt with in the past and try to realize where they went wrong.  He was in trouble so much that he couldn't be focused in the relationship.  ""Put That Woman First"" covers territory that has been covered by R Kelly, ""When A Woman's Fed Up"" and Joe, ""Treat Her Like A Lady"".  However, with the old school feel to the song, this will still be one of your favorites.  ""Beauty & Thug"" features the queen of r&b/hip hop, Mary J Blige and brings pleasant results.  Both singers sound very well together and Malik Pendleton, who produced Mary J. Blige's ""Seven Days"" from her ""Share My World"" CD does the production.  The fellas will be able to relate to ""Tight Jeans"", as Jaheim tells a tale about one of his good female friends always coming around him wearing tight jeans.  While he may have intentions of being a platonic friend, she is tempting him to think of her in other ways.  Jaheim also displays the same sentimental side that he showed on ""Ghetto Love"" with songs like ""Backtight"", ""Special Day"", ""Long As I Live"" and ""Everywhere I Am"".  The latter, is a powerful dedication to his mom who passed away when he was a teenager . On another song, ""Me And My B****"", Jaheim professes his loyalty for his lady, but at the same time he is saying if you try to ""get at her"", that might be the last move you make.  This may be too much for some r&b fans, but if you understand the concept, you will understand that he isn't trying to offend women, this is just his way of expressing his thoughts on this particular song.  If Jaheim would have ended ""Still Ghetto"" at track 13, I believe that he would have a 5 star CD on his hands.  However, tracks 14-16, turn out to be nothing but filler.  Especially, ""Whut You Want"", which puts a damper on 13 straight tight songs.  The majority of the production is handled by Kay Gee, formerly of Naughty By Nature and Eddie F and Darren Lighty, which provides primarily the same sound as his debut CD displayed.  Overall, Jaheim has a nice sophomore CD on his hands.  If you liked ""Ghetto Love"", you will enjoy ""Still Ghetto"" but you may enjoy the 1st CD better.

""Lush Life"" meanders a bit, but ""A Stranger In Town"" begins to pick up the pace, and Davis begins to pull out the stops on ""What Kind Of Fool Am I.""
""I've Gotta Be Me"" is an absolute masterpiece, a powerful cry of self-impowerment that is as stirring today as it was upon it's release.  Is it a tad over-dramatic?  Maybe--after all, it's a Broadway tune.  But, for those of us who got downright nauseous listening to ""Candy Man"" four million times, ""I've Gotta Be Me"" is a revelation, a vocal so big and full of life that it just can't be overlooked.

Names like Frankie Avalon, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydel were considered the kings of youth music. But all of that was about to change. Before the Beach Boys, you had this foursome. The Four Seasons emerged that year 1960 with not one or two but several 45 hits. They dominated the top of the charts and took America by storm. First with ""Sherry"" quickly followed by ""Walk like a man"" and then ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" the Four Seasons brightened up sleep overs and slumber parties everywhere. Girls couldn't get enough. The 60's arrived big time in most part to the new sound coming from New Jersey and that sound would shape the decade to come. Solo acts would fall to the side. Groups would dominate.

Later, when Frankie Vali stepped out in front of the group to bask in his own glory, the shine fell off the rose and the rising star of the Four Seasons began to fall. Vali tried to go solo only to find his voice lost in the Beatles/Stones era of music, where it never really rose to its former heights. Vali's career ended by fading away into obscurity... until a little Broadway play came along four decades later.","The year was 1960 and few boy groups - with the exception of the Lettermen - were successful .

The orgasmic moans/screams by BARBARA INGRAM is as vivid as ever!!!. She is literally writhing/ranting in heat/ecstasy, nothing is left to imagine. This is surely one of the greatest lovemaking songs ever recorded!!!.
Next is the airy ""SWEET TOMORROW"" and the most sad ""SIDESHOW"",originally done by the soul group BLUE MAGIC. ""TWO WRONGS"" bouncy yet regretful. Next is the hopeful ""LOVING YOU IS MELLOW"" a favorite. ""JUST A THING I DO"" is poetry in motion, I love this work of art as well. ""AFTER LOVING YOU"" is an expression of long lost love, lively yet a tad sad. Concluding this supreme effort is his remake of the classic ""MY WAY"", with his soothing tenor voice, he makes this song his very own.

""Sideshow"" is a mellow cover of a Blue Magic classic jam, and Major Harris handles it well.  Other slower jams include ""Just a Thing I Do"" and ""My Way.""  The other songs are more up-tempo and also are spirit and soul up-lifters.  ""Sweet Tomorrow"" is gorgeous, poetic, and romantic.

Having read a little about them I'm not surprised to find out that they are an alternative band formed in the late 90's. ""C'mon, C'mon"" has all the features that attract me to alternative music (I do not claim to be an music expert and many times I do not follow bands, I simply go by what I like and my own interpretations of the music--if you listen long enough you're able to identify the rock, punk, and even some 70's sounds in  many songs that are considered or identified as alternative). For me at least, the influence of good old fashioned well known punk bands, like the Clash and American punk like the Ramones is clear even in ""C'mon, C'mon""--probably one of the reasons why I liked it and bought it.

I did not know that ""C'mon C'mon"" was used as the opening music for the TV show ""Rescue Me"" but this is besides the point. I have no idea what the lyrics mean and are beyond the scope of my review. However, they're simple enough, I've caught myself singing to this song and I usually don't sing.

A3QS1EPDZTLPWS,B00122EGAU,1,1,4,"Rob Dougan is justly best-known for his track ""Clubbed to Death,"" which first appeared when Mo'Wax was a can't-miss label. And the cinematic quality which marked that track (as well as the track itself) reappear on his debut album, _Furious Angels_. More interesting, Dougan adds his hoarse vocals to his creations, which veer more towards country-western than to pure electronic music. It's an interesting combination, if not an entirely successful one. The title track has a gospel chorus that add tension to some potentially overwrough lyrics. ""Will You Follow Me?"" sounds as if it came straight off a soundtrack -- John Williams would be proud. Not sure what Mr. Williams would think of the dirge-like ""Left Me for Dead,"" however. At times, Dougan sounds as if he's straining his voice in an attempt at emotion, and it's at odds with the elegant orchestrations. When he doesn't try as hard, as on ""There's Only Me,"" he gets across a sense of desperation and sadness much better, as does the melancholy trip-hop and warbling Falsetto of ""Nothing At All."" Not surprisingly, on the instrumental disc, the tracks in which Dougan's vocals proved problematic feel improved with just the strings, but the ones in which the vocals were an asset feel slightly empty. But the most surprising track would be ""Drinking Song,"" which has much of the simplicity and directness of the Pogues' ""Fairytale of New York."" It brings romanticism to a drunken haze -- reminiscing with a gravelly voice.","Rob Dougan is justly best - known for his track "" Clubbed to Death , "" which first appeared when Mo'Wax was a can't - miss label .

More interesting , Dougan adds his hoarse vocals to his creations , which veer more towards country - western than to pure electronic music . It 's an interesting combination , if not an entirely successful one . The title track has a gospel chorus that add tension to some potentially overwrough lyrics . "" Will You Follow Me ? "" sounds as if it came straight off a soundtrack -- John Williams would be proud . Not sure what Mr. Williams would think of the dirge - like "" Left Me for Dead , "" however . At times , Dougan sounds as if he 's straining his voice in an attempt at emotion , and it 's at odds with the elegant orchestrations . When he does n't try as hard , as on "" There 's Only Me , "" he gets across a sense of desperation and sadness much better , as does the melancholy trip - hop and warbling Falsetto of "" Nothing At All . "" Not surprisingly , on the instrumental disc , the tracks in which Dougan 's vocals proved problematic feel improved with just the strings , but the ones in which the vocals were an asset feel slightly empty . But the most surprising track would be "" Drinking Song , "" which has much of the simplicity and directness of the Pogues ' "" Fairytale of New York . "" It brings romanticism to a drunken haze -- reminiscing with a gravelly voice ."

So crisp you could take a bite like a green apple and taste the burst of flavor! Honestly I was surprised. I was expecting something with a harder edge. This album cuts its own slice of American Pie. There are tracks with messages of social consciousness and responsibility without the element of  ""Feel Guilty bad human"" looming overhead. This troupe of musicians reminds me that there are, yes- artists who insist on putting forth their best effort. You can tell. So, what tracks stand out? Relentless is beautiful and has a very erotic rhythm to it. It's a Taqsim kind of thing. Winslow likes Change. Their rendition of Chains is indeed a compliment to Fleetwood Mac. Finesse! Chasing After- Wow, this song is like a fresh shot of double espresso. If this doesn't wake you up and get the blood going, see your doctor. This track flows into a segue with beautiful guitar and drum tracks. Falling Away- I don't think any other group can cover this song, it is truly Tantric. Can't touch this Baby! Hey Now- need I say more? Hero takes me back to an era of the `70's when life was full of California sunshine and the beach. I don't know why but that's where it takes me: San Onofre and Trestles, salty sea air and late afternoon blue skies. Rocks this ol' surfer girl. This is a very seductive album and is a must have for the True music collector. Very well worth the investment. Rich, and Winslow is never wrong! Winslow's rating:Full tail feather fan!

A2WA8R7ZNUHZMA,B00122HPJ4,1,1,5,"Tantric's sophomore effort is pure brilliance.  After hearing seeing them live, I immediately went out and bought their self-titled debut and every SECOND of the album was up to pitch, fantastic rock music.  So when I heard they were coming out with another album, I was ecstatic.  Though this album is a little more 'hard' then their first CD, it's still amazing and those acoustics made famous by Todd are still there.  Their first single 'Hey Now' is actually more like their old stuff.  My favourite song on the CD would have to be 'Hero', a brilliant done song.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac remake, the beginning doesn't really sound like Tantric but once it gets to the chorus, you can hear their signature sound.  From start to finish this album delivers and I cannot WAIT to hear more.  If you liked the first album from Days of the New, Tantric's first CD or just love rock music you won't be disappointed with this.

That was my review after the first week of having the CD, now I have a little more to say.  Tantric's 'After We Go' is a timeless album, it hasn't left my CD player since it's release.  It's one of those albums that you can put on replay for the rest of your LIFE and still want to hear more.  Each track is amazingly good, it's like a big juicy apple pie, rich and delicious.  The opener, 'Chasing After' is a fast paced starter, Hugo's vocals are extremely well done here, lyrically good as well.  'After We Go' is one of my favourites (tied with about 5 others), the background vocals surpass Hugo's...strange, no.  The talent of this band is overflowing.  'Falling Away' is musically, one of the best songs I've heard.  The guitar work is actually intelligent.  The first single 'Hey Now' is a single I actually love to listen to.  'Hero' which was my favourite song when I first got the CD has now dropped a fair bit, it's still brilliant - a somewhat sweet anthem, if that is an apology, I accept.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac cover, very well done of the classic, the chorus is hard edged, I love Hugo's vocals on the 'and if you don't love me now, you will never love me again', chills.  'Change The World' is a great song to start off if you're a new Tantric fan, it's not as experimental, still extremely well done.  'Just Once' is my favourite song, I think when I listen to it, I go into a different world, the guitars and vocals put me into this dream and I never want to wake up.  These last few songs are what I call the creme de la creme, the best damn music I've ever heard in a long time!  All of these are tied with 'After We Go' for my favourite after 'Just Once' - that didn't really make sense.  In any case, 'Relentless' is lyrically amazing, Hugo's vocals are sexy as hell.  'Alright' - what can I say, the chorus ... if you're a woman, you will get caught up in the vocals, I am telling you, there is nothing sexier than Hugo's vocals.  Todd - you are a god.  Always will be.  'Before' really, there isn't much more I can say ... if I had a thesaurus close by I would look up some more incredible words to describe it's brilliance.  Lastly, 'Awake', a great closing song but every time I get there I wish there was more.  I hit repeat for the time being and I am counting down the days for the next album!!","Tantric 's sophomore effort is pure brilliance .

A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00122J05G,1,1,4,"The Spinners have a long history. Started in Detroit in 1954, as of 2015 the group was still active, with Henry Fambrough the last surviving original member. Of that early quintet, baritone Fambrough, bass Patric Jackson and tenor Billy Henderson appear on their self-titled debut 1973 ATLANTIC Records LP (SD 7256). Technically considered an original, tenor Bobby Smith replaced James Edwards only weeks after the one-time Domingoes were formed. He's here, as is tenor Phillip Wynne, co-lead with Smith and a 1971 replacement for G.C. Cameron, who chose to stay with MOTOWN when the group left for ATLANTIC.

This album was a huge seller in its day. Certified Gold, an R&B #1 and #14 on BILLBOARD's 200.
Producer, arranger, conductor Thom Bell also plays keyboards.

Originally an ""A"" side, ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" peaked at #77 on the Hot 100
and reached #14 on BILLBOARD's R&B chart. Its flip side, ""I'll Be Around"" was the group's
first ever #1 (R&B). It also was a Hot 100 #3. ""Could It Be I'm Falling in Love"" and ""One
of a Kind (Love Affair)"" also made the R&B top spot, with the former a Pop #4 and the
latter peaking at #11 on the Hot 100. Four charting singles on one LP-- not bad!

A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"It is a myth that soul was a singles medium. At least half a myth. In the 1960s, it was True. Most Motown albums were not meant to hold together as such. But when Stevie Wonder released Music Of My Mind in early 1972, he proved soul LPs could work as cohesively as any rock LP.

And so it went for Gamble and Huff and Thom Bell, the Philly Sound. Both the O'Jays with Back Stabbers and here, this first Spinners album, are just that: albums. Playing the singles on AM was AM's gain and lack of FM airplay was FMs loss.

The Spinners, the album, does not have a concept like the O'Jays Back Stabbers or Ship Ahoy.  Or does it? If love and passion can be a concept, it is best illustrated on this album

There is the Philly Sound, there is........well, easy there, let's climb one mountain at a time.  The lush horns, strings, vibes, and master vocals are wound into one massive, wonderful silk sheet of sound. I don't have to tell you, just listen. Wagner would be proud

""I'll Be Around,"" ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,"" ""One Of A Kind Love Affair."" Anyone born by 1970 or before grew up hearing these on the radio, and do you believe how stupid some of us were? We heard this music next to Daddy Dewdrop's ""Chick-A-Boom,"" or ""Have You Ever Been Mellow,"" by Oliva Newton John, and quickly ran to our King Crimson albums, unable to separate the prime rib from the beef jerky. The best soul from the worst pop. We look at ourselves now. Wagner would NOT approve.

More proof. Yeah, sure. Play part of Coltrane's Love Supreme next to Bobby Goldsboro's ""Honey,"" and run for the hills. The blimp has crashed. But take said 'Trane and then go into ""One Of A Kind Love Affair,"" and it will be the start of a one of a kind love affair--for you. Me too.

Talking jazz,  I almost forgot. There is jazz here, too. Check out the third track, ""Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You"" I needn't go into this, but it proves my point. All this wonderful music is wonderful music, some of which happened to be singles. But listen to The Spinners from start to end, like a stranger to this music, and all the richness and craft and variation, and there is a ton, holds together musically and conceptually.

A14W1VNMMYLWND,B00122J05G,1,1,5,"1972 and 1973 were the years that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success.  Now with producer/writer team Thom Bell/Linda Creed, and a deal on Atlantic, they Spinners' hard work finally paid off after years.  This joint is surely a winner, with some heavy hitting mid-tempo soul jams.  This one contains some legendary jams like the rolling funk of ""I'll Be Around"" and ""Could It Be I'm Falling in Love"" heavily laden with strings, a staple of Philly Soul.  ""I'll Be Around"" is one of my favorite soul jams of all time, and even though I am 10 years younger than the song is, I remember listening to it and loving it in junior high school (in the mid 90's) when L.A. hip-hop station Power 106 FM had time set aside time for old school jams.  Rapper Rappin' 4-Tay also made his own version of it in 1994, a wonderful hip-hop jam which took the funky rolling music and some of the hook vocals for the rap song.  Another one of my favorites here is ""Just Me and You Baby,"" a slower, ballad type jam with heavenly harmony.  ""Ghetto Child"" is heavy mid-tempo jam exploring the bad side of growing up in the `hood, very sad and timeless.  ""How Could I Let You Get Away"" is a sadder lyrically rich song laden with sitars later in the song.  Phillipe Wynne, Bobbie Smith (great singers), and company surely deliver a rich album full of lush Thom Bell production and sweet harmony and melody; the transition from Detroit to Philly surely was a lucrative one.  1974's Mighty Love is another wonderful soulful album as is 1975's Pick of the Litter.  The Spinners are definitely essential listening in order to truly experience what Philly Soul has to offer.","1972 and 1973 were the years that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success .

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00122KZBY,1,1,4,"It turns out the old saying is True: The family that plays together, stays together. Four siblings and their best pal make up indiepop group Eisley, whose debut EPs hinted at what they could do. And ""Room Noises"" certainly proves that their airy, whimsical pop was worth the long wait for.

Some of the songs are from those EPs, although they sound a bit tighter and smoother. For example, the heartbreaking ode to the bullied, ""Telescope Eyes,"" or the prettily whimsical ""Marvelous Things."" Despite the airy poesy of the songs, there's a distinctly melancholy streak through the album, which peaks at the very beginning: ""Memories,"" a haunting song about a woman mourning her husband's suicide.

Despite a few EP songs, they also have quite a few new songs, like the enchantingly sunny ""Golly Sandra,"" which has echoes of the Beach Boys. But the sparkling pop vibe continues in other songs, carried over in piano melodies and smooth guitar riffs. ""Still floating soft/I am dreaming and I'm glad I lost/And still with my fingers/I'm drawing circles in the water,"" the song goes, as fluid as the water it talks about.

That mixture of bittersweetness and innocent optimism is what makes Eisley so darn appealing. Nowhere are the stereotypical I-just-wanna-have-fun or my-boy/girlfriend-dumped-me-and-now-I-wanna-swim-with-the-toaster music for THIS pop band. While they have some love songs, the emphasis is on their enchanting kind of whimsy.

That whimsy carries over into just about whatever they sing about, whether it's Sherri and Staci singing about dragons in the woods, sunlight and butterflies, or metal teeth and ""telescope eyes."" Some of the lyrics seem to stray into Flaming Lips-type surrealism, but are also grounded by simple sentiments like, ""You have shining eyes, yes like those forest lights, and it makes me want to cry.""

After the past few years, with the group rapidly moving out of the teen bracket, one would wonder if Stacy and Sherri Dupree's angelic vocals would have gotten... well, not so pretty. No problem with that -- they sound a bit like younger versions of Beth Gibbons or perhaps Hope Sandoval. The two girls even interplay their vocals in on song, with remarkable skill and spine-tingling results.

At the start of one song, the line ""Congratulations, we've finally made it"" is sung. And so Eisley has -- and this promising band only shows signs of getting even better in albums to come.","It turns out the old saying is True : The family that plays together , stays together . Four siblings and their best pal make up indiepop group Eisley , whose debut EPs hinted at what they could do . And "" Room Noises "" certainly proves that their airy , whimsical pop was worth the long wait for . Some of the songs are from those EPs , although they sound a bit tighter and smoother . For example , the heartbreaking ode to the bullied , "" Telescope Eyes , "" or the prettily whimsical "" Marvelous Things . "" Despite the airy poesy of the songs , there 's a distinctly melancholy streak through the album , which peaks at the very beginning : "" Memories , "" a haunting song about a woman mourning her husband 's suicide . Despite a few EP songs , they also have quite a few new songs , like the enchantingly sunny "" Golly Sandra , "" which has echoes of the Beach Boys . But the sparkling pop vibe continues in other songs , carried over in piano melodies and smooth guitar riffs . "" Still floating soft / I am dreaming and I 'm glad I lost / And still with my fingers / I'm drawing circles in the water , "" the song goes , as fluid as the water it talks about . That mixture of bittersweetness and innocent optimism is what makes Eisley so darn appealing . Nowhere are the stereotypical I - just - wanna - have - fun or my - boy / girlfriend - dumped - me - and - now - I - wanna - swim - with - the - toaster music for THIS pop band . While they have some love songs , the emphasis is on their enchanting kind of whimsy .

Eisley's debut L.P. ""Room Noises"" is a perfectly good debut record. There is more potential for greatness on this record then I have heard in some time from any band, if they only reach it occasionally.

""Memories"", the records lead off track, is the records best ssong, all minor key harmonies and a twisting, melodic as all else breakdown which is one of the coolest things I have heard this year. The next song ""Telescopic Eyes"" is another keeper, showcasing the bands darker form of melodic pop, catchy enough for radio but different enough for the rest of us.

From there the record is spotty. Or actually it's not. There really isn't a quote-unquote bad song on the record, it just gets a bit same soundy as it goes on. The group shows such potential and talent on the first handful of tunes that as the record goes on and the song remains the same you get kind of dissapointed. Maybe some changes in tone, maybe a little, just a little distortion, maybe some different types of arrangements could fix this problem. I don't know.

But I say buy this record. It is good, and this band could very easily be great a record or two from now. ""Room Noises"" is promising, even if it doesn't deliver fully on said potential. But I'll tell you one thing:

I can't wait to hear what they do next.",""" Room Noises "" is a perfectly good debut record .

Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.

In the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.  Extremely disappointing.

It starts with a simple , almost latin melody, and Robert comes in quietly and without hurry.  His narrative is leading and his melody makes you feel as if there is actual movement.  His matter of fact delivery is in line with his more mature sensibilities and the desperate angst of his youth is replaced with tension but not desperation.

Eisley has released 2 EPs in early and late 2003, the excellent ""Laughing City"" and ""Marvelous Things"". For whatever reason, it's taken over another year for the release of their debut album. The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there, and Coldplay's Chris Martin is a big fan as well (Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour).

""Room Noises"" (12 tracks, 41 min.) is full of dreamy, yet very catchy songs, not unlike, say, Sixpense None the Richer. The best songs are in the first half of the album, including the opener ""Memories"", ""I Wasn't Prepared"", ""Memories"" (the standout track of the album), and ""Brightly Wounded"" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers. Other great tracks are ""Plenty of Paper"", a great up-tempo song, and the closer ""Trolley Wood"".

What keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs (in newly recorded versions), and that's disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning. We want more new songs! Finally, the Amazon listing shows a bonus track (a remixed version of ""Lost at Sea"") but the CD I bought doesn't have it, hmmmm... Regardless, Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I can't wait to see them live!

Keith Sweat is one of those few I like.  With 17 songs (1 is just an extended version so it's 16 total songs), you get some of his finer songs.  Although he has 6 albums, about 40% of the songs on here are from his debut, and a few albums only have 1 song represented on here but nevertheless it's a nice collection.  It has 2 classics, 2 almost classic songs, only 1 I really skip, 5 are ok and the rest are good.  Prodcution is mostly handled by Keith Sweat and Teddy Riley and is good.  Guests are on a few and it even has his classic from the ""LSG"" album.  A must have for his fans or fans of R&B.

I noticed that a lot of the songs are from his first album Make It Last Forever. Sure, that was his best album, but maybe he should've included a good number of songs from ALL of the albums. Oh well, there are other hits you remember, like ""Nobody"", ""Twisted"", ""I'll Give All My Love To You"", and even LSG's ""My Body"". And most hits collections contain a hard-to-find song, and here there's ""(There You Go) Tellin' Me No Again"" (from the New Jack City soundtrack).
I'm not exactly sure why the Snoop Dogg-assisted ""Come And Get With Me"" is on here, but regardless, this is still a good album to buy if all your Keith Sweat cassettes are worn out or lost.

A1D44YT0P8Q8XL,B00122MC0Q,1,1,5,"For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

With the superb instrumental skills of pianist Don Grolnick, drummer John Guerin, bassist Bob Magnusson, guitarist Bob Mann (who also played fabulously on Rod Stewart and Steve Tyrell's recordings) and the creative flair of concertmaster David Frisina, this CD offers some of the glowing moments of Ms. Ronstadt's musical career. ""Lush Life,"" ""What's New?"" and ""For Sentimental Reasons"" are three of the greatest and most beautiful albums of standards ever recorded.

Nobody sounded more expressive than Ms. Ronstadt singing ""When I Fall In Love,"" a song lamenting that love has ended even before it has begun. You can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist, Bob Mann, complementing Ms. Ronstadt's exquisite voice. Likewise, nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of ""When Your Lover Has Gone.""

""What lonely hours
The evening shadows bring
What lonely hours
With memories lingering
Like faded flowers
Life can't mean anything . . .""

In ""Skylark,"" the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition as she brings new life to this Johnny Mercer/Hoagy Carmichael classic. She also left a lasting impression to one of Sinatra's signature songs ""I'm A Fool To Want You,"" just like Ol' Blue Eyes did with his meaningful interpretation. They both did the best versions for male and female vocals, respectively.

She swings lightly on Rodgers & Hart's gem ""You Took Advantage Of Me,"" then she takes it slower in Mills/Parish/Ellington's ""Sophisticated Lady."" And picks up the light swing tempo again on ""Can't We Be Friends?""

""Sophisticated lady I know
You miss the love you had long ago
And when nobody is nigh
You cry. . . you cry.""

If you're a lover of standards like me and an admirer of beauty in all its forms, you should have this CD in your collection and take pleasure in listening to its endless beauty.

But the band is really more of a funk and roll band in the Parliament-Funkadelic mold. Mr. Randolph's steel guitar is often counterbalanced by popping bass lines and wailing organs. ""So Refreshing"" has a funky bass and buzz saw steel riff and ""Squeeze"" has fiery organs that perfectly contrast the wicked steel guitar. ""I Need More Love"" has a call and response chorus that sits atop a hard funk groove that is very Stevie Wonder like. ""Smile"" slows things down and features tender harmonies.

In the middle of all this Grammy supergroup shanigans many in our great nation were introduced to Robert Randolph and the Family Band. ""I Need More Love"" was tight performance of what they represent. Positive, church inspired, funk music with blistering jam band talent. Very, very rare that we hear anything that sounds fresh, new or an extension upon the foundations of black music rather than a recapitulation of established norms. These guys are the real deal. The music will raise your spirits. The talent will awe you at times. Acoustic music with power, fire, technique, soul, love, heart, courage, and power.
That's we need today, and that's what you should purchase.
Support great musicians and cop this album!

A3IC5E3OFHYAZX,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"You know, I never heard of Robert Randolph until I caught a sampling of 'The Word' album on an independent radio station about a year ago. After hearing him play the pedal steel guitar on that collaboration project, I must say I was absolutely floored! EVERYTHING about his playing will bring to mind all the things that made guys like Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Duane Allman, Carlos Santana, and Stevie Ray Vaughan as revered as they are. Simply put, the brother got ""MAD SKILLZ""!!!

The same can also be said of his stellar backing unit known simply as the Family Band, whose sound I found it best to describe as being a unique hybrid of the Allman Brothers' roots-based  rock and Graham Central Station's sanctified funk. On this, their first studio-conceived album, nearly all the tracks shine from the infectiously ""gospel-delic"" groove laid down by the band as well as the industrial strength of Randolph's pedal steel work (which is a joy to behold in itself). I would've given this a 5-star rating if some of the jams were extended for greater effect, but that's just a minor complaint linked mainly to personal preference. On the other hand, I do know a good band when I hear one and something tells me that Robert Randolph & Co. aren't that far off from becoming one of the most exciting and influential bands of their generation (MY generation to be specific).

HIGHLY recommended, but also get their live album as well. This band is definitely one of the best concert draws going today.","You know , I never heard of Robert Randolph until I caught a sampling of ' The Word ' album on an independent radio station about a year ago . After hearing him play the pedal steel guitar on that collaboration project , I must say I was absolutely floored ! EVERYTHING about his playing will bring to mind all the things that made guys like Jimi Hendrix , Jeff Beck , Duane Allman , Carlos Santana , and Stevie Ray Vaughan as revered as they are .

AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00122N04I,1,1,4,"Excellent followup for Robert Randolph and the Family Band's underground classic ""Live at the Wetlands."" Those who liked that CD will be pleased with this one. Most of this consists of tunes that this excellent group has been performing live over the last year, like ""Run For Your Life,"" ""Good Times,"" and ""Squeeze."" Once again, John Ginty plays the heck out of his organ and Marcus Randolph and Danyel Morgan in fine support (though it would be nice if this one had more of Danyel's soaring vocals).
Overall, this is good stuff, particularly the songs that I have just mentioned. Real get-up and go music with a positive energy not often found in tunes of recent times. ""Soul Refershing"" is simply beautiful and ""Smile"" is interesting (Robert's sister Lenesha does the vocals here). ""Calypso"" (not to be confused with the Harry belafonte tune of the same name) is an interesting novelty. A few of the songs (like ""I Need More Love"") are somewhat lacking in the right mix of melody and energy that characteris\zes this group-but a so-so song from these guys are better than the best of a lot of what's out there now!
I would suggest that those who may be interested in this start with ""Live at the Wetlands"" before going on to ""Unclassified."" That will give you a better preperation for this. Then pick up ""The Word"" (RR without the Family Band) and the ""Sacred Steel"" Cds after you listen to ""Unclassified.""

A2UR38SZPVA07I,B00122MEB8,1,1,5,"The Confessor was the title song from Joe Walsh's seventh solo album, released in 1985. It's also the most interesting single recording he has ever released as a solo artist. A two-part acoustic/electric guitar showpiece, the song is a reflection on perceiving reality and the certainty of having to pay a price for treachery and evil.

The futuristic synthesizer intro is augmented/contrasted by Joe's bluesy electric and haunting acoustic slide guitars. You can actually hear Joe's bottleneck scraping the brass-wound guitar strings as it eerily slides over them. Slow blues from the dark realm of another universe.

 Minor and major seventh chords complement Joe singing the murky philosophical lyrics of the first, and slower, half of the song.

The second half of the song features a ferocious electric guitar solo and one of Joe's most compelling vocal performances.

The Confessor:

If you look at your reflection in the bottom of a well
What you see is only on the surface
When you try to see the meaning hidden underneath
The measure of the depth can be deceiving
The bottom has a rocky reputation

You can feel it in the distance the deeper that you stare
From up above it's hard to see but you know when you're there
On the bottom words are shallow
On the surface talk is cheap
You can only judge the distance by the company you keep
In the eyes of The Confessor

There's nowhere you can hide
You can't hide from the eyes (of The Confessor)

In the eyes of The Confessor

You cannot tell a lie (to The Confessor)
Strip you down to size

Naked as the day that you were born
Naked as the day that you were born

Take all the trauma, drama, comments
The guilt and doubt and shame
The what if's and if only's
The shackles and the chains
The violence and aggression
The pettiness and scorn
The jealousy and hatred
The tempest and discord...

""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" the album, has five songs you never heard of, and one song you should know. This song is the one you want. Skip the album.

In the rock-and-roll canon, that great list of songs everyone generally agrees is great, you'll find a few Elvis, Stones and Beatles tunes. Zeppelin will have their share, and you'll see the Doors, Clapton, Buddy Holly and other familiar names repeated throughout that list. Then, somewhere close to #100 or 150, you'll see 'Iron Butterfly'. Who? It doesn't matter who. It matters what. The what is ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" a 17 minute work of rock-n-roll art.

To say Iron Butterfly was a one-hit wonder is only relating half of the story. This wasn't like ""People!"" whose cover of ""I Love You,"" hit high and then was forgotten when band members split to do other things. That's a real one-hit wonder. Iron Butterfly had one hit, but it would be like if Zeppelin only gave the world ""Stairway to Heaven."" The one song is enough to seal them in rock-n-roll history.

Has anyone covered this song? No one cares, because this is the version everyone wants. Everyone else is just giving this version an homage.

Like Skynard's guitar in ""Freebird,"" the drum solo here is what everyone talks about. The physical endurance to carry it off, and the musical strength to sustain the rhythm back into the song is amazing.

I fully recommend, ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" by Iron Butterfly.

Its the thump of the beat coupled with the chilling eeriness of the organ and sting of the guitar that makes you forgot the endless noodling that goes on for the middle 13 or so minutes that threaten to sink the song ."

It often automatically presumed that because a recording has been re-mastered, or transferred from analog to digital, that it's better.  Not so in many cases.  Re-mastering often over-compresses the original recording and results in the equivalent of a poor mix.  Subtleties in the background either disappear, or become so faint as to lose relevance to the song.

In the two Robert Plant songs that I downloaded ('Big Log' and 'In The Mood'), I found this to be the case.  Extremely disappointing.

The introduction of grunge, rap, and other music was hard to get use to. In 1992 along come a great song from Alannah Myles, BLACK VELVET. I thought the music of the 1990's is not lost we have a winner. The reason why I love this song is the lyrics beat, and it has something for everybody. It is a song that is a blend of Pop/Country, the beat is a blend and the lyrics to me is more pop. So if U hate Pop music you will still love this song and vice-versa with those who dis-like Country music like me. I guarantee you will get attached to this song regardless with music you prefer, so enjoy.

Joining Plant and Page in this ensemble is Nile Rodgers,who himself had chart success with his R&B band Chic. Rodgers had quite a workload with this album and Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN. It's understandable that Plant and Page declined to carry on with Led Zeppelin after the 1980 death of drummer John Bonham. SOL was made famous originally by Phil Phillips in 1959. The differences between Phillips' recording and the cover are no ""buh-buh-buh-bum"" in the cover,a key change in the cover and Plant's accenting of some of the lyrics differently than how Phillips did it. I guess that's because Plant is English(as is Page) and Phillips is American(as is Rodgers). ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT really swings. It got the lively 1940's sound that the fighting men of World War II were dancing to at clubs. After this album,Plant,whose solo career began in or around 1982,continued going solo. Page formed his third band THE FIRM and released an album in 1985.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00122PIMA,1,1,4,"The Honeydrippers consisted of two members of the collapsed band called Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. After Page and Plant added some new faces they had a new band, The Honeydrippers. Their new band does some great covers some of their songs. Unfortunately, this CD is rather short--and that disappoints me. What we do get, though, is excellent quality!

The track set begins with ""I Get A Thrill."" The band gives the arrangement a big band/swing/50s rock and roll flavor to this number; and the band harmonizes to perfection! Listen for some great piano playing; and the drums and percussion bolster ""I Get A Thrill"" very well. Love that electric guitar, too! ""Sea Of Love"" opens with a grand musical flourish from the violins; and when the band comes in they play and sing without a superfluous note! ""Sea Of Love"" gives us The Honeydrippers delivering one of their strongest, most enchanting love ballads ever. They harmonize well as they sing this nostalgic song to celebrate the joys of being in love. The musical interlude uses the electric guitar very well, too.

""I Got A Woman"" is a song written by the late great Ray Charles; The Honeydrippers pick up the tempo to perform this song at a faster than normal clip. The tempo helps to emphasize the joyfulness of this number that has a man celebrating his love for his woman. The band delivers this flawlessly; and the horn solo during the musical interlude impresses me very much. ""Young Boy Blues"" uses some great chord changes to make this number special, too.

The CD ends with the awesome track entitled ""Rockin' At Midnight."" If you really want to hear rock mixed with both big band and swing, listen for THIS ballad. The band celebrates being out on the town with their girlfriends; and the musical arrangement pulls out all the stops to make this number stun you with its power! The guitar solo bolsters the number as the horns play during the musical interlude; and the overall effect of ""Rockin' At Midnight"" packs a strong punch!

The liner notes include some great artwork and we get the song credits, too.

The Honeydrippers never developed to the extent I hoped they would; but this CD gives us excellent material from a band that lacked nothing. I only wish there were more than the paltry five songs on this CD! I have to take off a star because of this disappointment.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this playful, energetic CD put out by The Honeydrippers. Led Zeppelin fans will at the very least be intrigued by this CD; and people who thirst for that big band sound with those crooning vocals will love this one. Pop it in your CD player and enjoy!

Great job, guys! Thank you!","The Honeydrippers consisted of two members of the collapsed band called Led Zeppelin , Jimmy Page and Robert Plant .

The there's the DVD, a homecoming of sorts with a live Minneapolis concert from 1985. Again, there's this brash enthusiasm that only a hungry young band could muster, and it's great fun to watch. It's east to see why (if you believe Kurt's liner notes) the T-Bone urged the suits at Warners to sing The Bodeans because ""they're gonna be bigger than The Beatles.""

They had new albums and new bands from&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Los - Lobos / dp / B000CCD0F8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Los Lobos</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/The - Blasters / dp / B000VUTP4G / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">The Blasters</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/The - Bodeans / dp / B00005Y1Y4 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">The Bodeans</a > . They all got sort of lumped into the ' new wave ' category , but there was something more going on here . "" Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams "" was one of the best embodiments of this group of bands , and reissue , almost 25 years after the fact , shows why . The Bodeans were young and enthusiastic kids who wanted to make their own sound . Being from Wisconsin , they has no burning desire to be trendy or fashionable , just to make music that felt like escape to them . With the first thrilling notes of "" She 's A Runaway "" and the rocking theme of breakout the song offers , it 's an instant classic that should have slotted in comfortably next to the Springsteen or Mellencamp hits of the day . T - Bone Burnette heard the truth inside the songs and the vocal magic Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas made , and hauled them away to Los Angeles to make this album . "" Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams "" is a missing link of an album , the chain the runs between The Everly Brothers and The Rolling Stones ( from whom the album nicked its title ) . The remaster sounds incredible . The BoDeans were still fresh and excited , with T - Bone at the top of his early production game . "" Rickshaw Riding "" has sudden space in its slowbreathing sound . "" Looking for Me Somewhere "" sounds like Johnny Cash passed on it to hand it over to these youngsters . And the bonus track "" Turn Your Radio On "" makes you wonder why this Chuck Berry - ish rocker got left behind . The there 's the DVD , a homecoming of sorts with a live Minneapolis concert from 1985 . Again , there 's this brash enthusiasm that only a hungry young band could muster , and it 's great fun to watch . the T - Bone urged the suits at Warners to sing The Bodeans because "" they 're gon na be bigger than The Beatles . "" It includes songs that never made it to the studio albums done in front of a hometown audience , excited that their local heroes just might be the next big thing . "" Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams "" captures that desire , and this re - issue - from the good folks at Rhino - makes you scratch your head as to why it did n't happen ."

It's an average Alice album at best, and if you skip this one you're not missing that much.

The best cuts are the galloping opener ""Zorro's Ascent""; The fiery, clever ""Tag, You're It"" has Alice assuming the role of horror-movie director and the entire song is made up of his direction to the terrified leading lady hiding from a psycho-killer. It alone makes this album worth getting. Though the militant ""I Better Be Good"" sounds like a leftover from ""Special Forces"", it's still one of the best tracks here lyrically and musically. Patty Donahue of The Waitresses appears to take Alice to task on ""I Like Girls"" and her asides are typically amusing and make the song (""What happened? Run out of gas?"" etc).

Among the rest: ""Make That Money (Scrooge's Song)"" is nothing special except the instrumental finale sounds like something straight out of the ""Killer"" era, which should please fans of the original ACG. In the slower ""I Am the Future"", Alice forgoes the sap of earlier shamaltz for a ballad with bite--exactly like a slow Coop song should be.

Some of the lyrics get a little silly, as on ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" but it's a decent sing-a-long cut nontheless, the showy chorus reminiscent of ""Hello Hurray"". The rocking ""I'm Alive (That Was the Day My Dead Pet Returned)"" also sounds like something from B$B updated for 1982.

""Adaptable (Anything For You)"", ""Remarkably Insincere"" are actually both UNremarkable.

The way I look at most of Alice Coopers releases from the early to mid 1980's is the same way I look at Iggy Pop's work form the same time period. None of it is really horrible (at least not completely) but none of it is really great. They both seem to have like the whole new wave thing and wanted to join in on it. It didn't work out well for either of them. But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n' roll and yet they wanted to do something...bad..? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music.

'Zorro's Ascent' 'No Baloney Homosapiens' 'I Like Girls' and 'Tag, Your It' are all decent rock tracks. They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics. Especially 'No Baloney...' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name. Though 'Remarkably Insencire' is a real gem.

The rest of the album feels trite and boring, not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music. The production for one thing is horrendous.

While not too bad and not a total waste of your money, Zipper Catches Skin is not an album worth hunting down. IF you happen to come across it yeah it makes a cool snag, but ditch the high hopes for this one.","Alice Cooper - Zipper Catches Skin * * 1/2

But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n ' roll and yet they wanted to do something ... bad .. ? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music . ' Zorro 's Ascent ' ' No Baloney Homosapiens ' ' I Like Girls ' and ' Tag , Your It ' are all decent rock tracks . They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics . Especially ' No Baloney ... ' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name . Though ' Remarkably Insencire ' is a real gem . The rest of the album feels trite and boring , not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music . The production for one thing is horrendous . While not too bad and not a total waste of your money , Zipper Catches Skin is not an album worth hunting down . yeah it makes a cool snag , but ditch the high hopes for this one ."
AKGF27HN0OF19,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"This one has to be Alice's most inconsistent albums.  It's material ranges all over the place seemingly in search of a direction, but not really finding one.  Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on ""Special Forces"".  This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long.  Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting.  I did hear ""I Like Girls"" on my local AOR station a few times, but that was about it.  Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads, I like a lot of this disc.  You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff, as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous.  Highlights include ""Zorro's Ascent"" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together ""Adaptable"", ""I Like Girls"", and ""Remarkably Insincere"".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  ""Tag You're It"" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" days.  ""It Better Be Good"" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  ""I Am The Future"" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.  ""I'm Alive"" is another clunker that closes out the album.  Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly.  Still, I like most of it and it is defiantly one of Cooper's most ""fun"" albums.","This one has to be Alice 's most inconsistent albums .

A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B00122PK9Q,-1,-1,3,"""Zipper Catches Skin"" may be the most unbalanced Cooper disk recorded. It has some fantastic songs like ""Tag, You're It"", a tribute to 80's slasher films in which Alice sings as if directing a B-Movie. ""Adaptable"" is a really fun song that will stay in your head after just one listen to the album. And you have ""I Like Girls"" and ""Remarkably Insincere"" which are fun songs about a womanizing loser. ""I Am the Future"" is actually a pretty dark song lyrically and I think is the standout song on the album. But, on the flip side you have what may be Cooper's worst song ever with ""No Baloney Homosapiens"". I am sure at the time, Cooper thought this was pretty clever, but musically it just does not flow, the lyrics are choppy, and forced into a rhyming scheme that just doesn't work. ""Make That Money"" is another forgettable ditty, with lyrics again not befitting Alice Cooper. But outside of those two songs Alice I think ""Zipper Catches Skin"" is a really good album, but still the weakest of the early 80's New Age Alice. I prefer ""Flush the Fashion"", ""Special Forces"" and the best of this era ""DaDa"". Still, it's Alice Cooper and worth the price for the import, if for nothing else than to own the entire Cooper Collection.",""" Zipper Catches Skin "" may be the most unbalanced Cooper disk recorded .

Having made the move from SoCal folk-rock band in the late 60's to Nashville-based country band by the early 80's, NGDB never fully lost its roots and is often credited with influencing the modern country-crossover movement.

You certainly hear those blended influences in ""Fishin' in the Dark"", which marries the toe-tapping twang of mid-80's Nashville country with the vocal harmonies of earlier SoCal folk-rockers like the Mamas and Papas.  The result is a landmark cross-over song that is both simple to listen to, and delightful to revisit.","1987 's "" Fishin ' in the Dark "" was the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band 's third , and last ( .. so far ) , # 1 single .

They might end up being too ""English"" for American tastes, but for me they really nailed it. Starting out with high energy numbers like ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor"" and ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" set you up for a completely up tempo CD and then comes the quiet thoughtful reading of ""Riot Van,"" where the tune totally belies the lyrics. Either the humor is spot on, in titles like ""Perhaps Vampires is a bit Strong..."" which is definitely not the sentiment in the song; or wicked social commentary is clearly expressed on songs like ""When The Sun Goes Down.""

The same dummy (""Bob Btchin"") from 5 years earlier bungles his way through the game and wins with a wrong answer. 3.) Headache sufferer visits a Chinese physician. 4.)

A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B00122Z4Y2,1,1,5,"The Mystic Knights of The Oingo Boingo have come a long was since presiding in the Devil's Chamber in that truly cult classic, THE FORBIDDEN ZONE, directed by Richard Elfman {sibling elf}, a highly entertaining venture into the vortex of utter madness. Since their innovative neo-punk beginnings, Danny Elfman has led the Knights onto many musical victories, including his own solo projects, & finally, movie scores. Such titles as BATMAN RETURNS, BEETLEJUICE, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE XMAS, NIGHTBREED & EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, are among his celebrated compositions.
The name has been put through the guillotine, severed in half to display a highly crystallized evolution. A focus on heavier rhythm guitars have been added, giving the album a sharper edge. The cover displays an interesting little clown, deformed in his composit. The back shows some aesthetic terrorism as well.
Now, this erubescent, modern-day Wolfgang brings forth a series of songs which speak from his satanic heart, of anti-assimilation in the jesting guise of conformity. Particularly noticable in the cantible ""Insatanity"". where the voices of little ones valiantly defy xian indoctrination by recognizing its unnaturalness. Also exposed is the hypocrisy of evangelists in their two-faced, money-grubbing, sexually-twisted forms.
Another favorite is ""Mary"", which is the common story of a blossoming midwestern girl breaking the apron strings to see the great-wide-world. The rub here, is that she enjoys what she feels, & for the first time, comes unto her own realizations & conclusionsnow thyat her overbearing xian family is out of the picture. It is quite an emotionally-evoking piece, especially when the syubbornness of her unfortunately xoid kin is displayed., in their unacceptance of her, when she finally finds something she really enjoys. Indulging in the pleasures of the flesh, & living a decadently hedonistic lifestyle which brings her satisfaction, & a sense of accomplishment. She was a bigger fish than they - she had ambition. I don't think it was too much of a blasphemous coincidence that the name hosen was ""Mary"", as in ""virgin"". By the way, the violins are sublime.
There's also a remake of the Beatles' ""I Am The Walrus"", a fun song that has been played at many a frat party, no doubt. SPIDER is an enjoyable diddy about he who glares from the wall. WAR AGAIN is an inspirational tune about war & the adrenalyn & tragedy of battle. It inspires pride. It is powerful in its emotional evocation, as the words are definitely felt, greatly compliments the music.
Overall, this release is an experience, which is rare in the pop-""music"" industry, with their trivial, monotonous, monosyllabic, non-music blare. Like Elman's other works, all which make an impression upon the listener, this is sure to please the discriminating, amalgamate, audial conniseur.","The Mystic Knights of The Oingo Boingo have come a long was since presiding in the Devil 's Chamber in that truly cult classic , THE FORBIDDEN ZONE , directed by Richard Elfman { sibling elf } , a highly entertaining venture into the vortex of utter madness .

AJK5WHV1GW941,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"I own most of Jaheim's music and this man never releases a bad album.  When he records an LP, he obviously brings his A-game because one can hear it in his voice: He is focused when he sings and he means every word he belts out.  He is one of the best male artists of today, easily.  Why?  Foremost, because he has a beautiful tenor singing voice and knows just how to use it.  He does not over-sing and he stays on key so well!  ""The Makings of A Man"" is one of the best albums of 2007 because it is consistent and there are some great tunes on this album.  Most of the songs are mid-tempo and about women and relationships.  Also, there are twelve songs so the album is not too short and not lengthy either.

 Jaheim will find some way to tell you that he is a reformed thug on each and every album.  I know he is serious, but it's a little funny that he feels the need to continually remind us.  This time, his thug story is found on ""Life of A Thug.""  He exposes some of the malicious things he did during that juncture in his life, and if you listen closely, he was a pretty bad guy.  This song is nicely produced; I particularly like the horns.  Also, the hook gives it replay value.  ""She Ain't You"" and ""Voice of R&B"" are great tracks.  Vocally, he does a splendid job.  The lyrics are meaningful, especially to Jaheim fanatics.  He informs his listeners that he is very important to the genre of music called R&B, and he is.  Keyshia Cole is my boo and she did well on ""I've Changed"", but that is one of the weakest songs on the album.  The song is average at best.  The hook isn't too good and neither are the lyrics or the production.  Jaheim has included quite a few songs about his mother on his albums.  Here, we have a song called ""Back Together Again.""  This heartfelt number has an emotional Jaheim singing about how his parents are united in heaven.  It's a lovely moment on the album.

 I hope I have convinced you to pick this album up, download it from iTunes, do SOMETHING!  I enjoyed it all the way through.  Be advised, this is a laid back album.  There aren't any dance tracks, just ballads and mid-tempos, but truly worth your time.  4 shining stars.

AGAMDS21PJZPK,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"It took awhile for Jaheim's 1st video to grow on me.  I would see ""Could It Be"" quite often on BET and finally after awhile the track began to grow on me.  Eventually, I picked up Jaheim's 1st CD entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghetto-Love/dp/B00005899K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghetto Love</a>.  My favorite tracks included ""Looking For Love"", ""Ghetto Love"", ""Just In Case"", ""Anything"" w/Next and ""Ready Willing & Able"".  His debut was definitely strong despite there being some filler amongst the 21 tracks.  His 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Still-Ghetto/dp/B00006WKYJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Still Ghetto</a>&nbsp;got a tremendous push because of the 1st single ""Fabolous"" that was an anthem dedicated to the young kids that are growing up in this crazy world.  My favorite tracks ended up being ""Diamond In Da Ruff"", ""Let's Talk About It"", ""Beauty & Thug"" w/Mary J. Blige, ""Long As I Live"" and ""Me & My B____"".  In 2006 Jaheim released his 3rd disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghetto-Classics/dp/B000BJ7CCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghetto Classics</a>.  The 1st single was ""Everytime I Think About Her"" w/Jadakiss and my other favorites included ""The Chosen One"", ""Like A DJ"", ""Masterpiece"", ""Conversation"" and ""Come Over"".

Just as review ""Musac Critic"" stated, Jaheim's 4th release, ""The Makings Of A Man"" has Jaheim playing it safe for the most part.  The 1st track ""Voice Of R&B"" is an introduction to r&b listeners who may not be too familiar with Jaheim's work outside of the singles that everyone has heard.  The track clocks in at less than 3 minutes and is a short but sweet track for Jaheim fans.  ""Hush"" is produced by R Kelly and has Jaheim describing a situation where he unintentionally started messin' around with a female that he knew was with a guy that he knew.  Jaheim blames it on having a couple of drinks but now that the 1st time was so good, he is trying to figure out how they can keep things going without the guy finding out.  ""Have You Ever"" is right along the lines of ""Fabolous"" as Jaheim is reminiscing to events that happened in the past when he was younger.  You hear the familiar Kaygee sound that you heard on ""Ghetto Love"" as well.  ""Lonely"" has Jaheim employing his own concept to the Bobby Womack classic ""If You Think You're Lonely Now"".  The chrous stays the same but Jaheim adds his own lyrics to the verses and the other parts of the song.  This is definitely one of my favorite tracks on this CD.  ""Life Of A Thug"" will be one of those songs that if you heard Jaheim's 1st 3 CDs that you have heard before.  However, you will still want to listen to the track in its entirety.  He talks about how his dad passed when he was 2 so all that he knew were the streets growing up despite having the guidance of his mom.  My personal favorite track on ""The Makings Of A Man"" is ""Just Don't Have A Clue"".  Babyface shows up to produce a nice midtempo jam using acoustic guitars and various other elements.  Jaheim is trying to tell the lady that he is with that she has no idea about the plans that he has for her in the future as long as she realzies that he should be the one and only one for her.  He states that he is better than the guys that she is use to so she shouldn't be afraid to give her all in the relationship.  ""She Ain't You"" has Jaheim talking about a woman that isn't girlfriend that treats him better than his actual girlfriend does.  He even says that the particular girl's love is like a Bentley Coup and his girlfriend's love is like a Mercedes Benz that's been used.  OUCH!..lol  ""She Ain't You"" is another nice midtempo jam.  ""Never"" is the lead single and serves that purpose well.  Jaheim talks about resisting the temptation of love before because he didn't want to turn in his player card.  However, after meeting this particular woman, that he is ready to burn the infamous black book.  Keyshia Cole, who is 3 singles into her sophomore disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Like-You/dp/B000VDDCHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Like You</a>, joins Jaheim on ""I've Changed"".  Kaygee employs a nice sample in Atlantic Starr's ""Let's Get Closer"" and creates a nice uptempo jam for the prince and princess of ""ghetto love r&b.""  If you are a fan of either artist then this just might be your favorite track on this CD.  ""What You Think Of That"" is another one of my favorites as Jaheim talks about how his ""Diamond In Da Ruff"" is making him feel.  He's not really caring about what the world thinks about the relationship and he is happy to have her in his life.  ""Make A Wish"" is a midtempo jam that has Jaheim wanting to treat his woman to a nice time since it's her birthday and ""Back Together Again"" is a nice song that talks about how his dad and mom are together again in heaven since they both left the Earth to soon.

If your purchased ""The Makings Of A Man"" at Circuit City then you were blessed with 2 bonus tracks in ""Roster"" and ""Keep It 100"".  ""Roster"" is the better track as the Kaygee produced track will remind you of ""Just In Case"" from ""Ghetto Love"" and ""Like A DJ"" from ""Ghetto Classics"".  ""Keep It 100"" isn't a bad track, but you will clearly be able to tell why it was a bonus track.

Overall, if this is your 1st introduction to a Jaheim CD, I wouldn't expect you to be a big fan of this CD.  However, if you have followed Jaheim since ""Ghetto Love"" then you will enjoy Volume 4 of Jaheim's ghetto classic series.  He has a nice voice and you already know the type of songs that you are going to get from Jaheim so you shouldn't be surprised by the material.  If you liked ""Ghetto Love"", ""Still Ghetto"" and ""Ghetto Classics"", then you should also own ""The Makings Of A Man"".

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"First of all, I consider Jaheim to be one of the standout male R&B singers of our time.  Unfortunately for Ja, he hasn't found commercial success easily. Sure, GHETTO LOVE and STILL GHETTO went platinum, but it took time and airplay. Last year's GHETTO CLASSICS landed Jaheim in the top spot of the Billboard Chart yet it only went gold (and its chart stay was brief as well)and none of his excellent singles made a splash at radio.  Sad considering ""Everytime I Think About Her"" and ""The Chosen One"" were both fine songs, among Jaheim's most soulful. This time around, Jaheim lands at Atlantic and the difference is noticeable.  Sure, Jaheim sounds as refined yet soulful at the same time, but the production doesn't feel as bombastic or bright as it did on last year's GHETTO CLASSICS.  It's not a bad thing, but despite this album being as consistent as any Jaheim album, it at times feels too safe and reserved. Vocally Jaheim is refined and never overdoes melisma, but you sometimes wish Jaheim would give just a bit more.

The material is overall fine, but a bit safe. The opening ""Voice of R&B"" has a nice vintage soul feel to it with the horns and 1970s feeling production. Jaheim still possesses his street-savvy persona here despite the soulful underlying production.  On ""Hush"", Jaheim gets his R. Kelly on (literally), though it isn't a complete successin my eyes.  Sure, Ja pulls it off pretty good, but I think Jaheim is better suited with soul-samples and vintage production work - nothing against Kells. It's not bad though, just different. ""Have You Ever"" and ""Lonely"" start to really heat things up while ""Life of a Thug"" truly brings the heat with its wah-wah clavinets, strings, and synthesized horn production.

""You Just Don't Get It"" isn't bad, though the highlights that follow are incredible.  ""She Ain't You"" is absolutely beautiful and is my personal favorite.  ""Never"" is a bit subtle, but maybe it is the subtlety that makes it so great. Jaheim vocal control is phenomenal here.  ""I've Changed"" features an as of late ubiquitous Keyshia Cole and proves to be solid as does ""What You Think of That"".  ""Make A Wish"" and ""Back Together Again"" are solid as well, if not as exceptional as the aforementioned best (""Have You Ever"", ""Life of a Thug"", ""She Ain't You"", ""Never"", and ""You've Changed"".

Overall, THE MAKINGS OF A MAN is Ja's fourth consistent effort.  Again, the material is good but safe in a couple of cases.  This isn't a bland effort, but it is even less ornate than GHETTO CLASSICS and there is no ""Could It Be"" this time around.  With that said, there are enough solid numbers to make this album overall enjoyable. 4 stars Ja.","First of all , I consider Jaheim to be one of the standout male R&B singers of our time .

A9Q28YTLYREO7,B001232NP4,-1,-1,2,"Jaheim is a Cat with a top tier strong voice, problem is the lyrical content and the fact he doesn't have anybody to push his vocal boundarys. he aspires to be the Teddy Pendergrass/Luther Vandross, Johnny Gill  of his Generation, but alot of the material he gets is making him more closer to Christopher Wiliams a vocalist who had a good range,but was stuck doing generic watered down takes on songs that were out or just doing hooks. I like the R.Kelly Produced ""Hush"" and a Jaheim vocally brings it, but the material he gets is hurting him and he seems to be headed toward the same path as Dave Holister another strong Voice Soul Brother who never got the right songs to compliment his overall range.","Jaheim is a Cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the lyrical content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal boundarys . he aspires to be the Teddy Pendergrass / Luther Vandross , Johnny Gill   of his Generation , but alot of the material he gets is making him more closer to Christopher Wiliams a vocalist who had a good range , but was stuck doing generic watered down takes on songs that were out or just doing hooks .

A17814AD8EWTN4,B001232NP4,1,1,4,"See with Jaheim, ive noticed the man can not make bad music. Every album he has put out has been at least good, and excellent at his best. And that continues with Makings of A Man. I think Ja made a good choice in switching record labels and going to Atlantic, because at Warner he wasn't getting any promotion. This was the first time i had to go to 2 different stores to find the damn album, because they were sold out at the first store. Jaheim is a breath of fresh air in the state of R&B right now. Because most of the R&B being put out right now revolves around Sex, partying, and drugs. And some of that is ok in small doses but to make a whole album around that gets old real fast. But Ja knows how to balance his albums between Love & Sex. He doesnt over do it on this album, along with any of his other albums. But the biggest thing that i think helped him in the move to Atlantic, was that it introduced him to some new and better producers. This is the first time a Ja album has actually had a more contempary feel to it. Like the stellar Babyface written ""Just Don't Get It"", this is totally different than the Ja we are used to. This song totally sounds like it could be on the radio. Excellent track. Like on the R. Kelly produced ""Hush"" where Ja reminices about how he had an affair with his best friends girl. This album is alot different sounding than his previous albums, but its a good thing. While ""Never"" could possibly be played at weddings, he can still do songs that the thugs can feel to like ""Life of a Thug"". And the other thing that i really like about this album (This might sound weird), is that he released it in December. Which in my opinion is the perfect time for him to release an album because in winter, i always find myself listening to his albums. I don't know what it is but during the winter his music just does it for me when i am driving around. Not that during the summer or whatever i don't like him, but during the winter i always make sure to have at least one of his albums in the car with me at all times. I think it could be his just smooth but jagged vocals that just warms the air during the winter that makes his music so attractive during the winter season. And we all know Ja can blow, unless you are new to Ja, now is the perfect time to introduce yourself. And this album will be in heavy rotation for quite some time because it is just as good as his previous albums, if not better. Another hit for Jaheim... as usual!

Grade:
B+","See with Jaheim , i ve noticed the man can not make bad music . Every album he has put out has been at least good , and excellent at his best . I think Ja made a good choice in switching record labels and going to Atlantic , because at Warner he was n't getting any promotion . This was the first time i had to go to 2 different stores to find the damn album , because they were sold out at the first store . Jaheim is a breath of fresh air in the state of R&B right now . Because most of the R&B being put out right now revolves around Sex , partying , and drugs . And some of that is ok in small doses but to make a whole album around that gets old real fast . But Ja knows how to balance his albums between Love & Sex . He does nt over do it on this album , along with any of his other albums .

Nope, this song is a sincere piece of work, and one of Thomas' best. And unlike his later work, it builds toward something grand, and when it comes to the chorus, it soars in a magical fashion that can only happen at Christmas.

Overall, one of the best modern Christmas songs I've ever heard. It's a earnest piece of work, and at least when it first came out, the proceeds went toward charity.

Anyway, this is slightly better than the debut, containing a whopping five good songs rather than four. I don't think you need me here to tell you that ""Take It Easy"" is better heard here than by the Eagles (Jackson wrote the damn thing); ""Redneck Friend"" is easily the best of his few rockers, and its sense of humor is a nice change of pace from his usual overtly-serious style; ""For Everyman"" is a bit overlong but has the best guitar solo Browne ever recorded; ""These Days"" (later covered by Gregg Allman) goes from country-rock to relatively full-on rock; and the slow-building ""I Thought I Was a Child"" is interesting too. But some of it's more of the same, just one turgid country-rocker after another - ""Our Lady of the Well"", ""Ready or Not"", etc. Better than the debut, at least.

A3G10NPD661EQD,B001232RGE,1,1,5,"""Saturate Before Using"", ""Late For The Sky"" and this album (and I suppose ""Runnin' On Empty"" too although I've yet to hear it - I can't imagine it would be bad, though) are ESSENTIAL albums to ANY music fan. EVERYTHING about these albums is perfect - the production, lyrics, musicianship, singing...etc. This makes perfect sense as Jackson was notoriously worried about getting everything perfect in the studio (and his producers rightfully got annoyed at him for that). This paid off in spades, however, as everything is crystal clear and perfect even though this was recorded in the late 60's! A cool little addition is that the first and second as well as the 9th and 10th songs flow into one another (very cool). The lyrics, as always, are extremely quotable, deep and meaningful - pretty much second only to Bob Dylan. Unlike Dylan, though, the lyrics are, like title of the album, ""For Everyman"". As opposed to ""Saturate Before Using"" and ""Late For The Sky"", ""For Everyman"" is the more consistent album - there aren't any ""bad"" songs (not that the other two had bad songs, a bunch just weren't as good as the highlights). Another cool addition is the first track, ""Take It Easy"", which is the original song which The Eagles then made into a monster hit with their cover version. If you were unsure whether you liked Jackson before, buy this album and you'll become a fan! For $9.00 this is a STEAL! Absolutely recommended!

My personal favorites on this  wonderful album are ""Our Lady of the Well"", a interesting and fetching  suggestion of Browne's social and political concerns blended with a  celebration of the common rural peasantry of Latin America, ""Take It Easy""  written with Glenn Frye of the Eagles and recorded by both Browne and the  Eagles, ""These Times You've Come"" about an old pair of lovers who still see  each other romantically after parting, and of course, the combination song  cycle of ""Sing My Songs"" and ""For Everyman"", which like ""The Deluge"" on  another album, sets out Browne's fear of a pending eco-disaster and  apocalypse. Browne is still around, still creative, and still as socially  and politically outspoken, but this is one of his best early albums, when  he was one of the most talented and creative young folk-rock luminaries on  the popular scene, a superstar a long time in the making.

A3NPBG9YE84S63,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Jewel was at the very tail end of her 20s in 2003 when her fourth album ""0304"" was released.  But the photos that adorn the CD's layout -- oh my!  She is more gorgeous and youthful in them than girls 10 years her minor.  She has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world in fact.  She is the living definition of ""young and smart and sexy,"" to use the catchphrase she coined for this album.

OK, so I've just now been open about my admiration for Jewel's looks, but the question is, does she have the music to back it up?  The answer is an unequivocal ""yes.""

Some reviewers considered ""0304"" to be something of a misstep for the Alaskan born singer/songwriter, but I believe this to be one of her best albums.  The opener ""Stand"" is a classic.  It always brings me back to the first times that I heard this CD.  One of her best ever.  It and the other songs here demonstrate Jewel's knack for making odd references in her lyrics (see also the one to Charlie Sheen in ""Intuition"") that put a smile on the listener's face and make for memorable songs.  Beyond that, I love ""Leave the Lights On,"" a slower and more laid back track.  One thing that was new to Jewel's sound on this release was the use of electronica to create numbers tailor-made for any dance hall, something some fans of her past, more folkish tunes didn't take well to.  I for one love it.  Some of my favorite tracks here are the lesser known ones stacked at the end that are great for dancing or exercising to.  I mean, you just can't get more catchy than songs like ""Yes U Can,"" ""U & Me = Love,"" and the rousing track where Jewel demonstrates her love for her home country, ""America.""  Excellent stuff.

There is actually not one weak track or moment of filler here though and Jewel sustains the listener's interest for the 53 minute duration of the CD, as only Jewel can, all the while proudly wearing her femininity and sex appeal on her sleeve.  The only reason I'm rating this album just shy of five stars is I liked the 2006 follow-up ""Goodbye Alice in Wonderland"" even slightly better.  Still, if you want to feel young and smart and sexy no matter what age you are, Jewel will show you how on ""0304.""  Highly recommended.","Jewel was at the very tail end of her 20s in 2003 when her fourth album "" 0304 "" was released .

But i still give this album a high rating because i love Jewel, her writing, and her raspy and lovely voice. The best song of the whole bunch is track number nine, Haunted.

A24P8BEJ26FU01,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"Jewel Kilcher was always known for her meaningful lyrics and acoustic song stylings so it was no surprise that she would be labeled a ""sell-out"" once she switched things up at all. No one knows quite why Jewel decided to switch styles though many assume it was to crossover to the mainstream and sell more. Jewel's fourth album ""0304"" takes a more electronica/dance approach than its guitar-driven predecessors though the lyrical quality is still there. The even weirder thing was that at the time of this album's release, June 2003, the big dance-pop bang from the late 90's and even 2000/2001 was over which suggests that this wasn't exactly an attempt to ride the latest trends. Jewel was never known for doing what was trendy and this is no exception.

The album starts off with the social commentary song entitled ""Stand"". The song comments on numerous topics including policemen stealing and the mayor having no money because he spent it on ""hookers and hash"". The lyrics seem to be trying to say that we can make a stand against all these problems. Next up is the first evidence of Jewel's new style, ""Run 2 U"". Everything from the internet-style writing in the title (numbers instead of words) to the dance beat in the background takes listeners away from what they thought a Jewel song should be but to me, it still works. The song is catchy enough that it will stick in your head but still maintains Jewel's usual meaningful lyrics (""I need you for dark reasons, for greed and lust...""). Thirdly. We have the first single ""Intuition"" which seems to almost be a parody of the pop music scene. The lyrics are not quite as deep as people are used to from Jewel however it is one of those meaningful yet catchy songs that gives its message as it gets stuck in your head. While it is good to dance to, it still maintains the positive message of following your heart.

Next is ""Leave The Lights On"" which is the first lyrically poor song on the album. I love the way Jewel's voice sounds in the verses of the songs but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired especially since we know Jewel can do much better. (""If you want my love, you can try my love, you can't buy my love""). It's catchy and Jewel sounds good in it, but she can do better. The song after, ""2 Find U"" reminds me of ""Standing Still"" (especially in the chorus) but that is not really a bad thing. The chorus is vocally good but lyrically weak. The verses are lyrically much better. Next is ""Fragile Heart"", another love-themed song. It is probably closest to Jewel's former style, but while it is a nice song on its own, it seems very out of place on this album. Maybe it would have sounded better on an album with more songs of a similar style.  After that is ""Doin' Fine"" which is also quite poor lyrically as well as a somewhat clichd theme (that her and her man are doing fine). This song is average at best and fails to really stand out.

Then comes ""2 Become 1"", and it is quite obvious what this song is about. Lyrically, it is mediocre and could have been much better. Jewel sounds very sweet in this song and this is probably my favourite song vocally, however in the grand scheme of things it is mostly average. Next up is ""Haunted"" which is told from the point of view of a stalker (similar to Sarah Mclachlan's ""Possesion""). This song returns to the lyrical quality that listeners expect from Jewel though vocally it reminds me of Tori Amos. It is an essentially eerie-sounding song that is bound to creep out some listeners. Afterwards is ""Sweet Temptation"" which seems like a better version of ""2 Become 1"". They both talk about the same subject however ""Sweet Temptation"" is much better both vocally and lyrically. This song is also much more catchy and memorable than ""2 Become 1"".

The next song, ""Yes U Can"" is probably one of the weakest on the album and is merely a typical dance track that nearly any singer could have done. Lyrically, it is not even up to Jewel's usual standards (""Would you like to come along? Then shut up and sing this song""). While it is a catchy, danceable song, it does not seem like a song that Jewel would or should be doing. ""U & Me = Love"" is no better, either vocally or lyrically. I understand that Jewel is trying to branch out to a different style however she would be better off with quality songs like ""Intuition"" and ""Stand"" than this song or the one before it. After that is ""America"", which is obviously another social commentary. Unfortunately, while I appreciate what Jewel was trying to do with this song, it did not work out too well. The lyrics are quite weak (""The Osbournes and Anna Nicole are too freaky to tell"") and the vocals are fairly standard. Lastly is ""Becoming"" which has better lyrics but really does not stand out too much. It is not in any way bad except maybe it was poorly placed.

Overall Mark: 3/5

While most fans were outraged when Jewel released this album, she actually has some decent dance songs that prove she's capable of other styles. This album could have been really great if Jewel had stuck with infusing meaningful lyrics to dance beats (as with ""Stand"" and ""Intuition""). Unfortunately, towards the second half of the album, Jewel ends up using mediocre lyrics that any dance artist could have done. Up until ""Fragile Heart"", the album was exceptionally well done for what it was supposed to be (meaningful dance music) though it faltered in a lot of places after that. Generally though, it is a pretty good dance album and much catchier than anything Jewel's done before.","Jewel Kilcher was always known for her meaningful lyrics and acoustic song stylings so it was no surprise that she would be labeled a "" sell - out "" once she switched things up at all . No one knows quite why Jewel decided to switch styles though many assume it was to crossover to the mainstream and sell more . Jewel 's fourth album "" 0304 "" takes a more electronica / dance approach than its guitar - driven predecessors though the lyrical quality is still there . The even weirder thing was that at the time of this album 's release , June 2003 , the big dance - pop bang from the late 90 's and even 2000/2001 was over which suggests that this was n't exactly an attempt to ride the latest trends . Jewel was never known for doing what was trendy and this is no exception . The album starts off with the social commentary song entitled "" Stand "" . The song comments on numerous topics including policemen stealing and the mayor having no money because he spent it on "" hookers and hash "" . The lyrics seem to be trying to say that we can make a stand against all these problems . Next up is the first evidence of Jewel 's new style , "" Run 2 U "" . Everything from the internet - style writing in the title ( numbers instead of words ) to the dance beat in the background takes listeners away from what they thought a Jewel song should be but to me , it still works . The song is catchy enough that it will stick in your head but still maintains Jewel 's usual meaningful lyrics ( "" I need you for dark reasons , for greed and lust ... "" ) . Thirdly . We have the first single "" Intuition "" which seems to almost be a parody of the pop music scene . The lyrics are not quite as deep as people are used to from Jewel however it is one of those meaningful yet catchy songs that gives its message as it gets stuck in your head . While it is good to dance to , it still maintains the positive message of following your heart . Next is "" Leave The Lights On "" which is the first lyrically poor song on the album . I love the way Jewel 's voice sounds in the verses of the songs but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired especially since we know Jewel can do much better . ( "" If you want my love , you can try my love , you ca n't buy my love "" ) . It 's catchy and Jewel sounds good in it , but she can do better . The song after , "" 2 Find U "" reminds me of "" Standing Still "" ( especially in the chorus ) but that is not really a bad thing . The chorus is vocally good but lyrically weak . The verses are lyrically much better . Next is "" Fragile Heart "" , another love - themed song . It is probably closest to Jewel 's former style , but while it is a nice song on its own , it seems very out of place on this album . Maybe it would have sounded better on an album with more songs of a similar style . After that is "" Doin' Fine "" which is also quite poor lyrically as well as a somewhat clichd theme ( that her and her man are doing fine ) . This song is average at best and fails to really stand out . Then comes "" 2 Become 1 "" , and it is quite obvious what this song is about . Lyrically , it is mediocre and could have been much better . Jewel sounds very sweet in this song and this is probably my favourite song vocally , however in the grand scheme of things it is mostly average . Next up is "" Haunted "" which is told from the point of view of a stalker ( similar to Sarah Mclachlan 's "" Possesion "" ) . This song returns to the lyrical quality that listeners expect from Jewel though vocally it reminds me of Tori Amos . It is an essentially eerie - sounding song that is bound to creep out some listeners . Afterwards is "" Sweet Temptation "" which seems like a better version of "" 2 Become 1 "" . They both talk about the same subject however "" Sweet Temptation "" is much better both vocally and lyrically . This song is also much more catchy and memorable than "" 2 Become 1 "" . The next song , "" Yes U Can "" is probably one of the weakest on the album and is merely a typical dance track that nearly any singer could have done . Lyrically , it is not even up to Jewel 's usual standards ( "" Would you like to come along ? Then shut up and sing this song "" ) . While it is a catchy , danceable song , it does not seem like a song that Jewel would or should be doing . "" U & Me = Love "" is no better , either vocally or lyrically .

AO3VO3TW1CCJP,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"I was hesitant to buy this album because I hadn't heard too many good things about it. For one, the Amazon.com review said, ""Why pick on a girl for taking a chance?"" Why would anyone pick on her? This is a great album that takes her Jewelness to a new level. Her lyrics, while mostly pertaining to love, are still hers in the sense that she puts poetic thought into them. She also has some great message-bearing songs, and then just some fun ones with no need for substance!
""Stand"" is the first song and is a great way to kick off the album. It talks about the sadness of the world we live in, how some poor people spend money on drugs and alcohol, there's a lot of violence, and other horrible things. She also mentions how we can come together and make a change!
I really liked ""2 Find U"" because it talked about the problems of relationships. Though there are mistakes that we make with our boyfriend or girlfriend, we have two choices when fights or things like that happen: 1) we can let the pain win and walk away forever, or 2) we can give eachother a clean slate & start over. Jewel asks for a clean slate in this song, it's very bittersweet.
Her voice is so cutesy in ""Fragile Heart,"" it's funny! She uses simple sentences and the childlike sound of her voice makes it amusing to me: ""If you want my heart, you have to promise not to tear it apart, 'cause my heart has been hurt a lot."" It's a cautionary song letting someone know she's had lots of pain in the past and doesn't want that now.
I must say that ""Haunted"" gave me goosebumps when I first heard it, and still does!!! Though Jewel's liner notes say it's about a stalker (which makes sense if you look at the lyrics), I like to think it's a very dark song about someone who Jewel wants revenge against. She describes how she will ""come to you in the still of the night"" and ""crush you with the burden of sight."" The music is very creepy and slick, adding to the frightful feel of the song. There's also a little clock ticking in the background, making it all the more paranoid and intense! Remind me not to make her mad! :-)
""Yes U Can"" is a song that really doesn't have much meat to it lyrically, but is very fun to listen to! It describes a club scene with cowboys and 'naughty girls.' It's tongue-in-cheek I think, kind of playing on words and stuff. Very good song!
I think ""America"" might be my favorite song on this album. It talks about the imperfections of our country, from the fact that our president wants us to 'shed blood in the name of liberty' to the deteriorating quality of TV shows. She doesn't just blast America, though, she admits that although she wants to change it she wouldn't leave it if she could.
Yes, Jewel's sound is altered here on this electronic album. But don't think it's crap because of that; like I said, in my opinion it enhances her greatness. Though there are some very computerized songs, there are also ones that are closer to her acoustic style on ""This Way."" I would strongly encourage every Jewel fan to give this album an honest listen! I think it'll be worth it!","I was hesitant to buy this album because I had n't heard too many good things about it .

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"Jewel Kilcher's recent musical and style change is perhaps the biggest public makeover in years. Once she was a guitar-strumming folk girl. Now she's reinvented herself as the American Kylie Minogue with ""0304,"" a catchy but overpolished collection of dance-pop songs.
The more philosophical side of Jewel seems to linger in the slow-paced ""Stand"" (""It's a shame there's no one to blame/for all the pain that life brings...""). But that vanishes with the wispy ""Run 2 U"" and pale ""2 Find U,"" both colorless dance tunes. Some of the necessary verve and power reappears with the catchy ""Intuition,"" bouncy USA-themed song ""America,"" and shimmying ""Yes U Can."" A more gothic sensibility surfaces in the distorted, ominous ""Haunted.""
Nobody expects dance-pop to be deep -- all it has to be is catchy. And ""0304"" isn't deep. It's just a collection of mid-level dance music, with mediocre lyrics, acceptable vocals and packaged electronic pop music. We've seen it all before, but Jewel's offering isn't bad. Instead, it just fails to be really good.
When you hear Jewel's voice, you can tell that all the flaws have been scrupulously polished out. In past albums, her voice had minor imperfections. No more. It's not an exceptional voice, but neither is it bad; it's suited for the dance music she produces here, which isn' too taxing.  Musically, it can't be denied that ""0304"" is very catchy. Jewel flavors the dance-pop with hints of jazz (the accordion in ""Intuition"") and replaces her acoustic guitars with electric and bass. Okay, the acoustic guitars are still there, but good luck finding them.
Unfortunately the songs are essentially empty. Jewel has a good ear for rhythm and rhyme, but there's nothing really interesting about these songs. They're just ordinary dance-pop. (""If u want my love/u can try my love/u can't buy my love/just take my hand"") The only exceptions to this are ""Stand"" and the sinister, stalker theme song ""Haunted."" Ironically, these two are the best of this album.
""0304"" may prove to be a mixed blessing for Jewel. It's catchy and danceable but essentially empty.

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B001237HCI,-1,-1,3,"So I approached Jewel's ""0304"" album with an open mind, knowing full well that the days of ""Who Will Save Your Soul"" are long behind us. It's not the out-right ""bad"" album that I had feared, but it's also not a ""classic"" by any stretch of the imagination.
""0304"" (14 tracks, 53 min.) starts of nicely with ""Stand"", with its light-beat dance rhythms. ""Run 2 U"" and ""Intuition"" follow along the same vein, and then it starts to set it: the songs all sound pretty much the same! Oh no! That's the trouble with an album that goes on WAY too long, it all starts sounding the same. Admittedly, there are a couple of outstanding tracks: the dramatic (and non-dance) ""Haunted"", and the name-dropping and culture-referencing ""America"".
Overall, this is an average, somewhat bland album. What surprises me is that in the liner notes, Jewel writes that this album is ""the first record I enjoy listening to"", which in a way is a put-down to all the fans that have loved her earlier albums.

Though I am not terribly in love with the whole album (it's sure more pop than most of her past efforts, and it has no shortage of 'catchy' tunes), the nonconventional lyrics are still there, at times, hiding disguised behind songs with teenage-like names, such as ""2 Find U"". The truth is that after the fact, the whole album makes you think twice as to her original purpose with ""Intuition"", the song/video that has stigmatized her so much.
But yes!

AADJXNY9HSKJF,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"This is a very cool album. Jewel has been taking a lot of heat for it and I don't really see what all of the fuss is about. It's not really all that different from the direction she had seemed to be taking with ""This Way."" Remember ""Serve the Ego?"" Remember ""Standing Still?"" The tracks from ""0304"" aren't all that different. The production is just taken up a notch. Obviously Jewel has done something right because of the first single ""Intuition"" has become her biggest radio hit since ""Hands"" back in '98.
""Inuition"" is definitely one of the star tracks of the album. Jewel has taken her lyrics and put them to a great pop beat and sound. ""Run 2 U"" is a stand-out also and is very catchy. My personal favorite *at least as of now* is ""Fragile Heart."" It's a light-hearted ballad and would make a great single. This is the Jewel I love! *who couldn't love that whistle?* ""Leave the Lights On"" and ""Haunted"" are the most unique songs and have a love/hate style about them. If you liked ""Standing still"" from ""This Way"" then you'll probably like ""Doin' Fine."" ""Yes U Can"" is definitely another potential single. Like ""Intuition,"" it's a dance track *originally written for Santana* but I'm glad Jewel got to do it. This would be a great club single. ""2 Become 1"" is a love song similar to the title track from ""This Way."" It's a beautiful song as are all of Jewel's love songs. ""Yes U Can"" is another fun dance track. ""America"" is a more serious track with some ear-catching lyrics.
Don't knock Jewel for wanting to lighten up and experiment with her music. True fans would respect her for wanting to try different styles. And who cares about her image change? So she's wearing a dress...get over it! She's hot, let her have her fun. The music's great. As far as her comparisons to the newly reformed teen divas, Jewel's talent in all its aspects *vocals, lyrics, song-writing*  makes them look like Milli Vanilli wannabes.

AQ75S7221N12Z,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"Overall this is a good album, not superb or great, but very good. INTUITION the single is excellent, and the remix CD Single is also recommended. Being at the top of the dance chart means the majority think the same way.
The other cuts such as ""Stand"" and ""America"" are also very good.
For those that think (or don't think at all), that this is a ""sudden"" change obviously have not heard 'Serve The Ego' or its remixes from about a year ago. Another dance chart topper, this album CONTINUES the trend that was already beginning on her last album. Check out the ""Serve The Ego"" mixes, those are excellent.
I love to hear people say ""she sold out"", ""she has changed"" and other assorted basic critical comments. Does that sound familiar? Remember the Bob Dylan as he went electric? The Beatles going Sgt Pepper? Sheena Easton doing ""Strut"". Are we saying Madonna did not change???Toni Braxton? The list goes on and on. Even Nsync changed! Those who refuse to change or cannot accept change are living in the past.
I can accept opinions of those who just don't like the music, that is fine, ok, and thats an example of how people have differing tastes, but just to say 'Sell out sell out"" to me  means  ""Grow...change..that is life"". The only acts and artists that sound the same always are at oldie shows. I applaud her willingness to try to stretch her considerable range and talent. Its still there and shows on this CD,
The album is good, has a few outstanding songs, 1 great song in ""Intuition"", and is a 3 to 4 star CD.  Its is not ""Hands"" or ""Pieces of You"" but is not supposed to be. I think its worth a listen, and the opinion of how good it is is yours. Do not be steered by people who do not like change. Treat it as a ""new"" sound and listen. Its your money, and the choice is yours. Like art, there is no ""absolute"" just opinions. Good Listening!","Overall this is a good album , not superb or great , but very good .

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B001237HCI,1,1,5,"Enough with the negative reviews on this cd. It's too different for the hardcore fans, etc., etc. It's too much like Christina Aguilera or Britany Spears, which is inaccurrate. You know, there was a time when a female artist could jump genres of music and receive accolades instead of dismissals. Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner, Cher, Madonna, Annie Lennox, Sinead O'Connor--all were able to shift gears musically, and to me that's a sign of talent, not selling out. Sure, Jewel is finely airbrushed on the cover, the titles are written like Prince tunes (U & Me= Love, Run 2 U, Yes U Can), and the songs are polished to fine pop bliss. I, for one, find this cd to be one of Jewel's finest. She forgoes all the pseudo-serious folk preaching and gets down to business with a cd filled with upbeat tracks instead of her serious ballads. However, she is still writing about serious topics such as social issues in ""Stand"" and ""America"" along with other familiar themes of love such as ""Run 2 U"", ""Fragile Heart"" and ""2 Become 1"". She also deals with letting go and trying new things such as the first single ""Intuition"", which probably flew over most Jewel fans' heads. She even deals with lust on ""Sweet Temptation"", ""U & Me= Love"" and ""Yes U Can"". In fact, there are a number of hits on this disc: ""Stand"", ""Run 2 U"", ""Intuition"", ""Leave The Lights On"", ""2 Find U"", ""Fragile Heart"", ""Sweet Temptation"", ""Yes U Can"", ""America"" & ""Becoming"". The only True miss is the overlong ""Haunted"", which seemed out of place. This new direction is great--a breath of fresh air for Jewel. She sounds like she's having fun and the music represents that spirit. Too many reviewers are taking this cd too seriously.

Granted, this isn't the out-and-out club record that some seem to be mistaking it for--it's not even nearly as cutting edge as the forward-thinking remixes of 'Serve The Ego' that she so effortlessly breezed through.

First single 'Intuition' hints at things to come throughout the set, with a helping hand from Shakira producer Lester Mendez.  'Stand', 'Fragile Heart' and the future club smash 'Run 2 U' all bounce along with enough addictive melodies to forgive the singer for her still overwrought lyrical approach.

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B001237HCI,-1,-1,2,"For some reason, all of Jewel's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews. I actually liked her first three albums, but I wish I could say the same for her latest album, 0304.
I have no idea what's going on with this album. It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying, because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club. Such tracks include ""Run 2 U"" and especially the leadoff single, the R&B-ish ""Intuition"". The music on these songs isn't bad, but it just doesn't sound like Jewel. If she's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once, it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example.
And when I listened to the rest of tracks on here, I noticed they don't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other, thus making you almost wonder if you're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album. ""Becoming"" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first: you or Jewel, and I don't know what possessed her to come up with ""Haunted"". ""2 Find U"" is okay, but I liked it better the first time I heard it, when it was called ""Standing Still"" (or the second time, when it was called ""This Way"").
Another problem here is the lyrics. Songs like ""Fragile Heart"" and especially ""U & Me = Love"" could have been rewritten a few times. I don't know how a party joint got on this album, but ""Yes U Can"" deserves some serious fast-forward button pushing. And can anyone make any sense out of ""Stand""?
I don't know what Jewel was trying to do here, because the album is 54 minutes of confusion. Even the album title is confusing, considering it came out on 0603. Maybe that's not what it means, but regardless, Jewel dropped a major brick with this album. Hopefully she'll realize this was a mistake and come back to Earth for her next album.","For some reason , all of Jewel 's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews .

It's not a sell out either, since this music isn't popular like it was a few years ago. Not to say it's bad by any means. The best track for me is ""2 Find U"", a nice love song. ""Run 2 U"" is another favorite. ""Leave The Lights On"" has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado. ""Haunted"" is another great track here. ""2 Become 1"" is a great love song. The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow's second album, picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics, and including odd pop-culture references and name-dropping along the songs.

INTUITION is that cool top 30 hit you've heard lately. Read the lyrics. It's classic Jewel. (I love Ms. J's big butt is boss-who do you think this is about :) LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON is a cool jazz-infused song. Ooh so good and Jewel-like! 2 FIND U is a beautiful poetic ballad.

DOIN' FINE is a cool upbeat dance record that uses the guitar in a really odd that's different and very interesting. 2 BECOME 1 is an excellent song very beautiful even better done live acoustic but excellent on the album; almost a sequel to 2 FIND U. HAUNTED is easily the coolest song she's ever written. It's truly haunting. I feel like I'm stalking Jewel as I hear it and I feel bad for her, but I can't help myself. SWEET TEMPTATION is a really excellent track, more a rock 'n roll record than a dance record. YES U CAN is a cool upbeat rock record she originally wrote for Santana but he decided not to keep. I'm glad he didn't, her performance is great. Such a cool song! YOU & ME=LOVE is another cool upbeat song. The title is the theme of the song. AMERICA is a thought-provoking dance record about what we do in America, whether it be good things or bad things. She mentions plenty of both, and quite skillfully. BECOMING is a great ballad about Jewel becoming, as she constantly becoming other things. She is young, and she is still a work in progress, and she intends to keep acknowledging that truth.

A1XPTVJC8OMM3I,B001237HCI,1,1,4,"There's gonna be some mighty fierce debating going on about this album! The most important thing is to keep an open mind. Indeed, Jewel has traded in her acoustic guitar for a new dance floor sound. Indeed, she looks like an 80's Cyndi Lauper on the cd cover. Yet, the biggest thing Jewel has NOT done is sell out. She may look and sound different, but Jewel has remained True to her heart. She has proven that one doesn't need an acoustic guitar to make meaningful music. At the same time, she proves that rhythmic music can be very meaningful as well. Anyone who has listened to the lyrics of 'Intuition' carefully has already figured this out. Jewel is mocking commercialism and materialism! Or, making political and societal statements (if you will). Is this really so different from what she has done in the past? The 'Intuition' video is the biggest mockery of all! The video displays Jewel: The Actress. The songs 'U & Me = Love' and '2 Become 1' follow, lyrically, in the tradition of Jewel's 1996 mega hit 'You were meant for me.' 'America' is yet another song where Jewel discusses the many aspects of American society and makes poilitcal statements. Gosh, this sounds like the same girl to me! Although, despite keeping her lyrics True to heart, the dance beats heard throughout make this cd Jewel's most fun project to date. Heck, it's dance music! Meaningful lyrics or not, it's still fun to listen to! Be sure to listen to the lyrics of each song carefully. You'll discover that Jewel has not, in any way, created fluffy, mindless pop (which some people are accussing her of doing). It's rare to find dance music with a purpose beyond just making people feel energized and relaxed. This album proves that the very essence of Jewel will never change (even though the music has).","There 's gon na be some mighty fierce debating going on about this album !

The combo of songs on this compilation will re-introduce the delicate vocal sound of JEWEL to a new target audience. All the compositions from 0304 are lyrically intelligent as all of her prior work, yet the fresh approach in production (making her sound at times like a reincarnation of WILSON PHILLIPS) will surely place JEWEL back on the top 40 charts.

Yes, I also didn't realize that this album, These Streets, was released over a year ago, but I'm glad I finally discovered it.

Most people are probably only familiar with ""New Shoes"", but there are plenty of other highlights as well, like ""Last Request"" and the title track. There are also some good acoustic selections, whether it be piano (""Autumn"") or guitar (""White Lies""). And ""Jenny Don't Be Hasty"" has some pretty interesting lyrics.

Even though the second (acoustic) version of ""Last Request"" (the hidden track after the hidden track) is unnecessary, Paolo Nutini still has the skills, so you shouldn't mind taking a drive down these streets.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00123BCKQ,1,1,5,"Paolo Nutini makes a huge splash with his debut album, These Streets. Paolo displays a natural talent for singing and songwriting; and his voice is rich and full of masculine warmth. Just one listen to this CD proves it!

The track set begins with ""Jenny Don't Be Hasty."" Paolo sings with the style of a seasoned pro; this number about a woman he wants makes a strong start for this album! The electric guitar, drums and percussion make a good musical arrangement. ""Last Request,"" another highlight of this fantastic album; lets Paolo sing with great sensitivity of how he wants one last time alone with a woman who doesn't love him anymore. The melody charms me with its beauty; and I predict that you will enjoy ""Last Request"" very, very much.

""These Streets,"" the title track of this album, begins with some pretty awesome guitar; and when Paolo comes in this number takes off like a jet! Paolo laments losing his childhood because in retrospect he realizes things were simpler for him back then. The guitar works wonders for this number; and the guitar alone with Paolo's voice makes ""These Streets"" a True masterpiece!

""White Lies"" has another beautiful arrangement for the guitar; and ""Loving You"" lets Paolo sing happily of finding his one True love. Paolo also shows off his wide vocal range, sometimes singing a few words in Falsetto--flawless!

The album ends with ""Alloway Grove."" This number starts with the drums and guitar; and when Paolo comes in he sings this perfectly! Paolo sings of his disappointment that the girl he loves is no longer there for him. The upbeat melody belies the sadness of the lyrics; but it all works well for Paolo and his musicians. The lengthy number works well.

The liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs except for some of the lyrics to ""Alloway Grove;"" and the artwork impresses me. We get some good shots of Paolo, too.

Paolo Nutini's first album sounds like a tour de force of a very seasoned talent--which is truly phenomenal since he's still rather young and this is only his first CD. I highly recommend this CD for fans of comparatively mellow rock and pop vocals.

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00123G6YI,1,1,4,"The son of a Kentucky musician whose own Nashville dreams never came True, John Michael Montgomery kept a bit of his daddy's hometown grit, even as he put together an impressive string of Nashville-produced hit albums and singles. This generous compilation offers twenty tracks, and collects nearly every significant hit single that Montgomery's had in his twelve year recording career.

Montgomery's first hits, the ballads ""Life's a Dance"" and ""I Love the Way You Love Me,"" had a middle-of-the-road sweetness that hit an emotional chord with both record buyers and award givers -- the second single was the ACM song-of-the-year for 1993. The love songs continued in 1994 with, ""I Swear,"" as did the awards (ACM song-of-the-year and single-of-the-year). As with most of Montgomery's ballads, the country flavor is to be found almost entirely in his vocals. There's a hint of steel, but the drums-guitars-bass-keyboard backing could just as easily host a pop vocalist (in fact, the song was covered by the R&B group All-4-One and netted a grammy). It's the slight edge in Montgomery's voice, the phrasings, and the down-home sentimentality of the lyrics that brings his slow songs into the country arena.

Later in 1994 his singles began to capitalize on Montgomery's uptempo numbers, charting with the rowdy country-rocker ""Be My Baby Tonight"" and the mid-tempo ""If You've Got Love."" Both tracks kick up the twangy guitars and fiddle of a honky-tonk bred backing. His releases continued mix ballads and up-tempo tunes, including the lightning-quick auctioneer's cadence of ""Sold (The Grundy Country Auction Incident)"" and the contemplation of his father's death, ""I Miss You a Little."" The latter, unfortunately, is missing from this collection.

By 1996 Montgomery was mostly charting ballads, variously edging more towards the center and bringing a bigger dose of his country sound down-tempo. ""Angel in My Eyes"" is more contemporary pop than country, but 1998's ""Cover You in Kisses"" has a superb melody anchored by a strong underline of steel and fiddle. Montgomery's last #1 single, 2000's ""The Little Girl"" features Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski on harmony vocals.

In addition to seven #1s (seventeen top-5s!), this collection adds ""'Til Nothing Comes Between Us"" from the ""Pictures"" album, and a pair of newly recorded tracks: the waltz-time generation gap tale ""Cool,"" and the romantic ""One Less Day."" This is a terrific overview and introduction to Montgomery's hitmaking career. Though it's missing the top-5 ""Cowboy Love"" and top-10 ""I Miss You a Little,"" it's probably the more complete pick over his 1997 ""Greatest Hits"" LP.","The son of a Kentucky musician whose own Nashville dreams never came True , John Michael Montgomery kept a bit of his daddy 's hometown grit , even as he put together an impressive string of Nashville - produced hit albums and singles .

A1JMR6MVOIC38K,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Cher's follow-up release to her blockbuster album ""Believe"" was ""Living Proof.""  It is another album in the dance/club music vein, though it is a darker and much more cynical collection than ""Believe.""  Cher pulls it off beautifully though.

Right before this album came out, 9/11 happened.  Cher dedicates the tribute song ""A Song For the Lonely"" to the ""Courageous People of New York"" who endured through the horrible event. When I last saw her in concert (Farewell Tour, 2005, Glendale AZ) and this video was shown in the ampitheater, I was struck by the WTC symbolism and how moving the song was.  This CD has a link to the video and it is definitely worth watching.

I think ""Believe"" was a much-more commercially viable disc than ""Living Proof,"" though I think that ""Living Proof"" is a more powerful recording. It also took me a few listenings for me to really start to like it.  It's packed with great songs.  I always thought that Diane Warren's ""Body to Body, Heart to Heart"" should have been released as a single.

The record company antics of releasing different versions of the disc in the U.S. and Europe are a bit tiresome: the European versions contained additional songs and short-changed U.S. fans.  The same company did the same thing with the ""It's A Man's World"" disc in the mid-90s.  It's all about the bucks, I know, but enough is enough.","Cher 's follow - up release to her blockbuster album "" Believe "" was "" Living Proof .

AE42JLYPXUI45,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"In late 2001, Cher had released, yet, another album. No, this one is not a compilation; it is a studio recorded album. No, you did not read this statement wrong. This album is, indeed, another studio recorded album for Cher. The album is entitled, LIVING PROOF, and is her best album since that of  1998's BELIEVE. The album is jam packed with great songs, including four hit singles that were released. Read on to find out more.

SONG FOR THE LONELY

  The first single from the album. When I first heard this song, I was really amazed. I could not believe how incredible this song was. The lyrics are so strong and motivating, as Cher's voice is strong and powerful. I strongly recommend that you all listen to this song first because 1) It is the first song on the album, and 2) Cher has dedicated this song to, and I quote from her album thanks, ""...The courageous people of New York, Mayor Gulianni, Governor Pataki, and my friend Liz...""

A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG

  The third single from the album. This is a song that would be most popular on the dance floors at clubs and other get-together parties. This is definitely a kick-a** tune.

ALIVE AGAIN

  The fourth & final single from the album. Awesome tune.

THE MUSIC'S NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU

  The second single from the album. ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"" is not the only song that should be played in clubs; this song would also fit into that of clubs, where people can immediately get their groove on. This song has an edgier groove for anyone who wants to shake their a** on the dance floor.

RAIN, RAIN

  Not bad.

REAL LOVE

  Not bad.

LOVE SO HIGH

  Incredible

BODY TO BODY, HEART TO HEART

  Diane Warren has written so many songs for so many solo artists since I can remember. She has written such songs as, ""Who Will You Run To"" for Heart, ""Love Can Move Mountains"" for Celine Dion, & ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" for Cher. This was another one of Diane Warren's songs and Cher was happy enough to grace Diane's lyrics with her music and voice.

LOVE IS A LONELY PLACE WITHOUT YOU

  Great.

LOVE ONE ANOTHER

  Back in 2000, when Amber released her self-titled album, she had originally recorded this song. Cher took the courage to cover the song. The song is amazing in every way and I think Amber would be most proud of this version, even though her version kicked a** as well. If you listen to both versions, you'll notice that Cher had re-written the second verse for her version, as well as re-writing the last two lines of the song's bridge.

WHEN YOU WALK AWAY

  Not bad.

WHEN THE MONEY'S GONE

  Not bad.

  This is an album that I have enjoyed from start to finish and I do encourage each and everyone of you, who have not yet heard this album, to buy it and listen to it. I guarantee you all that you will enjoy every song on this album from start to finish. If you do not like it, than I've done my part, while receiving the wrong response.","In late 2001 , Cher had released , yet , another album . No , this one is not a compilation ; it is a studio recorded album . No , you did not read this statement wrong . This album is , indeed , another studio recorded album for Cher . The album is entitled , LIVING PROOF , and is her best album since that of   1998 's BELIEVE . The album is jam packed with great songs , including four hit singles that were released . Read on to find out more . SONG FOR THE LONELY The first single from the album . When I first heard this song , I was really amazed . I could not believe how incredible this song was . The lyrics are so strong and motivating , as Cher 's voice is strong and powerful . I strongly recommend that you all listen to this song first because 1 ) It is the first song on the album , and 2 ) Cher has dedicated this song to , and I quote from her album thanks , "" ... The courageous people of New York , Mayor Gulianni , Governor Pataki , and my friend Liz ... "" 

 A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG 

   The third single from the album . This is a song that would be most popular on the dance floors at clubs and other get - together parties . This is definitely a kick - a * * tune . ALIVE AGAIN 

   The fourth & final single from the album . Awesome tune . NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU The second single from the album . "" A Different Kind Of Love Song "" is not the only song that should be played in clubs ; this song would also fit into that of clubs , where people can immediately get their groove on . This song has an edgier groove for anyone who wants to shake their a * * on the dance floor . RAIN , RAIN 

   Not bad . REAL LOVE 

   Not bad . LOVE SO HIGH 

   Incredible 

 BODY TO BODY , HEART TO HEART 

   Diane Warren has written so many songs for so many solo artists since I can remember . She has written such songs as , "" Who Will You Run To "" for Heart , "" Love Can Move Mountains "" for Celine Dion , & "" If I Could Turn Back Time "" for Cher . This was another one of Diane Warren 's songs and Cher was happy enough to grace Diane 's lyrics with her music and voice . LOVE IS A LONELY PLACE WITHOUT YOU 

   Great . LOVE ONE ANOTHER 

   Back in 2000 , when Amber released her self - titled album , she had originally recorded this song . Cher took the courage to cover the song . The song is amazing in every way and I think Amber would be most proud of this version , even though her version kicked a * * as well . If you listen to both versions , you 'll notice that Cher had re - written the second verse for her version , as well as re - writing the last two lines of the song 's bridge . WHEN YOU WALK AWAY 

   Not bad . WHEN THE MONEY 'S GONE 

   Not bad . This is an album that I have enjoyed from start to finish and I do encourage each and everyone of you , who have not yet heard this album , to buy it and listen to it . I guarantee you all that you will enjoy every song on this album from start to finish . If you do not like it , than I 've done my part , while receiving the wrong response ."
A1XFNWGTPMG1AE,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Cher's last Long Play effort would be consider her most danceable to date.  Every track on this album is upbeat, so if you're looking for ballads forget about it.  The success of ""Believe"" directed this album to this music style.  To start things up the leading US single ""Song For The Lonely"" is an anthem dedicated to the people of NYC or anyone who ever felt lonely, the lyrcis on this song are really strong, but, the strong resemblence to ""Believe"" make this song sound a little bit dated.  The second single in the US ""A Different Kind Of LOve Song"" is another strong lyric song, with great definition, and more innovative beats than the first, one of the best tracks of the album.  ""Alive Again"" tranceable, cheesy lyrics, but understandable, the second single overseas, not a great result.  ""The Music's Not Good Without You"" this is the first single overseas, has an old feeling to it, dedicated secretly to Sonny, great deep lyrics, sad sounding, melancolic, great results, ""Rain Rain"", the more midtempo of the album, great feelin' put in this, ""Real Love"" the distortion of Cher's voice is overused here, not bad, but not great. ""Love So High"" filler, but it's listeneable, ""Body To Body, Heart..."" similar to Dove D LAmore, so you can tell, ""Love One Another"" cover of Amber's original song, this album do have strong message, and great beat, could easily be taken into your mind. ""When The Money's Gone"" well, last single release, great dance tune, but the message is a little anoying.  In conclution, this album is danceable, will make you stomp your feet, but, don't expect, some songs to deliver the full Cher we are used too, although the songs here were not promoted well, this album is one of Cher most easy to listen to.","Cher 's last Long Play effort would be consider her most danceable to date .

A2JAKHFYI88ZX0,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"This album was released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. The main difference is the US version has a track called ""When You Walk Away"", and the UK/Canadian printings have a great song called ""You Take It All"" instead of ""When You Walk Away"", and vice versa for the US. LIVING PROOF is a great album that builds on the strength of BELIEVE, however this album never really lived to its potential, it didn't catch on as much as BELIEVE did to listeners. ""Song For The Lonely"" was a song that really resonated with a lot of people, with it's universal theme. In fact, a lot of the songs were like the ones on BELIEVE, with a message of strength and survival through life's difficult stages. As a whole, this album is better than BELIEVE. The only tracks I could have done without is the R&B tinged ""Rain Rain"" and the Diane Warren latin infused ""Body To Body, Heart To Heart"". The rest of the album is just great. I actually like Cher's version of Amber's ""Love One Another"", more than Amber's version. ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"" is like an epic ballad dance song, should have been a single. ""Real Love"" is a really funky Daft Punk sounding song, very european. ""Alive Again"" and ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"" are other highlights, with great positive messages. Other highlights include ""You Take It All"" (one of the best on the album) and ""When The Money's Gone"". Overall a really strong album from Cher! Can't wait to see what she does next.","This album was released in the UK and Canada in late 2001 , and in the US in early 2002 .

A3RC3AK8UN89I9,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Cher's newest offering is 2001's LIVING PROOF, this is the version that was released in the UK before the US got a copy. The UK version features ""You Take It All"", which in my opinion, is the best track of the album. Instead the US version has ""When You Walk Away"", which is not available on this UK version. Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength, like ""Alive Again"", ""Song For The Lonely"", ""Love One Another"", which all have messages of love and acceptance and moving on. Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"". The only songs I couldn't get into are the latin influenced ""Body To Body, Heart To Heart"", and ""Rain, Rain"". The rest of the tracks are winners, however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than ""When The Money's Gone"". I love her version of ""The Music's No Good Without You"", which was the first UK single, a nice dark trance type track. ""Real Love"" stands out, it has a nice Daft Punk-ish sound to it.

A1FML9FCUPV6TI,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"This is Cher's latest offering, first released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. UK and Canada had ""The Music's No Good Without You"" as a first single, whereas the US had ""A Song For The Lonely"" as the first single. LIVING PROOF continues the trend started by BELIEVE, her comeback album. ""A Song For The Lonely"" has a very upbeat message in it, many have used it to cope with the tragedies of 9-11, it's a universal song of acceptance that we've come to expect from Cher. There are other songs in this vein as well, ""Alive Again"" sort of mirrors the message of ""Believe"", just a song about survival and the desire to feel alive again. I really like ""Real Love"" which has a almost retro sound to it. The second single in the US is ""A Different Kind of Love Song"", which is also similar to ""A Song For The Lonely"", just a song of acceptance. She continues the trend with electronica. ""You Take It All"" is another highlight here. Other highlights include ""Rain, Rain"", and ""Love Is Lonely Place Without You"".

Okay, I'll stop reviewing her hair and get into the music!  This is truly evidence that rather than letting her more mature years slow her down, she continues developing.  Purists can say all they jolly well want about her voice quality deteriorating, but it just isn't so.  She's working with it and singing songs that reflect much of her perennial dramatic past, but mellower and upbeat.
No, there's no song titled ""Living Proof"" here.  But that title is a reference to the most outstanding song on the CD, ""A Different Kind Of Love Song"".

When I recently I learned Bread's music was spoke to my brother and sister-in-Law's deepest feelings for each other I sought out the ""Best of Bread"" album. I'm glad I did because it renewed my interest and reminded me how much I liked their music. ""If"" is one of several favorites on the ""best of"" album,  ""If"" spoke to my late teen romantic heart. Hearing it now helps remind me of the feeling of those formative years.

For my brother and sister-in-law ""If"" is more than other Bread songs they like ""their"" song. Just listening she can't help but let loose a tear. This makes it even more special to me and I'm certain it brings up special feelings for many.

Bread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I like how much their music means to friends and family just a bit older than me too.

I'm glad I gave them another look. It was well worth it and ""If"" is well worth 5 stars to me.

Hope this helps someone!","I liked Bread when I was young ( but often did n't admit it ) . Back then I took a little kidding for liking Bread when the "" cool "" people were into more edgy music .

Being in Canada, I bought the international version of Living Proof with 'You take it all' instead of 'When you walk away' last November from a local retailer. It has been in my stereo ever since! 'Real Love' 'Song for the Lonely' and 'When the money's gone' are the best of the best. High energy, fun, and radio-ready cuts to say the least. Cher has changed with the times, that is why she had such a long-standing career. Sometimes the computer effects on the tracks get to be a bit much, but I love every song nontheless. Be sure to listen to this disc from start to finish. I can honestly say that there is not one track that could be considered the 'worst' song on the album.

It also contains Cher's curious choice of song lyrics (she only wrote one of the songs) and her somewhat annoying singing voice (only topped (again! haha!!) by her annoying speaking voice and the insipid things she says).  The problem with that particular album is she sings in a language Hoppy can understand (English!).  This Japanese version is much much better.  I can't understand a thing the crone is saying, but I can still dance dance dance my pants off!

A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"Cher's new CD masters what ""Believe"" promised in 1998.  Cher's singing is confident and powerful; and the songs are consistently excellent.  This CD follows Cher's 2000 internet-only CD of self-penned tunes, ""not.commercial,"" that Cher released on her own Isis label.  For that CD, she lived in a castle in France and wrote some good songs like ""The Fall"" dedicated to Kurt Cobain and ""Sisters of Mercy"" that expressed her opinions on Catholic school.  While we don't see any saucy lyrics as Cher's classic, ""You're about as useless as Bob Dole's... arm,"" we do get the best commercial polish on ""Living Proof.""
""Song for the Lonely"" is a hot rocker, timely in the wake of the World Trade Towers & Pentagon terrorist acts, ""When heroes fall in love or war, they live forever.""  The drums fall hard on this comforting opener; and when Cher sings ""It'll be all right,"" her vocals fly angelically.  ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" is a cosmic rocker with a driving techno beat, ""We have living proof there's some kind of light that flows through everything.""  ""Alive Again"" is a pulsating midtempo song of renewal, ""I only want to learn to freeze the flame.""  Throbbing echo chamber vocals resound through the excellent ""The Music's No Good Without You.""  One of my favorite tracks, #1 on my own personal top ten, is ""Rain Rain,"" an addictive soulful track.  Keyboards and hot rhythm guitar lace ""Real Love,"" ""Time after time, you're bringing me up when I'm down.""  ""Love So High"" has more soaring vocals on this throbbing rocker.  ""Body to Body Heart to Heart"" is an amorous full-throated rocker where Cher uses a taste of Spanish guitar that she employed so prominently on one of my favorite songs from the ""not.commercial"" CD, the gorgeous ballad ""Still.""  ""I'll never love this way again,"" Cher sings passionately as the pace slows a tad on the beautiful ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You.""  ""Love One Another"" is great cosmic pop with pulsing rhythms, ""Try to understand, open up your heart, a fist is just a hand, it can come apart.""  Keyboards wash defiantly on ""When You Walk Away.""  The CD closes with Bruce Roberts' and Donna Weiss' ""When the Money's Gone,"" a funky rocker that is so endearing.  Cher's voice floats as she sings, ""What a fine life I give to you.""

So Cher shows in ""Living Proof"" that you don't mess with success and use the same formula as ""Believe"".  Though ""Believe"" was a good dance album, it also got tiring very quicky as does ""Living Proof"".
The songs are good dance songs my favorite is ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" which is definitely the strongest song on the album and should of been released as the first single in stead of the dismal been believed and done that before ""Song for the Lonely"".
However all the songs sound like the same vain of ""Believe"", and just get tired with the same dancebeats over and over.
I don't want to sound contradicting here, Cher is good, ""Living Proof"" is a well produced dance piece, however it would do better as a 12 inch vinyl single than 12 different songs.
The other strong cuts include ""Rain, Rain"" and ""Love One Another"" which sounds a lot like ""A Different Kind of Love Song"" which is a faster version of ""Song for the Lonely"" which is a slower version of ""Believe""....Get the picture?
There is no new trails taken here, no new ideas, or sounds.  Chers voice always the classic sound that Cher has is always in good form, and Cher is one of the best entertainers of all time, however ""Living Proof"" is just the same old ""Beliefs"".

Other note - worthy 's include the hot "" Body To Body "" , the 70 's feel of "" Love Is A Lonely Place "" , the anthemic "" Alive Again , "" a great cover of Amber 's "" Love One Another "" , and "" Song For The Lonely . "" 
 Acutally , the only cut that sounds like it should 've been on "" Believe "" is "" You Take It All . Simply put - she 's back If you do n't own anything else from Cher , this is it !

A3JAR8K4EF94ZO,B00123G5ZI,1,1,5,"It's clearly obvious that no one has ever transformed themselves more or been succesful for as long as the supreme diva herself, Cher.  One Word that means so much.  This latest cd is her best yet.  ""Living Proof"" is the most appropriate title fore Cher shows in this dance-ethrusted cd that she can take on anything in her career and that she is here to stay.
""Living Proof"" is defintely the best produced dance cd EVER, with the following tracks...
""The Music's No Good Without You"" ~ The First European single, and the most unlike Cher song on the cd.  I you didn't know it was Cher you wouldnt know who it was.
""Alive Again"" ~ Cher goes from super vocoded in track 1 to a super powerful voice in track 2.  So powerful that a radio station in Germany has chosen it for their Olympic theme song.
""Song for the Lonely"" ~ The first Amerian single and the most meaningful song is also very powerful and unlike Believe has no vocodor (cherbot) recrdings o her voice.
""Different Kind of Love Song"" ~ Cher said it herself...its ""Vocoded to DEATH!"" haha...its awesome super dancy..will be big in clubs
""Rain Rain"" ~ Smooth Ballad...cuts the dance theme a little,but still miraculousely is dancy?!?!?! Only cher!
""Love so High"" ~ Excellent song...has to be heard
""Body to Body, Heart to Heart"" ~ Kinda like Dov'e La'`more.  Very latin and very upbeat
""Love is a Lonely Place Without You"" ~ Great Vocals, Cher!! Super good song.
""Real Love"" ~ Kinda like Believe...very vocoded...excellent
""Love One Another ~ Remake of Amber's dance song...very good.  Cher's is far better
""You Take it All"" ~ Very slow yet very well produced
""When the Moneys Gone"" ~ Great way to end the cd..one of the best songs on Living Proof.

A3I7P0TSJHGOVK,B00123G5ZI,1,1,4,"Frankly, I expected nothing like this cd. Actually, I didn't know what to expect after ""Believe"". I was on of those that had a ""wee"" problem with Cher going 'dance'. I wanted another ""Heart Of Stone"" or ""It's A Man's World. Believe showed Cher in great vocal form from previous recordings. The songs suited her to a tee (with the exception of ""We All Sleep Alone"", a real nightmare!) and the production was quite good.
My big surprise was the amount of careful work that went into this followup. The only reason this cd doesn't rate a ""5"" in my opinion is that she could have done it entirely without vocoder effects and it would have still been great. After all, I buy her music to hear HER.
""Song For The Lonely"" will be as big, if not bigger, than Believe. And there are several potentials for Top 10 to follow. Check out the infectious ""Different Kind Of Love Song"", the haunting ""Rain Rain"", anthemic ""Alive Again"", the 70's  disco ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"", and a great cover of ""Love One Another"". This cd tops Believe without taking away from it. If you haven't got it yet, wait for the february release of the US version which will contain an additional track (13). Yep, she's back, big time!","Frankly , I expected nothing like this cd . Actually , I did n't know what to expect after "" Believe "" .

I was not willing to wait until spring of 2002 for the US release of ""Living Proof"". I was happy to shell out the big bucks for her new album. Needless to say, the results were positive. ""Living Proof"" is ten times better than ""Believe"". The material she chose to record is far better than most of the songs off its predecessor. Although I do think Cher overdoes it on the vocoder sounds on this cd, I was able to forgive her for that since every song on this cd is a winner in my book. I immediately fell in love with ""Alive Again"" which is one of my favorite tracks off this cd. I was completely surprised when I heard Cher cover one of my favorite songs from another dance diva Amber. Cher does a swell job at ""Love One Another"".

 ON Believe Cher seemed to be more passive to the producers. Her involvement on this cd is very evident. She is there for multiple background choruses, and works all the vocals superbly. It's great to hear a girl singer with a lower register, and a way with a lyric. The work is there and the power of the singer is up front. I personally find a few of the tracks her highest achieving artistially ever! ""When the Money's Gone"" is a wonderful rocking dance rock track that finds Cher earnestly questioning the fidelity of her partner when the riches fall! It is a terrific track. ""This is a song(for the lonely"" is an anthem dedicated to the Sept . 11th victims and families, and she shouts it in plaintive cry, in the feel of a real rocker. It is full of emotion and conviction.""Rain Rain"", has a hook that stays after one listen, and the depth that makes you glad you remembered it!
Cher's cover of Amber's hit, ""Love One Another"" does not become a brides-maid to Amber. She brings a low decible sincerity that only a mature woman can pull off. ""A different Kind of Love ""Song, is just that! AND....Cher universally dedicates it to everyone, acknowledging love in a universal way! Cher is no stranger to fame, and this cd will only add to her roster!!! I love it, and so will you.

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00123IAVK,1,1,5,"History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60's. Much of it heavily based in fact. Most of this is of the psychedelic rock scene of that city. But there were some important hybrids too. For Frisco it was Santana. For Oakland it was Tower Of Power. A multi racial band coming out of the same stew as the Santana Band and Sly & The Family Stone this was a band that,especially in the beginning were very much on what you might call the very live garage band type of funk. Based heavily in what James Brown was doing at the time,they had an approch that couldn't be more different if it tried.

  Right off the bat the album kicks off with ""Knock Yourself Out"". This along with the witty ""Social Lubrication"" and ""The Price"",""Back On The Streets Again"" and ""The Skunk,The Goose And The Fly"",with almost goofy lyrical exchanges are TOP before they were even closed to slick. The rhythm section is right out in your face,the horns are blaring right out and the vocals are as raw and unrefined as you'd hear on any Kool & The Gang and James Brown album you'd find during the period. Somehow or other though,there's a mild soulful gentleness to the whole thing. Especially as a number of these songs lead out with some mildly bluesy Hendrix type rock guitar riffs.

  The real break from the funk tradition this album tends to set is the closer ""Sparkling In The Sand"". This is a very slow 9+ minute ballad that has much more of a jazz flavor with more prominant reed solos than anything else. It's surprising with the amount of funk process activity taking place on both ends of the Bay Area in 1970-with Sly Stone,Santana,War and Tower Of Power here all making extremely important contributions,that the music didn't overburden itself before it really got going. It's a testement to the enduring power and stylistic elasticity of funk that that never happened. This and all of those bands prospered greatly during the era. And laid the groundwork for what is sometimes called ""united funk"".","History is littered with a lot of romantic talk of the bay area music scene of the late 60 's .

The only problem I'm having is trying to figure out exactly why this is considered a ""best of."" Quite frankly, each of their albums stand quite well on their own, and in many ways equals the overall quality of this collection. There are a few songs here that I personally would not have included, (""their rendition of ""El Paso"", for instance), while there are plenty of songs from each studio album whose inclusion would have been easily justified (""Wreck Your Life""'s ""W-I-F-E"" and ""The Other Shoe,"" and ""Too Far to Care""'s ""Streets Where I'm From"", for instance). Nevertheless, ""Hit By a Train"" is an entertaining listen from start to finish. In that sense, this is more of a sampler than a collection of their best hits.

Miller has a tendency toward song-title puns that don't do justice to the songs themselves (""Cryin' Drunk,"" ""Crash on the Barrelhead"" - not included here), but this only points out his self-consciously clever way with a phrase. The band has obviously mastered the two-step `train beat' (3 tracks here) and the hard-bouncing ""Texas shuffle"" (which accounts for eight of the CD's eighteen tracks), but it's Miller's lyrics that keep you coming back for more, even after repeated listens. Miller's albums as a solo artist certainly hold up well, but it's his work with Old 97's that is most effective, which is why this collection works as well as it does. How can you not love an album containing ""Barrier Reef,"" ""Lonely Holiday,"" ""Jagged"" and ""Victoria,"" all on the same disk? ""Hit By a Train"" encapsulates some of the band's best moments, and hardcore fans of the band will want this if only for the non-album tracks (the above-mentioned ""El Paso"" and ""Cryin' Drunk""), but casual fans would do well to continue exploring their catalog further.

A23I4TZSZYSY1Q,B00123KDBK,1,1,5,"A beautiful restoration with stunning bonus tracks of the strangely overlooked Peggy Lee masterpiece from 1974 capture the fascinating legendary lady in peak form, mesmerizing title song produced and arranged by Paul McCartney.  Fresh from a dramatic weight loss and looking like a million bucks, Peggy Lee was ready to go when she signed Atlantic Records to record a soulful set of great contemporary songs.  Peggy Lee went deep inside, laid down a stunning vocal on the great ""Let's Love"" which should have been a huge hit but shamefully received no airplay upon its release. Next is a spirited soulful version of Melissa Manchester's ""He Is The One"" with a thrilling background gospel chorus with Peggy leading the way with a superb vocal.  Sensuous and funky on a playful ""Easy Evil"", torchy and illuminating ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight"", clearly Miss Lee is in peak form and very inspired!  A fresh funky arrangement make evergreen ""Always"" a delight while ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" becomes a tour-de-force, making this the definitive version of this timeless soulful classic. Hot rhythm track sets gospel spiritual ""Sweet Lov'liness"" on fire while a haunting Peggy Lee original ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter"" is simply gorgeous.  Soulful seduction make ""Sweet Talk"" a quiet storm classic which should have been a huge hit and mesmerizing achingly gorgeous Henry Mancini ""Sometimes"" is a sentimental classic having a special feel all its own.  Bonus tracks are wonderful discoveries with ""I Am His Lady"" the best ever version of this soft-jazz treat.  A ragtime arrangement make the Peggy Lee original ""I Wanna Be Seduced"" great fun and another Peggy original ""The Nickel Ride"" is a stunning classic that is naked and haunting.  This unique original has Peggy brilliantly accompanied by piano only and the result is another great song that echos  Grammy Winner ""Is That All There Is?"". Peggy must have wondered ""Is That All There Is?"" when this great release was received with such shocking indifference, robbing public exposure to a great work and Peggy acclaim she clearly deserved. Closing is a great circus like arrangement for a stirring ""Let's Keep Dancing"" which was to be Peggy's last major studio production and a winner it is!  This great song featured in ""Sharky's Machine"" soundtrack should have been a big hit and would have been in better musical times than the musically directionless early eighties!.  Now if only Capitol Records would release the great 70's ""Where Did They Go"" and the classic ""Norma Delores Egstrom"", both featuring the iconic Peggy Lee in peak form, fans will be happy this legendary singer is finally given some justice for her great but sadly overlooked 70's work.  For those who enjoy great singers in a sublime setting in peak form, do not miss this classic collection, this level of greatness will never happen again...special Limited Numbered Edition & value will soar when no longer available...Thank You Peggy Lee for years of great entertainment and sublime vocals & classy lady RIP","A beautiful restoration with stunning bonus tracks of the strangely overlooked Peggy Lee masterpiece from 1974 capture the fascinating legendary lady in peak form , mesmerizing title song produced and arranged by Paul McCartney .

Peggy Lee went deep inside , laid down a stunning vocal on the great "" Let 's Love "" which should have been a huge hit but shamefully received no airplay upon its release . Next is a spirited soulful version of Melissa Manchester 's "" He Is The One "" with a thrilling background gospel chorus with Peggy leading the way with a superb vocal . Sensuous and funky on a playful "" Easy Evil "" , torchy and illuminating "" Do n't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight "" , clearly Miss Lee is in peak form and very inspired ! A fresh funky arrangement make evergreen "" Always "" a delight while "" You Make Me Feel Brand New "" becomes a tour - de - force , making this the definitive version of this timeless soulful classic . Hot rhythm track sets gospel spiritual "" Sweet Lov'liness "" on fire while a haunting Peggy Lee original "" The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter "" is simply gorgeous . Soulful seduction make "" Sweet Talk "" a quiet storm classic which should have been a huge hit and mesmerizing achingly gorgeous Henry Mancini "" Sometimes "" is a sentimental classic having a special feel all its own . Bonus tracks are wonderful discoveries with "" I Am His Lady "" the best ever version of this soft - jazz treat . A ragtime arrangement make the Peggy Lee original "" I Wanna Be Seduced "" great fun and another Peggy original "" The Nickel Ride "" is a stunning classic that is naked and haunting . This unique original has Peggy brilliantly accompanied by piano only and the result is another great song that echos   Grammy Winner "" Is That All There Is ? "" . Peggy must have wondered "" Is That All There Is ? "" when this great release was received with such shocking indifference , robbing public exposure to a great work and Peggy acclaim she clearly deserved . Closing is a great circus like arrangement for a stirring "" Let 's Keep Dancing "" which was to be Peggy 's last major studio production and a winner it is ! This great song featured in "" Sharky 's Machine "" soundtrack should have been a big hit and would have been in better musical times than the musically directionless early eighties ! . Now if only Capitol Records would release the great 70 's "" Where Did They Go "" and the classic "" Norma Delores Egstrom "" , both featuring the iconic Peggy Lee in peak form , fans will be happy this legendary singer is finally given some justice for her great but sadly overlooked 70 's work . For those who enjoy great singers in a sublime setting in peak form , do not miss this classic collection , this level of greatness will never happen again ... special Limited Numbered Edition & value will soar when no longer available ... Thank You Peggy Lee for years of great entertainment and sublime vocals & classy lady RIP"

Candlebox is one of those bands that defiantly jumped on the Grunge band-wagon that conquered the early 90s in Alternative Music. The only problem is that they weren't as good as the bands they were most likely influenced from. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, and Soundgarden were just so much better and created a legacy in the trail they left behind. Candlebox just sort of had a moment where people enjoyed the sound of Grunge so much they were desperate for more and they heard ""Far Behind"" and instantly called it worthy. You could arguably say Candlebox is a one hit wonder, I disagree with that statement but its understandable why others might think that. What's included on this best of is really the best of what they put out. Everything here is really all you need to hear to truly see what they had to offer to music.

While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic ""90 Degrees and Freezing"", a Motown-inspired, horn driven ""Come to Me Do"" and a catchy and powerful pop gem ""Feel"" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.
I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite ""King of Might Have Been"" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.
I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on ""XXX"". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on ""XXX"".
Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.
""Chicago XXX"" ""could have been a contender"" with a different approach to the CD's production.

A1TKJ3L7FMZ01Y,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,2,"I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue, but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right. Now this is not a comparison about old 70's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste, but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly. If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago, you might want to check this out, but I was dissapointed. There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album, but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs.  There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd.  I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on, but not that much.  I did not like the producer on this album.  Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards, drums, guitar, vocals etc that I felt cheated. I did not know who played on what track.  My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced.  It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious.  I don't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm, but it was way over the top!  The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance.  The back vocals on the song ""Caroline"" sounded like a straight keyboard sample.  Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop-machine?  They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it's painfully obvious.  I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person's voice.  Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with.  These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets.  I do not mind the loops, midi, sequencing, samples etc, cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster, and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine, but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed.","I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue , but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right .

A23Q1T4MXZHFM7,B00123IBSC,1,1,5,"April 2006 saw the two great surprises from two great Chicago bands. One is Survivor's Reach album after 18-year break. And the other is this one. Full-length new material release from Chicago. I am not sure under what counting method could this one be their thirtieth. Probably including compilations and Christmas albums. I lost track of Chicago since Night and Day album in mid 90s(22nd release). But that one is sort of tribute. So the last album I FEEL Chicago is Twenty One in 1991. Yeah indeed listening to XXX is like meeting a LONG LOST FRIEND.

FEEL the first single from this album is static at first but from the mid section it turns dynamic. Reminding me of the Chicago during ""18"" album.

KING OF MIGHT HAVE BEEN is tried-and-Trued style of Chicago ballad during 80s. WHY CAN'T WE tries duet but unmistakably typical of Chicago styled ballad. Most surprising one is 90 DEGREES AND FREEZING. Just like Earth Wind and Fire and groovy and I hope Maroon 5 cover this one. So thrilling and my best song of the year so far.

Verdict: My favorite band returns stronger than ever.

Rating: 95 out of 100. One of the finest comeback efforts.

A1EYSN1T55SV7U,B00123IBSC,1,1,4,"I love this band and have for nearly 25 years (since I was in junior high school in 1982--when ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"" hit the airwaves).  While most artists get some criticism from me if they have too many ballads, this is one band that has been above that because they do the ballad so well.  I love all of their ""second career"" stuff from the 1980s.  I also have gone back to visit their earliest stuff--including listening to and enjoying their debut ""Chicago Transit Authority"" album.  Suffice it to say, I am a fan of all eras of this band.

So where to place this comeback effort?  After listening to it numerous times, my conclusion is that it nearly stands up to previous material.  I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that a couple of the ballads are a bit sappy even for them, and for sure the song order is strange with having all ballads followed by all uptempo numbers.  I also see no point to having two versions of ""Feel"" on the album--just stick with the trademark horns version.  Still, I am overall very pleased with the release of this album.

""Feel"" is an enjoyable track (whichever version you listen too)--very familiar but with a sound of modern production.  Good single, although I don't think it did too well chart-wise.  Ballads like ""King of Might Have Been"" and ""Caroline"" would fit right on such Chicago albums as 17-21 with their beautiful vocals and overall melodic sound.  Even the guest vocals on ""Why Can't We"" and ""Love Will Come Back"" are somewhat enjoyable and an interesting direction to take.  ""Long Lost Friend"" is a bit sappy but for sure very pretty.

I agree with those who say the second half of the album comes as a nice surprise in returning to the ""roots"" of the band a bit.  ""90 Degrees and Freezing"" is a catchy, fun uptempo number, and ""Come To Me, Do"" is a vintage-sounding Robert Lamm-sung track.  ""Already Gone"" has some cool harmonies that are not so typically straight-ahead as so many Chicago melodies are.  ""Where Were You"", ""Lovin' Chains"", and ""Better"" are also refreshingly uptempo and a lot of fun to listen to.

Some have called this a ""safe"" Chicago album, and to a degree I agree with that.  Many of the ballads in the beginning certainly fall into a familiar territory we have heard before.  While I have never heard a note of it, I am further intrigued by people's descriptions of the unreleased ""Stone of Sisyphus"" album and would love to have it see the light of day.  I also think of such albums as the amazing one that Toto put out this year and wonder what a Chicago album made in the same vein (i.e., totally doing what they want to do instead of perhaps pining too hard for a return to radio single ""glory days"") might sound like.  All that being said, for me this is overall a very satisfying release.  I have enough criticism here with the song order and ""safeness"" of the album that I can't quite give it a 5-star rating, but it is close.  Call my rating 4 1/2 stars for an album that should be very satisfying to '80s Chicago fans and also to plenty of career-spanning fans of this legendary band.","I love this band and have for nearly 25 years ( since I was in junior high school in 1982 - -when "" Hard To Say I 'm Sorry "" hit the airwaves ) .

Hypnotic drum beats lead the charge on ""Feel."" A catchy melodic chorus and subtle guitar riffs will take you the rest of the way. Soulful and emotional vocals dominate the piano laden ballad ""King of Might Have Been."" You may make comparisons to ""Hard Habit to Break"" here, but the song does a great job of standing alone. It's the multi-part harmonies and warm brass that really draw you into ""Caroline."" When you read the lyrics the song seems a little cheesy, but when you here how Chicago presents it, it's quite encompassing. Rascal Flatts makes an appearance on the optimistic ballad ""Love Will Come Back."" ""90 Degrees and Freezing"" echoes the group's 80s high-end production and sound. ""Already Gone"" is loaded with plenty of pop-rock melodies and signature Chicago horns.

The Bad

I thought that the remixed version of ""Feel"" was unnecessary. I didn't really care for the blandness of ""Come to Me, Do"" either.

I really didn't expect this album to be so good. Chicago returns with their thirtieth album, after a ten year break, and shows that there's no rust on them.

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,3,"The one very noticeable feature of ""XXX"" is that Chicago seem frozen in time. To me, their last album was ""Twenty One"" back in 1991. ""XXX"" could easily be the follow up judging by the musical direction the band takes here. I'd say this album is most identical to Chicago 16 through 21. It has the streamlined, by the book, paint by numbers, manufactured syrupy saccharine assembly line power ballads and lite funk/jazz pieces you'd expect from 1980's era Chicago. What happened? It's as if the boys missed grunge/rap/hip-hop/hip-pop and have released an extremely American Idol friendly album.

That being said, the 12 songs are fairly homogenous and melodic. I don't hear any hits here because all the songs sound like they could be made by any MOR/AOR band right now. The guest musicians don't really add anything original to the Chicago sound. The horns seem more present with less keyboards. There isn't a truly awful song on ""XXX"", but it's just bland and banal pop, and nothing that could match Chicago 16-19. I don't believe ""XXX"" has anything that really resembles their 1970's output, which is a shame, because there are still fans waiting for Chicago to really kick out the jams like they used to and sideline this David Foster-cursed pop they've been producing for the past 24 years.

I also felt it a waste of space to have two versions of their first single ""Feel"". I listened to both and there wasn't any major difference between the two, so I'd go with the ""Hot Single Mix"" version.

It just seems to me that after nearly 40 years Chicago should be taking more chances with their music. They have absolutely nothing to lose at this point.","The one very noticeable feature of "" XXX "" is that Chicago seem frozen in time . To me , their last album was "" Twenty One "" back in 1991 .

The horns seem more present with less keyboards . There is n't a truly awful song on "" XXX "" , but it 's just bland and banal pop , and nothing that could match Chicago 16 - 19 . I do n't believe "" XXX "" has anything that really resembles their 1970 's output , which is a shame , because there are still fans waiting for Chicago to really kick out the jams like they used to and sideline this David Foster - cursed pop they 've been producing for the past 24 years . I also felt it a waste of space to have two versions of their first single "" Feel "" . I listened to both and there was n't any major difference between the two , so I 'd go with the "" Hot Single Mix "" version . It just seems to me that after nearly 40 years Chicago should be taking more chances with their music . They have absolutely nothing to lose at this point ."
A1PG0IQB3CP9II,B00123IBSC,1,1,5,"Have had this CD for less than 3 days, mind made up, best of this genre that I have heard this year.

Some die-hard Chi fans are berating this effort because it doesn't duplicate the sounds of CTA-II-V-VII-VII (Guercio) or the 17-21 (Foster) sounds.  I knew that Scheff and Champlin had the makings of giving this band new life, given the right production and management.

This band has finally, (under Jay DeMarcus production) with XXX, come into their own. Of note, checking the Rascall Flatts website, DeMarcus profile shows that Chicago and David Foster were two of his major influences.  It shows on this production.

The STRONG voices of Lamm, Champlin and Scheff, with the addition of TOTO members Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams, and the Rascal Flatts singers makes for as strong a vocal production they have done since Cetera's departure, breaking new ground for the band.  Instrumentally, the bands already strong skills are supplanted by  some of Nashville's best hired guns on guitar and drums.

Stylistically, they cover Trip-Hop-Pop, Power Ballads, Power Pop, New Country, Jazz Fusion, and Blues Rock.  This kind of diversity is unheard of in todays' music scene.

""Love Will Come Back"" with Rascal Flatts on vocals has the makings of a new country hit. Expect it to be the most added song to New Country playlists

""Caroline"" as the makings of a Power Pop anthem. Renegade rock stations stand the best chance of adding this to playlists.

""King of Might Have Been"" is another stand-out, Scheff power ballad.

""Feel"", the first single, has the best chance on the Adult Contemporary scene, with its updated beat and production values.

""90 Degrees and Freezing"" is a Lamm Jazz-Fusion piece which reminds you of the roots of the band back inthe 60's and early 70's. Maybe Jazz and Public stations will play this, too complex and tight for AAA, too hip and edgy for AC.

Other material is very good, not just ""filler"" but it's doubtful any of it will ever get airplay.

All in all, a very pleasant surprise to critical listeners.  No corners were cut on this production, and Warner/Rhino seems to be doing a good job at promoting it.  Just hope they can break them back into the spotlight.","Have had this CD for less than 3 days , mind made up , best of this genre that I have heard this year .

A4OSXRZR2BMX8,B00123IBSC,-1,-1,2,"(2 & 1/2 stars) In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure.  When I played trumpet back then, I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like ""Questions 67 and 68.""  I even enjoyed their more ""lite rock"" phase of the '80s.  But all of that was then and this is now.  Their new ""XXX"" is not so hot.  The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD, ""King of Might Have Been.""  It's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of ""You're The Inspiration.""  The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now.  ""Inspiration"" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera (no longer in the band); ""King"" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing.  The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus (who?); ""Inspiration"" was filled with shimmering, subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster.  ""King"" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune; ""Inspiration"" is a classic that was co-written by Cetera and Foster.  And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole.  It's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago's glory days, but the fact remains that it's a pale imitation.

A couple of thoughts regarding the CD's title.  First, the album count has gotten shakier over the years.  I don't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection (ex., ""Chicago Love Songs"") should count toward the total.  So really they are nowhere near 30 albums.  Second, the movie rating implications of ""XXX"" seem to have completely escaped them, as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art.","In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure .

A30RI0AJ4CQBU1,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"Randy Newman has written many brilliant songs, but SAIL AWAY may well be his finest album.  The 2-minute ""Political Science"" is certainly one of his greatest achievements, and the song is just as timely now as it was in 1973.  What makes the lyric so great is that it distills exactly what so many Americans think about the world.  It could be your friendly next-door neighbor, who seems like a perfectly nice person until you stumble into a  political discussion, and then you realize that he is an immoral monster.  It seems to me that ""Political Science"" should be the national anthem -- it's what large numbers of Americans  really think, and if they disagree then they should be forced to change the attitude as well as the policies before they change the song.

 I would like to include the entire lyric, but here is a sample:

 ""We give them money, but are they grateful, no they're spiteful and they're hateful.  They don't respect us, so let's surprise 'em, let's drop The Big One and pulverize 'em.""

 ""Boom goes London, and boom Pay-ree, more room for you and more room for me.  Every city the whole world round will just be another American town, oh how peaceful it will be, we'll set everybody free ... They all hate us anyhow, so let's drop The Big One now.""

 Is Randy Newman being too sarcastic, too harsh?  Just look at the anti-French movement among the republicanus neanderthalis recently -- ""nuke France and gimme some Freedom Fries with my burger"" -- and it seems clear that if anything he is too kind.

 Thank goodness for Randy Newman in times like these.  Along with Mose Allison, Stan Ridgway (see my 7/29/04 review of his brilliant latest, SNAKEBITE), and a few other mavericks, he understands America's dark side well enough to deflate its pretensions and hypocrisy  with humor, from the inside.","Randy Newman has written many brilliant songs , but SAIL AWAY may well be his finest album .

A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B00123KDR4,1,1,5,"After a few albums of searching for a sound, Newman experimented and finally found his sound on ""Sail Away"". He experimented so much, in fact, that ""Randy Newman Live"" was released as a stopgap in 1971;it also previewed 2 songs from this album in stripped-down piano-only versions. The ""alternate"" take of the title track on this reissue shows just how much Newman experimented. Pounding anthemic rhythyms gave way to more lush but not overstated arrangements. The final release was very much worth the wait. Newman brings orchestra back into the fray after completely abandoning it on ""12 Songs"" (most likely the abandonment came as a result of the use - and sometimes abuse - of orchestra on his debut album). Newman's piano and the orchestra meld wonderfully in the mix. Some of the arrangements are downright amazing (especially on the title track and ""He Gives Us All His Love""). Thematically the album could not be more diverse: God, death, politics, satire at a Swiftian level, sex, and success. Newman's ability to communicate cynical satire in a way that takes itself seriously without seeming self-righteous is displayed all over this album. When he's funny he's also profound. ""God's Song"" is hilarious while at the same time chilling. The same could be said for the sadly still all too relevant ""Political Science"". In the midst of these songs, the serious numbers are almost shocking. There probably hasn't been a more candid song about death and belief than ""Old Man"". Newman claims that audiences have walked out on this one, so he's stopped playing it. It's a great song, but yes, an absolute downer. ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" evokes the era the song is set in complete with breeze and front porch swing. ""Memo to My Son"" is an absolutely hilarious song about parenting; the character in the song promises to show his son how smart he is, and then rattles off clich after clich. ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" has become a very recognizable song, maybe one of Newman's best known songs (even for people who have no idea who Randy Newman is).
The bonus tracks on the reissue are interesting: ""Let It Shine"" is an upbeat and happy song more akin to Newman's movie soundtracks of late. It was written for a sitcom that apparently never aired, which explains the mood. ""Maybe I'm Doing it Wrong"" was included on ""Randy Newman Live""; this is the studio version complete with orchestration. The rest are demos of songs on ""Sail Away"". All are good tracks that complement the album well.
It's no surprise that this album is considered a classic by many critics. It's one of Newman's best, and one of his best-sellers. A good album to introduce someone to Newman's music. It was the first Newman album I heard, and I've been a voracious fan ever since.","After a few albums of searching for a sound , Newman experimented and finally found his sound on "" Sail Away "" .

At the time I was committed to the lush sounding music of Yes, Genesis, ELP, radiohead, etc. In comparison Randy Newman seemed like a scar to my prized music collection. Skip forward 5 years and I see how time has not only eased me into Newman's music but has made me an admirer. I have since realized that Newman stands among the great social satirists - and that's everybody, not just the singer-songwriters. Whether it's pollution/industrialization (Burn On), Religion (He Gives us All his love, God's Song), Death (Old Man), Fame (Lonely at the Top), Reminiscing (Dayton Ohio 1903, Last Night I had a Dream ), Perversion/Lust (Leave Your Hat on), American Ignorance/Racism (Sail Away) - Randy's craft is undeniably poinant, honest, and meticulous in it's disection of the human heart and our social practices.","I wrote a review for this album back in ' 03 .

Randy Newman really blew me away with these songs and ballads that hit the nail on the head with so much social and political commentary--not to mention satire--while managing to keep the tunes catchy and easy on the ear. Randy's use of major and minor keys enhances the songs all the more, especially in stellar numbers like ""Lonely at the Top"" which discusses quite frankly the price of celebrity; ""Sail Away"" about slavery in America from the point of view of a slave trader in Africa during the time of slavery; deep thoughts about God heard in both ""He Gives Us All His Love"" and ""God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind);"" the evils of potential nuclear warfare in ""Political Science"" while pointing out that the people dropping the bombs would be too ignorant to realize that they're ruining the world instead of making it a better place; sex in ""You Can Leave Your Hat On;"" ""Memo to My Son"" which shows how an older man really doesn't know all that much about life; the memorable ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" and more. Several of the songs are also quite amusing such as ""Memo to My Son"" and ""Political Science.""

Another thing I like about this edition of ""Sail Away"" is that we get some fine bonus tracks not found on the original CD release (and they certainly weren't on the original record album release, either). Listen for bonus tracks that are truly special like ""Let It Shine;"" a studio version of ""Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong;"" earlier renditions of ""Dayton, Ohio-1903"" and ""Sail Away"" as well as a demo of ""You can Leave Your Hat On.""

Written by Stevie Nicks, it became the only U.S. number one hit for the group, and even today, so many years later, it remains one of their best known songs. That first LP went it's own way years later, but was replaced with a CD copy. That one still surfaces in my untidy collection now and then, but when I saw the MP3 version here, it was an instant no brainer to grab it.

That classic classic disc was the number-one album on the charts for over 30 weeks, and Rolling Stone named ""Rumours"" as the 25th greatest album of all time. Today it ranks as the 10th best-selling album ever, with more than 40 million copies sold to date, and it features four top 10 singles. ""Rumors"" won the 1977 best album Grammy, and even 35 years later, it today remains remains the band's most successful effort, and ready to be shared with yet another generation.

These are the album tracks on the MP3 version here:

1. Second Hand News (LP Version); 2:53
2. Dreams (LP Version); 4:13
3. Never Going Back Again (LP Version); 2:15
4. Don't Stop (LP Version); 3:13
5. Go Your Own Way (LP Version); 3:35
6. Songbird (LP Version); 3:23
7. The Chain (LP Version); 4:31
8. You Make Loving Fun (LP Version); 3:29
9. I Don't Want To Know (LP Version); 3:15
10. Oh Daddy (LP Version); 3:57
11. Gold Dust Woman (LP Version); 5:02

For this listener, the only other song that I would have liked included here is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Springs-Live-Album-Version/dp/B0027FZ1X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Springs (Live Album Version)</a>&nbsp;as it was on the 2004 remastered reissue of the album, but luckily for us, it's still available here as a single. The quality of the recordings in this MP3 version are excellent, and the carryover from the LP versions are excellent. Listen to the vocals and instrumentation and you'll see for yourself.

For newcomers to Fleetwood Mac, the group consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. This was their eleventh studio album, and the recording sessions were marked by quite a bit of interpersonal strife between members of the group; and these experiences showed up in some of the album's lyrics. There are plenty of postings out there on the 'Net about the background behind this album, so I won't add to them here. Needless to say, ""Rumors""  remains the group's most successful effort, and for many it's the best album they made.

As a side note, the front cover of album featured a stylized shot of drummer Mick Fleetwood and vocalist Stevie Nicks dressed in her ""Rhiannon"" stage persona. The photograph was taken by Herbert Worthington, a friend of Stevie Nicks for over 30 years, and he and Stevie have collaborated on thousands of her best photographs over the years.

A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B00123NC8G,1,1,5,"""Rumours"" probably forever ruined the old tried and True maxim ""no dating in the band!"" Anyone fed that line today can simply respond, ""yeah, that so didn't work for Fleetwood Mac."" Arguably, dating, not to mention other things, in the band likely gave Fleetwood Mac an ineffable edge to help them attain unimaginable heights of popular music. An unanswerable question lingers as to how the album would have turned out had the band's relationships not gone sour. No one will ever know, of course. And that's very much OK. Because regardless of the emotional miasma, drama, drugs and whatever else went on, the late 1970s line up of the then nearly 10 year old Fleetwood Mac released a hugely acclaimed, and not often disputed, classic rock/pop album.

No doubt the ""real"" rumors in the press and subsequent documentaries detailing the band members' intimacies and the undoubtedly uncomfortable situation surrounding the recording of the album have contributed to this album's staying power. Everyone likes a good drama, after all, especially from a distance. This may have led to the creation of a new recording industy marketing strategy: take a collection of great songs, add interpersonal drama and a mega-hit will result. Struggling band managers may have started complaining ""Hey! Why is no one dating in this band?!? Come on! Start kissing!"" The trick, of course, remains writing a collection of great songs. And without the unquestionably great songs the drama behind the classic ""Rumours"" (spelled in the British manner for obvious reasons) probably wouldn't hold anyone's interest for too long. Many may have come to this album titillated by the drama or mesmerized by the sales figures and ended up staying for a direct emotional connection to the music.

And this much hyperbolized, mega-selling, nearly ubiquitous and archetypal album definitely includes plenty of great songs. They mostly speak for themselves. And surprisingly they don't sound bitter or vindictive apart from a lyric here and there. Almost anyone alive and within ear distance of rock and pop radio from 1977 to the present has very likely heard many of these songs willingly or unwillingly. The generations born after the 1960s probably didn't even know that they've actually heard most of this album until they put it on. Likely they repeat, ""Oh yeah, I've heard that one! That's Fleetwood Mac?"" throughout the first listen.

The album's galloping fade up beginning, ""Second Hand News,"" pulls in helpless cochleas with the distinctive layering of Lindsey Buckingham's vocals and the nearly addictive hooks and catches between the vocals. The brain almost doesn't have time to respond before the vocals begin. The beautiful contrast of ""Dreams"" lets hungry brains know that this album isn't blandly homogenous, but unpredictable and adventurous. And the folk-rocky mostly finger-picked acoustic ""Never Going Back Again"" just adds to the sonorous intrigue. ""Don't Stop"" picks up the pace again which continues through the grinding and angry-without-being-angry ""Go Your Own Way."" An interlude with ""Songbird"" (the only track recorded in an arena) sets the stage for the poignant and hopeful ""The Chain,"" one of the album's highlights. And that's only the first song of side two, in the language of 33 1/3 LPs. The rest of the album maintains the momentum, ending with the intense and brooding ""Gold Dust Woman,"" supposedly about the lure of the snort. Only ""I Don't Want To Know"" and ""Oh Daddy"" come close to subpar songs, but only in contrast with the rest of the album.

""Rumours"" will likely stand for quite some time as one of the pinnacles of 1970s rock/pop. It still hasn't gone away. Whether future generations not yet emerged from birth canals also fervently embrace it remains to be seen. But rumor has it that they just might.",""" Rumours "" probably forever ruined the old tried and True maxim "" no dating in the band !

A11GY1G10WSE8,B00123KEGO,1,1,5,"Rhino Records which has already released a dozen of Chicago's first albums as enhanced re-issues, has put out this 20 song offering.  Chicago : What's It Gonna Be Santa"" is a re-issue of ""Chicago XXV"" , a superb contemporary collection of Christmas classics with a Chicago original mixed in. This new release however, adds six newly recorded tracks to the 14 on Chicago XXV, making an already good thing even better.

The original selection of Christmas tunes is simply terrific. Chicago, following in the approach of ""Night and Day Big Band"" wherein the American supergroup re-arranged big band classics with an inventive and fresh variety of styles, tempos and grooves, takes a similar artistic path with their Christmas release.

Such holiday standards as ""White Christmas"" and ""The Christmas Song"" are done in an uptempo pop-funk style while ""Let It Snow!"" shows off Chicago's ability to really rock in a blues shuffle groove. Bill Champlin's soulful ""Have Yourself a Merry Little"" Christmas"" gives this moody classic a wonderfully original blues treatment. And, throughout the disc, the legendary Chicago horns play through trombonist Jimmy Pankow's melodic arrangements in their unique, warm and fat style.

The six new tracks really compliment the original CD, adding even more new styles and sounds. The disc's opener, Bobby Lamm's ""Winter Wonderland"" lays down an infectious rock groove with excellent vocal arrangements making great use of Chicago's arsenal of superb vocalists. Lead guitarist Keith Howland who covers some tunes in concert, shows off his first studio lead vocal with a quick tempo pop rock version of ""Jolly Old Saint Nicholas"". Bassist Jason Scheff's tenor has never sounded better than on ""This Christmas"", which has a wonderful 70's soul retro sound with the Chicago horns propelling the arrangement. Bill Champlin again shows why he is probably the greatest blue-eyed soul singer around with a gutsy, funky ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"". It sounds like an odd combination, but this track really works.

Following up to his terrific arrangement of ""Let It Snow!"", trumpeter Lee Loughnane pens a superb shuffle version of ""Sleigh Ride"". Again, he steps behind the microphone to tackle lead vocal duties and his deep voice, reminiscent of the late Terry Kath's depth and timbre lends itself perfectly to this classic.

""Chicago: What's It Gonna Be Santa"" is just terrific and certainly one of the most inventive and eclectic holiday CD's by any artist. There's something for everyone here to enjoy.

Their treatment of some of the classic Christmas songs is typical Chicago style.  Their muscial stylings are not at all hampered by limitations of the seasonal music as one reviewer suggests.  Track #18 ""A Childs Prayer"" is so sweetly performed.  You'd think a band like this wouldn't be able to play something like it without overdoing it.  The songs that Chicago chose to place on this album tell me that this is not just a performance album.  Rather, Christmas has a certain meaning to the members of Chicago.

I wonder if we realize that the John Williams ' , the Howard Shores and Alan Silvestris and Hans Zimmers of this age will be the classical music of the future ? Not that they are n't of that caliber NOW . The themes of Star Wars , Superman , Jaws , and others , are fast becoming synonymous with superheroes and scary movies . John Williams music is not only prolific and professional , it pierces to the heart of whatever the subject of the movie is . May his tribe increase ! May his catalog increase !

Highly recommend this CD plus Dwight's Used Records CD.

A1GIIPXONCEEHP,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight Yoakam is the reason I'm not embarrased to say I like country music.  When he broke onto the national scene with his debut album GUITARS, CADILLACS, ETC., ETC., he gave the country music establishment a much needed kick in the butt.  This twenty track collection hits most of the highlights of Yoakam's nearly two decades as a performer.  Starting with the Johnny Horton cover of ""Honky Tonk Man"" from his debut through two tracks from his 2003 release POPULATION: ME, Yoakam has had a major impact on country music.  If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to Rhino's 2002 box set REPRISE PLEASE BABY, this is a winner from beginning to end.  The only disappointment is that with a running time of just under 70 minutes, they could have added the only two top 10 singles missing from this set: ""Always Late With Your Kisses (from 1987's HILLBILLY DELUXE) and ""I Got You"" (from 1988's BUENAS NOCHES FROM A LONELY ROOM).  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  [2012 addendum:  The mp3 download version of this album has different cover art and eliminates the final two tracks from the 2003 album POPULATION ME, making this an all-Warner Bros. collection.]","Dwight Yoakam is the reason I 'm not embarrased to say I like country music .

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B00124BPBG,1,1,5,"Dwight's music is firmly rooted in traditional country, yet makes just enough concessions to progress so that it appeals to a modern generation. I guess a few purists will ignore him, but not many - there aren't many country singers now whose music owes so much to tradition while still selling in large quantities.

This compilation covers the whole of career to date, including eight tracks from his compilation of eighties hits (Just looking for a hit), eight tracks from his compilation of nineties hits (Last chance for 1,000 years), Things change (from A long way home), I want you to want me (from Tomorrow's sounds today) and two tracks from Population me (Late great golden state, Back of your hand). Thus, there is no new material here, but this compilation is the strongest single CD of Dwight's music so far released.

Inevitably, some classic songs have been omitted, one example being The heart that I own. Most of the songs here are originals but Dwight has recorded many fine covers, represented here by Little sister and Suspicious minds (both Elvis Presley) and Crazy little thing called love (Queen).

That has always been the case with love songs collections as well, because there are just so many of them that really don't seem to showcase enough material that really reflects the best of those love songs. That just isn't the case with Chicago, and their great music collections, because they definitely hit the nail of the head very, very well. Their music has endured extraordinarily well for over thirty-five years. There have been a few successful hits collections that really reflects Chicago, and this one is just no acception.

Chicago's 2005 Love Songs collection, consists of their most well recieved love songs from thier long-time career. The album conists of 18 tracks, and a couple of live rendidtions of classics never before released on any Chicago album as well. The collection contains a lot of great tracks inclding You're The Inspiration, Will You Still Love Me, Beginnings, as well as classics like Colour My World Hard Habit To Break, and Hard To Say I'm Sorry. The album also includes a couple of live recording with Phillip Bailey from Earth, Wind & Fire fame, on versions of If You Leave Me Now, and the Earth, Wind & Fire classic, After The Love Is Gone, which really sounds delightful and lively.

While there love songs albums that really don't sell very well, or just miss out on a lot of great songs, Chicago's Love Songs really displays very, very well within not just its price, but the vast number of classic Chicago tracks here. While many not at all be interested in this collection, it really is a good reflection of Chicago's best ballads.

A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B00124JDW4,1,1,4,"You know, I have been listening to a lot of 1965-67 Coltrane lately, and as essential as this is to my system, I need a break.

And maybe that was part of the idea Charles Lloyd had when he put out Forest Flower in 1967. Coltrane, Shepp, Taylor, The Black Panthers, protest vs. revolution. All this had taken over jazz that year. So Charles Lloyd comes along, and Forest Flower says--""This is all supposed to be fun. Chill for a second. We'll make the demonstration tomorrow. Let's play some tunes. RELAX!""

Not that these ""tunes"" leave subtance lacking. Lloyds sense of harmony and melody is increadible. Listening to is chord structres, I feel as if a Beatles or Brian Wilson has been channeled into a jazz man. His chords are so tuneful, this music is just a joy to listen to. Fresh and clean now as it was the day it was born.

I don't have to tell you about the skill of Keith Jarret or Jack Dejonette--there is a reason Miles inducted them--and proof is right here.

There was a lot of great jazz like this during this era, and unfortunately, it gets hidden in the shadow of giants like Coltrane, Miles, and Archie Shepp. Listen to them always, but dig on this sometimes, too.","You know , I have been listening to a lot of 1965 - 67 Coltrane lately , and as essential as this is to my system , I need a break .

Not only that but their are many excellent creative elements to this music as well that are even still ignored to this day for the same reason. So instead of concentrating on this album for what it isn't I'll focus this review on what it is. Throughout his career it's important to understand that George Benson was always on the cutting edge of vocal soul-pop/jazz. Even his earliest albums such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-George-Benson-Cookbook/dp/B0012GMW5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The George Benson Cookbook</a>&nbsp;featured Benson singing pop songs of the day so I am not going to criticize him on this album for doing what he'd always done. The main thing that makes the difference here is that George Benson is modernizing his poppy funk-jazz here for the mid 70's and in terms of music,song selections and just his renowned playing and singing this album certainly takes the cake there. It's not very long in it's entirety but the fairly long cuts that are here are all excellent each in different ways and aside from two one vocal number the instrumentals that dominate this recording give enough time for everyone,especially Benson to strech out instrumentally. No matter how many times I've heard the title song of this album,as far as I know one of only a select few instrumentals associated with Bobby Womack and aside from the rather pretty melody these days I actually really enjoy the bluesy sort of licks gets on the final verses of the song. After having heard the original of ""This Masquerade"" on Leon Russell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carney/dp/B000002U04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carney</a>&nbsp;it gives new meaning to this one. Leon's had a deep bayou flavor to it wheras George Bensosn presents the song as something of an American pop standard with the darkness of the melody baught up to the surface even more along with George's guitar-scating signiture almost making the song into a Benson original as opposed to an interpretation. In fact the only Benson original here is the instrumetal ""So This Is Love?"" which,much like ""Lady"" and the Jose Feliciano cover ""Affirmation"" all get a great balance between soul-jazz,funk and R&B with a tempo and rhythm that variates enough to keep it really interesting and involving. ""Six To Four"" is a great pop/funk that's a bit more uptempo and upbeat than the rest of the album and provides a nice change of pace. This album,all and all is not altogether as pop oriented as you might expect despite Claus Ogerman's flowery string arrangements and the upfront melodies and it actually serves it's purpose very well in that regard. There are plenty of very musical licks from George,Phil Upchurch and everyone else involved in the making of this album so it's not just a commercial triumph for Benson but he didn't totally compromise himself artistically either.","So much controversy has been generated regarding the creative merrit of this album that I truly believe it 's many enjoyable qualities have been forgotton .

A70YTUFJY5HXN,B00124DTBK,1,1,5,"This is still one of my favourite George Benson CDs. He won a 'Record of the Year' Grammy in 1976 for ""This Masquerade"" and rightly so. It's a fantastic vocal performance and the only vocal performance on this record.

He also won a 'Best Pop Instrumental Performance' Grammy that same year for ""Breezin'"" and this was the song I remember being all over the radio back then. But the guitar work on that particular song is nothing compared to what he throws down on the excellent (and proper jazz) songs, ""Affirmation"" and ""So This Is Love?""

But those two are just my favourites. All six tunes are great and this is another of those CDs I put on repeat anytime I play it. One listen is very rarely ever enough. Great production by the celebrated Tommy LiPuma with the orchestra arranged and conducted by the equally legendary Claus Ogerman. It rarely gets any better.

If war or flooding (or something equally disastrous) was on its way and I had the opportunity to take 100 CDs from my collection before I fled, this would definitely be one of them.","This is still one of my favourite George Benson CDs .

Over the years I have not listened to a lot of Jazz. I do appreciate a good jazz musician though, and Benson is one of them.
The first time I heard the CD, years ago when it first came out.
I could not believe my ears. The Sound was incredible and the guitar was exquisite. i Truely wish there were more jazz guitar players with this kind of talent. If there were I would probably listen to jazz as much as I do the blues.
George Benson has come up with a very fine album.
This is one of those albums you play at night while you are in bed and listening to music. I often listen to music at night and I love the mood this artist gets you into.
This Masquerade which was written by Leon Russel and was a major hit for Benson. This to me is the classic Jazz album of all time. This is the master with his grammy winning album. Need I say more?
The album is very good from the first note to the last note.

A2162NFEC5ZSDQ,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions. This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period! This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original. As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment! From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being ""Tommy"" by the Who and ""White"" album as it's called by the Beatles.

Although never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the ""British Invasion"" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc. This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of ""statement"" album. The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving. The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.

Barry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon/McCartney or Townshend/Entwhistle or Jaggar/Richards and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be. The epic title track shows their strong ability to ""story tell"" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean. Then you have songs with a country fell such as ""Marley Purt Drive"" to the folk sounding ""Melody Fair"" to the bouncy ""Suddenly"" amongst others. Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.

This album really showed that the ""boys"" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19. Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him. Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers. That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later.","This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions .

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>. There was orchestral rock before this masterpiece, and most rock albums using strings and horns from 1967 or 1968 sound nothing like Sgt. Pepper.

Odessa sure doesn't. Where Pepper was really, on one level, about applying any type of music to rock--making it a limitless expanse, Odessa is extremely consistent in sound.

Odessa shoots for an almost Spectorian, Wagnerian sense of orchestral pop. Huge strings, huge echo on the voices. Listen and the Beegees seem to sing out of the funnel center of the bigness they crate.

You'd better get used to this  sound if planning to sit through Odessa, because it runs through what was a double album. (Young? Call mom and she'll explain.) If you like this sound, it is like being stuck in orchestral mud honey. Just surrender and drown in it for the next seventy minutes. There are deviations: some silly sixties light pop, and some country tinged experiments that really work.

But what there is not is a grinding guitar like on Pepper's ""Getting Better,"" rock and roll stomp like""Good Morning."" You would barley know guitars plugged into amplifiers listening to Odessa.

I understand why Pepper is used as a bench mark, and in the sense that rock bands were more free to ""experiment,"" after Pepper, this is accurate.

A1XP7P3X9MRE5H,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"Odessa was the Bee Gees' fourth internationally released album, and their first double album. It was by far their most ambitious release and was had a red-flocked cover and included a poster and sticker. At a certain point the title ""Masterpeace"" was considered.

The band was still a 5-piece band at the beginning of the recordings, but before the release of the album in 1969, guitarist Vince Melouney had left the group.

Though not a direct concept album there are themes about the ship Odessa that runs though the songs. Apart from some long, mostly instrumental orchestral pieces, the music is not really that different from the group's previous releases.

To be regarded as a real classic I find the album too uneven, with too many average songs. There are of course a lot songs, too, that ranks with the very best of their early works.  I have always liked their music best without the big arrangements that often burdened good songs too much.

Simple songs with great melodies like, ""Sudddenly"", ""You'll Never See My Face Again"" and ""I Laugh in Your Face"" are still my favourites. I also used to like ""Marley Purt Drive"", but it seems the songs hasn't aged that well.

Among the classic ballads ""Lamplight"" is outstanding, and ""Melody Fair"" and ""First of May"" are both great songs.

This 3 CD version contains both mono and stereo versions of the original album, and the third CD contains some very interesting alternate versions along with some previously unreleased songs. Many of these are almost as good as the well-known versions, and a few maybe even better; I especially like the alternate mix of ""You'll Never See My Face Again"". The song ""Barbara Came to Stay"", is the same tune as ""Edison"", with different lyrics, and also one of the great additions. For fans of the group, this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums, of course is must.

Great reproduction of the original cover and a fine informative booklet too.","Odessa was the Bee Gees ' fourth internationally released album , and their first double album .

For fans of the group , this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums , of course is must . Great reproduction of the original cover and a fine informative booklet too ."
AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"After forty years, the Gibb Brothers have finally re-released their most classic and eclectic of albums, ""Odessa"".  Released at the height of their first popularity and the start of their ultimate eighteen-month breakup, these three musicians, barely out of their teens, produced their only double studio album.  Originally coated in a red velvet cover, this is one of the most extravagant re-releases to date.  Originally seventeen songs, varying from the near operatic, ""Odessa (City On The Black Sea)"" to country flavored tunes like, ""Marley Purt Drive"" and ""Give Your Best"", the Gibbs cover nearly every style of pop music available, including rock, orchestral, country and R&B.

Originally slated to be titled, ""An American Opera"" or ""Masterpeace"", this double album epitomizes the height of talent of the Bee Gees boundless creativity.  In addition to two new studio songs, ""Pity"" and ""Nobody's Someone"", there are alternate and demo mixes that will surprise in their originality, beat and alternate verses.  ""Edison"", ""Lamplight"", First Of May"" and ""Whisper, Whisper"" all are given special treatment, sometimes twice.  ""Whisper, Whisper"" is actually Part Two, a welcome addition to a song that originally ended too quickly on a fast, rock driven pace.

Of the three discs (57 songs), the stereo had been remixed/remastered to absolute, crystal clear perfection, bringing out all the muffled sounds that the original LP contained.  The Mono mixes present the songs with emphasis on different vocals and instruments, while the third disc contains all the previously unreleased material.

Fan Joe Brennan of website ""Gibb Songs"" has this great explanation of Stereo vs. Mono recordings:  ""Odessa was recorded on 1-inch 8-track tape reels.  Each of the 8 tracks can be played separately, and each might have the input from one or more microphones.  Each of the 8 could be recorded at different times and places (like New York and London), or erased and re-recorded.  To make stereo, you have to mix down to 2 tracks, and for mono, mix down to 1 track.  While doing this you get to decide how relatively loud each track should be.  That's where the differences come from.  The source is the same 8 track master.  Mono was for old record players, and for AM radio, which was where you heard the latest tunes on your transistor radio or car radio"".

With three discs, a poster, extensive liner notes, photographs of the group, handwritten lyrics, single covers and reel-to-reel listings, a T-Shirt and a sticker all enclosed in a nifty red velvet covered box, this limited edition is a fan and collector's dream.","After forty years , the Gibb Brothers have finally re - released their most classic and eclectic of albums , "" Odessa "" .

A3QPA2Y4CDZUAH,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"First off, the packaging...in a lovely, luxurious red velvet BOX, not a slipcase as I originally thought it would be...with the title gold embossed.  Open it up and the treasures flow out...first a round red Bee Gees sticker, then a huge poster (double-sided), then a great photo-packed booklet (love the B&W cover, and Robin's buggish sunglasses...he looked downright alien-ish...a precurser to Flaming Lips head genius Wayne Coyne!!)...with incredible, informative liner notes that said what we've always known...prior CD issues were crap (abridged, bad sound, etc) and this was an opportunity to give ""Odessa"" the full glory treatment, and info on EVERY song...all versions.

Now, the songs, oh man, THE SONGS!!!!  There are 3 CDs (as I guessed it would be when I first heard of this deluxe (an understatement if there ever was one) release...CD1 is the 17-track album in stereo, CD2 is the album in MONO (first time released in the US) and CD3 is the REAL treat, the 23-track ""Sketches For Odessa""...cool and fascinating demos, alternate takes (sometimes both), 2 UNRELEASED tracks and a promo spot for the album from some record stores, not the radio.

I won't go into the riches of the songs TOO much, but the lovely folks at Reprise/Rhino must have known about how grand this album is (possibly the Bee Gees' best album ever, a True masterpiece) and how crap prior issues were, so they pulled out all the stops and made this clearly the best-sounding CD version of the album.  I don't know what is better, the stereo or the mono...they both sound great.  I love the songs on ""Odessa"", exquisite orchestral pop with killer melodies & 3-part harmonies and excursions into alt-country/rootsrock a la The Band, and orchestral interludes...it works best playing from beginning to end as one piece, yet each track coulda worked as a killer single (except the 3 instrumentals of course).  Faves are def ""Melody Fair"", ""Marley Purt Drive"", ""Give Your Best"", ""Never Say Never Again"" (ESPESH the CD3 alt version with the fuzz guitar, AWESOME, it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain!!!), ""I Laugh In Your Face"", the awesomely cool Maurice-led ""Suddenly""...on and on, one of THE great pop/powerpop albums EVER made, and that's an understatement...

Now, the REAL treats are the TWO unreleased tracks, ""Nobody's Someone"" & ""Pity""...those songs are AMAZING, and it's wild to know they were in the vaults for 40 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!  They could have been hit singles easily, they sound finished and complete, with great hooks and harmonies, just killer.  Another thing is the album was not done justice by the choice of single released, ""First Of May""...nothing against the song, it's lovely, but it would NOT have been my first choice of first single...""Melody Fair"" or ""Marley Purt Drive"" or the title track would have caught people's attention, and the album would have done better, not widely forgotten except for collectors, hardcore fans and powerpop freaks...

NOW, with this GRAND 3CD reissue, people will realize what they truly missed, the treasures in store for them.

A28FNKCGFS03VL,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"Best remembered (and justifiably so) for disco anthems like ""Stayin' Alive"" and ""Night Fever"", The Bee Gees had actually been recording for at least a decade prior to that. This album is more of a pop-rock album, but with some unusual instrumentation and deep, dark, and profound subject matter not often found in mainstream music (even during that time). Songs like ""Edison"" and the title track are dark and haunting, while ones like ""Melody Fair"" and ""Suddenly"" are somewhat less lyrically profound, but all of the songs are extremely well-written and performed.","Best remembered ( and justifiably so ) for disco anthems like "" Stayin ' Alive "" and "" Night Fever "" , The Bee Gees had actually been recording for at least a decade prior to that .

A20JK8DT702CWE,B00124OEBY,1,1,5,"This is still the lushest of all the Bee Gees' albums, unless you count the late, great CUCUMBER CASTLE.  That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my, oh my- -those songs.  I don't know what the rift was over the band's direction that temporarily broke them up (a family affair, you see), but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious, inglorious Sixties.  It was their last of that decade, and everything they'd done previous to it, great as it may have been, was merely prelude.  In England ODESSA was released as a red-velvet two-LP box set; in the States as a red-velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster-at-sea insert.  You could put the thing on your coffee table (or floor, or kitchen counter) and let it speak for itself, or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean.  Or both, with or without headphones.  Okay, that may be overstating it, but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers' finest compositions, ranging from the story-telling prog-rock of the title track (the cello solo is an ingenious touch) to the lighter-than-air, lovely 'Melody Fair' to the oboe-chugged, acoustic 'Suddenly' (Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor) to the desperately haunted 'Sound Of Love'.  Heck, they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one, the prescient globalists!!  And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot!  And- -'Lamplight'!! You want goofy instead?  Okay, 'Give Your Best', and 'Never Say Never Again'! There! These guys are awesome!

AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00124OEBY,1,1,4,"Yes, this was the Bee Gees 'white' album, only this doubled LP had a red velvet cover and a 'Titanic'-like illustration in the gatefold.  Now available on a single CD, it marks the end of the sixties period for the Bee Gees.
The music?  This was an important time for the Gibbs' who were maturing (at ages 19 and 21) and already millionaires.  The music was conceptual and starting with the title track, it delivers with powerful orchestration and emotional, lyrical simplicity.  It is a skewed look at a fabled seafarer lost at sea and emotionally destitute.  At least, that's what the project started out to be.
Somewhere during the recordings, egos flared and tempers snapped, so what you ended up with is a collection of half Bee Gees conceptual songs and half individual Gibb contributions.  It is still a remarkable recording!
Stand-out cuts are ""Marley Purt Drive"" that could have been recorded by ""The Band"" and ""Melody Fair"", a single in some countries and a well covered track.
Most of the other tracks deal with period issues like, drugs, sex, rock 'n roll, psychodelia and why not?  Producer Stigwood unwittingly fueled the tensions by choosing ""First Of May"" as the A-Side single instead of B-Side ""Lamplight"", which was just as strong.
Regardless, the final outcome is a conceptual album filled with an orchestrally sweeping moodiness aligned with perfect harmonies and lyrics envied by everyone. This is one of the few albums of the period with orchestral solos with the Gibbs providing the chorus.  It is monumental.","Yes , this was the Bee Gees ' white ' album , only this doubled LP had a red velvet cover and a ' Titanic'-like illustration in the gatefold .

But, his music has been very melodic and intmate, that it is worth taking a listen too each and every time. His classic 1979 standard Sailing is just as melodic and souldully deep as it was when it has came out over 30 years ago. While he was never a part of the MTV era, his music is still just a great escape to, and honestly still holds up better to all the crap music that has came out over the past several years. If you've loved Christopher's opus, it is worth downloading all over again. While his latest Dr. Faith isn't bad, truthfully Sailing is the one you'll always keep coming back to.

After they disbanded, Seals began performing as Dan Seals and launched a country music career through the 1980s which produced 11 No. 1 hits."" Another reviewer writes that England Dan & John Ford Coley's music was along the lines of ""light pop"" with ""a touch of folk;"" and I agree!

These five tracks are some of their very best music; I love the way they performed so well! England Dan & John Ford Coley could harmonize flawlessly and their melodies were easy on the ear and memorable as well. ""I'd Really Love to See You Tonight"" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and it still sounds great in our time! ""Nights Are Forever Without You"" is a little masterpiece that is timeless; it has great electric guitar work and the arrangement overall is very strong. They cover Todd Rundgren's ""Love Is the Answer"" so well that Todd would surely approve and ""It's Sad to Belong"" is very poignant. The track set ends with England Dan & John Ford Coley performing their awesome ""We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again;"" this is yet another evergreen classic that I could never tire of hearing!

Big fans of England Dan & John Ford Coley will probably have most if not all of these songs already, so I think this music is best geared toward more casual fans and people just discovering their artistry. True, it's very sad that Dan Seals passed away all too young; but he does live on through his music. I highly recommend the beautiful songs of England Dan & John Ford Coley.","England Dan & John Ford Coley "" were an American pop rock duo composed of Danny Wayland ` England Dan ' Seals and John Edward ` John Ford ' Coley .

Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record ""Machine Head"" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.

The song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood,"" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I love live music, and highly endorse this version, and I also recommend ""Machine Head"" (the ""Best Hits"" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price.) One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple.",""" Smoke on the Water , "" originally from the great Deep Purple album "" Machine Head , "" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat .

Plus since I had already purchased another song (""Puff, The Magic Dragon"") from this very same album (""The Very Best Of Peter, Paul And Mary"") ..I guess it made even more sense for me to also get this song too.. from the same album.

In any case ""Leaving On A Jet Plane"" sounds very nice.. and I may end up getting some of the other songs from this album someday.","I recently purchased this song , "" Leaving On A Jet Plane "" by Peter , Paul and Mary and I am very satisfied with it .

Peter, Paul and Mary put out some of the best music in this genre.

While Trini Lopez also sang ""If I Had A Hammer"", my preference hands down is Peter, Paul and Mary's version.  Mary's earthy voice collaborated beautifully with Peter and Paul's harmonies.  Each brought out the best in the other and a truly great song was born.

A2INX8B6VXUVW6,B0012FE454,-1,-1,3,"The last three concerts of the Monkees summer 1967 concert tour were professionally recorded, with the idea of assembling a live album from the tapes.  Also, two weeks before those concerts, a member of the Monkees touring crew recorded one of their concerts, probably for his own use.  As far as I know, these four concerts are the only recordings of Monkees concerts from the 1960s that exist.  Unfortunately, the exact same songs were played in the exact same order at all four shows.  Which is not to say that the concerts are exactly the same.  The Monkees make different mistakes at each of the concerts.  Sometimes they sing the wrong lyrics, sometimes they play the wrong notes.  And there are often technical problems with the microphones and instruments.  Probably the major difference other than the mistakes is in the ad libs that the Monkees say during the concerts.  They even occasionally ad lib a few lines from songs like ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" and ""Act Naturally"".  So, is it worth owning copies of all four concerts?  Not really, unless you're an absolute Monkees fanatic.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0012FFPDE,1,1,5,"Firefall ""is a rock band that formed in Boulder, Colorado in 1974. It was founded by Rick Roberts, who had been in the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Jock Bartley, who had been Tommy Bolin's replacement in Zephyr. The band's biggest hit single, `You Are the Woman,' peaked at number 9 on the Billboard charts in 1976. Other hits include `Just Remember I Love You' (# 11 in 1977), `Strange Way' (# 11 in 1978), `Cinderella' (# 34 in 1977) and `Staying with It' (# 37 in 1981) with female vocalist Lisa Nemzo."" (Wikipedia).

These five tracks are some of Firefall's best music. ""You Are the Woman"" has a sweet melody and Firefall does this really well--it's a classic that got lots of airplay when it was originally released! ""You Are the Woman"" still sounds good today. ""Just Remember I Love You"" also was a big hit for the band; just one listen will tell you why! The guitar is well used in the musical arrangement and this couldn't have been done any better. ""Strange Way"" features Firefall singing and playing at their usual very best; and ""So Long"" is an excellent tune. The track set ends with Firefall performing ""Livin' Ain't Livin';"" it leaves me wanting more from this awesome group!

Firefall biggest fans will probably have most if not all of this great music already, so I think this music is best for the more casual fan or newcomers just discovering Firefall's incredible artistry. I highly recommend their music.","The band 's biggest hit single , ` You Are the Woman , ' peaked at number 9 on the Billboard charts in 1976 .

A23LCEFE2BWE5F,B00130PR54,1,1,5,"This is a great classic rock/bluesey rock band with a piano thrown in for some southern-fried swagger. Kind of a bluesy, gospel-ey sound with heavy guitars. Their sound is hilighted by the strong, heavy, and soulful George Ratzlaff vocals, man does this guy have some pipes!!

Includes mostly faithful covers of Red Rooster, You're No Good and a nice slowed-up cover of The Beatles Lady Madonna. A real bluesy affair, a 70's rock vibe with good guitars. A great listen for fans of Humble Pie, Stones or Faces. The band had three albums so someone at the label obviously recognized some potential.

Also worthwhile from the 'Lost 70's blues/psych/guitar rock' cannon, check out Head Over Heels, Tin House, Stray Dog, Blue Goose, Jeronimo, Black Cat Bones, White Chocolate, Jericho, and the awesome smokin hot guitar album Totty!!!","This is a great classic rock / bluesey rock band with a piano thrown in for some southern - fried swagger .

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B00136J7OA,1,1,5,"please understand, that as what I wrote in an earlier review, I believe that there is more than enough room in this world for women who choose to be childfree and those who choose to become and stay mothers  (regardless of their age).  For some reason, I have heard billie jean by Michael Jackson on the radio enough times for the song to grow on me. Im taking it that billie jean by Michael Jackson symbolizes the journey of a man coming to terms with being the father of a woman who became pregnant at an extremely young age (Im guessing a teenager) due to the lyrics she is just a girl. He does not want to believe that he is the father, but he sees that he probably is due to singing about looking at the babys eyes that remind him of his own eyes. From my humble opinion, Billie jean by Michael Jackson still does touch on a relevant issue today because the common societal message that is still being sent is that every woman who is someone becomes a mother, and I do believe that many teenage females subconsciously take in this message and internalize it. I just happen to have made my own decision on what I was going to do after my teenage years when I was tasked with helping my adoptive mother look after the younger children in her care.  I have an open mind when it comes to teenage mothers because I myself was born to a woman who had just turned 16 8 days before my entrance into this world. However, that is all that Im going to say for now for a compelling song that touches on a topic that is not going to go away anytime soon.","please understand , that as what I wrote in an earlier review , I believe that there is more than enough room in this world for women who choose to be childfree and those who choose to become and stay mothers   ( regardless of their age ) .

When I walk by Your side

Will I dance for You, Jesus
Or in awe of You be still
Will I stand in Your presence
Or to my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine

I can only imagine when that day comes
And I find myself standing in the Son

A1GR2QPCD08COG,B00136JBBY,1,1,5,"I've been buying Amazon music for a while now and I love how Amazon offers low cost music and even free music from new artists. I listen to radio mostly and frequently I get tired of the same stuff and definitely tired of the over-played stuff (even if it's a great beat like Lady Gaga's ""Poker Face""). I've never heard of Franz Ferdinand and I first heard ""Take me out"" on Amazon. The more I review songs the more I'm aware of my alternative music tastes (especially alternative music reminiscent of 1990's alternative).

For me, good alt-music has a rock beat with a twist--something different, unexpected, experimental even. I think this can be subtle or obvious and very subjective definitely (in the eye of the beholder or the ear in this case). Sometimes a repetitive beat is annoying (one reason modern country music doesn't do it for me); but sometimes it's classic (like Elvis Costello's ""Pump it up,"" Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode,"" or Elvis Presley ""That's Alright Mama"" and even some old-skanky-country like Hank Williams' ""I'm so lonesome I could cry""--old-skanky-country is a term of endearment made up entirely by me). By no means am I comparing ""Take me out"" to the classics, I'm trying to explain how I base my reviews.

What caught my ear on ""Take me out"" was the initial repetitive rock beat (it's fast with a hint of punk) guitar and drums dominate; it's a great mix with the singer's voice (is he singing or screaming--it's hard to tell, there's an angry sound to his voice which is fitting with the punk aspect of the music). A minute into it, the beat transitions to a slower, deeper, harder rock sound (hm, interesting choice of words yes? If good music doesn't make you think sex, maybe it's not good music. Anyway, a very sexy transition IMO). There are hints of 70's disco in the cymbals in the chorus (or what I think is the chorus). There isn't much variety in the lyrics or rhythm for that matter; but sometimes that just doesn't matter. The beat keeps the song moving along. The lyrics do borderline on the monotonous but it's an easy song to sing to--maybe Franz doesn't have much to say. It's the only song I've listened to from Franz Ferdinand. I like it, a lot.

With Amazon's 20 million songs, there is so much to listen to! I rated this song 5 stars because I am very happy with my purchase. I love songs that are a change from the mainstream.","I 've been buying Amazon music for a while now and I love how Amazon offers low cost music and even free music from new artists .

As a young man finding my way in New York City there were what the residents called public baths. This was a very long time ago but as a music fan even then, I remember a young, explosive female entertainer named Bette Midler who would entertain at these baths accompanied by her pianist, Barry Manilow. Of course they would later break away from each other to become each outrageously loved and successful show business personalities. There were definitive differences with Barry Manilow becoming a much more  conservative recording artist whereas Bette is the nouveau Lucille Ball with a comedic lasciviousness that generations have enjoyed immensely. My wife and I waited in an endless, serpentine line to see Barry Manilow do a show at the Garden back in 1981. Once inside, we immediately noticed his engaging smile and friendly persona which is nothing short of contagious. His material, as evidenced by the classic Weekend in New England ranks amongst the finest songwriting in American music. In Barry's case, whether another classic of his I Write the Songs classifies him as a 100% singer songwriter is irrelevant. We appreciate him as a captivating singer who is an authentic charmer. That is exactly how Barry Manilow can credit his gargantuan success since the days of playing the piano and appearing with Bette Midler in New York's public baths. I would have to say that his vocals and keyboard playing are indeed highly professional. His strength is to light up any room he walks into and then you have have to add one of the most highly regarded song catalogs music fans have ever appreciated.

A2IHB3M0ZIKNOZ,B00136JB8W,1,1,5,"Many people cite The Love I Lost, from late 1973-early 1974 as the first disco song. It has all the elements from the disco beat to the use of strings. I would say the Trammps with Zing Went the Strings of My Heart had all the disco elements down including the strings, and that was in late 1972, over a year earlier. But the Trammps song was minor and The Love I Lost was a huge mega-hit, so it's known to far more people. Disco evolved out of the Philly sound of Gamble and Huff, and taht's who Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes recorded for.

But forget labels like disco anyway (some people don't like the term), and what you've got is a smooth orchestra, a driving rhythm and Teddy Pendergrass singing his heart out. It's a great R&B classic and is as fresh today as it was when it was released. There was a long version on the album, but that just had an extended interlude for dancing because dance music was expected to be more than a three minute AM tune. But for just listening I think the single is better as the dance interlude gets a bit repetitious on the long version if you're just listening. It deserves to be in this collection.","Many people cite The Love I Lost , from late 1973 - early 1974 as the first disco song .

The song from ""August Rush"" completely missed the mark it was trying to achieve, and ""Enchanted"" with the exception of ""So Close,"" sounded like typical Disney type fair.

However, then came, ""Falling Slowly,"" a song from a widely unknown film, I was like, ""Wow, this is really different, this is beautiful!"" And it was all that and more, and the studio version only improved on these precious elements. It's a moving, gentle song that really touches your heart. And like I said, I liked the song so much, I now want to see the actual movie, ""Once.""

Overall, the surprise song of the year, and a feel-good story that these unknown musicians are finally getting the credit and recognition they deserve. Buy this song, and you won't be disappointed.

By the way, get this version, there's a longer version that was put out, and it's not as good, because the song seems a little bit too spontaneous and drawn out, and it also loses some of the elements that makes the soundtrack version so great.","And I 'm not talking about instrumentals either , I 'm talking about lyrical themes to movies that have to embody the movie , and really set the tone for it the movie .

No matter what happens to him in court, no matter what went on recently (His death), Jackson will always prevail. Sure, we have the Black Eyed Peas, but before, Jackson stood by his name as the King of Pop.

Beat It is his signature song. It tells about an anonymous person ending up meeting a gang (Or so I assume), and the people in the gang seem like as if they want to injure the person. Now, that may not be the actual storyline in the song, but seriously, what do you think of after hearing this: ""They're out to get you. Better leave while you can!""

No matter, though, because being a universal language, music belongs to the world. There is so much going on in this arrangement, and it all fits together so perfectly, that you have to listen to it over and over to begin to pick up everything that's going, from the harmonies and little vocal touches and phrasings, to that incredible female background soprano, which I sounds almost like a Theramin, one of the first electronic instruments.

They share an hour or so together drinking a 6 pack in her car catching up on their lives but neither one reveals everything or the True picture of their current lives. After they've said all they've had to say, they part ways and go on with their lives. Many of us have been in a similar position and can relate to the characters.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136JOVG,1,1,4,"When it comes down great guilty pleasure artists, we often seem to forget what influence they've made on music today, especially back in the 80's. For those acts, we always will think of Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince. But, for Billy Joel, he really made the best that was still coming around. 35 years after he broke ground with Piano Man, he has still dominated with his music on the radio. While he hasn't recorded an album since 1993's River Of Dreams, his music still stands the test of time because it is worth while from beginning to end. But for those who seem more interested in acts like Britney Spears and anyone who has been on American Idol, and doesn't own a Billy Hoel record, than this is a start to download for your MP3 player.

The Essential Billy Joel is a collection of over 30 tracks from Billy's long and successful career from the 70's, 80's and 90's. The songs here have all been remastered well, and chronicle a innocent man who has made the music of our times. The collection includes a lot of great standards he has made his own for over 35 years like Piano Man, River Of Dreams, We Didn't Start The Fire, the delight diddy Uptown Girl, and The Longest Time, all the way to #1 hits like My Life, It's Still Rock N' Roll To Me and Allentown. There is so much that is great in music, but there are a few of his great songs that were sadly overlooked like You're Only Human (Second Wind), Modern Woman and a few other good songs. But, those are small complaints, because those songs were only minor hits. Instead, the collectin includes some of his songs from his 2001 classical pop album instead.

All in all, The Essential Billy Joel is a very strong and standard greatest hits album from beginning to end that is fun and a joy to listen to, whether you're a hard core fan, or anyone who is new to Billy Joel's songs. This album is definitely a great purchase to download off the internet, or buy from your local record store. Even though Billy Joel hasn't made anything new in awhile, his music is still making us go to extremes.

A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B00136JMH2,1,1,4,"The title was taken from the bumping track ""Front, Back, & Side To Side"". I purchased an old The Source magazine from December 1994 and saw that was a track for one of their Sure Hot Singles back in the day. Thing was I never paid too much attention to UGK, except for a few songs here and there. Then ended up being the laughing stock at my job, because I told them that I'm from the A, their recent album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underground-Kingz/dp/B000K7UFL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underground Kingz</a>&nbsp;was the only album I owned. So I ended up buying this the very next day.

Super Tight is a very southern style album. Both Bun B and Pimp C sound way different back in '94, than they do today. A lot of tracks would bump today as they did back then. ""It's Supposed To Bubble"" is one of them. Bun B drops a solo track ""Feds In Town"" which sounds real good. ""Pocket Full Of Stones 2"" and ""Protect & Serve"" are other good songs. ""Stoned Junkee"" is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and features 3-2. The final track ""Three Sixteens"" featuring DJ DMD is a very good way to close out the album.

Super Tight is an excellent album. Some of the production sounds dated (although I have to give mad props to Pimp C for his production), but it still bumps here today. It's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar, especially when other albums from the south such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik/dp/B0000013GB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Diary/dp/B000000W6Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Diary</a>&nbsp;dropped the same year. But if you're a fan of 90's southern rap (mainly groups like E.S.G., UGK, or anyone from Rap-A-Lot), don't hesitate to get this album. I used to live in San Antonio during my high school days ('00-'04), and this album reminds me so much of how it was down there in Texas. Peace!

The beats are melodic G-Funk, with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs.  Lyrically and vocally, UGK kills in all departments.  They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows. The track ""Feds in Town"" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. ""Super Tight..."" is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue.

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00136LO78,1,1,5,"is that it was about someone who died from an overdose.

I know that when I first heard this song it came and went. I didn't pay much attention to it at all.

But these days I like it lots. This is after I bought the platinum edition (2007). The ending is emotional. And I could see myself getting teary-eyed if I loved someone half this much.

But I'm not in a relationship. But I still like songs like this. Love-oriented ones. I always have!

 And they range from different sides of mainstream music from Pop (Mandy, Robin, Christina or Jesse,) to R&B (Mariah, Carl Thomas, Beyonce and Luther Vandross) to Pop-Rock (Maroon 5, Incubus, Yellowcard and Fall Out Boy).

5 stars.

end note: I clash with many beliefs of the other review made before this one.","is that it was about someone who died from an overdose . I know that when I first heard this song it came and went .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,4,"Hard to believe today it is 5 years since Michael Jackson tragically lost his own life the way he did. I definitely do not think Michael Jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a pedophile and wacko jacko. Still he still had some great songs towards the end of his career and his life. You Rock My World, one of his last hit songs originally from the lackluster Invincible album is still one of those few standouts from that album that is playing well. It showed a more R&B rhythm to the appeal that Michael Jackson wanted to get into a generation that was getting into Destiny's Child, TLC and when a lot of R&B really was going more into a dance and hip hop rhythm. It really was a good song, but one of Michael Jackson's last to really hit the nail on the head. If you would prefer Michael's music from the afterlife, as it was released from the Xscape record, you should absolutely go back to what made Michael Jackson a legend in the first place, and get Invincible with You Rock My World.

A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00136LQ2Q,1,1,5,"The prelude; Michael Jackson and Chris Tucker having a conversation about a girl they're supposedly looking at, though there isn't any background noise to help set the scene; is like the skit at the beginning of Black Or White. It may be funny initially, but it's replay value is nowhere near that of the song it introduces. Listeners of at-least the official album versions of these tracks may, in other words, find themselves skipping past, or at-least zoning-out on, the first several seconds. That means the tracks, essentially the songs, would be better without their preludes. In the case of You Rock My World, the title of which doesn't come across nearly as corny as it should, the song would also make more sense without it. The dialogue implies that the girl is a total stranger to both Chris and Mike, but the song lyrics have Jackson already romantically entwined with her.

""It feels like I've finally found a perfect love this time,"" he insists before going into one of his best choruses yet. ""You rocked my world, you know you did,"" it goes, utilizing a harmonic vocal stack similar to the haunting Ghosts, ""Who'd think I'd find someone like you to call mine?"" The words are trite; on paper the song would read like a high school crush poem; but the vocal melodies, even on the verses and bridge, are quite awesome. The music, highlighted by dramatic keyboard strings where applicable, is a slinky soul groove that goes back to the relative timelessness of the Thriller album. Despite an unnecessary scratch break near the end; the ad-lib peak section should take the song out; it's producer Rodney Jerkins at his best. It's not Michael Jackson at his best, but it's damn close. If the quality of this love theme is any indication, I'd guess he got the girl.

It has some nice flourishes such as great sax solos, judicial use of cow bell, and one of the nicest drum solos recorded, with ample timbale which lends an exotic flavor. There is great synthesizer throughout with strong performances by all backup musician.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00136LEMS,1,1,4,"To really be honest with you, this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music. While so many artists like Jordin Sparks and Beyonce' have taken so much radio airplay, it has been harder to find fresh faces to make good music come alive. Newcomer, Sara Bareilles though has managed to get herself out there and try to make a name for her little voice with her debut single, Love Song. The song actually is very catchy after awhile, and stays with you. It is a pretty good song that shows she has a decent ability who has the distinction of making good songs sound fresh, rather than flimsy and manufactured. I really hope she keeps making good ones for years to come, that really stick to the mind and soul.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00136LEMS,1,1,5,"First off, Sara Bareilles is a great new musical talent, in the vein of the gaggle of female pop artist dominating the airwaves today. She sings great, and her piano work is incredible. The song could be compared to REM's classic, ""The One I Love,"" in that, the title sounds, well, like a lovesong, but actually it's like a break-up song. Bareilles does a great job at creating a radio-friendly upbeat pop song. And it all seems to work. Just the other day, I heard the song twice within a span of 15 minutes, on completely different radio stations.

Overall, a great little pop tune from a big talent. Music just seems to be coming up with a ton of surprises lately, and this song is no exception.","First off , Sara Bareilles is a great new musical talent , in the vein of the gaggle of female pop artist dominating the airwaves today .

AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00136LEMS,1,1,5,"Much more things going on, production-wise than the version that I have downloaded to my computer. It's great though, gives it more personality.

The version I hear when I listen to it (downloaded version) has just the piano and vocals. Nice, but no production whatsoever. It's great, but not this. The video version is much livelier.

The song itself is pretty impressive though; it lets us know who Sara actually is; what she wants; needs and most importantly, how she thinks! Lyrics are subtly interesting and the piano work is somewhat infectious, albeit simple.

I've heard the samples here, and although they weren't enough to make me want to purchase the album, it doesn't take away from this awesome single and I will still give them another go someday!

A3TI1WDAEOTD0I,B00136NE62,1,1,5,"Black or White is one of those songs by Michael Jackson that is memorable not just because of the beat and the video that would later accompany it, but because of the words.

We live in a time where so much is put on color, but there is something else that I realized when I heard the song recently. Life is not black and white. Nothing is really at its best when it is separated and distilled. Michael Jackson knew that in his career and refused to be defined. We would do ourselves and the world a favor that doing the same.

Black or White contains a message that minds us that we are all human, all important regardless of what we look like. What matters is how we live and treat our fellowman. If we remember that, then we will truly be able to say we are living life to the fullest.","Black or White is one of those songs by Michael Jackson that is memorable not just because of the beat and the video that would later accompany it , but because of the words .
