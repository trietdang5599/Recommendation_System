,B000WOWPZM,1,-1,3,"The quality of the song is a little crackly. I heard this song on the radio the other night, and I wanted to have it on my MP3 player. It is a good song. If you find a version with a better quality, go for that version instead.",
,B000WOWPZM,-1,1,5,okay,
,B000WOWPZM,-1,1,4,Why would anybody dump this woman?,
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,3 dog night was a staple rock band. The very idea of anyone reviewing songs from the 70's without mentioning them is wrong in every way. Mama Told Me is the center of their rocking.,
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,I already owned Three Dog Night's Joy To The World Greatest Hits collection -- and this song was not included.  A great single purchase finish the 3DK collection.,
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,I bought this tune just as a trip down memory lane and it did send me back to the 70s. It is a somewhat cheesy tune with vocal with lots of affectation which has some comic value. The recording doesn't really hold up and needs to be remastered. But if like me you need a brief escape to the70s this might do the trick.,
,B000WQ6XK8,1,-1,3,...the best songs Three Dog Night did.  But it's okay.  Downloaded it because it brought back memories of losing my first real love...,
,B000WSWEOA,-1,1,4,I didn't realize that there were various versions of the song. This one is not the one on You Tube but is close and doesn't have the instrumental for the second half.,
,B000WSWEOA,-1,1,4,I'm a lover of this type of music. I get the MP3 downloads which hasn't been the best with Amazon's Downloading device this past 4 months which is why I knocked a star off.,
,B000WSWEOA,-1,1,4,This is a great song from my teen-age years that provides a little different version from the usual Derek and the Dominos version.  It would be nice if this version eliminated the introductive talking portion.,
,B000WSV1AS,-1,1,4,"Great song, beautiful tune, and the lyrics caused me 2 do some research. There was a radio station in the South that was allegedly either bombed or burned down for playing this song!  Janis had the insight to write this song at age 13!  I would give this song 5 stars except that the girl cops out at the end. However, the song played in 1965 or 1967, so the taboo of the times still has to be considered.  For the most part,  society's children are still ""sticking to their own kind"", and though  unspoken and a bit weaker, the social dating rules still exist.",
,B000WSV1AS,-1,1,5,"This song wouldn't be a big deal today (well, maybe I am wrong); back then it really ticked some people off.  I like the words and the sound.  I guess it was an early protest song.",
,B000WT5CAW,-1,1,5,I'm not quite sure what I am supposed to say. I downloaded the song and it is what it is.,
,B000WT5CAW,-1,1,4,Its okay but I like other things by Johnny Cash better,

,B000WTUYM8,-1,1,5,Nelly Furtado's range in music is so under-appreciated.  love her.,
,B000WTUYM8,1,-1,3,"Nelly has an extremely great voice.  This song is probably one of her best.  I have not heard too much about her, but she should sing more of these types of songs.  I heard Promiscuous and it was cute, but I wouldn't buy it though.",
,B000WZWW7M,-1,1,5,Speaks volumes.,
,B000WZWW7M,-1,1,5,"I first heard this on a YouTube video for Final Fastasy The Spirits Within, except...it was never in that movie or soundtrack.  Run I heard it on a FF VII video, except was not in that either.  Tracked it down to Tears For Fears, years ago, remake by Jules and used n Donny Darko movie.  My wofe says it's dark,Mi just think it is a solid A, moving, touching, mindful, haunting.",
,B000X6NXZ0,-1,1,5,Heard my brother play this song and really liked it. The lyrics caught my ear. plus any song stated sorry has to be good,
,B000X6NXZ0,-1,1,4,it is ok as a story,
,B000X6NXZ0,-1,1,5,It was okay but I've heard better from Buckcherry,
,B000X6TUGQ,-1,1,5,"I do not like to reveiw music purchases, movie purchases and I certainly don't like to review downloads. If you didn't like the song in the first place why would you bother downloading it.",
,B000X6TUGQ,-1,1,5,Rocks!,
,B000X6TUGQ,1,-1,3,my daughter wanted this and loves it,
,B000X6TUGQ,1,-1,3,ok,
,B000X6UB46,-1,1,5,"Awesome music! Must buy more, must buy more, must use up 9 more words .... blah blah blah blah blah",
,B000X6UB46,-1,1,5,"Very nice song to mix in with the Christmas tunes.  And since this has to be a certain length to be submitted, I guess the other songs are going to go without reviews.",
,B000X6ZBCS,1,-1,3,"This is a earlier, much more foul-mouthed Gaffigan. His current style is still present, but there is definitely a little bit more edge to the delivery of his jokes. Parents, be warned about the expletives that are going to ensue.

Jim talks a lot about his recessive genes causing his absolute paleness, his Midwest upbringing, and his hatred of reading. But the most famous of his jokes is present here, the famed Hot Pocket joke. How much can one man talk about the destructive nature of this lovely frozen food item? You will be surprised.

The best part of this release is the included DVD with several of classic Gaffigan stand ups originally on Comedy Central. He sure looked really skinny and pale back then!

It is solid, but no where as strong as his subsequent releases, King Baby and Mr. Universe. It is worth it if you are a Jim Gaffigan fan.",
,B000X6ZBCS,1,-1,3,"It is funny, but I should have read the information more carefully, as many of the bits are contained in some of this other albums.",
,B000X6U6IM,-1,1,5,"I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.
See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours, for like EVER. :D
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:",
,B000X964EY,-1,1,5,"Monolithic Baby! is the sixth full-length Monster Magnet studio album, it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time.

The album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.

The aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.

The fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.

Regardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'

Most Monster Magnet fans are fond of Dave's Vocals and lyrics, which are up to their usual high standard on this record, and most fans will be more than happy with this album, the songwriting is of a very high caliber and there are so many rocking songs that this is one of the most direct, focused and in your face records the band have made.

Of course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments. If that describes your feelings in similar situations then maybe give Monolithic Baby! a miss, elsewise do not hesitate to pick up a copy, it really is a very enjoyable record.",
,B000X9KKO4,-1,1,5,Finally Paramount listensed and put out a complete version. There were so many left out sequences on the older version. The USS Grisom and the destruction of the Enterprise are only a small sample of what was left out.,
,B000XEI154,1,-1,3,"It took me right back to the 1950s!  I played the tune over and over Easter Sunday, as I prepared breakfast, for my family.  My grandchildren got a kick out of me, Nana, singing along as the waffles and blueberries piled on their plates.  I hope it embeds a fun memory for them, as it has me over the years!",
,B000XO0LKW,-1,1,4,A++,
,B000XO0LKW,-1,1,5,says it all,
,B000XO0LKW,-1,1,4,"Quick buying on the computer, downloading not so bad. Once again, issues getting to iTunes or Windows Media. But I think that's a computer bug.",
,B000XQZASS,-1,1,5,Punk out!,
,B000XXZ31K,1,-1,3,"The Good
""Call to Arms"" is no doubt the band's anthem for this album. A major difference you notice right away is that this album is a lot brighter and hopeful as compared to their 2006 album We Don't Need to Whisper. ""Everything's Magic"" adds a hint of keyboards and lots of progressive effects that complement Tom Delonge's (ex-Blink 182) melodic, high-pitched vocals. ""Breathe"" is not your typical radio ballad, but more like a sci-fi movie love song. Driving guitars mixed with melodic vocal breaks make up the track ""Secret Crowds."" Drummer Atom Willard (Offspring) experiments with some unique drum beats on this one. ""True Love"" employs electronic drum beats, unique guitar licks, and uplifting vocals.

The Bad
Despite the different effects and drum beats used, the album tends to sound like one long, drawn-out song.

The Verdict
The brighter more optimistic Angles and Airwaves are far more enjoyable than their darker and hopeless debut. However, lack of diversity keeps this album from returning to my CD player.",
,B000XXZ31K,-1,1,5,"I already reviewed this but Amazon killed the review for an unknown reason.

In any case, this album is as good as the last, which is to say it's spectacular.

The only problem with it is that Rite of Spring is utter garbage; amateurish lyrics and simple, garage, my-first-punk-song from the musical standpoint. It's always skipped and the album should not have it.

The rest ranges from pretty good to really good. Very much a relief that A&A didn't screw things up after their first one, and it was not a fluke!",
,B000Y076EO,-1,1,5,"When it's over, it's over or is it.? I really had to do some searching with a few lyrics to Google who this Artist was due to the fact that I would never known it was Keith Urban, a Country Western Artist, not my usual selection. Most definately I could not have enjoyed it more.",

,B000YKEMZ0,-1,1,4,"I actually dismissed this song when it was new. It didn't really grab me. After hearing their later releases, though, I went back and liked it better. Weird huh?",
,B000YKEMZ0,-1,1,4,"Hooked. Lined. Sinkered. Not sure that last one is a word, but that is how I felt the first time I heard this tune, as I am sure did everyone else who knows this song from One Republic. Not sure why it took me so long to finally download it.",
,B000YN07XI,-1,1,5,"Beautiful music, lousy words.  Should be re-written.",
,B000YN07XI,-1,1,5,As another reviewer said - appreciate this for the music and not the lyrics - good god they're awful!  It's too bad - ugh!  I was able to find a cover site and remove all of the vocals and keep everything else as is.  Aaaah - now it sounds better.  :),

,B000YNNTWY,-1,1,4,"This was for my aerobics on MP3, and the 5th star is missing only because I'm an old geezer from the Sixties. But, this version for Legacy is less harsh in the vocals than the original first films, and lacks nothing for envisioning that beach run from Supremacy, and that's where it takes my vision and motivation. If you have seen those films, even without Legacy, (and maybe especially without it), this one should keep pace. Good Works to you, where ever you turn it on. ~ww",

,B000Z1GR9C,-1,1,5,"Great tune!  I like being able to download MP3s on Amazon but I'm disappointed that some songs play fine and others the volume is much too quiet, or in the rare case, too loud. I miss the fact most of the songs used to be $0.99 and now they are mostly $1.29 too.",
,B000Z1GR9C,1,-1,3,The song is awesome but it wasn't cleanly transferred to an mp3.  I am still happy that I purchased it.,

,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,4,"Type O Negative's most recent album, ""Dead Again"" gets re-released and repackaged with a bonus DVD.  For those who have already picked up ""Dead Again"", this new edition is only worth picking up for die hard fans of the band.  The bonus DVD includes the live Wacken performances of fan favorites ""Kill You Tonight"", ""Love You to Death"", ""Anesthesia"", and ""Christian Woman"", along with the videos for ""The Profits of Doom"" and ""September Sun"".  An interview with the band is included as well, but it's nothing special, even though it concludes with Josh Silver touring Coney Island, which is actually pretty funny.  As for the album itself, you can check my old review for a more detailed take on it, but other than the DVD and new red colored cover, this is the same ""Dead Again"" that you picked up last year.  That's not a bad thing for more casual or new fans to the band who haven't picked up ""Dead Again"" yet, of which by all means this is the edition to pick up.  Other than that though, unless you are a die hard fan who needs to own everything Type O Negative, or you don't own ""Dead Again"" at all, this re-release isn't all that worth picking up.",
,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,4,"Musically, ""Dead Again"" features some of the most ambitious, memorable songs in Type O's career.  The formula hasn't exactly changed, but these songs for the most part match up to past classics.  However, lyrically, this is easily Peter Steele's worst work ever, and oftentimes the inane lyrics detract from the emotional power the arrangements inherently have.

There are several reasons this might be the case.  For instance, it's quite possible that all Peter knew how to write about were the typical Type O topics: death, romance, wolves, fire, etc... The lyrics on this release instead attempt to make real inspirational/thoughtful and moral statements.  That in itself is not the problem, nor is the fact that apparently now Catholic Steele preaches his newfound faith through several of these songs.  The problem is that the lyrics are usually either simple and literal (""I'm a drug addict, always will be"", ""there's no excuse for drug abuse"", ""A child is torn from the womb unbaptized, there's no question it's infanticide"") or pun-filled attempts at humor (""Turn your cheek, gets ripped off, that's why we're given four"").  The song ""Ode to Locksmiths"" actually has the line ""Now I know why girls hate boys,'cuz Eve was in fact raped"".  It seems painfully obvious that Steele's faith is hardly sincere (more out of fear of death than anything) and that he's only preaching because he feels he should, not because he really believes in what he says, judging by the tired and sometimes ridiculous points he tries to make.  Steele himself even said in an interview that he had a hard time finding lyrical inspiration for this album.  A few of the tracks have decent lyrics, such as ""September Sun"" but most, being long songs, have their fair share of good and bad parts.  Only 2 become unlistenable, ""She Burned Me Down"" and ""Halloween in Heaven"".

Other than that, this is a much more energetic and punky Type O than we've had in a while.  Nearly all of the songs have some sort of throw back to their early days, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" is fast throughout.  Many of the songs are quite positive, also... this may be the least depressing album in their career.  Even the World Coming Down-esque ""These Three Things"" has a triumphant finale.  There's no question to me that the drama in their songwriting has improved... all of the epics on this album truly build energy and go somewhere.  Kenny's guitar work seems more Sabbath-inspired than ever before, and although the guitar tone has lost the signature, thick, flanged tone, the combination of Steele's vocal melodies and Silver's organ textures still creates the signature Type O sound.  The songs are full of tempo changes just like the Type O epics of old (""Black No. 1"") but there seems to be a logic and flow present in these songs that just wasn't there in those days.  The album is incredibly consistent, and has no filler and is easy to listen to all the way through despite its length.

In conclusion, ""Profits of Doom"", ""These Three Things"", ""Ode to Locksmiths"" and the haunting closer ""All Hail and Farewell to Britain"" with its excellent ambient outro all contain some of my favorite Type O moments.  I'd recommend ""Dead Again"" to any Type O fan who doesn't put too much importance in the lyrics.",
,B000Z7S78U,-1,1,5,"It's been a long time since Type O Negative have been on the scene. Too long, as a matter of fact. 2003 saw the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Is-Killing-Me/dp/B00009PJPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Is Killing Me</a>&nbsp;and the band seemed to all but vaporize since. Rest assured, however, the boys from Brooklyn are back, and frontman Peter Steele has gone through enough of a personal Hell to inspire one of the best albums of their career. ""Dead Again,"" Type O's seventh studio album sounds just as fresh as the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloody-Kisses/dp/B000000H6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloody Kisses</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/October-Rust/dp/B000000H57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">October Rust</a>, leaving no fan disappointed in it's wake.

At the risk of sounding like a fanboy, I must say that this album totally blew my mind. Listening to it, I get the same feelings I did when I took my first listen of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloody-Kisses/dp/B000000H6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloody Kisses</a>&nbsp;oh so many years ago. It's hard to believe how long these guys have been at it, and that they have yet to get stale or boring. Whether it's the triumphant opening title track, or the gloomy ballad, ""September Sun,"" Type O Negative touch on all their previous material here, while still keeping it relevant. Others like ""Tripping A Blind Man,"" ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" and ""She Burned Me Down"" are the cream of the crop, with their punch-in-the-gut riffs that bring back old school Black Sabbath (something that Type O are the best at). Even a song like ""These Three Things,"" which clocks in at over fourteen minutes, is impossible not to enjoy. And if I'm not mistaken, I can hear a bit of confidence in Steele's voice like never before. For the first time, he truly sounds like he is releasing his demons through his music.

""Dead Again"" is quite possibly the most accessible Type O Negative record available. Granted, you're not going to be hearing this stuff on the radio much, but if you were ever a Type O Negative fan, there is surely something here for you. They are one of the few bands that can create an album that matches their earlier work without it sounding like a shameless rehash. This is easily the most inspired Type O have been in ten years. Everyone who cares for this band owes it to themselves to own a copy of ""Dead Again.""",

,B0010S8HRO,-1,1,4,"I figured coming from such creative stock that Martha Wainwright's album would be 5+ star worthy.  It's good, but it's not great.  Like her brother Rufus, I like the idea of her, more than I actually like her.

I have heard her sing with her father (Loudon Wainwright III) and she came across much more bluesy than she does on this effort (check out ""You Never Call"" on his live disk). Her voice on this disk hits some qualities of Marianne Faithful (great) to some more alt. generic female lead singer(not so great).

The good thing (for me) is that she kind of defies a certain style.  It's not that she's all over the place, just that the music doesn't fit nicely into one genre.

Wainwright's writing is pretty good for her initial effort. I think that's where all her family's strentgh lies anyway...which is not a knock to their performing abilities.

But like most disks there are some outstanding tracks: ""When the Day is Short"", ""Wither I Must Wander"" and the oft mentioned ode (?)to her father, ""BMFA"".

It's at least worth a check-out, if not a purchase.",
,B00110JDUQ,-1,1,4,"After listening to this disc for the first time, all I could say is, ""Wow, not bad!""  These home recordings, in my opinion, give insight into the creative songwriting process of Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer of Weezer.  If these songs were the demos (or prototypes if you will), think of what they would've sounded like if they were refined and produced in the studio!  Someone actually complained of how these songs were, among other things, out of tune and unpolished.  Well, what did you think they were?  That's why they're called HOME RECORDINGS!  Think of them as first drafts to potential songs.  In fact, I think ""Home Recordings"" is far more enjoyable than the Green Album and Maldroit combined!  ""Home Recordings"" is definitely worth buying, in my opinion.  And not just for the hardcore fan mind you!",

Her albums from the early 90's a lot better than her most recent albums.  The only album by her I somewhat liked from recent years is ""No More Drama"" and even still it wasn't a perfect album.  Mary's first three albums are her best and her best being ""What's The 411?""  For long time Mary J. Blige fans you may be disappointed.  If I were you I would just stick to her earlier albums.",
,B00110DT4C,-1,1,4,"Before I said this CD was about average. It's not. It's just different. There is a bit of hip-hip mixed with R&B here but once you get past the good tracks and to the second half of the album it's full of excellent songs that are mid-tempos and beautiful ballads. Some of the highlights of the slower songs are ""That's What Love Is"" (my favorite song), ""Work In Progress (Growing Pains)"",  ""Talk To Me"", ""If You Love Me"" (which sounds like it could have fit right in on her previous huge hit of a CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>) and even ""Come To Me (Peace)"" which ends the album on a slightly more upbeat and inspiring note.

More than half the album is slower and full of meaning and songs about relationship/self-esteem up's and down's. The production on a few of the tracks is a little more Pop/R&B than a lot of her earlier material too.

So even with certain differences I must admit that after listening again (just like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Life/dp/B0000AQS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Life</a>&nbsp;album) I find that this is a great (and once again) underrated effort by Mary J. Blige. To me it's more even than her next outing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stronger-with-Each-Tear/dp/B002UZ5G7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stronger with Each Tear</a>&nbsp;(although that album was solid and upbeat) and is pretty much as great as her previous effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakthrough/dp/B000BNTM32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakthrough</a>&nbsp;believe it or not. It's just more of a grower in my opinion. To me though some of these tracks are just amazing. I guess the ballads/mid-tempos actually makes this one of my favorite recent MJB efforts. I'm now not ashamed to say that. Beautiful effort.

4.4 stars.

,B00110DT4C,-1,1,4,"This is a decent album; I personally was expecting more soul into it. What I actually got was a mixture like Geffen is trying to turn Mary J. Blige into a black Carole King. This became apparent in songs ""Smoke"" and ""Fade Away"". I did listen to the record three times consecutively on my recent trip and the first half was pretty good, what I was looking for was for Mary to hit me with something heavy like she has on all of her recent efforts (i.e. PMS, I'm Not Lookin', Changes I've Been Going Through, Not Gon' Cry) and then I heard ""Roses and personally, I'm split with the song. It's Mary but it's didn't grab me like Whoa!.
I did appreciate ""Just Fine"" a little more than when I did initially. ""Grown Woman"" I love and ""Work that"" picked up where the hidden track from her last album left off. The beat is nice, the lyrics are little B-rate. After ""Just Fine"" things start to run together and sound a bit same, then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little. Her duet with Usher ""Shake down"" is cute but a bit odd vocally. Usher is nice but I would've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary's (i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight). This album is a hit and miss with me, where only a good 3 songs are my favorites and they aren't the best of Mary.",
,B00110DT4C,1,-1,3,"the thing with Mary J.Blige is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her albums that i can get with such as Just fine. that song is cool and compliments her. vocally she sounds good on this set.  overall though and I gotta compare she isn't anywhere near her first two albums which just stand out like that. but she is able to keep on going and put out some cuts that are cool. her theme is played out and worn out,but the formula works because she still can make a cut or two that sticks. Production is cool and the arrangements are cool. songwriting is hit and miss overall to me.",
,B00110DRWQ,-1,1,5,"For a change, rather than a hefty import price for a worthy reissue of an out of print disc, we get a domestic, inexpensive release. Plus, finally on CD are BOTH tracks from the original 12""--the 6 and a half minute remix of ""Let It All Hang Out"" and the 5 and a half minute remix of ""88 Lines"".",
,B00113SLBA,-1,1,5,"It's Al. Duh.  His weakest album, but stil a must for fans.",
,B00114105I,1,-1,3,Good,
,B0011B6UI8,1,-1,2,"The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought ""Cool...this just might work!"" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's True talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's ""I'm Not In Love."" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the ""Big boys don't cry"" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the ""I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back"" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with ""Under The Milky Way"", ""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Broken Wings."" Oh, sure, ""Under...."" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on ""....Town"" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for ""Town"", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for ""Wing""). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal ""Human."" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a True testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. ""Holding On To Yesterday"" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. ""Baker Street"" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. ""Let's Go Out Tonight"" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on ""For The One."" Much like ""Human"", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to ""Miss You Nights"" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! ""Blue Rose"" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. ""Cry"" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (""You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb""), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with ""Imagine"", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).",

See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D

There are standout tracks, such as ""Never Change"", ""Can't Stop"", ""City Of Gods"", ""The Come Up"" and the Bonustrack #2 ""Magic Hour"", but the rest of the album just seems to be randomly and unkindly put together.

AZ is one of the best MCs in the business (no doubt), but he needs to come up with a neatly organized album. I am thinking about DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Buckwild to produce it with guest appearances by Nas, CL Smooth, Common and Cormega.

None the less, pick up this CD to support AZ. He is one of the last True rappers in the business! Check out AZ's Greatest Hits CD ""Decade 94-04"", which is hard to find in the US. This album rocks!",

It was after a little while of that that I got more of a critical eye with the song as I came up with reasons to hate the song that was so overplayed by radio jocks. So first off, while the verses are good, the chorus, especially the last couple rounds of it in the last minute or so in the song, turns away from that, and falls flat, making it a flat love song at the end.

So overall, great verses, bad chorus. Maybe not the best of songs to win your lovers hand. But in any case, it's a good shake-up from the usual Nickelback.",

The song is basically wanting the life of a Rockstar, which Nickelback is, so... not the most original theme. In fact, this song is more cliched than a international South Park cartoon character. But, what makes the song is the catchiness. You'll have it stuck in your head whether you like it or not, and soon, in the middle of a crowded elevator, you'll start singing, ""I'm going to pop my pills with a pez dispenser."" This may of course cause you much embarrassment, and will cause you to smash your radio. But in the end, it's a rock song, and Nickelback's best rock song, and maybe best song period. I'm not saying it's a great song, just Nickelback's best song, because it's so darn catchy.

So anyways, the song has a nice buildup. It is a little slow, and the payoff may be less than satisfying, but Linkin Park is clearly going for a soft rock sound, to go in some background somewhere. Some people may like the sound, like soft rock fans, but fans of Linkin park will be like, WTH? ""In The End"" this is not. The vocals suit the song, the lyrics are good. Are they trying to go for a love song or something?

Overall, try first, maybe buy if you like. For me, it's just another song on radio I could really care less about. And definitely not one you want to hear all the time. Maybe every once in a while, but that's it.",

(It starts with one)
 One thing I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To explain in due time
 (All I know)
 Time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down to the end of the day
 The clock ticks life away
 (Its so unreal)
 Didnt look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on but didn't even know
 I wasted it all just to watch you go

 I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time when...

 I tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end
 It doesn't even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end
 It doesn't even matter

 One thing, I don't know why
 It doesnt even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
 To remind myself how
 I tried so hard
 In spite of the way you were mocking me
 Acting like I was part of your property
 Remembering all the times you fought with me
 Im surprised it got so (far)
 Things aren't the way they were before
 You wouldnt even recognize me anymore
 Not that you knew me back then
 But it all comes back to me
 In the end

 You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...

 I tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end
 It doesnt even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end
 It doesnt even matter

 I've put my trust in you
 Pushed as far as I can go
 For all this
 Theres only one thing you should know
 I've put my trust in you
 Pushed as far as I can go
 For all this
 Theres only one thing you should know

 I tried so hard
 And got so far
 But in the end
 It doesnt even matter
 I had to fall
 To lose it all
 But in the end
 It doesnt even matter",
,B0011Z4WT8,-1,1,5,I had no other reason to get this song other than I was thinking of another Linkin Park song and thought hay this one is not bad either.,
,B0011Z4ZDQ,-1,1,5,"Twenty years ago, at the end of 1994, MTV counted down 100 music videos of 1994 and gave the number one video position to the song Basket Case by Green Day from the CD Dookie. I used a magnifying glass to study the picture art on the cover of the CD jewel case and found the caption: twisted dog sister. The blimp in the upper left corner of the picture on the CD cover has the message: BAD YEAR. The CD is round and does not have the entire message, but the art on the CD itself clearly has bombs that are called DOOKIE. This CD was released in 1994 during the transition from January to February, so MTV had many opportunities to play the song Basket Case during the year 1994, and I think a special thrill was beheld internally at the idea of giving myself the creeps and my mind plays tricks on me. Basket Case was the Martin Luther Stonehood of 1994 expressing itself in punk rock, and people who have forgotten are like Americans who lack Hegel circling the present with the depth of its past.",

One of the names mentioned in the song is ""Rebekah,"" that's me, which is why I love it.  ""Rebekah, Joanna, Donna, Annabella, and Jodi.""  These are the names of the sexy women he mentions in ""Get Busy.""  I don't know if ""Kana Kana"" counts as a name.
The beats in ""Get Busy"" are pretty fast, terribly abrupt, and choppy. There is that syncopated constant short clap beat throughout the song in addition to that daydream um....sound.

""Wait a Minute. Prince.
May 6, 2011 by frmarkdwhite
In an idle moment, I busted out a few tracks from the first Batman movie soundtrack, just to re-live the time. Listening took me back to those heady days of cassette tapes, and a crystalline realization left me humbled like a man in front of Niagara Falls:

Let's reflect for a moment--

Between 1982 and 1987, Prince came out with 1999, Purple Rain, Around the World in a Day, Parade, and Sign o' the Times.

Pause. Taking it in...

Do you realize how many songs are included here that are necessary elements of the cosmos?

By my count, at least twelve.

This is the most amazing thing that has ever been done.

If the man had only produced Purple Rain, that would be the most amazing thing that has ever been done.

...Can we really doubt, you know, the Almighty Hand?

No.""

i am not so sure how the long version, and the single version of this song differ. i guess i will never know unless someone that i know has purchased the single version. in this version, a guys says something from the beginning before the actual song begins and there is a long solo with a distorted type of voice towards the end. i found that kind of weird and not quit sure if that is how it is supposed to sound like. very difficult to say since music nowadays have that distorted voice in it too. maybe someone will let me know. :)",

However, this song is usually presented as a pairing 'This Beat Goes On/Slippin' To Glide' and it usually happens in a seemless manner. These songs are cult classics and I'm sure the fans out there would love these to be presented in the normal seemless manner. To me it seems like breaking them in two is just a ploy to generate extra revenue. Still, I'm sure fans would pay $2 to have this be one peerless piece of music. I will compare this this to ZZ Top's 'Waitin' The Bus/Jesus Left Chicago' or Queen's 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' - you really shouldn't hear one without the other.",

""Love won't let me wait"" was NO exception, as it's a great song.

As this CD is an import, it's expensive ($38.99 as of 12/01/2006).  Third parties have cheaper (though not much).  This is going to force me to wait.  Oh well...(sigh)...Five stars...

,B00122PK9Q,1,-1,3,"Originally released in 1982, this was the follow-up to his 'Special Forces' effort (see my review). 'Zipper Catches Skin' is a rather 'off' the beaten path lp for Alice. That's not to say it doesn't have good songs, because it does. Tunes I thought were good were ""Zorro's Ascent"" (it's got a great beat to it), the radio friendly ""I Like Girls"" (with guest vocalist The Waitress's Patty Donahue - R.I.P.), ""Tag,You're It"" and ""I'm Alive (That Was The Day My Dead Pet Returned to Save My Life)"". There's a cut here ""I Am The Future"" that at first I didn't remember where I've heard it before. Turns out it was part of the movie soundtrack for 'Class Of '84'. Line-up: Alice - vocals, Mike Pinera & Richard Wagner - guitars, Erik Scott - bass, Duane Hitchings - synthesizer and Jan Uvena - drums. Make not a classic, but [very] decent.",
,B00122PK9Q,-1,1,4,"Around the time this album came out, most people were probably thinking, ""What has happened to Alice Cooper?"" or ""What is Alice Cooper thinking?""  After he tried to reinvent himself for the 80s with Flush The Fashion, I think many people abandoned him for the cruddy new bands that started popping up.  The punk sound that he hinted at with Flush The Fashion and carried on with on Special Forces is still in play here.  This could actually be part 2 to Special Forces minus the ... attitude.  Alice uses this album to totally let loose his humor side with mixed results.  It's really not as funny as Alice thinks it is.  That's not to say I don't enjoy it, I do.  I actually like this album quite a bit.  I think it's great that he tried something different regardless of what people think.  The only flaw in my eyes is that it seems as though Alice Cooper-the man was taking a vacation from Alice Cooper-the character.  All of us fans fell in love with the creepy character of Alice Cooper, and this album comes across as an album by the man and not the character.  Look at his picture on the cover.  Yes, it is funny, but ""Alice Cooper"" wouldn't do something like that, or make an album of songs like that either.  Same can be said for Special Forces(though I can see the outfit working, but not the lyrics), or Flush The Fashion(where I can see the songs working but not the image).  This may sound like I'm putting these three albums down, but I really like and listen to them quite a bit.  This little known ""weird"" period of Alice's(Flush, Forces, Zipper, Dada) is very underrated if you ask me, and should be given alot more credit and attention than it does.  It's sad that the ""Trash"" period is more well known and favored.  I know this review won't be read by many because of that, and it's only hardcore Alice Cooper fans that will take any interest in this album at all.  And since that's the case, you already own it or you're eventually gonna get it and were curious about it....It'll be one step closer to having the whole collection, and you just may be surprised that it's actually a good album.

,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.

1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  ""Reach"" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.
2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.
3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.
4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.
5) 2 Find U: Weak.
6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.
7) Doin' Fine: ""We are what everyone wants to be.""  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.
8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is ""spells"" the song title...).
9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.
10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.
11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.
12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.
13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).
14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own ""becoming"" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.

As you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to ""This Way"") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.",
,B001237HCI,-1,1,5,"For former Jewel fans who don't like this CD, tough!  I've never heard anything like this, and my friends agree it's great.

""Stand"" (take a stand) is like some time tunnel idea from when music counted for something, set to a sleazy bar beat that holds the counterbalancing darkness.  We haven't had an artist who could popularize stuff like this in a while.

And there hasn't been so much hidden in lyrics since people tried playing Beatles records backwards.  Consider that ""Intuition,"" seems to be ""follow your heart"" inspiration, all mushy stuff you'd be proud to sing in church, when suddenly a stacatto vocal riff breaks in with ""just cash in, sell yourself.""

There are two striking examples of subliminal change of the apparent message by the silencing of a ""t"" at the end of a word.  In ""Leave The Lights On"" the rhythm makes it impossible to pronounce the ""t"" in ""can't"" so what we actually hear is ""you can try my love, you can buy my love"" instead of ""you can't buy my love.""

The second one is in ""Yes U Can.""  The first time the ""t"" in ""boots"" does come through, but after that it sounds like ""b"".  This one will get my review censored if I spell it out here, and maybe that's why she wrote the lyrics that way, to get past the WalMart censors?  The albumn does NOT have an explicit lyrics rating.  But the ""boots"" are bumpin'.  Apparently it worked.

Right on, Jewel.  Go for it!",
,B001237HCI,1,-1,3,"Firstly, I am a huge Jewel fan.  She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever.  At first, I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering.  The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general.  But let's not give up on Jewel so quickly.  I admit, I don't like the first single from 0304 ""Intuition"" because it is rather forgetful pop (and won't go down as a classic), but you cannot deny that it appealed to many younger people.  The second single ""Stand"" really appeals to me, on the other hand.  It is a very catchy song, and while it is not traditional Jewel, it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there. And at the end of the day, isn't that what is important about a singer?  To be able to re-invent themself from time to time?  Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it.  I consider ""0304"" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different.  She never said she wouldn't go back to her traditional style in the future.  Unfortunately at the moment, folk type music isn't that popular ... so that's another reason why Jewel is trying something different.  In 1978, the Rolling Stones released a disco single (Miss You) because that's what the public were really into then - even though rock was their normal style. Going with the flow, in other words. Times will change yet again, and folk music will be what the public want.  Cycles ...
""0304"" is Jewel in 2003.  It's not the classic of ""pieces of you"" or ""Spirit"", but it's not as vile as many reviewers have stated.",
,B001237HCI,1,-1,1,"so i read the reviews on here, which i rarely trust anyways, and i decided to get the cd.  (even though i HATE intuition) Lyrically, this IS a bit like her previous albums.  They COMPLETELY butchured her voice though, and made most of it a Dance album...that's what REALLY pissed me off about this album.  Jewel was PERFECT the way she was. and she sounds WAY better on her previous albums, and live.  what was ORIGINAL about her was how u could hear her putting feel into her songs with her vocal capacity.  this all sounds the same and no vocal range at all.  PLEASE all you newcomer jewel fans, pick up one of her EARLIER albums and you will see why us REAL jewel fans hate this cd so much.  she's throwing away good talent, and good looks.  i liked her look before, now she just looks like a hooker.
but all in all let's pray that jewel went through a phase, and will go back to her original stuff on her next album.  She is still the same old Jewel in concert though, which is good. so maybe there's hope after all!",
,B001237HCI,1,-1,1,"It's not so much Jewel sold out but Jewel shows on this CD that she has aristically sold-out.  This is simply a dull, lukewarm collection of machine generated songs that offer no reason to listen to again.  Where's that edgy young artist who said Bukowski was one of her major influences?  Her and Liz Phair should start a support group for aging thirty-something female pop stars who think they should be Avril.(Oh, Jewel isn't that old?  She sure acts like it...)  I have to re-evaluate her old stuff.
  ""If I could tell the world just one thing...that you're okay....""
  I think Jewel proves on this CD the True depth of her previous stuff.",

,B00123G6YI,-1,1,4,"From his debut hit ""Life's A Dance"" in late 1992 through the rest of the '90s, John Michael Montgomery (with his easy going baritone) was one of country music's most reliable hitmakers.  Over the past four years, however, he's had but one top ten hit, the chart topping heart tugger ""The Little Girl.""  With his recent singles struggling, a hits collection was the logical choice for Montgomery's next release.  A sequel to 1997's GREATEST HITS made the most sense, as Montgomery has ten top 20 hits not included on that first set.  Instead, Warner Brothers went with this career encompassing VERY BEST OF that contains 11 of the 14 recordings already found on the strong selling GREATEST HITS.
Among the hits not included on either collection are the engaging ""Ain't Got Nothin' On Us,"" ""Love Working On You,"" and ""Hello L.O.V.E.""  All are uptempo romps that would have contributed nicely to the ballad-heavy VERY BEST OF.  The sequencing on VERY BEST OF distorts the musical nonbalance even more, with three fast tunes leading off, followed by a slew of slow stuff.  The collection concludes with two new ballads: the paternal reflection ""Cool"" and the pledge of devotion ""One Day Less.""  While pleasant, neither track seems likely to reverse Montgomery's recent chart struggles.  Ultimately, while it contains more tracks and covers a longer period of Montgomery's recording career, this VERY BEST OF is not as enjoyable to listen to as his earlier GREATEST HITS.",

What may be surprising is that she's managed to pick out an album's worth--well,almost--of songs that hold the listeners interest,something she failed to achieve with the mostly half-baked BELIEVE(the obvious exceptions being the title track and 'All Or Nothing'). Which is a shame,because,like her magnificently underappreciated IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, LIVING PROOF looks to be losing what little momentum it managed to garner from BELIEVE's success, going the way of WORLD with little to no fanfare. It's even more disheartening considering that the song and vocal quality is literally light years ahead of her previous set, thanks to such first-rate tracks as 'Song For The Lonely','Alive Again','A Different Kind Of Love Song', and 'Love Is A Lonely Place Without You'. The only real snoozer here is 'Body to Body,Heart to Heart'(Memo to artist--cross Diane Warren off your ""go to"" list--she hasn't written anything remotely interesting in ages). The only other quibble is the over-use of that annoying vocoder--it was cool on 'Believe'(the first half a million times),but it's used far too much for it's own good here.

,B00123G5ZI,1,-1,2,"Cher is at it again.  Now nearly 56 years of age, Cher is still fighting the inevitable tide of time.  This time, as with her last ""effort"" ""Believe"", Cher (with platinum hair--will it translate to platinum sales?  I doubt it) continues her foray into the world of trippy dance beats and nuevo-disco stylings as the listener is bombarded with studio wizardry and up-to-date technology (and Cher's unique voice).  The songs (as is usually the case with Cher) are penned by songwriters (i.e., not Cher herself although she did have a hand (ha!) in writing the first ""tune"") and Cher is backed by a slew of competent studio musicians and masterful, clinical, overproduction.  To me, this sounds like technology for technology sake and not for the sake of the music.  On the bright side, it does tend to obscure Cher's questionable ""talent"" somewhat and that can't be all bad.  If you go for dance music, stick with the experts and not some ""artist"" trying to stave off irrelevance.  If you're someone who digs Cher, you'll buy this anyway (and maybe even dance to it--ha ha ha!!!).  The bottom line:  Overproduced dance music that's been done better by many others.  Hippity Hop Dop!!!",
,B00123G5ZI,-1,1,4,"After staging arguably the biggest musical comeback this side of Tina Turner with her dance-driven project BELIEVE, Cher's back three years on to offer up more of the same with LIVING PROOF.Utitlizing many of the same producers, she attempts to build on the momentum experienced with the previous set, and the end result is an overall more consistent album.  Granted, there's nothing here that matches the instant pleasure of 'Believe' or 'All or Nothing', but there's also nothing here that matches the abundance of filler found on BELIEVE either. Lyrically, the tracks follow similarly in the vein of her eighties' corporate-rock albums than her more recent output. The set's first international single, 'The Music's No Good Without You',seems an odd choice, if only because it isn't one of the albums more ingratiating tunes.  Far better is 'Alive Again', as well as 'A Different Kind Of Love Song' and 'Real Love'. Also interesting is 'You Take It All', an electronica-driven track that sounds like Cher trying to channel Olive or Dido.  Among the very few missteps are the sole ballad 'Rain Rain', which is just plain dull, as well as a pedestrian remake of 'When The Money's Gone'. The only other minor quibble is the use of the dreaded vocoder on nearly all the tracks--it sounded cool the first thousand times we heard 'Believe', but has since been rendered just another tired, over-utilitzed gimmick--her voice is better than ever, and the heavy reliance on vocal effects just detracts from the album's overall impact after several listens. Though it doesn't match her underrated nineties opus IT'S A MAN'S WORLD as her best, it is a superior album to BELIEVE and reinforces the notion that Cher sounds best when she supresses the rock chick and unleashes her inner dance diva.",

it's buisness and that makes this album a dirving slice of gritty,hard core east coast funk! The plaintive ""Sparkling In The

The opening five acoustic tracks are warm and intimate if not overly spectacular. The Pig Pen sung Katie Mae stands out a bit from the rest. The Smokestack Lightning jams are a bit excessive even though they can be a bit mesmerizing if you merely have them on in the background. However, the highlights of this disc are Pig Pen's stylish singing on Big Boss Man and Hard To Handle. Old Piggie sure knew how to sing the blues.
Anyway, definitely like Jerry Garcia's interpretation of Sitting On Top Of The World. Again, Good Lovin' is another bonus track on this CD as it was on Europe 72. The jam is somewhat excessive although the drum solo is pretty captivating.
Again like Europe 72, several good moments and I like the idea of both acoustic and electric sides of the Grateful Dead. However some of the jamming certainly goes off the deep end. My only advise is know how much endless instrumental noodling that you can take.",

Chicago hasn't had a top 40 hit since 1991's ""Chasin' the Wind."" But LOVE SONGS makes it perfectly clear.  That album was only the beginning of repackaging Chicago's material.

There's really little new here if you already own THE VERY BEST OF.  ""If You Leave Me Now"" is a live version with Philip Bailey. Another live version is ""After the Love Is Gone"" featuring Earth, WInd & Fire.  ""Never Been in Love Before"" is from 1975's CHICAGO VIII.  And ""Here in My Heart"" is a Lenny Kravitz-produced song from 1997's anthology THE HEART OF CHICAGO.

So what other creative ways can Rhino repackage this material?  The Terry Kath years?  The Robert Lamm-penned songs? Songs from albums whose titles don't contain a Roman numeral?

,B00124DTBK,1,-1,3,"This is the album that made George Benson a pop superstar. ""This Masquerade"" was a light jazz easy listening hit and ""Breezin"" was a hit too. ""This Masquerade"" had the unique distinction of hitting number one on the jazz, R&B, and pop charts; I wonder if any other tune has performed that trifecta. Jazz players will be very familiar with this tune and having the original version for library was the main reason I picked up a bargain version of the album. I did not realize, however, that the new remastered version has extra versions of some of the tracks as well as a version of ""Down Here On the Ground"" a very Donny Hathawayesque tune that I dig off of the ""Weekend In LA"" album.
""Breezin"" sounds like easy listening light jazz but it's a pleasing chart that I enjoy with its flute hook but it's got a nice groove to it as well and . This stuff drips with 70s production values and has a Bob James kind of sound. If you like that kind of light jazz than ""Breezin"" is an excellent album. I find it to be pleasing light jazz that doesn't wear as well as his ""Weekend In LA"" album, where the live performance brings out more fire for George Benson. This album was one of the blueprints for smooth jazz and folks that dig smooth jazz would be wise to look at Benson, with his soulful jazz chops and breathtaking Hathaway like voice before they dig into the latest thing playing on light jazz radio.

The Subject matter The Atonement, relates to God' great love for us, personified through the Live, death & resurrection of God's Only Son, Jesus Christ, and includes songs relating to the death of Jesus (Were you There,& The Cross) celebrating the fact that he is alive & living today( Jesus is Alive) among other topics.

Pros: As with most Lampmode CDs this is a very useful tool for strengthen your walk with Christ. Whilst I might not bump these tunes in my ride, I do listen to them on my Hi-fi system and bible in hand.

Cons: the interludes, whilst interesting on the first or second play, become items that you fast forward on further plays. Whilst I can't criticize the subject matter on display, some of the production/music doesn't live up to the great lyrics on display (In Adam all Die, Were You There? The Cross)

MP3 editing software is cheap and plentiful and it isn't too difficult to cut out the part of the solo I don't like.  It's not a great song but it got a lot of airplay in the Houston area back in the day and a classic rock station started playing it recently so I decided I just had to have it.

See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours.

,B00136JOYS,-1,1,5,"This is actually more like a 4.5, and here's why:
Of the two widely recognized Isley Brothers slow jam compilations out - this one and 1994's ""Beautiful Ballads"" - both albums have monumental oversights.  One record (this one) is missing ""Choosey Lover"" and ""Don't Say Goodnight""; the other record (""Ballads"") is missing their best slow jam and one of the best slow jams ever, ""Sensuality"", as well as ""Groove With You"" and ""For the Love of You"", while replacing it with stuff like ""Caravan of Love"".  And NEITHER album has ""Let Me Down Easy"", but since that's more of a break-up song, you can sort of forgive the oversight.
Somewhere between these two albums is the best slow jam tape ever made.
Not that this one doesn't deserve 4.5 or even 5 stars despite this.  The other CD was lacking, in that it had items on it that weren't exactly ballad-like to compensate(!) for the above omissions.  This one is still a solid, 100% CD in and of itself that you never have to hit the ""Next Track"" button on.  it doesn't break mood, doesn't insert a jumpy dance groove in the middle of the rotation...it's exactly what it says it is and is exactly the way you want it to be.  It's practically been laid out with the ebb and flow of a night with your lover in mind.
Of the two albums, this one is superior, despite its own grievous ommissions.",

This song has more to do with regrets over missed opportunities. I like it, but Dan Fogelberg has done better songs.

,B00136LQC6,-1,1,5,"The quality of the MP3 doesn't do it justice though because it would have been better if it was a WAV file. But nevertheless, I will always love this song which is why I gave it 5 stars.",

,B00136LOU0,-1,1,5,"First, this is the original recording. It's a shame to have to point that out, but the majority (!) of matches for Groove Line are re-recordings. It's much better to match those memories to the actual remembered version.

Second, this is the extended version. The usual, radio edit is 4:22 (as found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mega-Hits-Dance-Classics-Vol-8/dp/B000006LRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mega Hits Dance Classics, Vol. 8</a>, for example), but this is the full (12-inch?) length of 7:26. Disco songs were meant to roll along forever, just like that.

As I type, this version of Groove Line is also available in Amazon Prime Music, but I thought it was worth the bit of cash to be able to download the MP3 to use wherever I want. However you want it, if you like disco, you should check this out.",
,B00136LS9W,-1,1,5,I can play this song 2-3 times a day 7 days and not get tried of hearing this last hit that he performed w/Journey on Video which they was nomated for a Grammy and should have received more than a nomanation?,
,B00136LQUI,-1,1,5,"I love this song, it brings back bittersweet memories of the summer of 2000.

In June of 2000 after the unexpected and sudden death of my husband, my BFF at the time and I were riding in my black '96 Mustang GT, windows down radio blaring.  She was trying to get my mind off of what had happened a few days before when Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" came on.

Before I even had time to think about it, we looked at each other and started ""car dancing"", you know, you're bustin' a move while moving at a high rate of speed, singing at the top of your lungs, laughing, crying and just having fun.  People driving past us would look over and smile, or laugh, some even paced themselves alongside us and broke out in their own car dancing moves.

I didn't stop and think about what people would think if they knew my husband had just died.  I didn't stop and think about anything except the moment me and my best friend were in, ""Girl's just having fun"".

The lyrics are easy to pick up, sing along with and dance to and the video was great.

I believe that if more girls just wanted to have that sort of carefree silly fun, the world might be a little less uptight.",

,B00136LHH0,-1,1,4,John Denver was a voice in the 70s.  This is one of his classics.,

,B00136LO9G,1,-1,3,I like this song. It is the only song by rosanne cash I like. So I bought it. It's a good cover version of a song her dad sang.,
,B00136LKMC,-1,1,5,"This is a sad song that accurately describes how the dying Ratso and Joe Buck take Ratso's last trip to Florida.  Listen to the phrase, ""I'm going where the sun keeps shining through the pouring rain.  Going where the weather suits my clothes.""  In the south along the Gulf Coast they have a saying for this condition.  ""The devil is beating his wife""  This means the sun is shining and it is raining like hell.  How could the producers of ""Midnight Cowboy"" used this as the opening song?",

,B00136LVM6,1,-1,2,"""Oh Sherrie"" was Journey lead singer Steve Perry's first solo release.  No one can deny the strength of Mr. Perry's voice, but he is too bombastic on this track.  He goes for the sledgehammer right over your head, when a little more subtleness would have better for a love song written for his girlfriend at the time.  The guitar work sounds a little too much like a knock off of Neal Schoen.  The song was a massive hit in early 1984, peaking at number 3.  It would be his only solo song to crack the top ten.",

,B00136LJ4Q,-1,1,5,"When I first heard this song, I thought that this was made in the 1980's. But I found out that the song was recorded in 1977. This song sounds like it has a 'disco' influence, with a touch of 'classical rock'. I love the song but I don't know what has happened to the group.",

,B00136NFE8,1,-1,3,"I chose this song because it reflects a relationship between two people. Nothing in a relationship is hidden but, those things that are hidden will effect a relationship. An open relationship should reflect the genuineness of both people in their commitment to one another. This is why I chose this song because she poured her relationship into this song. I loved her honesty in this song, and that's more than enough for a person to buy the song.",
