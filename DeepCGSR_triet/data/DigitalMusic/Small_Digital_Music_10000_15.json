Kesler","reviewText":"Ya' know, it's really easy to criticize, and not something that I like to do in general, preferring to keep my mouth shut and let people dig something they like, and not pointing out the flaws.  For all this album is, in the same light, it floats off into the clouds, is vague, and entirely too sweet for my liking.  What can I say, I need some edges on which to hang my hat ... so it wasn't until the song \"Papercut\" drifted from my speakers, that I had a sense that Tift Merritt actually had something to say, and in a manner that held my attention.  Believe me, it's fine for songs to be etherial, but they need to be memorable, otherwise this is just an album to slip off to on a Sunday morning when you're trying to shield your eyes from the sun as it creeps in through the blinds.\n\nOthers have compared Tift to Sheryl Crow, though she dances on the indy side of the scales.  I once heard Tift in an interview saying that she never really says what she means ... and folks I tell you, it shows.  Sure, this is a very intimate album, at least it was designed to be, it has a really nice opening track \"Mixtape,\" but for the most part See You On The Moon doesn't go anywhere, nor does it allow your imagination to take you anywhere, other then setting the stage for a reflective somber morning about life in general.  In another interview Tift said that she has always subscribed to the less is more attitude ... and that shows as well ... excluding the tracks \"Mixtape,\" and \"Papercut,\" where she subscribes to the more is better philosophy, and has something to say in an exciting manner, lifting the vail of obscurity, and revealing the two finest songs of her career.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","summary":"Tift Merritt - See You on the Moon","unixReviewTime":1354924800,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","summary":"LOVE","unixReviewTime":1452470400,"style":null,"vote":null,"image":null}

I haven't checked out most of her previous work but I was really interested in \"We Are Born\" because it had two of my favorite songs from her, \"Clap Your Hands\" and \"You've Changed\". I'm glad to say that this album as a whole, is stellar! Sia has an awesome vocal range that's so soulful and complex yet she knows how to balance it amidst an electronic sound landscape. She has a lot of strength in her voice but isn't afraid to use it lightly when the time is right. Her lyrics are fun, never too heavy-handed and she takes subject matter that's been done a million times but makes it feel completely new and fresh, you can't help but be swept into the playfulness she exudes with her arrangements. It's a very electronic sound, so if you don't like that, you might not like it all that much. Still, Sia's voice is worth taking a listen. It's crazy to think that no-talent hacks get more play than an accomplished artist like Sia but alas, that's sometimes how it works. Anyway, I highly recommend this album to any and all who want something divine to listen to.","summary":"Ah-mazing!","unixReviewTime":1399939200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"2","image":null}

I have always been a fan of Chrissie's, from the very beginning of the Pretenders first release back around 1979. I have every CD, Concert DVD, Video DVD, & Box Set released by all the various versions of the Pretenders. I even have a DVD of Chrissie & the Pretenders being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, near Chrissie's hometown of Akron, Ohio.\n\nI'm happy for Chrissie, that she has finally found her perfect lover, \"LUCKY JP\". I love Chrissie, but I'm a little jealous of that JP guy. Just like some of the other reviewers, I've always had a crush on Chrissie, but I also love her music and videos. This Deluxe Edition is one great package for a Chrissie Lover. The songs tell a tale about the love story between her and JP, and the struggles they had to overcome. It's a beautiful, real life issue, love story that ends with commitment & fidelity. The Deluxe Edition contains 2 bonus songs: \"Christmas Soon\" and \"Skinny Love\". The Bonus DVD contains videos for \"If You Let Me\", and \"The making of If You Let Me\".\n\nThis is a real treat, for any Pretenders &\/or Chrissie Hynde fan.

Young \"Stevie\" Winwood as he was known back then was just 18 years old when the Spencer Davis Group burst onto the scene in early 1967. Within just a few months the group boasted a pair of Top Ten singles. Yes, the future appeared extremely bright for this four man band from Birmingham, England. But Stevie Winwood had other ideas. Before the end of the year he would leave the Spencer Davis Group to form his own band that he dubbed Traffic. Winwood's timing was impeccable because Top 40 radio was just beginning to wane and within just a few years album-oriented rock stations would come to dominate the FM band. Over the next decade Traffic would become a staple of these AOR radio stations. In 1969 Winwood also became a part of rock's very first supergroup Blind Faith. Then in 1980 Steve Winwood would embark on a highly successful solo career.\n\nDuring the decade of the 1980's Steve Winwood would amass more than a dozen charted singles including 6 Top Ten hits.  Of these the most  acclaimed was hit 1986 # 1 hit \"Higher Love\".  With background vocals from Chaka Kahn \"Higher Love\" would spend a total of 22 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart.  The song would snag a couple of Grammys including \"Record of the Year\" and \"Pop Male Vocal\" of the year.  One of the best singles of the 1980's.","summary":"Rolling Stone counts him among the \"100 Greatest Singers of All-Time\".","unixReviewTime":1470873600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It came out a couple of months before I finally had enough money from my first job after college to buy a 35mm SLR Minolta camera in 1973.

What a hook this song has! Mama did not take Paul's Kodachrome away (the absolute best and Truest color rendering slide film there ever was even though it was the most expensive and slowest ASA speed).  Kodak itself took it away after the digital camera appeared on the scene. Sigh. I upgraded the Minolta camera to another film camera in the mid 80s. I still do not like digital cameras. Have you ever used one between 9 am and 4 pm in the desert on a day with NO clouds? Or outside anywhere during a bright day when there are NO clouds? The LCD viewing screen cannot handle that sun!

Looking back its crazy how \"B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)\" took off. It was a mixtape joint that just blew up out of nowhere. That was like the summer anthem. Then you got Styles P on it. His verse was cut short for some reason. A lot of people felt like SP messed the song up. I disagree, his verse served it purpose.  And then you got two high energy song like \"MC Hammer \"and \"I'm Not a Star\". Yall know those songs will get hype whenever they come one. Yeah, Yeah he recycled the formula but thhe make it work!\n\n\"Freemason\" is another song I like on here. Ross basically trolled everybody with title Lol. Keep in mind this is everybody was running with the Jay Z Illuminati stuff. Me personally, I stay the away from all of that type off stuff. Back to the review, Ross did his thing, but Jay bodied this joint! His wordplay was crazy \"He without sin shall cast the first stone\/ So yall look in the mirror, Double-check your appearance\/ B****, I said I was amazing\/ Not that Im a Mason\/ Its amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in\/ Lord forgive me, I never wouldve made it without sin\".\n\n\"Aston Martin Music\" is just one of those smooth radio joints. The song was so dope that Drake and Chrisette Michele had to make their versions of it! \"Tears of Joy\" is dope too. Cee-Lo did his thing on the hook. Its funny to hear Ross address the DJ Vlad situation.\" A punch in the face get you 300K\/ ask Vlad, Now he back to making minimum wage\/ another victim of my criminal ways\". S***, the punch basically made Vladtv what it is today Lol. I bet Vlad don't regret getting punched one bit Lol. Also check out \"Super High featuring Ne-Yo\" and All The Money In The World featuring Raphael Saadiq, which is one of Ross' most personal joints.\n\nNow lets into the bad. \"No. 1\" is wack! Everything about that song is wack. The lyrics are wack, the beat is wack and the hook is extremely wack. Am I the only one not feeling \"Live Fast, Die Young\" and \"Maybach Music III\"? There weren't necessarily wack, but its something about those two songs that I cant really get into. I really cant put my finger but oh well...Overall I really enjoy this album and I think its safe to say that Teflon don is the most accessible Rick Ross album. I like how short the album is with just 11 tracks. Ross solidified himself in the game and this album took his popularity to a whole new level. I definitely recommend checking this album out.","summary":"Teflon Don, 4 Stars!","unixReviewTime":1472428800,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

He has this special, rare quality to his music that you can't fake or manufacture. Beautiful album by a beautiful band. \"The Suburbs\" is a meaningful and unforgettable album. I listen to it all the time. And I don't care what people say, I also like their latest album, \"Everything Now\". I appreciate that the band are not afraid to change up their sound with each studio album. So with that being said, I recommend ALL 5 of their studio albums, but start with \"The Suburbs\" - it's their most groundbreaking. Enjoy!","summary":"\"Now our lives are changing fast, hope that something pure can last...\"","unixReviewTime":1512432000,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Bob Lind was a folk-rock singer-songwriter from Baltimore. After dropping out of college Bob moved to Denver and began working the local folk clubs. Shortly thereafter he made a demo tape. The folks at Liberty records were duly impressed and signed Lind to their World Pacific subsidiary. Among the tunes on that demo was \"Elusive Butterfly\" which became his first and only hit single peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1966. Much was expected of the follow-up record \"Truly Julie's Blues\" but it proved to be a major disappointment. The well must have run dry because for all intents and purposes Bob Lind was never heard from again. Still, \"Elusive Butterfly\" is a beautiful song that is well worth remembering.","summary":"Big things were predicted for this singer-songwriter from Baltimore.","unixReviewTime":1468281600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

People was a pop-rock group from San Jose, CA. In 1968 Capirol records released a single called \"I Love You\" that had originally been recorded by The Zombies and released in August 1965 as the B-side of the single \"Whenever You're Ready\". That record went absolutely nowhere in the U.S. and the tune had been largely forgotten until early 1968 when People decided to record a cover version. \"I Love You\" did quite well in the USA peaking at #14 and selling more than a million copies worldwide. It was also a hit in Japan, Australia, Mexico and Canada. Once you know that the tune was originally a Zombies song it seems so obvious. I just don't know why I never made the connection.

Grindle","reviewText":"Much in the same league as Miles Davis,Prince,Paul McCartney,Ramsey Lewis and other unpredictible musical talents who scare the same astrological sign Brian McKnight is also a soul artist. That means that by the very essense of the music he has two sides to his creative personality. In his case,one side wants to say...appease a female companion or purely be himself. Usually the former element wins out,both musically and lyrically. So the title of albums is very appropriate as duality IS the theme of this album. Both of duality of himself as a musician and that of his general personality as well. In the end they both often work hand and hand. Brian McKngight has always had just a little too soft a touch on the romantic end of things,taking only that element generally from his influences and not their sense of irony and multi faceted outlook on the topic. Not only that he chose one of the most appropriate influences to draw on with this final release for him on the Motown label.\n\n  One of the major clishes of the last couple of decades in the R&B world is what I refer to as \"the next Marvin Gaye\" syndrome. Often enough this departed talent is used as a measuring stick by which almost all emotionally naked modern neo\/retro soul influenced music is measured. In this case,as if it wasn't present in a huge way already McKnight takes the Gaye influence to the next level. More in the groove with a heavier bottom than the previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/U-Turn\/dp\/B00008H2L6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">U Turn<\/a>. In fact on the defiant hearted \"Grown Man Business\" and \"She\" they grooves and melodies are downright hard-the bass line brooding and pumping in particular on the latter for two of the funkiest numbers McKnight ever laid down. Even more midtempo shuffles such as \"What We Do Here\" and \"Stay\" feature a similar type of flavor. Some songs such as \"Everytime You Go Away\" and \"Here With You\" explore McKnights already well explored weaker emotional side,again ready to cave into denying his True emotions to fawn over and weakly beg to his lover.\n\n  Now it's on the final four songs that the Marvin Gaye influence comes on the strongest. Strong funky soul grooves \"Come Back\" and \"Watcha' Gonna Do\" as well as the breezy,spare jazz style of \"Your Song\" all come purely out of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/What-s-Going-On\/dp\/B00007FOMP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">What's Going On<\/a>&nbsp;school of cinematic Motown soul\/funk. The last tune \"Me & You\" takes on the flavor,both musically and lyrically of the \"other\" famous Motown male solo star (we all know who that is) in looking at the analogy of Jesus's crusifiction along with McKnight's own racial identity struggle as a possible reason why he along with so many others in the black community in America turn to the Christian faith as a means of inner salvation. So many of these tracks have great grooves,great meaning and the concept hangs well together as an album. Being that the few weaker and stereotypical McKnight tunes fit so perfectl into this concept this is one Brian McKnight album that is actually very consistant. And because it showcases his abilities at their best it also qualifies as one of his strongest full lengh album releases.","summary":"The Two Headed Hydra Explores His Twin Nature","unixReviewTime":1308096000,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Many catchy songs, and a few that could inspire you to hit the dance floor, but OMD also still have that a darker, creative edge that colors other tunes.

I admit that I was drawn in because of the guitars and the well timed singing of this song. However, I did not figure out the meaning of the song until after I lived here in the Washington D.C. area (through online sources).

Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war. German artists are so avant garde, like Mike Myer's Dieter.","summary":"Swiss German translation of 99 Luftballon","unixReviewTime":1473552000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Sparing no expense to work with some of the top people in the music industry, Shambhu set out from California for the bucolic splendor of Vermont to record at the studio of Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy winner Will Ackerman. To say that the supporting musicians are an all-star cast would be an understatement, and includes bassist Tony Levin, who plays with Peter Gabriel, Eugene Friesen of The Paul Winter Consort on cello, and a host of other top notch musicians who tour with the likes of Santana, Pat Metheny, Ravi Shankar, Yanni, and more.\n\nBut at the center of this luminous universe is acoustic guitarist and composer Shambhu. In his own words, \"My compositions reflect a diversity of musical influences from across the globe, from contemplative to Indian-jazz fusion to contemporary instrumental.\"  All radiating a \"heartfelt feeling throughout.\" This is simply some of the finest music of this type that I have ever heard. And I'm obviously not the only who thinks that, since the album was named \"One of the Best of the Year\" for contemporary music by Common Ground magazine and has received nominations for Best New Artist, Best Album of the Year, Best World Music CD, and Best Acoustic Instrumental CD. A track from this CD is featured on a recently released compilation entitled \"The Gathering,\" produced by Will Ackerman.\n\nOne of the outstanding features of this project is that it is actually a multi-media experience. Shambhu thoughtfully filmed the entire recording process, and in the beautiful accompanying booklet, entitled \"A Guide To The Journey,\" as well as on his website are links for the videos on YouTube, which I found absolutely fascinating. \"Sacred Love\" is a journey well worth taking.","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1341532800,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

His music inspires you to open your heart and to hear the vibrations of love and compassion. It gives a rest for your soul and helps to achieve clearness for your mind.\n\n\"Sacred Love\" is the debut album by Shambhu. It was produced by legendary Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy winner Will Ackerman. Many first class musicians have participated on the recording of this release. As a result \"Sacred Love\" is a multicolored carpet which imbues with the aromas of various cultures and musical traditions.\n\nThe debut album by Shambhu has the unique, mesmeric flavor of the music of India. And at the same time it is a really western born project. Cello, violin and other parts of traditional instruments bring tenderness and a classical charm to \"Sacred Love\".\n\nOne wants to listen to these fine tunes very attentively in order to not to miss each nuance. Shambhu's music is penetrated by many subtle details and when you listen to the composition \"Imagine\" you, without effort, are able to recognize the thoughtful and slightly ringing guitar of Will Ackerman. His touching soul manner of performing cannot be confused with anybody else.\n\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that \"Sacred Love\" has a perfect sound design. Its sounding is pure and exquisite.

Olsen \/ Review Publicist","reviewText":"When you integrate one proficient acoustic guitarist with select vocalists and instrumentalists, along with the skillful production talents of Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy Winner Will Ackerman, the final product might expectedly be a top rated album compiled by dedicated music professionals that virtually everyone would love and appreciate.\n\nShambhu is the proficient guitarist clearly asserting in his website news pages that his first album has truly been a \" labor of love \" while composing, performing and co-producing with Will Ackerman, along with his time spent working beside other top music professionals.  This I can believe since at the end of the day, Shambhu and his insightful selection of collaborating musicians has paid off rather handsomely, and by their collective time spent together, have helped convert this debut release into a commodity of premium value.\n\nSacred Love - Feel The Journey is New Age Fusion, Contemporary Instrumental, and Jazz, having East, West, and World elements which help facilitate the conversion of artful melodies into solid gold entertainment that requires only simple involvement for the rest of us to acquire the appreciable benefits of this grand endeavor.  Sacred Love has already achieved a quantifiable amount of success, where at present Sacred Love - Feel The Journey is # 1 for the month of October 2010 in ZMR's Top 100 Chart, but I also have a feeling this album will appreciate in value even more over time.\n\nShambhu is an esteemed musician in his own right performing concerts or on albums with top music entertainers like Bob Hope, Carlos Santana, Jon Anderson and on Whitney Houston's multi-platinum album titled simply Whitney.  The list goes on since Shambhu has also been involved in projects with many of the respected musicians I continually write about like Will Ackerman, Jeff Oster, Eugene Friesen, Ann Licater plus many more.\n\nSacred Love - Feel The Journey on the Acoustic Shine label has an impressive cast and crew since many have toured or recorded with top musical groups themselves.  Some of these artists on Shambhu's album include Tony Levin of Peter Gabriel on bass, Jeff Haynes of Pat Metheny on percussion, George Brooks of John McLaughlin on saxophone, Celso Alberti of Steve Winwood on drums, and then Premik Tubbs of Santana and John McLaughlin on flute.\n\nTogether is the first of 12 songs total and what a memorable impression it creates.  The center stage guitar and violin pairing established securely alongside flute and reflective instrumentation is magnificent, plus it is easy to visualize this song and others in a Cinematic role since the warm, sincere, and dynamic atmosphere echo the characteristic essentials for a multitude of made for the big screen movie settings.\n\nNatural Moment is a warm and casual song that positively takes off and ascends to new heights.  First expressed during the initial sequences, xylophone and numerous percussion enhancements become the lively components that merge into a free spirited narrative complete with smooth and graceful electric guitar rhythms which intensify and progress neatly into a picturesque arrangement.\n\nMaiu Breeze is refreshing by exhibiting a jazzy tropical presence.  First conveyed by acoustic guitar highlights, the integral xylophone rhythms and harmonious vocals filled with energy and vitality are a natural accompaniment to the guitar arrangement.  Together they merge perfectly to bring out the compositional fascination of this album and its entirety, creating a dynamic atmosphere that leaves one with an impression of total harmonic refinement.\n\nThis first release by Shambhu will always be termed a debut as one might expect, but when you consider his proficiency as a guitarist, the impressive number of outstanding talents on this extraordinary album, and their combined lifework totaling a significant number of decades as esteemed music professionals, then this masterful first album by Shambhu truly does amount to a rewarding and appreciable \" labor of love. \"\n\nFull musician credits are Eugene Friesen - cello, Charlie Bisharat - violin, Ravichandra Kulur - flute, Michael Manring - bass, Jill Haley - English horn, Claytoven Richardson - lead vocal, Jeff Oster - flugelhorn, Noah Wilding - vocals Todd Boston - sarod, mixed and engineered by Grammy Award winning Corin Nelsen.","summary":"Review from NewAgeMusicWorld.

Styles range from quiet meditations to Indian-jazz fusion, and some very impressive musicians join Shambhu on a wide variety of instruments. To quote Shambhu: \"my work has one goal: to convey a celestial abode in music and superb musicianship that invite listeners to explore, enjoy and reflect within.... 'Sacred Love' invites full-on, soulful listening.\" While it's True that this music won't stay in the background, it can provide a colorful backdrop for other activities. The blending of Eastern and Western musical traditions gives Shambhu's music a very distinctive sound, and the incredible team of Ackerman and engineer Corin Nelsen makes the quality of that sound as close to perfection as it can get.\n\n\"Sacred Love\" opens with \"Together,\" a joyful and optimistic piece that features Charlie Bisharat on violin, Premik Russell Tubbs on wind synth, and Tony Levin on bass - a great beginning! \"Edge of Eternal\" is quieter and more subdued, and features Imaginary Road regulars Jill Haley on English horn, Eugene Friesen on cello, and Noah Wilding on wordless vocals - lovely! \"Eyes of a Child\" is a gorgeous guitar solo that \"expresses the illumination of a child who still marvels at the beauty of simplicity and the simplicity of beauty.\" My favorite track is \"Natural Moment,\" a lively and upbeat celebration of oneness and cultural diversity. Shambhu performs on guitars, sitar, synth pads, and kalimba backed by Tony Levin, Charlie Bisharat, Jeff Haynes (percussion), and Rocky Fretz (piano). If you can keep your body still while listening to this one, you really need to loosen up a bit! \"Revelation\" is another favorite. It begins as a graceful duet for guitar and cello, later adding English horn, bass, and light percussion. A slow, tranquil flow creates a musical daydream. \"Maui Breeze\" is as light and refreshing as its title. Claytoven Richardson (vocals) and Jeff Oster (flugelhorn) also appear on this track. \"Shiva Grove\" is an east\/west jazz fusion with sax (George Brooks) and flute (Ravichandra Kulur) soaring over the chordal guitar foundation. \"Humility\" is the concluding bonus track, and is a duet for guitar and flute (Kulur). Also an east\/west fusion, it conveys gratitude and humility before \"the Source of Creation\" and brings this exciting album to a close.  Recommended!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1289174400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Yet, it is so sad that it has been 35 years since John Lennon was tragically murdered, and the songs that he has recorded on his own, and with The Beatles have stood the test of time deeper than meets the eye. I honestly have loved the songs that he had recorded near the very end of his life, when he released his Double Fantasy album. The songs from that album have stood taller than almost everything he has recorded from the 70's. One of my favorites is Woman, because of its simplicity in saying I love you in just a simple ballad. t truthfully is one of those songs that really takes me into a time where I do wish that John Lennon was still making music, before he died. He wrote this song to share his heart with Yoko Ono, and it still is a lovely song after all this time. If you love John Lennon, than download this song.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Loving Heart","unixReviewTime":1430870400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Prior to releasing that hit, she released the lesser known, but exceptionally good song \"Starry Eyed\".  Unlike \"Lights\", \"Starry Eyed\" has a slower, more deliberate pace for a ballad about being caught in those moments where lovers are lost in each other's world together.  One of the nicer aspects of \"Starry Eyed\" is the accompanying music video, which has Ellie and her on-screen boyfriend stargazing and getting lost together at twilight.  For anyone who is a fan of \"Battlestar Galactica\", they could easily make you think of Apollo and Starbuck.  Ellie is going to be big.  I can't wait for her next work.","summary":"Intoxicating, cinematic ballad","unixReviewTime":1371600000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I heard this song on Pandora and immediately fell in love with it.  It provided a glimpse at what Ellie Goulding's potential.  This song sounds great on really good headphones or speakers with lots of bass.  Ellie Goulding is a self taught musician and her range is nicely displayed in this song.  She also uses lots of cool electronic effects in this song similar to Anything Can Happen.\n\nOn what this song is about:\n\"It's about letting go. As opposed to all the sad and depressing things I write about, I decided to write something about the joining together of people in some kind of euphoric statebe it at a festival, at a show or in a club. I wanted a song that would reach out to people of every background and every enjoyment, whether you enjoy a natural high, taking drugs, drinking or whatever. Because I'm essentially a pop artist I wanted to write a song that everyone can relate to.\"","summary":"Makes me Starry Eyed","unixReviewTime":1368489600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The past several years, he had battled alcoholism, and was dropped from his LaFace label after a lackluster set of songs. So it has been awhile for him to regain his footing on his music. He has tried it again with his latest single, Love Like This from his album Lyrics. I really didn't find the song to be anything really out of the ordinary to what he could've turned out to be in his songs. It really wasn't really anything to rave about, to deliver from his Where I Wanna Be mastered days. Hopefully, he can deliver with more amazement for his fans to accept him all over again.

I commented sceptically on the enthusiastic welcome given this disc by another fellow reviewer , the Santa Fe Listener, but am again ready to recant and say that five years later I am convinced that Grigolo is managing his vocal and career development very wisely. Perhaps the continued dearth of really Italianate tenors has made me more susceptible to his gifts but I am now genuinely enthused about his ability to carry the torch.\n\nThe best things about his voice apart from its intrinsic beauty are his evenness of production, the way in which he inflects the music with musically acute details and the clarity of his diction. He has studied and acquired all the little vocal refinements which allow a singer to inject the note with emotion without being too overt about it; hence he has mastered the judicious use of portamento,  the acciaccatura, the messa di voce and the despatch of fioratura - all of which may be heard to perfection in the best track here from the same role in which I have just heard him live, \"Una furtiva lagrima\".\n\nI was surprised that he opes this recital with an aria from a heavier, spinto tenor role but he manages it without strain and even returns to a second aria from \"Un ballo in maschera\"sings in track11. He does not here yet have quite the full weight of voice to do it full justice but his attention to colouring the text is exemplary. The programme includes several weightier arias alongside some standard bel canto numbers;hence early and middle period Verdi features, as does some heftier Puccini, as an indication of the direction he has gradually been taking since. In fact, there are only two Donizetti arias here;the rest are all from those two other composers.\n\nWhile his voice does not have the distinctive ping of the young Pavarotti, he sounds far more pharyngeal and virile than Bocelli - and I like his chutzpah in throwing in a high C sharp at the end of the aria from \"Il corsaro\". I look forward to bigger and better - but all in good time as he is still three years off forty as I write.\n\n(PS: the three supporting comprimario voices who make brief appearances in two tracks are absolutely dire - why?)","summary":"One to watch and keep watching.","unixReviewTime":1416960000,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":"2","image":null}

Firstly it expands her repertoire considerably and presumably her live shows will be able to be more fleshed out. Secondly this album has her showing a bit more restraint in terms of the guitar solos and she also uses more of a whispering vocal style in parts which is different if not actually a good thing.\n\nObviously when you come out of the blocks with a debut as good as Ms Taylor did the follow up won't hit people as hard and this album doesn't. But it has a danker feel of grit to it than the aforementioned debut and that isn't a bad thing. Issues arise however with the whispering vocals that fade into obscurity at times, songs that just don't sparkle like those of the debut and the guitar tones sought here seem obtusely thicker without necessarily obtaining extra gravitas as part of the deal.\n\nHighlights on this album would have to be the slow starting first track, Can't Keep Living Like This, Dead and Gone and the title track. Dead and Gone in particular sounds like it would be out of place on the first tune with the guitar and vocal riding a melody that is both plaintive and upbeat at the same time with a tasty fade out solo.","summary":"Good follow up album.","unixReviewTime":1396051200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It might even be in my top 5 Cube records. The lyrics were so on point, between it and Laugh Now Cry Later, it really seemed like hed found that spark he had when writing stories back between 90-93.\n\nThe music and beaten on I Am The West is probably my favorite since Lethal Injection because it was modern AND extremely unique, not just piggybacking off whatever sound is popular the minut he was writing the song... because if you write a song to be popular right then, chances are, in 6 months when its released, its gonna sound played out, let alone a year or two from now when you're looking for something to listen to... bottom line, musically, this is top 5 of his to me.\n\nBut now the problem... the reason this album only gets 3 stars is because this is the FIRST album hes put out in his (at the time) 24 year career containing ALL but one song (Hood Robbin) is essentially just emceeing the whole time... in other words, just bragging about himself and his skills\/rep. Gone are the stories and descriptions of life in that way that only he does.\n\nThe whole reason Cube has stood above the rest is because hes always balanced the emceeing with the storytelling (with a strong majority on each album leaning towards the latter) because Cube was supposed to be ABOVE that petty garbage and all the rappers that based their entire careers off doing just that.\n\nBOTTOM LINE, any Cube album is a great rap album because no one does it like him. The music is great, his lyrics are still great, its just the subject matter is weak, and unfortunately, subject matter makes up about 51% of the reason that an album great, and about 80% of the reason an album is worth listening to more than once.","summary":"In a perfect world, Id rate it 3.5, but since I cant... sorry Cube...

He led the NYPO for several years from the late 40's to the late 50's, with the great Leonard Bernstein following him. Mitropoulos had a brilliant way of conducting modern music that wasn't heard too often back then, with a conducting style that was once compared to a \"Byzantine monk furiously shaking martinis\". One of the composers he excelled in was Gustav Mahler, back when Mahler was rarely heard. This is a live performance of the \"Tragic\" sixth symphony from April 10th, 1955. It is very, very, good, if a bit flawed in a few places. For one thing, the sound quality is surprisingly good for a live recording from the mid 50's. But, there is a patch of some kind of electrical hiss or whirl in the fourth movement. Maybe it's the download or it's the original recording, but it's very annoying. Fortunately, it only lasts about 2 or 3 minutes. The audience is not too intrusive with coughing and such.\n  As for the actual performance, it's fantastic. The work moves at a nice pace and sounds like the sixth should at almost all the right spots. The second and third movements are presented as andante followed by the scherzo. You know, one way you can always tell a True Mahler fan apart is to ask them the question \"Which do you prefer, scherzo before andante, or andante before scherzo?\" A True fan will know just what you mean, and then be emphatic on their opinion of the order of those movements. I have always preferred the Scherzo before the andante, perhaps because that's the way I first heard the symphony. You know what they say about first impressions. Plus, I feel IMHO that you need that long, beautiful andante to come before the nearly 30 minute finale. The metabolism, or \"Blood Pressure\" if you will, of the work needs to slow and calm down in order to prepare both you and itself for that finale. Could you imagine Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the molto vivace scherzo coming right before the Ode to Joy finale, and not the slow movenent? The same goes for Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 or Mahler's Fourth. Now I can't damn the performance or recording because of this. It's a personal preference, and of course andante before scherzo does work for a lot of Mahlerites.\n  In the end, this recording is for die-hard Mahler fans. Or die-hard Mitropoulos fans. If you want a good first recording of the sixth, try Pierre Boulez and the VPO on DG, which is the best version I've ever heard. George Szell also does great version with the Cleveland Orchestra, now out of print I think. As for Bernstein, the second version, on DG from the 80's is also a must have.--------------PEACE","summary":"For die-hard Mahler fans, or die-hard Mitropoulos fans.","unixReviewTime":1487030400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It was a revelation to me, and I have heard many Sixths! I had never heard Mitropoulos' Mahler until now, and he captures the drama and tragedy of this amazing work, Mahler's most \"classical\" symphony (4 movements with inner slow and scherzo movements) and yet most anti-classical symphony! My first experience of the Sixth was Bernstein's Columbia recording of 1967. That recording sold me on Mahler as my favorite composer. Now having heard this recording, I must say this ranks in the top 2 or 3 recordings of the work!

I have to say that apart from a few minor burbles from the trumpet and horns which remain perfectly acceptable in a live, I am amazed by the unanimity of their drive and attack; Mitropoulos galvanises them into giving a truly ferocious account of the stretti passages in the first and final movements and they are very sharp in following both the conductor's beat and the frequent switches in rhythm and time signatures characteristic of Mahler's scores. It is clear that Bernstein by no means had it all to do in familiarising this orchestra with Mahler in the sixties; his mentor had obviously already rained and enthused them.\n\nThe only reason to regret the slightly raw and quite resonant mono sound is in the huge, tutti climaxes of the finale, when Mitropoulos generates an extraordinarily glorious cacaphony as the titanic struggle between optimism and despair unfolds; otherwise the acoustic, by accentuating the typically strident whistle of the violins when they are playing high up on the bridge, if anything, adds to the excitement. However, Mitropoulos knows when to let the music swoon and sigh and again prompts me to wonder just how influential he was in informing Bernstein's own style in Mahler.\n\nThere is some radio whistle a few minutes into that finale and the audience are a bit restive up top that point, too, but both irritations pass and Mitropoulos keeps the screws on to the bitter end - and indeed it is, deeply dark and forlorn.\n\nI have an entirely irrelevant and personal reason for favouring this recording; it happens to have been made on the same Easter Sunday over sixty years ago when I first saw the light of day...","summary":"\"Energico\" is the key; this would be a first choice if it were stereo","unixReviewTime":1432857600,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":"2","image":null}

April 10th, 1955.  I share the lead reviewer's enthusiasm, especially because the only other Mitropoulos Sixth in my collection is wretchedly played by the Cologne WDR orchestra.  But I must disagree with the lead reviewer about the precision of this New York performance. The first trumpet barely squeezes out the exposed high note at the beginning (it must be treacherous, since in a live reading by Karajan and the Berliners the first trumpet actually misses the same note). Other mistakes, such as the occasional struggling horns in the finale,  are minor, to my ears at least, and overall the execution is miles ahead of what we heard from Cologne. Like Hermann Scherchen and Jascha Horenstein, Mitropoulos managed to be great and sloppy at the same time.\n\nthe lead reviewer considers the tempo for the andante to be unusually slow, but at 15:02, Mitropoulos's pacing is a minute slower than Bernstein and two minutes slower than Karajan, both on DG. Where he is certainly right, though, is in the spontaneity and intensity of this recording. At his best Mitropoulos was a passionate conductor with a sense of real aliveness, like is protege Bernstein. Yet there is a sense of poise, also, making Bernstein's two readings more impetuous overall. Mitropoulos takes the opening march in the first movement at an almost stately pace, closer to Barbirolli than to those who take Bernstein's cue and drive the beat home with crushing immediacy and threat. The Scherzo is quick and forceful; by contrast Tennstedt is far more harrowing in his recent live reading with the London Phil.  the tendency to underline Mahler's emotional extremes was much less present in Mitropoulos's day, and what seemed biting then is fairly normal now -- which isn't to take away from the spontaneity and excitement of his Scherzo.\n\nIn the finale Mitropoulos doesn't go for the nerve-racking intensity of Bernstein and (especially) Tennstedt, allowing quite a few moments of relaxed rhythm and measured pacing. But it's all in the service of a slow build that finds the right moment to crest in terrifying outcries. Some may feel that however great a performance, the Mahler sixth needs full spectrum stereo. Here we have excellent, well-balanced mono without microphone distortion or a radio producer riding the gain during climaxes (not that noticeably, at least).  I had no trouble finding the version at hand, from the Archipel label, not the one pictured here, quite listenable. I even wonder if this French off-label didn't pirate the NY Phil. source.\n\nAt this moment used copies of the complete Mahler broadcasts sell for $450, so being able to attain a decent-sounding version of tis famous Sixth is a boon. It fully justifies its reputation.","summary":"Mitropoulos's famous Sxith from New York, in very listenable sound","unixReviewTime":1288051200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":"3","image":null}

If you thought you knew ABiCA with their previous releases then this album is gonna hit you hard as it's a giant leap in quality.\n\nHash and Tac who are the two mcs\/vocalists in ABiCA have a great interplay style, it helps that they both have distinct voices and don't sound like each other. The album opens with the soft sound of piano keys on title track \"Numb\" before the vocals kick in, it's a brave move for a band to start a debut album on such a quiet note, in reality it's just easing you into the next 55 minutes of varying styles. \"Tell Us Why\" comes bouncing out with heavy beats and industrial sounding guitars as Tac and Hash are joined by Binary Audio who were two thirds of the British band Radiator, Janne Jarvis joins on vocals and the song has a real Nine Inch Nails style to it. \"Turn Me On\" has a great interplay of vocals and keeps the album flowing into \"My Song\" which features former memeber Cant on vocals, the track is a hip hop delight and will keep longtime ABiCA fans happy. The track features a cool loop throughout the track.\n\n\"The things You Think I Say\" features Approaching Nirvana on vocals and he gives the song a Linkin Park laid back sound. \"The Pursuit\" sounds like vintage \"Licensed To Ill\" Beastie Boys. \"Take This Away\" starts with a haunting piano and has Hash delivering some heavy lines as Tac sings in the background, it's a perfect example of both members varying styles working rally well. On \"I Can Be Real\" ABiCA get real heavy, with some big drums and heavy guitars, the song is produced by Tweaker Ray who has mixed many a Nine Inch nails song himself, his production qualities really shine on the track.\n\nABiCA even give us a big dance sounding track on \"Gave Em A Reason\" a track that features a big chorus. Former member Cant appears again on \"Blurry\". The final track \"What You See\" is a rock stomper with Tac leading the vocal duties, it's a great way to finish off the album. The only complaint you can really level at the album is that at 16 songs it might be too long, especially for a debut and considering the short attention span climate we now live in.\n\nWith \"Numb\" ABiCA have set the mark high for their next album, which should be ready to go by late 2011 early 2012. It's amazing to think the Tac and Hash have produced and released their own album, the sound quality is great as good as you would get on any major record label release, the artwork is cool with detailed information on who produced and engineered what as well as what the guest performers roll in each track was. ABiCA have drawn many comparisons to Linkin Park, Nine Inch Nails, Eminem and the Beastie Boys, for me they sound a bit like Pop Will Eat Itself \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" era a former English band who featured Black Swan composer Clint Mansell on Vocals.

It took a few listens for me to truly grasp this band, but in the end I found Numb to be a very competent effort from a band that quite plainly has a bright future ahead of them.\n\nThe music teeters between full-on hip-hop\/rap to alternative rap\/rock reminiscent of Limp Bizkit and old Linkin Park. Layers of synths swirl alongside heavy guitars and drums to create an energetic soundscape that completely carries this album. The production on the record is top-notch, and some of the best instrumentation I've heard in this genre. Furthermore, the album has just the right amount of variety to keep it interesting. At sixteen tracks, you may think it'll be a bit on the long side, but the songs sound different enough that you will never feel the length. Standout tracks include \"Tell Us Why\", \"The Things You Think I Say\", \"Take This Away\", \"Gave Em A Reason\", \"Never That Far Away\" and \"What You See\". I must especially single out \"Gave Em A Reason\" as probably the best track on this album. It's a high-energy thrasher that keeps going till the very end. On a side-note, from hearing the record I would imagine Abica's live shows to be some of the most energetic and intense around!\n\nUnfortunately, the album does stumble in a few places. Lyrically, it's hit or miss. Not that the lyrics are bad, far from it, but they sometimes feel a bit overly simplistic. It's striking since it's such a stark contrast from the meticulously-crafted music behind them. A prime example of this is \"Beautiful\", which despite the brilliant backdrop ends up being a rather generic hook-up song. Another head-scratcher is \"Blurry\", which is an awkward reconstruction of the song \"24\" by Jem (with no mention of original songwriters Jem Griffiths and Justin Griffiths in the linear notes). It's not a remake, the music, beat and chorus share the same melody with \"24\" but the lyrics are original. I personally felt the song lacks the punch of Jem's version and ends up the weakest point on the record. Also, and this isn't really criticism, around two times on the album there is some very melodic singing during the song's bridge. I would really like to hear more of that! Not that the rapping and raspy vocals are bad, but the singing just added a little uplift that gave those songs a little more depth.\n\nBut ultimately, Numb's numerous strengths far outweigh its few drawbacks. Abica has created a strong and robust album that's sure to please fans and invite new ones. I really enjoy this album, and I definitely look forward to future releases. I'm anxious to see how this band grows and evolves in the years to come.","summary":"A very strong album!","unixReviewTime":1287619200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The band sent me a promo CD and I've listened to it a number of times trying to figure out how a feel about it. It isn't a style I normally listen to, so I want to be as objective as possible. The music doesn't want you to be objective though. It wants you to feel and get deep down into it.\n\nIf forced to classify it, rap-rock with and industrial influence is as close as I can come. I think Tac and Hash are really trying to something unique here. In some instances they succeed wonderfully while in others they fall back in to cliche. Their rap interplay works well yet their singing voices leave a little to be desired. The big strength of Numb is its the lyrics. Very well thought out, you really get into their heads. These songs are brimming with emotion, though I'd say the predominant one is angst. The F-bomb gets dropped frequently, but it only serves to emphasize the more meaningful lyrics.\n\nMusically I really dig most of Abica's songs. There are some very cool things going on in the songs and repeat listens are needed to pick out some of the more subtle stuff. I'd compare them to Trent Reznor, but their studio wizardry isn't quite to that level. Yet. It is well on it's way and very listenable. I'd just like to hear a bit more dynamic range and a slightly less \"processed\" sound. While Abica covers a wide range of topics and a few different styles, in the end it one song comes out sounding a bit like the next. But if you want strong beats, emotionally driven lyrics and catchy hooks, then maybe that isn't such a bad thing. It has grown on me and I am willing to bet that album #2 takes things to the next level.\n\nStandouts for me:\n\nWhat You See\nNumb\nMy Song\nBlurry\nThe Things You Think I Say\nTake This Away\nNever That Far Away\nNothing Here\nBeautiful\nGave Em A Reason","summary":"Gave Em A Reason","unixReviewTime":1287446400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51jkP6GsR6L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61TwHxWHipL._SY88.jpg"]}

I remember the song when it first came out because it was being promoted for the newer version of the Charlie's Angels Movie (Charlie's angels is even quoted in the song). I like the positive theme to the song about learning to always be independent in all areas of your life, and of it being 50\/50 in relationships. The song sends a positive message to avoid depending on others to give you what you want, and to instead find ways to obtain your desires through your own means (the group cleverly does this by using lyrics such as \"the shoes on my feet, I bought it\", and with mentioning how they even paid for the place they live in). This is also a good song to listen to for putting oneself in a prosperous state of mind.  Overall, this is definitely a song to listen to if you like any of Beyonce's songs and\/or any music from Destiny's Child.","summary":"A Good Song about Empowerment","unixReviewTime":1296172800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

In fact, between 1974 and 1986 Don would amass an impressive total of 17 #1 hits on Billboard's Top Country Singles chart.  Despite all of his success as a country artist Don Williams could never seem to come up with the crossover hit that most country artists were always looking for.  Then in 1980 he recorded a ballad written by Roger Cook and Sam Hogin.  Don finally had his crossover hit.  \"I Believe In You\" spent an impressive 20 weeks on Billboard's Hit 100 pop charts peaking at #24 in November of that year.  Meanwhile, \"I Believe In You\" would also become Don's eleventh #1 country hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","summary":"BEAUTIFUL","unixReviewTime":1452470400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It's simple, but its synth beats and \"yodeling\" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!","summary":"The fun more than makes up for the lack of substance.","unixReviewTime":1501286400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Sexton","reviewText":"This is a cheerful CD that I picked up at a Peter Noone and the Hermits concert. Some of the songs I hadn't heard before (not surprising since they were hits in the UK, not the US), but many I had. Yes, I sing along with this vocal candy ( a guilty pleasure is I'm Henry VIII, I Am). It puts a bounce in my walk and is perfect to do clean by -- all that energy seems to make chores easier.\n\nIf you enjoy 1960's pop music, you should definitely include this group in your collection.","summary":"Cheerful music!","unixReviewTime":1487462400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}
{"overall":5.0,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"10 31, 2015","reviewerID":"A1GIIPXONCEEHP","asin":"B004CT4I2Q","reviewerName":"Steve Vrana","reviewText":"Sure, Peter Noone was a safe teenybopper idol and the Hermits weren't frequently used in the studio, but what a great string of lightweight pop singles they left behind in the wake of the second wave of the British Invasion. In 1965 alone they had six Top 10 singles (including two No. 1's) and sold millions of records, rivaling The Beatles for chart dominance.\n\nGranted, this music isn't quantum physics, but songs like \"I'm Into Something Good,\" \"Silhouettes\" and \"Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" were infectious ear candy for those of us who were barely in our teens in the mid-sixties. One of the first six albums I bought (I now have over 7,000) was INTRODUCING HERMAN'S HERMITS with the three previously mentioned singles on it. It also contained a lot of covers like \"Sea Cruise\" and \"I Understand,\" but this was a singles band which is what makes this such a terrific collection. The only singles missing are their last two to chart in the U.S.--\"Don't Go Out Into the Rain (You're Going To Melt)\" and \"Museum,\" both from 1967.\n\nInstead we're given a handful of failed US singles from 1968 to their breakup in 1970, although several of them hit the top ten in the UK.  Since this is, after all, a UK release it only makes sense that these songs--though unfamiliar to the average American listener--are included in this Best Of package. [Note: No. 1 songs like \"Mrs. Brown\" and \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\" are on this set, too, even though they were never released in the UK as singles. So this collection seems to be a compromise for fans on both sides of the Atlantic.]\n\nHere is the complete track listing:\n\n1. I'm Into Something Good (US #13, UK #1)\n2. Show Me Girl (UK #19)\n3. Silhouettes (US #5, UK #3)\n4. Can't You Hear My Hearbeat ((US #2)\n5. Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (US #1)\n6. Wonderful World (US #4, UK #7)\n7. I'm Henry VIII, I Am (US #1)\n8. Listen People (US #3)\n9. Dandy (US #5)\n10. Just a Little Bit Better (US #7, UK #15)\n11. A Must To Avoid (US #8, UK #6)\n12. You Won't Be Leaving (UK #20)\n13. This Door Swings Both Ways (US #12, UK #18)\n14. No Milk Today (US #35, UK #7)\n15. East West (US #27, UK #33)\n16. There's a Kind of Hush (US # 4, UK #7) [Note: Their final US top 10, 1967]\n17. I Can Take or Leave Your Loving (US #22, UK #11) [Note: Their final US top 40, 1968]\n18. Sleepy Joe (US #61, UK #12)\n19. Sunshine Girl (UK #8)\n20. Something's Happening (UK #6)\n21. My Sentimental Friend (UK #2)\n22. Here Comes the Star (UK #33)\n23. Years May Come, Years May Go (UK #7)\n24. Bet Yer Life I Do (UK #22)\n25. Lady Barbara (UK #13) [Note: Their final UK single, 1970]\n\nThe skimpy four-page booklet provides a brief history of the band, only one photo (the cover shot--minus Karl Greene), and a track listing that includes the songwriter and year of release. The CD label says \"stereo,\" but there is no mention of remastering.\n\nLast summer, I saw Peter Noone and a touring version of the Hermits (no original members) at a free concert. It was great fun to listen to him sing the old hits, and this generous 25-track compilation provides a nastolgic trip down memory lane.

I liked the song so much that it caused me to make my first and worst mail order record purchase. The TV had advertised a record called Muskrat Love, which had this song plus many other popular songs of the time, like Rubberband Man, Nadia's Theme, Theme from Airport '76, Car Wash, Boogie Fever, Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word. Some real tepid stuff. Unfortunately, what I failed to understand about Muskrat Love from the commercial, was that these songs were not the original artist recordings. They were covers that sounded very close to the originals but not quite. I think my Mom tried to explain this to me before she helped me send $3.99 to some PO box in Michigan, but I probably didn't understand. After waiting 4-6 weeks for delivery, which is a lifetime to a nine year old, the album arrived and I eagerly placed it on the turntable. Right away, I knew something was amiss. More Than A Feeling sounded weird. I still listened to the album, but soon soured on it and eventually tossed it in the creek across from our house. I was disappointed, flabbergasted. How could someone be allowed to sell crap like this? Apparently, Canadians were spared this monstrosity.\n\nI finally heard the actual Boston album years later, I heard the real More Than A Feeling. And Peace of Mind. And Foreplay\/Long Time. As my brother would say, may your birthday be as cool as side one of Boston's first album. It is a great side. Side Two is good also, but I never cared for Something About You and Let Me Take You Home Tonight (Mama now it's all right). By the way, when did guys start referring to women as 'mama', and when did it end? Was it just a hippie thing?\n\nLater on in life, I heard Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, and noticed that the chord structure was very similar to More Than A Feeling, albeit an angrier angst-ridden 90s yin to Boston's happy 70s yang. The guitar solo in More Than A Feeling is like taking a dose of serotonin. It sends joy and pleasure right into your bloodstream.","summary":"AUG 29","unixReviewTime":1497139200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Kesha is very similar to her peer Lady Gaga, the two of whom debuted at the same time; the music is pretty much the same so if you love Lady Gaga you'll definitely love Kesha. The difference between her and Lady Gaga is that Kesha's style is harder, she's the ultimate party girl, and she on a mission here to party non-stop. The songs are primarily dance tracks, with slightly harsh electronic (I think its electroclash not to sure on the sub-genre), but surprising it suits her voice, Dr. Luke and his cohorts did a wonderfully job with production despite the harsh electronic background that surrounds her, Kesha doesn't get lost in the mix and its her that stand in the forefront. Most of the tracks (the really goods ones) revolve around drinking, party, and boys. But please don't think for a minute that she is just another puppet most of it is written or co-written by her and she can actually sing. (Something she better demonstrates on Deconstructed). My favorites from \"Animal\" are Dancing with Tears in My Eyes, Tik Tok, Kiss N Tell, Your Love is My Drug, and Take it Off.

On top of that, over the years he has been a part of 4 or so group albums and a large handful of mixtapes.  Flash back just about 20 year ago when Redman broke into the rap scene and started a name for himself, a name and persona that would build over the years and eventually lead him to well-known and respected veteran status in the rap game, and breaking that fame into the TV and movie world.  This hear, being his 7th album, compared to his others, I'd have to say it's toward the bottom; but don't get any ideas that it means the album isn't quality.  Compared to his other releases, he's done better work, but this album still is worthy of a strong 4 star rating.  Here is my ratings of his other solo albums:\n\n\"Whut: Thee Album\" (1992) --- 4 stars\n\"Dare iz a Darkside\" (11\/94) - 4.5 stars\n\"Muddy Waters\" (12\/96) --- 4.5 stars\n\"Doc's Da Name\" (12\/98) --- 4.5\/4 stars\n\"Malpractice\" (5\/01) ---  4.5\/4 stars\n\"Red Gone Wild\" --- (3\/07) --- 4\/4.5 stars\n\nOn top of those I have 4 group albums he's been a Part of (Def Squad's \"El Nino\" from 6\/98, and 3 albums with Method Man: \"Blackout!\" 1 & 2 and the \"How High Soundtrack\"), plus he has put out a decent amount of quality mixtapes over the years as well. This one has 13 songs; 1 is a Classic, 1 or maybe 2 that I'd skip over, the other 10-11 are good or real good songs.  Guests are on 6 of the 13 tracks, and are mostly his normal guests from the old crew; 4 songs they are rapping on and the other 2 they provide the chorus.  Production is on point for the majority of the album, (like he always provides our ears) but has a couple average or sub-par songs on here. 13 different producers each do 1 song: DJ Khalil, Ty Fyffe & Efrain Rodriguez Jr., Tone Mason, J. Rub, Rich Kidd, Rockwilder, The Futuristiks, Fyre Dept., Freak, M. Phazes, Three Sixty, The Audibles, King David, all do a song each.  The man continues to show he has talent still in the tank after almost 20 years blessing our ears and drops another album worth checking out.\n\n#1 - 9 (nice beat & has him spitting for 32 bars straight)\n#2 - 8\n#3 - 6\n#4 - 8 (f\/ Ready Roc, Runt Dawg, Saukrates -- has one of those annoying auto-tune choruses)\n#5 - 5 (worst song on the album)\n#6 - 8.5 (f\/ Faith Evans)\n#7 - 9 (f\/ Saukrates, another one of the overused auto-tune choruses -- nice beat)\n#8 - 9 (another nice beat)\n#9 - 9 (f\/ Ready Roc & Melanie Rutherford -- good beat)\n#10 - 10 (CLASSIC over a Great beat)\n#11 - 8.5 (f\/ Method Man & Bun B -- nice beat that sounds like one of the many great, old Nintendo beats)\n#12 - 8.5 (f\/ Poo Bear -- good beat)\n#13 - 9 (Another nice beat)\n\nReggie Noble -- b. 4\/17\/70 -- Newark, NJ\nCheck all my reviews","summary":"7th solo is good, but notches below his normal work","unixReviewTime":1342742400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer.  Just a few months later Debbie would score a Top Ten hit with her first single \"Aba Daba Honeymoon\".  And after her memorable performance in the 1952 musical comedy \"Singin\" In The Rain\" with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor the name Debbie Reynolds would be forever etched in the folklore of Hollywood.  Given her vocal prowess many people expected Debbie Reynolds to become a fixture on the Billboard pop charts.  You might be surprised to learn that this simply was not the case.\n\nIt would be another five years and 14 films before Debbie Reynolds would have another hit record.  It does not appear that a recording career was a top priority for her.  In 1957 she co-starred with Leslie Nielson and Walter Brennan in the romantic comedy \"Tammy And The Bachelor\".  The song \"Tammy\" made its debut in that film and was nominated for the 1957 Academy Award for Best Original Song.  The tune was a massive hit with the record-buying public as well.  \"Tammy\" would remain on the Billboard Hot 100 for an unheard of 31 weeks and spend 5 big weeks at the top of the charts.  Over the next couple of years Debbie Reynolds would have a couple of more hits but nothing could compare with the popularity of \"Tammy\".  i suppose that in this day and age most people would consider a song like \"Tammy\" to be pure unadulterated schmaltz.  But in my opinion, there is something to be said for such schmaltz.  Even as a teenager in the 1960's I loved this song.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"The signature tune of a beloved American original.....","unixReviewTime":1482969600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

What else would you expect from a disc entitled Leaving Eden?  While Brandon does touch on that some, he spends most of the time focusing on God, His love for us, and how we can make a difference in the world around us.\n\nThe disc opens with \"Leaving Eden,\" and it is the one song on the disc that does talk about how hard life can be.  Over the course of the verses, he mentioned Alzheimer's, a Salvation Army store being robbed, natural disaster, and war.  Yeah, real upbeat stuff.  So it is actually a surprise that the song is on the fast side of mid-tempo with a soaring melody that makes it much less depressing then you think it would be.\n\nBut Brandon immediately changes focus with the second track.  \"Your Love\" is the first single from the disc, and it's a winner.  It's at once a song of praise and surrender to God for His great love for us.  Again, it's on the mid-tempo side of things with a melody that is very catchy.  This one will be very popular on the radio.\n\nActually, God's love and care for us are the theme of several of the other songs on this disc.  \"It's Alright\" is a piano and string based ballad that uses images from Jesus' life to remind us He always have things under control.  \"Stolen,\" one of my favorites on this disc, talks about God's relentless pursuit of those He calls His own.  And for pure fun, there's \"Might Just Save Your Life.\"  This song is written from God's point of view as He rescues someone who was in a desperate situation.  This song is pure rock with a tad of hip hop thrown in.  Frankly, it reminds me most of \"Give Me Your Eyes\" from his last CD.\n\nThe other theme on the disc is how we are to respond to the world around us as a result of knowing God's love.  The theme is introduced early in \"The Light in Me,\" but it really starts to be driven home at the end of the disc.  \"It's No Good to be Alone\" is written to a friend who has withdrawn from life.  Verse one sounds like someone hiding due to depression while verse two is someone so busy perusing a dream they lose track of everyone around them.  The chorus is a tad on the repetitive side as it repeats the title several times, but the fun melody always makes me forget that fact.  In fact, this is the song I am most likely to find myself humming after I listen to the disc.\n\n\"The One\" goes beyond our friends to look at those struggling around us.  But it doesn't end with the verses detailing the hardships around us.  The chorus is a call to action.  \"If it takes just one, just one\/What if, what if, what if I'm the one.\"\n\nThe final track looks forward to the hope of Heaven.  \"As Long as I'm Here\" is a slow ballad that dreams of how great the day will be when we can return to Eden.  While he doesn't quite put it that bluntly, it certainly does bring the disc full circle.\n\nStylistically, Brandon is still in the mostly guitar driven pop\/rock he's done so well on his first two discs.  There isn't too much new to his sound, but his fans will certainly be happy with what they hear.\n\nLeaving Eden might not be a huge step forward musically for Brandon Heath, but the songs here are still great.  His many fans will be pleased with it and it might just win him some new ones as well.","summary":"Brandon Heath Finds Faith to Help Him Leave Eden","unixReviewTime":1431734400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Spirograph starts out very dream like and keeps playing for a while. It becomes very jazz like in the latter part of the song. Lo Swaga is one of STS9's better songs on the album and should be playing during happy moments. Ripple sounds like a theme song for characters going through hard times or doing drugs & cocaine. Sarge should play during the end credits of a Sonic the Hedgehog game. Midnight Girlfriend is one of those songs that makes me want to look at nude pictures of women & nude female anime characters all day long. If they put C.N.S. in a movie, they should the male voices out of the song. High Life sounds like one of those Hip-Hop casino songs in a movie. EHM is another good STS9 song.

That is what has happened with the tragic death of George Michael, whom died on December 25th, 2016 at the somber young age of 53 years old. He was a absolute gift in the soul of the heart with his work. He had crafted some of the most beautiful ballads of the past 35 years of music. When he was with Wham!, he had brilliant pop songs that were guilty pleasures, and when he was starting to be on his own, he made the deepest statement from any breakthrough as a singer with Faith. One of my favorite songs from Faith that had been more underrated, but deep at the heart, is Kissing A Fool. He really began to take a deeper heart when he stepped away from Wham!. It just is a delightful gem that really hits you when you really hear the song from the beginning. While everyone had been more focused on I Want Your Sex & One More Try, I was focused here from the start. If you have never heard a song of George's, this one would be a loving memory to start with.\n\nGeorge Michael: 1053-2016\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Kissed Forever","unixReviewTime":1482710400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Not only because they are True blue-eyed soul, but they still are better than what is on radio today. His songs have still the impact today, as they did back in the 80's and 90's. But the one that started the ball rolling for George on his own, I Want Your Sex, the lead single from his breakthrough solo record Faith doesn't feel as controversial as people made it back in the 80's. I liked how George was able to prove himself, away from his Wham image, and it still captures a rawness that still is vibrant as today as was the case back in the 80's. If you have never heard a George Michael song, this is one of the first I recommend.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","summary":"He Still Wants Your Sex","unixReviewTime":1365552000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Anyhow, I found this song surprisingly good to listen to although im guessing that some may say that jump jump by kriss kross could also be a guilty pleasure type of song.

In 1963, after several unsuccessful attempts in the music and show business, they finally linked up with famed record producer Phil Spector. By then, the group called themselves 'The Ronettes,' named after lead singer Veronica Bennett (Ronnie) who eventually married Phil Spector, then becoming known as Ronnie Spector. This song, which is performed impeccably, turned out to be a huge hit for the Ronettes. It actually influenced artists such as Brian Wilson of Beach Boys fame and Cher. Many other hits followed. 'Be My Baby' was one of my personal top favorites for the year 1963. The vocal and instrumental arrangements are outstanding. I just love this song.

True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.\n\nI am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either.

This was the reality Bobby Darin was forced to cope with. Even in his early teens Bobby Darin knew just what he wanted to do with his life. He craved the spotlight and realized early on that music was in his blood. Not only did he love to sing and perform before live audiences but he was also an extremely gifted songwriter and a talented musician as well. And because of his serious medical condition he was determined to make a name for himself before the age of 25. Well lo and behold Bobby Darin did just that!! In the decade between 1958 and 1968 he churned out more than 40 singles. Several were major hits including his signature tune \"Mack The Knife\". Perhaps my favorite Darin recording is his big 1960 hit \"Beyond The Sea\". This was the stuff of night clubs and Broadway shows. Audiences loved it and the record zoomed to #6 on the national charts. Don't hear this much on the radio anymore but when I do I crank up the sound!","summary":"Bobby Darin at the peak of his career.","unixReviewTime":1466380800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It does not have a single bad or even mediocre track. For me the title tune stands out. Even after all the decades it still fires an emotional response and does not get old.\n\nThe song itself an old folk song which is anti-prohibition and as performed by Traffic is a little sorrowful sounding to me. Almost as if sung in mourning. In the end we know that prohibition ended as the song predicts with \"and little Sir John with his nut brown bowl proved the strongest man at last\"\n\nBack in the days when this came out I was in a local band playing guitar. Traffic was one of those influential sources that inspired us and became part of the soundtrack of that portion of my life.\n\nJohn Barleycorn Must Die is a classic song with an iconic performance that has stood up well for at least 47 years so far. Such was the magic of Traffic in their prime. Without question 5 stars from Traffic","summary":"An Iconic Performance By Traffic Of A Old Protest Song, One Of Traffic's Best!

Good","reviewText":"Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.\n\nIn June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him \"being guilty of a serious criminal offence\". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.\n\nIt is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.\n\nThis individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.\n\nMore mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.\n\nThe track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime.","summary":"A Stain On The Music Industry","unixReviewTime":1316995200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It's around DR8, which is pretty good for modern Pearl Jam records. It's definitely not nearly as crushed as the Ten Remix. And there is a bit more detail and bass compared to the old master done in the 90s. The bonus tracks are decent as well. Overall, this is a solid reissue in a nice, large digipack. Go was a nice change of pace from the sound of Ten and really is the first record where they actually sound like the band they are today. It's not their best overall, but it has more than a few solid classics.

Both the fan base and Damon Albarn would agree that this is the groups weakest album musically. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad album by any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that this is Gorillaz most ambitious album to date, just for the simple fact that the album's creation was limited at the time of its release. This album was completely composed by Apple iPad music apps. The amount of depth and creativity Damon was able to produce and record off of a simple iPad is truly astounding to me, because despite the album not breaking any new ground sonically, the music on this project is still of high quality. I personally can enjoy this album on its own merit. But when compared to the previous 3 Gorillaz project, it falls short. Because of Damon's choice of using only music apps, the albums sound is not as rich or organic as past albums are. This album has a much more electronic feel than the previous 3 albums and it does suffer for it. The song-writing does not grab your attention as much and the songs aren't nearly as catchy.

Most cites want flowers, and rainbow colored unicorns to be associated with their fair or even unfair city.  But the Standells has a difference esthetic view, a naive one but they loved their town and they sang about it frustrated women and all.  The song is about the grittier side of Boston and the dirty water of the River Charles.  It is a catchy song, and like the unpolished portrait of Boston the song portrays, the sound congers up a vision of four teens hammering out a tune in a cold garage.  Yep, there are the trashcans and in a minute the drummer will have to get up and haul them out to the curb.  Directly behind them is a tool\/work bench with various tools and bits and pieces of things that are being saved because you never know when you are going to need rusted muffler for a 1961 lawn boy mower.  The boys have the door up and a gusty wind blows some autumn leaves in.  Their fingers are cold and it sometimes makes it hard to hit the cords crisply.  They have no intention to quit because each of them loves their town but they also have dreams of going beyond Boston.

I just KNEW it. It's getting to seem like everything truly excellent (and new) in production these days is coming from RedOne -- and his creativity behind the board is on full display, here. RedOne isn't playing around anymore, that much is for sure: he's hunting for some monumentally massive numbers within the industry, and by the sound of this, he's going to get them.\n\nRandom thoughts:\n\n1. I love the atmospherics \"pushing\" the song here. Long a feature in Euro-trance, I have wondered for ages when somebody would grab the concept and knock a single out of the ballpark with it on the US chart. Call this \"propulsive house\" if you like, but there's a bit of \"propulsive mariachi\" at work here as well, if you ask me. I don't know if there's even such a thing as \"propulsive mariachi,\" but if there is, then THIS is what it sounds like; I honestly thought this might break into 9\/10th's time and go into a \"flamenco house\" at the break (there's no such thing as THAT either, but hey, feel free to sue me if it makes you feel any better). Using the synths as practically a separate drum track is LONG-overdue for use in a mass-market US single; this really should have preceded ON THE FLOOR in the initial push at radio for the album (it is slower, though... my ears have it at 120 BPM, while ON THE FLOOR strikes me as 130-ish (BPM)). I can kinda tell that you wanted to use higher-pitched tones for the bass-line here, while using the low end for traditionally higher-pitched melodic elements -- but I'll be damned if I can point to just where I think I hear that. One of these days you're gonna reverse them for real, and it's gonna be a MONSTER in club-land.\n\n2. Lopez's voice here is in fine form -- she sounds, to me, sharper... almost as if she's naturally in F (which she ain't). A part of that, of course, comes from the contrast against the key used here: my ears have this in E (minor), so Lopez here sounds sharper (by comparison); still, what I think I hear from her does sound True -- i.e., it wasn't done electronically... she does, simply, sound better... is what I'm trying to say. The vox here are sharp, energetic, and focused. RedOne is not only an Einstein behind the board, but he also gets the best, vocally, from Lopez (in my opinion, anyhow) in a good long while.\n\n3. All the usual good stuff applies, here: it's totally club-ready as-is, ringtones galore can be heard within it, and the re-mix potential is BEYOND massive. The (rapidly growing) Latin market is properly nailed (singing a few lines in Spanish towards the end feels absolutely correct), while the record still maintains a solidly mainstream US focii. I love the mariachi-sounding keys... and yeah, I know I already said that. The hook is ROYAL, man... the chorus is an instant earworm. The final result is MAJESTIC.\n\nProps, RedOne.\n\nYou brought out the best from the talent in front of you, and it's really a truly exceptional record. This is what a producer is supposed to be, folks: RedOne, YOU TOOK LOPEZ TO A PLACE WHERE SHE EXCEEDED HERSELF.\n\n5 stars, all around.\n\nSimply beyond massive.","summary":"...and on the 8th day, God created RedOne:","unixReviewTime":1320451200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Unfortunately, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still needs to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so poor, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Love?, which took several years, and a few poor starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her better songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely poor chemistry along the song.

If it was, surely a club song like 'Papi', 'Invading My Mind', or 'Hypnotico' from Jennifer's 'Love?' album would have been chosen to follow the success. Instead, this summery single is just pleasant without ever catching fire, immediately inferior but less polarizing than the aforementioned songs.\n\nLil Wayne's feature surely had much to do with this choice of a single, though many flop singles in the past have shown that an artist doesn't necessarily equate to success. This song will likely crack the Top 40 or 30 on Billboard, but it's a shame if this stops the 'Love?' campaign. Jennifer has recorded some spectacular pop songs for the album, this being simply middle of the pack.\n\nBottom line: If you like what you hear in the clip, you'll surely enjoy the song, since there's not much else to it. However, don't miss out on the phenomenal non-singles (thus far) that I've mentioned above. They were listed in order of greatness.","summary":"Solid Album Track","unixReviewTime":1311120000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The first half of the album didn't generate as much interest for me as did the last half which I found to be more engaging and interesting.  A nice bit of diversity and some flourish there, from the driving rocker \"To the Wolves\" to the acoustically oriented and affective \"Down\".  Album ender \"Depraved\" is their most adventurous song, and their longest, but it pales in comparison to some of their other last tracks.\n\nThis is most definitely a \"poppier\" Anberlin.  They're moving far away from their new wave punk influences (though they are still there in tracks like \"We Owe This To Ourselves\") and toward emotionally swooning ballads (like \"Take Me As You Found Me\").

I heard of them through a friend of a friend, and at the time I was going through an indie splurge at the time so I listened to them right away. The music was fantastic, and I quickly recommended them to other friends. Sure enough, the fire caught on quickly and most of my friends were fans.\nBut then Cities came out and totally wiped their previous albums clean. They're both good, and I have some friends who still prefer the second out of pure nostalgia, but Cities as a whole was far above their previous work.\n\nSo how could they possibly top that?\n\nAnswer: they can't. Once you go above and beyond something fans will always compare your next work to what they consider your best. It's just simple habit.\nNow, Dark Is the Way is by no means bad; in fact, it's very good. It just doesn't capture the energy or detailed lyricism as their previous albums (namely Cities, of course).\n\nI have to emphasize that this is still a very good album, and \"Pray Tell\" is one of my favorite Anberlin titles from all their works.\nYou get more varied sounds here, noted by Anberlin's curiosity in incorporating different tunes and styles in their forte. Some work, some don't (but are still good), and the end result is a mixture of the very good to the okay.","summary":"Coming from Cities is a tough experience, but this album is worthy of their lineup.","unixReviewTime":1403827200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

After having so much success as a writer.  I have all of her cds.  And they are all very good.  Although she doesn't do other artist's covers like Jolene well.  But she writes most of her own songs anyway.  And I have wished she would do a cd of songs she's written that were hits by artists like I'm That Kind A Girl, Hey Cinderella. Strawberry Wine. Wrong Side Of Memphis,  Stuff like that.  This cd does have You And Tequila.  It and Your Husband Is Cheating On Us and South Of Heaven are Highlights.  Also this has nothing to do with the cd.  but I got this idea when the song You and Tequila was out.  I am a big Dallas Cowboy fan.  But not a fan of Tony Romo.  She can call me up and we can co write a song called Tony Romo Makes Me Crazy.","summary":"good","unixReviewTime":1465171200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

This set achieves that, in spades.\nYou know what a great orchestra performing a beautiful piece of music sounds like, yes? This set of Sibelius doesn't, to me, sound like that at all. No, it's more like sound rising up like mist from the ground and swirls around you as you walk through it. As if the music just appears and unfolds of its own volition, with no human involvement.\nLemminkainen, for example: one reviewer feels Lemminkainen in Tuolena is too slow, while another says the suite pales in comparison with the old Ormandy recording. I grew up with the Ormandy and I love it: it's an amazing, beautiful performance, a fitting valedictory to a long and illustrious career. Yet it still sounds like a performance, a wonderful orchestra playing a wonderful piece of music, whereas this Lemminkainen is like a dream unfolding. Kind of hard to explain the difference, I know.\nThe symphonies share this same organic feel.","summary":"Vibrant and alive","unixReviewTime":1450742400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"2","image":null}

There's no mistaking this for a country or bluegrass tune, however.  Perhaps that's because of an underlying percussive beat that lends the song a distinctly rockin' energy.  Whatever it is, this unexpected sound is enough to capture a listener's interest.  Clearly Dispatch isn't a band that's afraid to think outside the box.\n\nThe lyrics speak enigmatically of the American immigrant experience: disillusionment, hardship, homesickness, and the struggle to belong.  This is the kind of song that's just as good to listen to whether you're giving it your full attention or you've just got it on in the background.","summary":"Pensive and unusual","unixReviewTime":1309910400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"2","image":null}

They opened for Lady Antebellum a little while before this cd came out.  I had heard the song Amen and just about fell in love with Hannah Blaylock who's name Hannah fit's her because I thought she looked like Miley Cyrus.  Then it seemed like it took a long time for this cd to come out.  And when it finally did.  It is my choice for album of the year.  At least in my cd collection.  Amen turned out to be the only thing close to a hit that they had.  Hannah soon got married and the band dissolved.  Our loss.  There is not a bad song on here.  Swingin' Door, Last Supper the Gosphel Acapella Christ Alone are all super.  But as good as this cd is.  The song Cherry Pie makes it even better.  About all the people in your life who  have influenced you and made you the person you are.  And Cherry Pie is a horse so it is not only about people.  It get's me to thinking about my own life.

Jason brings a wanted desire that is occupied in all human ideas to have fun no matter the length of the night.

Let's listen to it.\n\n\"Wreckin' Bar\" is a nice anthemic punk song.  Well it sure sounds like it's in the punk spirit.  Whether it's technically punk or not I haven't a clue!  It's catchy enough.  \"If You Wanna\" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It's really catchy and enjoyable.  \"But if you wanna come back it's alright it's alright, it's alright if you wanna come back!\"  That's actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  \"Well I don't want to wake up in the morning but I've got to face the day, that's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!\"\n\n\"A Lack of Understanding\" has an excellent verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good \"I've got too much time on my hands, but you don't understand or you won't understand\".  \"Blow It Up\" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there's enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  \"Wetsuit\" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The \"ah ah ah\" sounds like the 60's song by Dusty Springfield \"I Only Want to Be With You\".  Pretty decent melody either way.  \"You want to do things differently, you'll do them independently\".  I love the part \"Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!\"\n\n\"Norgaard\" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  \"Her mind's made up she don't want to go steady she's only seventeen so she's probably not ready!\" is a funny line.  \"Post Break-Up Sex\" is another memorable rocker.  \"Leave it 'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs\"  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it's a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  \"Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?\"  VERY clever lyrics!\n\n\"Under Your Thumb\" is pretty decent pop\/rock.  \"I don't mind about taking it slow, I'm perfectly aware of what I'm yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!\"  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Love the \"Eleanor\" part in particular.  \"All In White\" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it better than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.\n\n\"Wolf Pack\" is perhaps the only song I'm not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it's missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  \"Family Friend\" is a relaxing tune with a much better melody.  Really good lyrics too. \"You wanna get young but you're just getting older, and you had a fun summer but it's suddenly colder, if you want a bit of love put your head on my shoulder it's cool\"  Also love the line afterwards \"Half baked girl hey I'm hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody's lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you're trying to get yourself back in, come on in\".\n\nThe hidden track, \"Somebody Else's Child\" is a short piano ballad of sorts.  I like how the piano gallops at times.  Touching moment of the album and drastically different from the faster punk\/pop rock stuff.  This album deserves credit for the tight songwriting and strong lyrics.  It's a 5-star album alright.","summary":"inject this","unixReviewTime":1462838400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

But for newcomer Esperanza Spalding, she has been known to beat out a favorite in the crowd. After all, she was the one whom whipped Justin Beiber's moptop when she won Best New Artist at the Grammys this past year. But for those whom are new to her soulful voice, her cover of Billie Holliday's I'll Look Around from A Tribute To Billie Holliday actually is very intimate, and flows well to the classy voices of acts of today like Corrine Bailey Rae. I was pleasantly surprised, especially with her smooth blended style, added with the intimacy of hearing the voice of Billie saying how she grew up out of slavery, and made only a grand a week. This is a elequent download for your MP3 library, and a nice treat from the overexposed dance pop that has honestly gotten very tiresome from Lady Gaga & Rihanna lately.

She has a lilting way with the song, sensuously wrapping her vocal tones around the notes.  Esperanza's bass playing is noteworthy as well, as she expertly coaxes the electric bass to produce some zesty lines throughout the song.  It's a fitting tribute to Billie Holiday, and also a good showcase for Ms Spalding's skills.","summary":"Lovely singing (and playing) by Ms Spalding","unixReviewTime":1309824000,"style":null,"vote":"5","image":null}

Compared to Holiday's version, which was filled with languorous yearning, Spalding's is a little smoother and more upbeat, bringing an almost whimsical note to this song of lost love.  The background is easy-listening jazz - it's the sort of thing you might expect to hear playing softly in a classy restaurant.  Spalding's voice is just as appealing, silky and fluidly sensuous.  This is an old-fashioned song with a timeless sound, and Spalding has made it her own for a modern audience.\n\nNo matter your tastes, this track is sure to add a touch of loveliness to your music collection.

However, it certainly won me over - quickly - despite these audio issues.  Actually, most of the songs sound better than I anticipated, given the price and the comments of a few reviewers.  It's like Billie Holiday - you don't listen for exemplary audio, but for her inimitable voice.  Same here, plus you are unlikely to ever hear many of these songs another way.  I'm loving this collection, and the less-than-stellar recordings, as someone else dared opine above, does indeed 'add to the charm.'  It seems appropriate to the music, but don't misunderstand, the music is great imo.","summary":"Better Sonically Than I Anticipated, Plus Some Great Blues Songs","unixReviewTime":1408406400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I saw the artist, Still Corners, in the credits. Went to Amazon Music, and looked it up. After listening to the preview, I bought this song.\n\nThe music is just soul stirring, the beat is solid and powerful, and Tessa's voice just brings it all together. As I said in the title of this review, this song is very tranquil. Very well composed. Not the typical electronic sound of most modern \"music\". It has a peaceful feel, almost as if you're floating through the song. Those who truly appreciate the art of music will know what that means. An excellent song, with great composition. I'd love to see Still Corners perform this live.","summary":"Very Tranqil","unixReviewTime":1478390400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The musicality seems stolen from better tracks and the whispered vocals don't emote the way that they should.  The song is trying desperately to encapsulate avant-garde but instead it feels pointless and insipid.  The song title also says a lot for the track itself, which comes across very long despite barely running over three minutes.  The lack of musical depth and the breathy vocals (which at times grate the eardrums) exasperate the track, making it feel as if it were running on and on.  It overstays its welcome rather quickly.\n\nI'm just glad this was free.","summary":"Please, just end...","unixReviewTime":1317859200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Nice clean opening drum and keyboard that stays throughout the song behind the robotic vocal and noises. Simple lyric, simple song sounds okay.\n\nNext up Short Order Cooks from Emil & Friends. Cool techno opening with weird noises then asexual vocal over same beat and various sounds. Stays interesting.\n\nTrack 3 is Rifle Men with His & Hers. Cool intro then hollow echo singer(s) over perky busy band playing one at a time(nearly) making great little song. Very nice. (song sounds vaguely familiar, cannot place it)\n\nGordon Voidwell with Ivy League Circus. Brutally unoriginal song with dated lyrics and simple 80's beat. You may love it.\n\nQueer Eyed Boy by Rumspringa. Rumspringa is the name for the time after an Amish kid reaches 16 and is allowed to party for a while. Nice alternative song great playing by the band and deliberate vocal. Good song.\n\nTrack 6 is Francis and the Lights playing Darling, It's Alright. Pretty cool vocal over clean band filling in the gaps. Nice production on neat sound.\n\nLast track is by Savoir Adore playing Bodies. Up beat song, nothing fancy, drums and vocals feature in this great little lite Alt. song.\n\nPretty much all Indie\/Alternative music, not Rock more like Alt. Pop songs. Many sound fresh most are good tunes. Download all 7 tracks on to your massive hard drive give them a try, delete is easy.

I do! Or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Because Amazon allows you to sample nearly every song\/album that they offer. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads. Free songs...even free albums. And more important than free. LEGAL. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But, quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nIf you think you might like this song...listen to a sample first. No review will help you make a better decision than doing that. I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was one of the Amazon freebies, previously mentioned.

I do! Or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Because Amazon allows you to sample nearly every song\/album that they offer.

If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads. Free songs...even free albums. And more important than free. LEGAL. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But, quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

Frampton Comes Alive! was a massive commercial success, staying at the top of the charts for 10 weeks. It was THE album of 1976.\n\nDo You Feel Like We Do is the final and longest track on the double live album. There is a momentary pause, the crowd waiting, then Frampton starts playing the classic opening riff. The rest of the band come in, bass, keyboards and drums.\n\nTo the audience, Frampton and his mates can do no wrong. It's like the crowd already know and love the album, even though it didn't exist yet. Maybe there were flashing CHEER and APPLAUSE signs? Perhaps they all owned and loved his studio album, Frampton's Camel? Nah, face it, Frampton was ON and he had them in the palm of his hand. It's great fun 70s rock, it sounds excellent, how could anyone not be having a blast at this show? Of course they feel like you do, Peter. You're the Pied Piper, Peter Piper.\n\nAfter the first couple of verses, Frampton plays a tasty little lick at 2:10, then kicks out a fantastic solo from 2:21-3:01. Following another verse and chorus, at 3:52 the music slides into a quiet middle section, featuring\n\nBob Mayo...on the keyboards, Bob Mayo, who plays a groovy solo from 4:12-5:17. Frampton starts asking the crowd, Do You Feel Like We Do...and, yes, I think they do. He solos again from 5:55-7:00.\n\nThen, wait...what's going on? I can't see what's happening on stage. The band are playing along together, the crowd is cheering. Peter must be mucking around with something. Oh right, he's getting his talk box effect thingamajig ready. It appears at 7:22, oo baydo baydo boo...crowd cheer...bah do wah bo baba dah...crowd cheer...Peter you sound funny, I wanna thank you...I hope you have a good night...don't forget to come again real real soon (not sure about this last part). Some of it must just be Frampton going wah wahwah woo wow uh.\n\nAt 11:25, Frampton ditches the talk box with a big Woahwoww...then pulls out all the stops for one more mighty solo at 11:45 that lasts until the end, sending the crowd into spasms of joy.","summary":"DEC 23","unixReviewTime":1498348800,"style":null,"vote":null,"image":null}

While listening to him, I was thinking he probably wouldn't do as well with Mozart (but I could be surprised - don't know), and indeed after looking into his discography, I can't see that he has recorded very much written before the 19th century. But his mind and fingers are programmed to zone into the great Romantic composers, and this survey of Rachmaninoff is truly some great stuff. The sonics are a bit uneven, but overall are acceptable. Highly recommended!","summary":"A great romanticist playing some the greatest and most difficult piano music ever written.","unixReviewTime":1427328000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

They were a favorite part of my young collection of LPs. Ponti has all the technique and soul  to do the music justice. Rachmaninoff was not only one of the great pianists of the first half of the last century but he also continued composing in the great romantic tradition when that musical idiom was thought to be at an end. The music is full of beauty, love, passion, and sadness.  It is wonderful to see recordings like this given new life on the cloud. The sound quality is very adequate. Do not hesitate. You will get hours of wonderful music.","summary":"Excellent Performances. Very decent sound.","unixReviewTime":1403568000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The Washed Out songs create a mood of floating along atop the clouds, a feeling certainly promoted by \"Amor Fati.\" I can't add much to Kort's very good review of this song, but I will suggest one more band this song reminds me of, '80s synth trio The Thompson Twins.","summary":"Blissed Out","unixReviewTime":1311206400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Shonen Knife has covered it faithfully here, but not brought anything new to it.  Except for the female voices, there is very little difference between this cover and the original.  Shonen Knife presents the lyrics with a straightforward delivery that doesn't suit the song's fun-loving vibe; I get the feeling they were spitting the words out more than trying to capture their feel.

They were influenced by 1960s girl groups, pop bands, The Beach Boys, and early punk rock acts. \"Rock N Roll High School\" is a track from their latest album 'Osaka Romones - Tribute To The Ramones' (available only in MP3 format currently).  It is a cheerful version rather than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/angrier-original\/dp\/B00000JFUY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">angrier original<\/a>&nbsp;and sounds like something you might hear while watching 'Teen Titans' or some other modern kids cartoon. They in fact have done soundtrack work and are on the Powerpuff Girls soundtrack 'Heroes and Villains'. So I'm not saying their rendition is bad ...just different.\n\nI like the song well enough, but it isn't something I'd play every day. The rest of 'Osaka Romones' sounds much the same, so if you like enjoy Shonen Knife's take on \"Rock N Roll High School\" and J-Pop in general, then you might want to add it to your Cloud Player and jam out with the three girls from Osaka.\n\n~ Kort-san","summary":"oo-oo-ultra-eccentric-super-cult-punk-pop-band-shonen-knife!","unixReviewTime":1311206400,"style":null,"vote":null,"image":null}

I haven't bought any of their records for many years now, but I have several and they are among my favorites from the late 1990s or so. Here they bring their particular brand of hybrid Japanese cuteness and toughness to this Ramone's classic, but in the end they stay pretty True to the original.\n\nAnd that's the problem that keeps this back from being among the best Shonen Knife material. Does anyone remember their cover of \"Top of the World\" by the Carpenters from the tribute album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/If-I-Were-a-Carpenter\/dp\/B000005IL6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">If I Were a Carpenter<\/a>? That was brilliant because Shonen Knife brought their punk-inspired driving guitars and rhythms to a song that was originally from the opposite, laid-back, easy-listening end of the pop spectrum. The cover version actually had a transformative effect.\n\nHere, we have a nice cover version by a great band of a classic song by another great band, delivered in a highly similar style. Shonen Knife's affinity with the Ramones makes it tough for them to bring anything really new to the tune -- beyond the cuter, Japanese girl band voice and vibe.\n\nGood, glad to have it, but it doesn't go to 11 or anything.","summary":"True to the original -- maybe too True","unixReviewTime":1311206400,"style":null,"vote":"8","image":null}

Well, apparently for the members of Shonen Knife, their idols were the Ramones.  This track is a pretty faithful rendition of \"Rock 'n' Roll High School,\" with a few slight differences such as a greater presence of harmonies, and the lyrics are sung with a cute Japanese accent!  However, the Knife ladies also seem to have taken the bite and muscle out of this song, maybe because the guitars are more toned down or something.  The Ramones usually sounded ANGRY when they played and sang; these ladies merely sound like they're having fun.

There are some interesting sounds and musical enhancements that add a layer of intrigue to the track, but they are compiled atop a rudimentary musical arrangement that gives Friedberger an almost dated feeling.  The horns at the end of the track are a nice touch, but they too don't really feel new or inspired.  They just serve to throw yet another trick in the bag.

However, the music up to that point is rather reminiscent of the annoying synthetic sounds so often found in video games twenty years ago.  In small quantities that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's the sort of thing one has to be in the mood for.  As for the lyrics, Friedberger seems to be telling the story of getting into a car accident while mulling over her frustrations with an ex-lover, but it doesn't really make much sense and it's hard to tell what exactly is going on.  During the verses, the words seem to spill from her mouth in a jumbled torrent.  What does \"tube top and shorts with thighs cut, hold me down\" mean, exactly?  How about \"he's ignoring me like it's 2001\"?\n\nIt's not a bad song, and its better moments have me thoroughly convinced of Friedberger's potential, but it has too many rough edges and irritating qualities to be as enjoyable as it might otherwise have been.","summary":"A few more mistakes to learn from","unixReviewTime":1310601600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"19","image":null}

There are  songs like Wrecking Ball and Northern Girl that are just as good as anything she has recorded.  She pits her emotions into Lonesome's Last Call which is another highlight.  This is one of those cds that more people need to hear.","summary":"good","unixReviewTime":1465603200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Stuckey","reviewText":"From the opening notes of \"Wrecking Ball\", this CD is pure Terri Clark. it is an upbeat, rocking number with clever lyrics, driving guitar, with just enough fiddle. \"Breakin' Up Thing\" is about a guy with 'no respect for the human heart', it is a mid-tempo song with a smattering of pedal steel, not quite a kiss-off song, it is more from the side of the kissee. \"The One\" is a slower song, about what she wants in a relationship: 'I don't need a love that I can live with, I want the one I can't live without'. \"Northern Girl\" could be the anthem for a whole generation of young ladies from Canada! Four of the tracks were co-written with Kristen Hall, formerly of Sugarland, including my favorite: \"Beautiful and Broken\". I love the banjo and accordion. \"Lonesome's Last Call\" sounds straight out of 1978 with the weepy fiddle\/pedal steel intro and story of two lonely souls who happen to find each other. A broken relationship is the story of \"The Good Was Great\". \"Smile\" is an emotional tribute to Clark's mother and features Alison Krauss, it put a lump in my throat. \"We're Here For a Good Time\" is a cover of the old Trooper song about having a good time, even when it's raining. The album closes with a Celtic-inspired song about the futility of planting \"Flowers in the Snow\". It's a shame that Terri Clark is not more popular, her music has so much more heart and depth than the other stuff being released to country radio right now.","summary":"another signature TC CD","unixReviewTime":1390003200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Im taking the song to be an upbeat tune where he is expressing that the person he is singing about gives him an emotional\/euphoric buzz and from the positive imagery of the video she is the perfect combo of being sweet (with his mentioning honey) but adding to his life through her multi-dimensional personality.

{"overall":5.0,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2014","reviewerID":"AA4VJFR1EDIN6","asin":"B005DL08L2","reviewerName":"David White","reviewText":"Debrah Bond is a groove artist for the chic set. A consistent presence as a session and background singer in the Washington, DC independent music scene, her voice consistently falls into the pocket and effortlessly rides the modern rhythmic production waves of her atmospheric band, Third Logic. On sublime neo-funk compositions like 5:35 and You are the One, Bond kicks up her heels and parties on musical shores as sophisticated as they are fun. On jazzy electric-soul ballads, Bond coos like an island breeze across string-heavy, percussive neo-80s soundscapes that pulsate with the city sounds of champagne toasts and penthouse living. Throughout these moonlit rides, Bond and her band prove to be thinking musicians with an unfailing sense of maturity, place, and drive.\n\nIt feels liks an age since we last heard from singer\/songwriter Debrah Bond on her 2003 debut, DayAfter, and its standout ballad, Sweet Lullabies. Her alto has grown lighter, surer, and more technically proficient since then. Refined from the ensuing years of supporting a virtual whos who of East Coast indy and mainstream soul from Kem and Ledisi to Frank McComb and Eric Roberson, Bond has come a long way in eight years, leaving fans only a remix of DayAfter to tide them over in the meantime.\n\nAiry voiced with a sultry resonance, on her sophomore project of original tunes, Bond - possessing her still youthful tones - does not always yield the most distinctive vocal presence as a soloist. But, her skill, brilliance, and efficiency is never less than awe-inspiring. The ease of the many transitions on Perfect is a technicians sleight of hand, making the difficult look effortless. Bonds deft hop-scotch handling of the tunes multi-syllabic phrasing and her perceptive nestling in the songs sweet spots making every moment count. In her vocal choices, Bond consistently reveals an intelligence that is understated, but hard to miss. With far less intricacies to maneuver through, she massages Think Twice and Never Was with a breezy beauty that a heavier voice would have made leaden. Her ample experience on backgrounds shines on every harmonic arrangement with voices rivaling Incognito and the Jones Girls on cuts like 5:35. Always appearing to glide over her subtle melodies, Bond is gifted at working hard without ever showing a seam.\n\nIf Bonds skill as a professional songstress wasn't worthy enough of eternal respect, she pulls off the coup of the century by excavating the M.I.A. cult legend Lewis Taylor, who hasn't been heard on a new recording since 2006, and then goes toe-to-toe with the eccentric star for every vocal riff, run and growl. The always pristine-voiced Taylor pulls a ferocity out of Bond on the track that would be nice to hear more of from the usually unflappable chanteuse. Warm and more blood-beating than the albums cooler illustrations, the mid-tempo guitar and percussion bumper is both a tease and a joy, leaving drooling listeners ravenous for more from this thoroughly edible duet.\n\nA cousin to the music of Foreign Exchange minus that band's melodrama, the hybrid Madame Palindrone fuses 90s acid jazz and 80s new age dance music with elements of modern day chillout, lounge, and progressive soul to create a series of briskly paced, though never rushed sonic moving pictures. The lockstep Third Logic musicians sacrifice themselves to mood and tempo, making only the most muted of individual impressions, like the discreet latin percussion and light spectral effects closing Say It or the fleeting bass, violins, and strings accenting Highest Mountain, all to moving effect. It is unobtrusive, atmospheric music that cannot help but light a candle, pour a glass, and set a seductive mood without ever being unseemly. Lyrically sound with less than obvious - but nonetheless compelling - choruses, Bond is more storyteller than hook-meister. Though a lack of singularity plagues Bonds profile as a signature soloist, the overall quality, impressive technique, and humble talent rolling through Madame Palindrone raises Deborah Bond to a circle of other elite, independent ladies whove made strong careers of riding urbane grooves, including: Julie Dexter, Conya Doss, and Amel Larrieux. Welcome to the big leagues, Madame Bond.","summary":"\" MADAM PALINDROME \"","unixReviewTime":1407974400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Or like some sort of vortex, or the Twilight Zone. If you were going to be stuck anywhere in northern California, it is most likely going to be Lodi. The narrator ends up there after riding in on a greyhound to do a gig, then his friends go missing, his promise of fame vanishes, and he ends up singing the same songs over and over, trying to save up enough money to buy a train ticket out of there. I have never been to Lodi, but it is apparently the ''Zinfandel Capital of the World.\" You end up sipping some wine and before you know it you are a resident. I don't think the narrator thinks it's such a bad place, but it must be frustrating since he has been stuck there before.

While so many have thought of One Sweet Day with Mariah Carey 16 years ago. But while the foursome, then trio have suffered in sales they did bounce back several years ago, they honestly could've brought more into their songs. Their latest sing More Than You'll Ever Know with Charlie Wilson isn't a bad collaboration from the two, but honestly not the best song they have made. Still it honestly is a better song than all the trashy music that is on radio right now.

A lullaby for artistic freaks, fiends and friends living in a depraved and dirty, yet stimulating and inspiring city where anything goes.

Stinnett","reviewText":"\"Last Song,\" by Edward Bear, is another of the 1970's songs which are melancholy and wistful and sad. Released in 1972 (same year as Bread's \"Diary,\" a similar sad song), \"Last Song\" spent 18 weeks on the charts and peaked at number 3 on Billboard's Hot 100. This was Edward Bear's most successful song; it centers on the singer's realization that his love, gone now for two years, is not coming back despite his keeping the lights on, hoping and longing for that return. Now, however, he understands that will not happen and so he writes and sings this \"last song\" for her. The time has come to close that chapter of his life, despite his continuing love for her. It's time to turn out the lights. A gently-sung piece, \"Last Song\" is entirely reminiscent of the feeling of the soft-rock 70's.\n\nEdward Bear is not a person's name; it's actually a three-man band, named for Winnie the Pooh, whose actual name is Edward Bear. A Canadian group, Edward Bear started out in 1966, completely unknown and performed at events, birthday parties, bars -- eventually getting noticed almost by accident and signed by Capital Records. The members were Larry Evoy, architect\/keyboardist Paul Weldon, and guitarist Danny Marks. The band lasted twelve years all told. They produced four albums and four solid hits. At the end, there were apparently no conflicts or issues among the trio; they just decided they were through with this segment of their lives and wanted to do other things.\n\nIn 1995, Evoy received an award from the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada for \"Last Song\" (and two other pieces) having been played on-air 100,000 times. On soft-rock stations, \"Last Song\" is still played, 44 years after its initial release!","summary":"\"Last Song\" still a golden oldie","unixReviewTime":1473033600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It debuted in most of the scenes with Atom's introduction to the ring, and the sight of the robot and his young owner\/trainer entering the arena with a fun dance number were cute and added some levity to the film.  And while it isn't the type of music I normally listen to, those scenes left enough of an impression on me -- and the song got embedded deeply enough in my head -- that I decided to track down a copy.\n\n\"Give It a Go\" is a heavy techno beat with heavily synthesized voices, almost like something Daft Punk might produce (only not as heavy on the synthesizer in the instrumentals).  It's unexpectedly fun and catchy, though, and one can't help but move along with the beat.  The singing isn't stellar and the female vocal seems to come out of nowhere, but otherwise it's a good number and could work well as a club or workout song.\n\nNot great, but a decent song from a good movie, and guaranteed to get the blood pumping.  As mentioned before, a good song to have playing in your headphones while you do your workout.","summary":"Catchy techno number the best part of the soundtrack","unixReviewTime":1394496000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

This is one of 7 \"Rise of the Masters\" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were\/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their\/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering \"Is this working right?\" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks.","summary":"Great Price Point","unixReviewTime":1494028800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Because of the strength of his reactions to things, sometimes I find myself needing to find middle ground no matter how much I admire and respect the therapists who work with him and their recommendations.  Many OT clinics like to do The Listening Program with sensory processing disorder or Autistic kiddos, and our little man does *not* do headphones.  We've been working on it, working on it, working on it...and we have brief periods of time where he will tolerate it, and most of the time he either rips them off his head or gets agitated at the mere sight.  So in looking at the studies on The Listening Program and AIT therapy in general, some of the information indicates that listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits.  So I purchased a whole bunch of these because the price point was great and they were digital and I could access them from multiple devices.  This is the other collection my son will listen to for a longer period of time then the others.

It would be more accurate to say that they feel radically different on his head then they would to you or I and he  still can't tolerate that sensation well most of the time, and there's probably a sensitivity to sound component in there as well.  Usually the best we can get is for him to allow them around his neck for a short period of time while one of his favorite movies plays on my kindle.  Music generally is too unmotivating to even get him to try and deal with the headphones from his perspective.  Since the type of Auditory Integration Therapy used by my son's OT clinic uses headphones, we've been kind of dying on that hill, but some of the studies into the efficacy of this method for treating sensory issues have indicated that traditional, unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits.

Of all of the hundreds of vocal versions of the Henry Mancini\/Johnny Mercer composition, \"Moon River\", over the years, perhaps the simplest, most effective, and affecting is the very first version which was sung by Audrey Hepburn. Strumming her guitar with violins and celeste in the background during 'the fire escape scene' with George Peppard in the movie \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", she nailed it vocally. And the song was in danger of being cut from the movie until Mancini and especially Hepburn fought hard to keep it in and, as they say, the rest is history: winning 2 Grammies for Song and Record of the Year, an Oscar, and enjoying great popularity ever since. Sung simply and sweetly, Hepburn is excellent in telling her believable tale about love, hope, wonder, and a river, in one pass through the lyrics. Mancini himself calls this his favorite version of the song. \"My huckleberry friend\", indeed! My Highest Recommendation. Five MEMORABLE Stars. (RCA Victor records. Steel music. 1-remastered MP3 track.

These \"new\" Drifters were led by a dynamic young lead vocalist named Ben E King and included Charlie Thomas who continues to perform Drifters tunes to this day. The move proved to be a stroke of genius as over the next 5 years The Drifters would prove to be a wildly successful recording act. \"There Goes My Baby\" would spend 19 weeks on the charts peaking at #2 in the summer of 1959. Produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, it was one of the first R&B records ever to use strings.","summary":"The first of a string of hits for the \"new\" Drifters featuring Ben E.

Larry Knechtel, a member of the Wrecking Crew, plays piano. It was inspired by a song from the gospel group the Swan Silvertones. It has been covered by such artists as Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Simon began working on it in the same house George Harrison sang about on the Beatles' Blue Jay Way.\n\nIt is a song of comfort and solidarity, it has a light in the darkness quality, no matter how low you feel I'm on your side. The piano gives it the feel of some sort of old hymn that has been around forever. Towards the end, the duo sing in harmony on the Sail on silver girl part, and the drums gain strength on see how they shine.  Angelic strings carry it away to the horizon. Supremely moving.","summary":"SEP 14","unixReviewTime":1497139200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads. Free songs...even free albums. And more important than free. LEGAL. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But, quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nIf you think you might like this song...listen to a sample first. No review will help you make a better decision than doing that. I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was one of the Amazon freebies, previously mentioned. However, the freebie selection on Amazon is constantly changing, so by the time you read this review, it may have a price attached.

Just listen to that four on the floor drum beat, the offbeat bass strut. It is the foundation for the guitar exchanges between Keith and Ronnie. It seems like the guitars are playing something cool every second. Notice in particular these moments: 0:17, 0:26, 0:42-0:45, that little squeak at 1:10, and on and on...it's like finding musical pokemons. You just have to listen. Small\/Faces Ian McLagan on electric piano and the great Sugar Blue on harmonica. Great riff.\n\nThen there's Mick delivering a classic vocal, in particular on the spoken sections that serve to demonstrate how much Mick really misses, well, You, right? Not even his friends can entice him with Puerto Rican girls and cases of wine. He ends up stumbling around Central Park at night like some kind of crazy Aqualung figure, people think he's craaaazy.","summary":"SEP 7","unixReviewTime":1497139200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Her piano is so expressive and gentle, that we become swept up in the emotion.  On \"A Chance for Goodbye,\" the mood is so sweetly melancholy that for me it brings up feelings of loss of a loved one whose remembrance is touching and whose absence is bittersweet.  \"On the Wings of Light\" reflects a hopeful mood, perhaps the start of a voyage.  \"October Sky\" is lovely and wistful.  Randy Yoder's cover photography is the perfect visual image of this music: beautiful & elegant.  Sweeten's musical style is similar throughout the disc; I might have hoped for a couple compositions with more pep and several with more variation in time structure, but this music has a wonderful place.

The elements of that alchemy include Kathryn's evocative compositions and grand piano expressions, produced by Grammy-winning Windham Hill founder Will Ackerman at his Imaginary Roads studio in Vermont, with mastering by Corin Nelsen, and a new addition to the team, recording engineer Tom Eaton. And last but not least, the accompaniment of a number of world-class studio musicians, some of whom graced her first album.\n\nSome of Kathryn's compositions, for me, are like musical portraits that evoke the earthy ambience and subtle shadings of an Andrew Wyeth painting. The opening track, a sweet piano solo, entitled \"Mountain Laurel\" is a perfect example. Within its' serenely sylvan melody is revealed a depth for those with ears to hear. The nature theme continues on the second track, \"Meadow Morning,\" which is peaceful and pensive, but with a touch of wistfulness in the air. This is one of the larger ensemble pieces, yet it's understated interplay maintains the delicate demeanor that characterizes the album.\n\nAs pastoral as Kathryn's music can be, she also ventures into other landscapes, such as the decidedly more urban vista of \"An Empty Street In Prague.\" The music so perfectly captures the essence of the title that it is hard not to feel like you are there, your lone footsteps echoing down the cobblestone corridor of the city. The title of \"How Deep, How Simple\" mirrors some of the qualities of Kathryn's music, with its reflective melodies that are unpretentious on the surface while illuminating deep waters below. Speaking of titles, the music on the title track \"Heavy As A Feather\" does a wonderful job of depicting a portrait in sound that has a lightness of being yet is counterbalanced by a subtle sense of gravity. Although there has been no mention (yet) with regard to the next CD, it is unlikely that Kathryn's fans will cease calling for an encore until she obliges and paints yet another haunting musical masterpiece in colors of earth and sky.","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1328832000,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":"3","image":null}

This music is overflowing with tenderness, compassion and forgiveness. When you listen to this project you realize what a joy to be here on this Earth and you want to stay here as long as possible in harmony and creativity.\n\nIt is not necessary to think how the artist achieves such a perfect sounding and deepest emotional impact of her performance. You just want to listen to the music of Kathryn Kaye and to recover your heart because the compositions of this project possess a strong healing effect.\n\nI would like only to mention in short that \"Heavy as a Feather\" is the second CD of Kathryn Kaye. Like the first album this project was produced by Will Ackerman at his famous Imaginary Road Studios in Windham County, Vermont. And, as it was on the first CD the team of outstanding artists helps Kathryn to record the second one.\n\n\"Heavy as a Feather\" shows the obvious progress of Kathryn Kaye as an acoustic instrumental and new age music performer. The album discovers new facets of her talent. This music appeals to the highest aspirations of your soul. It awakens the yearning for love and beauty.\n\nWhat will you feel when the music of \"Heavy as a Feather\" ends?

And her musical collaborators provide solid support without ever upstaging the proceedings.\n\nThe result is a delightfully rich and engaging concoction that is a sight for sore ears.","summary":"The RajMan Review","unixReviewTime":1327190400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

And I think with the passing of time, after a few more years, more people will \"get it\" and there will be added appreciation for this lovingly crafted album. I still think there are few too many lulls and slow moments, but in an odd way that sort of adds to the vibe of the whole album. But the highs and sweet spots on here are very good.

Quirky but oh so good. Now comes the band's 3rd album.\n\n\"Smart Flesh\" (11 tracks; 46 min.) continues the band's exploration of Americana music, and then some. The opener \"Ghost Woman Blues\" (don't let the blues reference fool you) sets the table for the album. \"Boeing 737\" is about the only harder-charging track on here (and also the shortest song on the album, under 3 min.). After that it's back to the slow and softer music, not that this is a complaint. Check out the beautiful and pensive instrumental \"Wire\", for one. As the album goes on, it becomes clear that this is a mood piece, much more so than the band's previous output. If you're in the mood for it, it'll play great. I myself love it.\n\nI saw The Low Anthem again (saw them at Bonnaroo in 2009 support of the \"Oh My God\" album) recently at the MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati, and what a show that was. Playing in almost darkness, the band brought many of the songs from this album, along with a couple of tracks from their earlier output. You could hear a pin drop when they were playing some of their quieter songs, just fantastic. I was equally amazed at the band's musical flexibility, with band members moving around from one musical instrument to another, just wow. Meanwhile, \"Smart Flesh\" is highly recommended!","summary":"Delving ever deeper into Americana","unixReviewTime":1317340800,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I found this CD to be somewhat haunting and sometimes beautiful, but also very depressing. It's not something I will play very often. The production is interesting...almost like it was recorded in a big empty warehouse rather than a studio. Not for everybody, but it does sound authentic. You might want to check 'em out if you like Dylan, Leonard Cohen or the more subdued side of Bright Eyes.","summary":"What Bob Dylan would have sounded like if he appeared in the 1860's rather than the 1960's","unixReviewTime":1301011200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Probably so, so I will write this review to tell you that you do need this song. It isn't the only worthwhile Springsteen hit for Springsteen is one of the greatest songwriters of our time. You may remember the Manfred Man Earth Band;s hit, \"Blinded By The Light.\" That song was actually written by Bruce Springsteen. Not many have connected with young people of the 70s and 80s and their lifestyle, their hopes and dreams and fears quite like Springsteen. This is a great song, but don't stop with it and be sure to read his lyrics when you listen to his music.","summary":"An Anthem Of Unfettered Youth","unixReviewTime":1498953600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

In a long and successful career he has had a ton of hits that stand out among some of the greatest hits in rock music. The best of his best to me has to be \"Born To Run\". There are many I know who have their own person favorite and could make a good argument for their choice of favorite Springsteen song. And I would agree with their reasons. But for me there is something about this early hit by the \"Boss\" that has an intensity level and sound to it that just can't be compared to any other. The longing and aching sung in the lyrics by Bruce of a guy who just wants to take his girl Wendy and find a better place for them, a better life. Bruce really gets into this song. That to me is what makes this song so good.

I like fell in love with her all over again.\n\nLeona kind of frustrates me sometimes though. She's got the beauty, the talent and the vocal chops but some of her material is boring. I think she could be really, really big if she brought most of her material home on a really, really good album.

Unfortunately, the song isn't really as strong for Leona as she has shown with her earlier tracks. While it honestly isn't her best song, it still has a nice rhythm. But, if you really want to download a great Leona song, stick with Better In Time instead.

I was a bit surprised to see that this MP3 album's track listing on its Amazon web page does not show the performing artists' names on well over half the listed tracks, and the few names that are shown I have never heard of before. I thought it best to give this album a \"try-before-I-buy\" listen before committing even a couple of bucks to its purchase. I am glad I did.\n\nThis may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard. The 100 tracks selected for this album are alright, although they only cover 25 different Bach compositions and therefore don't give a particularly well-rounded picture of the immense depth and breadth of Bach's incredible genius. The biggest problem, however, is the dated musicianship on the album.\n\nEvery one of the selections is played too slowly, and every performance is flat, lifeless, and dull. Allegro (quick) movements, especially in the Brandenburg Concerto, Orchestral Suite, piano concerto, and violin concerto selections, are played at a nearly Andante (moderately slow) pace, and Andante movements are played at close to a Largo (very slow) tempo.  Choral pieces fare no better. Choruses and solo vocalists, while technically competent, sing with little of the artistry  found in the best Bach recordings. I found the selections from both the \"St. Matthew Passion\" and St. John Passion\" especially lethargic and monotonous.\n\nThere are far better compilations of Bach's music that are performed by world-class musicians who infuse their performances with energy, passion, and tremendous artistry. Two such particularly praiseworthy albums are&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Essential-Bach-2CDs\/dp\/B000W0B1CO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Essential Bach (2CDs)<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/50-x-Bach\/dp\/B00P3CEUXS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">50 x Bach<\/a>, both of which are highly enjoyable and very affordable.\n\nBottom line: \"100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces\" is a non-starter at any price. Not recommended.","summary":"\"100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces\" may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard.","unixReviewTime":1501200000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I didn't expect this song to be a huge masterpiece from my favorite pop singer, Celebration shines in places but overall - this song is kind of weak in production. I can't believe Madge has entertained us for 26 years, I have practically grown up with her - she is the Queen of Pop and forever will be. This song will be included on her upcoming greatest hits cd of the same name.

I cannot remember the last song that I heard that I enjoyed as much. Like the title says, it really is a celebration. Every time I listen to this song I get the feeling that I heard it before. It reminds me of a hybrid of about half a dozen different Madonna songs, such as \"Music\" \"Into The Groove\" \"Holiday\" \"Everybody\" \"Spotlight\" and even \"Erotica.\" It's just so inviting and fun. My favorite part is when Madonna laughs because she has such an honest laughter that is so real and genuine. \"Celebration\" is for both old and newschool fans because the Queen of Pop mixes both the creative and the created like the master artist that she is now famed for. Every time I listen to this song all different images of Madonna over the years flash in my mind, it's like Madonna's life story in 3 minutes set to music. This is the very first MP3 that I ever downloaded, I feel so old. But Madonna is well worth it. For someone who grew up listening to her on compact cassettes this is an entirely new experience but who else can change with the best of em like Madonna.","summary":"you can dance","unixReviewTime":1250640000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary. But, unfortunately her music hasn't really hit the home run in her recent records, and with more of her life the past few years on her marriage to Guy Richie ending, and her adopting African babies, she hasn't been able to really deliver to the big hits. That simple is also the case with Celebration, the new single from Madonna's upcoming anthology from her success with the Warner Brothers era. The song sadly doesn't really deliver the same spark Madonna had delivered throughout her past 26 years. The song sadly is not Madonna at her best. It feels like she doesn't hit that nail on the head, as we've heard from her last few records. While she has been known as the material girl, her material needs to be more fine-tuned when she does deliver her next studio album.\n\nSong: D+","summary":"Celebrated?","unixReviewTime":1249516800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"2","image":null}

After 1992 and the grunge invasion, most hair metal bands split into three categories: some stuck to their guns and kept releasing albums in that style (FireHouse, Slaughter, etc), others split up and were never heard from again, and others attempted to embrace the grunge sound and release music in that vein. \"Insanity Beach\" is more of the latter; there are only a couple of songs that would sound similar to the band's earlier work. Instead of going full on grunge, however, Sleeze Beez pulled a Skid Row and just made their sound grittier. As a result, most of the songs don't have hooks, and it's hard to distinguish between them at times. There are some highlights however, as this album contains one or two of the band's best songs. If you like \"Slave to the Grind\" and \"Subhuman Race\" by Skid Row, you'll like this album. It's sound is kind of a mix between those two albums. The party rock may be long gone, but this is still a good listen.","summary":"Harder, Less Melodic Edge","unixReviewTime":1410739200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":"3","image":null}

While they had everything needed to succeed, for whatever reason, they just never got there.\n\n\"Insanity Beach\" is Sleeze Beez's third and final album. With the release of \"Insanity Beach\", Sleeze Beez took a more harder rocking approach than with their previous releases. Gone is the Def Leppard sound alikes, and in it's place is a more modern hard rock sound. Now don't get me wrong, this album still has that Sleeze Beez sound, it just doesn't have that over-the-top catchiness that \"Screwed, Blued & Tattoed\" and \"Powertool\" had. The album does contain some filler, but the good far outweighed the bad. My favorite tracks from the album are \"Tell It To The Judge\", \"The Long Goodbye\", \"Save Myself\", \"Scream\" and \"Gun Culture\".\n\nThe worst thing about this album is, it's almost non-existent for some reason. I know it was released only in Japan, but come on, where in the world is Rock Candy or Wounded Bird??? Thankfully Amazon.com has it for download for a reasonable price, otherwise most people would never get to hear this great record.","summary":"Not very well known, but it should be","unixReviewTime":1334966400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

And while I have yet to watch \"Highlander\" (I know, I'm a bad nerd...), I heard snippets of the song made famous by it, and decided it was worth a download.\n\nWhile not Queen's most famous song, \"Princes of the Universe\" is a fantastic song by the band, and deserves to be more well-known.  It has the signature Queen sound, part rock and part metal, and all energetic and blood-pumping.  The lyrics get a little lost in the instrumentation from time to time, but if you listen carefully the song is sung from the point of view of one of the film's immortal warriors.  And thankfully, one doesn't have to be familiar with the movie to enjoy said lyrics.\n\nA must-have track if you're a Queen fan, but also worth a listen if you're only casually familiar with them.

Which is something many of today's singers do not have and neither they will try. Hard to believe that it has been 35 years since he made his debut as a part of Wham, and his world really changed. But he has done so many remarkable covers over the years. He showed that throughout his career on his own by covering artists from Bonnie Raitt to Terence Trent D'Arby a few years ago for with Let Her Down Easy for his Symphonica album. But he has covered Stevie Wonder for years for so many of his albums and b-sides. His rendition of As with Mary J. Blige is one of those underrated covers that is really a hidden gem of George's. The song actually was a U.K. exclusive for his 1998 hits compilation, Ladies & Gentleman: The Best Of George Michael. The song is definitely a lovely song to listen to, and definitely worth every note. He really showed that he and Mary really do have a lot of chemistry worth listening to. It really was never recognized in America by die hard George Michael fans, as was the case with Outside back in 1998, but honestly the song definitely is joyous and very soulful. If you have loved George's duets over the years like Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me with Elton John, than you'll absolutely love this song.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"As Strong Today","unixReviewTime":1472083200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

With instrumentals like Burt Kaempfert's \"Wonderland By Night\" and Lawrence Welk's \"Calcutta\" topping the charts American teenagers were casting about looking for exciting new sounds to latch on to. In February 1961 the New York based disc jockey Murray \"The K\" Kaufman secured a copy of a recording session tape made by an unknown Pittsburgh based doo-wop group called The Marcels. The group had just signed with the recently-launched Colpix label in NYC. What Murray the K heard that day was the wildest version of the Rogers & Hart standard \"Blue Moon\" that had ever been attempted to that point. He was positively captivated by the tune and without telling either the record company or the group he began playing it over and over again on his show. Realizing they had a huge hit on their hands Colpix rush-released the single in the final days of February, \"Blue Moon\" reached #1 in New York City in just one short week and was topping the charts nationwide inside of a month. \"Blue Moon\" continues to be one of the most beloved oldies of all-time.  This is the historic hit recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"One of the greatest doo-wop records of all time was recorded in just two takes!","unixReviewTime":1476316800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

There are NOT 100 concertos here, but 35 (or different pieces I should say because some of the music included here is not a Piano Concerto, and another piece is incomplete -Mozart's K365). See my detailed list below. Amazon offers this collection of music for free to Amazon Prime members, which I am very grateful for. If you are not an Amazon Prime member, I strongly encourage you to buy this collection of music anyway. This is a very cheap album with so much joy in it! If you don't particularly like the versions included in here, you can dig deeper and find a better version on youtube or buy a CD of the concerto with your favorite piano player and\/or orchestra-director of your choice. There is always going to be some customers (me included) who are missing something in here (for example Rahmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3, one of my favorite ones, is not included here). Despite of that, the collection includes essentials such as Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5, Tchaikovsky No 1, Brahms No. 2, etc. etc. etc. I have taken the time to include all the concertos included in this collection WITH the name of the composers for every piece. This is something Amazon does not care much to include, as I have complained in other reviews of mine, so someone (me in this case) has to take the time and include the information which I believe is very helpful.

The first is the length,, it leaves you wanting too much more - but that might be a good thing\n\nThe second is that the track entitled \"little hitlers\" seems to be a word-for-word copy of an earlier Louis C.K skit.\n\nAside from those two things - five stars.

I laughed so hard tears ran down my cheeks! I look forward to another stand up show from this ultra talented young man. Donald Glover covered almost all current topics, from racial issues, family memories over a smore chocolate, and the meaning of the word nigglet! Lol. You will not be disappointed with this stellar comedy show. I like his calm demeanor and voice impressions too. Most people know Donald Glover from either the critically acclaimed show \"30 Rock\", or you may know him from his rap career under the name of Childish Gambino. Honestly watching this comedy stand up \"weirdo\" is the first time I have ever heard of him(Donald Glover). I recently checked out his rap albums \"Because the internet\" and \"Royalty\". I must say I was thoroughly impressed with Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino's music. Versatile, witty, and funny beyond measure, Donald Glover's is a truly talented weirdo for sure. Check this entertaining show out and laugh your butt off.

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","summary":"Great","unixReviewTime":1452556800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I think it's important for both males and females to have songs that make them feel good.  While this is usually meant for women, I believe that men can relate to it as well.  We all have a song or more that are our fight songs.  This is one such song by Katy Perry that is such for me.  When Roar was released I felt like the universe gave me such a shot of positive juice, and I needed something to help me get back up after Mom died.","summary":"Part of all of us.","unixReviewTime":1466035200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Musically, all the hype she had brought out, turned out to be a absolute failure with her album MDNA. Her lead single from her latest work, and her first after leaving Warner Brother Give Me All Your Lovin' isn't exactly a driven song. It feels like and sounds like Madonna doesn't actually have anything to prove within her voice and sound, especially when trying to reinvent herself for a whole new generation of fans. I think she could've brought more into the song, and doesn't feel like convincing from her voice alone. Hopefully, there is better songs from her to give all your loving to.\n\nSong: D+","summary":"Not Loving","unixReviewTime":1334448000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

That person's point is that this song sounds like their other songs.  Mine is that the song, itself, sounds mostly the same all the way through.\n\nIt's a high energy rock song.  It starts with a wall of guitar sound that remains mostly unchanged through the first 2\/3 of the song.  High energy drums.  But dynamic; there is no rise or fall in volume level; pretty much just loud all the way up to that 2\/3.  While there are chord changes, the wall of guitar at the beginning has a way of hiding them.\n\nObviously this song did not do much for me, even though I'm a fan of many kinds of music.\n\nThen again, for people who like this kind of music, this is just the sort of music they'd like! ;-)","summary":"All The Same","unixReviewTime":1357776000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It's an airy love song about a girl who is waiting for a call from a guy she really likes and had a good time with the night before, but isn't sure if he feels the same way.  Lead singer, Amy Heidemann's sweet vocals helped make the song a winner.  What was interesting, though was her briefly dabbling in a few rap lyrics during the song.  Far from being a gimmick, Amy (who is about looks about as hip hop as Weird Al Yankovic sounds Barry White) actually has quite a talent for rapping.\n\n  In this follow-up song, \"Hello\", her raps make up a much larger portion of the song.  When combined with her edgier singing voice in the lyrics, it feels like a wholly different musical experience.  If your first exposure to Karmin has been to listen to \"Hello\" without even having seen the video, the group would not be as you pictured.  Two good hits already have me looking forward to what Karmin does next.","summary":"Multi-talented Karmin shines","unixReviewTime":1371427200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's \"Forget Him\" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again.","summary":"A teen idol's last big hit.","unixReviewTime":1466294400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I wanted that song in my collection and hoped that I would find more of the same.  Well, I both did and didnt.  I did because there is a bounty of worship none of which I was familiar with but I didn't because I didn't find any other song that generated the same type of emotional or worshipful connection that I Surrender did.  Im not terribly into worship music and don't like a lot of it so when I find something that I resonate so strongly with I end up having high hopes.  I wasn't disappointed but sometimes I found myself having to work at being engaged.  I do think that the albums last two tracks, Greater Than All with its crescendoing force and a studio version of Hope of the World with an upfront piano line and steady rhythm, are very good worship songs.  Vocalists vary and include both men and women leads.  There are some other tracks on here that are moving or that I just enjoy (the production is such that the live experience is muted and it really sounds more like a studio album with background shouts and choral voices and echoes tracked down) and I was surprised at how long Hillsong has been doing this and it being commercially available.  Personally I don't know that I will go out and purchase another Hillsong Live disc but at least they're on my radar.","summary":"I Surrender is what brought me to Cornerstone.","unixReviewTime":1519430400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":"5","image":null}

But this song has stuck with me forever and I have applied it several women since including the young woman who became my wife who was such a non-Clairol Blonde when we first met that I did not believe she was not a Clairol Blonde for several months.

The boys grew up listening to the R & B groups of the 1950s. The sounds of groups like The Moonglows, The Heartbeats, and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers would have a profound influence on founding group members Charlie and Rich Ingui.\n\nIn the mid 1960's The Soul Survivors began to build a strong following, playing venues in Atlantic City and Philadelphia. Enjoying great success in Philadelphia, they attracted the attention of record producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Into the recording studio they went, emerging with \" Expressway To Your Heart \" a song that would climb to #3 on Billboard's R&B chart and #4 on the Hot 100 Singles pop chart. The success of \"Expressway\" would become Gamble and Huff's first \"crossover\" hit when it began to be played on both black and white radio stations.\n\nIn polls taken by both the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphias City Paper, \" Expressway\" was voted the number one record ever to come out of Philadelphia.  It's easy to see why.","summary":"Top Ten smash from 1967.","unixReviewTime":1471132800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The thing is, though, THE SEER is not equally superb throughout.  The second disc is just amazing, so don't be too hasty to form your opinion after only hearing Disc One.  The opening track (Lunacy) is fairly light, and there is a clear minimalist influence.  Then Disc Two shoots us screaming into space on a dark, psychedelic voyage!\n\nMichael Gira's reformed Swans are more powerful than ever.  The more recent TO BE KIND (2014) is more consistent than THE SEER -- it's stronger throughout -- but it does not reach the same heights.\n\nThe music of Michael Gira and Swans is raw, visionary and uncompromising.  His vocals remind of both Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, but the music is sui generis.  Listening is like plugging your mind directly into the black hole at the heart of the galaxy.","summary":"Raw and visionary, it rips open the perceptual cage","unixReviewTime":1431907200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":"4","image":null}

{"overall":5.0,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2014","reviewerID":"AA4VJFR1EDIN6","asin":"B008VSIIU2","reviewerName":"David White","reviewText":"The urge to merge:  instinctual as breathing and inevitable as growing up, there comes a time when Be Without You sounds better than Single Life and many start looking outward for legacy-building, contentment and companionship (spiritually and otherwise).  Dweles song catalog has always showcased the stages of love, but his sixth release, Greater Than One, delves deeper into murkier temptations and territories, using rich melodies, heightened harmonies and lucid lyrics to encapsulate a desire to commit without sacrificing the cool factor in the process.\n\nIf long-time fans or Dwele-come-lately listeners had high expectations due to his spectacular 2010 project, W.ants W.orld W.omen, the multi-instrumentalist, producer and songwriter doesnt disappoint: theres less bombast and boom-bap than on W.ants, since a distinctively 80s aura dominates this set, but its range is just as emotive and exciting.  Never one to phone in, the prolific Dwele writes or co-writes ten of the thirteen tracks while working the drum kit, keys and horns. Monica Blaire, Raheem DeVaughn, J Tait, L Renee and one-man hit machine Mike City contribute just enough of their talents to embellish Greater  without overtaking its direction.\n\nAs the opening interlude demonstrates, the 30+ performer is coming to terms with relinquishing the player card, but is not quite ready for rings, kids and SUVs just yet, a brutal truth that he paid dearly for in the bittersweet, horn-laden jazzy soul hybrid Going Leaving: She wanted more but I wasn't ready, me keepin it real made her heart heavy. I can admit it, scared me when she said where is this go-ING, I said Im not rea-DY, now shes leav-ING.she wants chil-DREN, OOOH.  One of the Mike City joints, the single What Profit, offers up syncopated rhythms and guitar-anchored grit on a cautionary tale about deserting your baby for the bling after getting large: Deep inside your mind down to the depths of your soul\/you see love lasts long, after all the money comes and goes. What profit a man to gain the whole world, but lose his girl. If I were your man, Id do all I can, to keep you Girl.\n\nJust as a relationship can arc outward as deeper emotions take root, the songs on Greater. ripple and resonate as Dwele wades into deeper levels of honesty and oneness. Takes22Tango is a sinuous and salty exploration of a love that has potential to steal the show when they get their vertical rhythm right, and Raheem DeVaughn helps to double-down on the give-her-good-love or else message during the mellow, but mesmerizing What You Gotta Do. Another intriguing track is Obey, with Dweles tenor solemnly promising happily-ever-after as synthesized notes swell and surge beneath a fragile reunion.  This Love is a 180-degree turn-around and a likely culmination at the jewelry store, jubilant and flush with affectionate awe for his newly-christened missus.\n\nDwele may be contemplating future monogamy, but the present still leaves room for partying, heard on the glib Must Be while trading verses with Black Milk, LRenee and J. Tait about the chaos that occurs when we aint sober and as hes wading through a Love Triangle, a folly that clicked into place after two friends with eyes for Dwele decide to..well, you can guess. Patrick Ronald (which mustve been conceived after a Prince\/The Time music marathon) is a club cut paying homage to the stomach-scraping beverage known as Patron that even allows Dwele to drop a few bars: That girl, she lookin good\/ she came up on me talmbout whassup I said my wood,\/ sorry, thats Patrick talkin. Frankly My Dear (Im Bennett I Aint Innit) closes with repentance when as he plays tug-of-war with his lust and his logic after discovering that last nights companion has a man: But you sure is fine, and right now you're mine\/I should just be hesitant and use my common sense. On my shoulders theres a good head, but I keep using my (bleeped out) instead.\n\nIn the decade since his self-distributed debut Rize, Dwele couldve stagnated within the neo-soul niche or chased bigger name recognition by dropping simpler and sex-starved R&B, but the Detroit native continues to evolve, fearlessly melding expansive lyrical insights with his masterful sense of musicality, making this CD an essential purchase and one of the Greater contemporary soul releases of 2012.","summary":"\" GREATER THAN ONE \"","unixReviewTime":1407974400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Musically, they have been absent from the scene for a long time, while Steven Tyler did well on his brief stint on American Idol. But for the group, they are trying again with What Could Have Been Love from their album Music from Another Dimension. The song feels like a throwback to the ballads that Aerosmith had that were strong back in the 90's like Crazy and Cryin'. The song isn't a bad song, but honestly not as driven as their other songs had shown before. I really am eager to hear what is next for Aerosmith from their what their next single is going to be. What Could Have Been Love is not Aerosmith's best, but is better than a lot of the joke artists like Rihanna and Katy Perry have came out with.\n\nSong: B-","summary":"The Return Of Aerosmith","unixReviewTime":1352678400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Steven Tyler & company have parted for a long time while Steven has had his gig with American Idol and Jennifer Lopez. But honestly, hard core Aerosmith fans have wanted something even more, new music. There is so much awaiting with What Could Have Been Love, the lead single from Aerosmith's Music From Another Dimension album. The song is not bad, a straight-forward and simple throwback to Aersmith's earlier ballads from the 80's and 90's in tone. It doesn't drive up to those earlier songs the bad boys from Boston have made years earlier like Cryin' and I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing. But it is better than most of the cheap and cheesy music from acts like Katy Perry and Rihanna have made for the past several years. Hopefully, we will hear better when Music From Another Dimension comes out soon.\n\nSong: B-","summary":"Aerosmith's Next Dimension","unixReviewTime":1352332800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I feel weird rating a song anyway. Usually people know what they are buying at least through a sample but this song is very good for those of us that have listened to ZZ Top since the 70's and HATE what the 80's and 90's did with them.\n\nThe song is about smoking meth from my best understanding, which I think is a stupid thing to do. You have to be an idiot to do use meth. But there are many historical songs about drug use that are not promoting the behavior, and I suspect this is one of those songs...just making an example of the behavior, not promoting it. These guys are so old, a hit of meth would kill any one of them, so I think they know that.\n\nYou have to get in to the mental weeds to understand all that, especially since the lyrics are about as seemingly random as can be and make virtually no sense...pretty much like the words of a meth head, which I think is the point of the song.\n\nDo not use illegal drugs especially idiotic drugs like meth. It will turn you in to an idiot if you actually survive.\n\nAll that said, this is a good song.","summary":"If you like ZZ Top heck yea","unixReviewTime":1370995200,"style":null,"vote":null,"image":null}

Professional recording artist Heidi Breyer's 2012 release Beyond the Turning features 14 eloquent piano instrumental songs. This is her third album, and follow-up to Another Place and Time, an album produced by founder of Windham Hill Records, Will Ackerman. Another Place and Time earned Heidi 2 ZMR Awards in 2010 for Best New Artist & Best Instrumental Piano Album.\n\nBeyond the Turning, produced by GRAMMY Winning producer and engineer Corin Nelsen, is another magnificent testimonial to the talents of composing pianist Heidi Breyer. An elemental variation in moods and influences is what makes Beyond the Turning shine from the rest. Artists include Eugene Friesen, Charlie Bisharat, Samite, Michael Manring, Steve Holley, Jeff Haynes, Jill Haley and David Cullen.","summary":"Review from NewAgeMusicWorld.com","unixReviewTime":1354406400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The opener \"Farewell\" with David Cullen's electric guitar is breathtakingly moving.  On the second track \"World Without End,\" Eugene Friesen's cello gives such depth in counterpoint to Heidi's gorgeous piano melody.  \"Eight steps free\" is another delightful track that opens with the lyricon (sounds like a penny whistle to me); it's ethereal and beautiful.  Janis Ian penned \"Tea & Sympathy\" that was on her 1975 album \"Between the Lines\" which transforms under Heidi's touch into a soft lullaby with her gentle vocals hugging the lovely melody.  \"Moondancing\" is a lovely soft piece that is given a major jazz inflection with Premik Russell-Tubbs' saxophone.  \"Beyond the Turning\" works well as a largely new age instrumental offering because of the great variety in instruments, superb musicianship and Heidi's inspired performance.

The other musicians on the album are as varied as the music and bring an eclectic sound to the mix. Breyer adds her delicate vocals to the two cover tunes and presents her first ever recorded improvisation (\"The Long Way Home, Passages 1-3\"), making this album a musical and emotional journey.\n\n\"Beyond the Turning\" opens with \"Farewell,\" a piece that contains one of the album's biggest surprises. Beginning as a heartfelt piano solo, I was blown away when David Cullen's electric guitar entered at about the halfway point. Breyer heard this piece as a piano and electric guitar duet when she wrote it and refused to compromise on the unique combination of instruments. I wasn't sure I liked that combination at first, but Cullen's passionate playing communicates so well and contrasts so dramatically with the piano that it won me over. \"World Without End\" was inspired by a painting by Alexander Volkov. This is actually the third version of this piece, which Breyer concedes may never be completely finished. Her piano, Eugene Friesen's cello, and Samite's vocals give it a hauntingly beautiful expression. \"My Peace Piece\" is a piano solo dedicated to jazz pianist Bill Evans. Slow, fluid, and very graceful, this one's a favorite. So is \"Rive Droite,\" which features the violin artistry of the amazing Charlie Bisharat and Bob Colwell on accordion in addition to Breyer's rhythmic and sensual piano. I also really like \"Eight Steps Free,\" a duet for piano and lyricon (an electronic wind instrument with a very ethereal quality) played by Premik Russell-Tubbs. \"Tea and Sympathy\" is an arrangement of one of Janis Ian's classics. Guitar, piano, and bass are a simple but very effective accompaniment to Breyer's heartfelt vocals and Ian's poetic lyrics. \"Moondancing\" was an experiment in rhythm and is the first of Breyer's pieces with percussion (tam-tam). Russell-Tubbs' soulful saxophone adds the  perfect emotional element and makes it soar. The title track is a gorgeous duet for piano and English horn (Jill Haley) that expresses the realization that there are so many turns in the roads we travel in life, often wondering what lies \"beyond the turning,\" and the inner peace that comes with the acceptance that the turning happens every day and letting it flow through us.\n\nRecommended!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1349049600,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Breyer's collaborators include Cullen on acoustic guitar, Charlie Bisharat on violin, Eugene Friesen on cello, Jill Haley on English horn, Samite on vocals, flutes, and adungu (a nine-string African harp), Premik Russell-Tubbs on lyricon and saxophone, Bob Colwell on accordion, Marc Enfroy on string group coordination, Max MacFarland and Michael Manring on bass, Steve Holley on drums, and Jeff Haynes on percussion.\n\nIn coordinating all of this musical chemistry, Breyer has created a unique album of exotic sounds and deep personal insight whose appeal will reach far and wide beyond just fans of piano music.","summary":"The RajMan Review","unixReviewTime":1347753600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

As outstanding as that one was, her latest recording takes it to the next level. The album was produced at Synchrosonic Productions by Grammy winner Corin Nelsen. While Heidi's music may generally fall into the acoustic new age category, there are elements of classical, jazz, and folk, as well as some unexpected ones.\n\nInterestingly, the album begins with \"Farewell,\" a bittersweet composition that Heidi refers to as \"a valediction to things passed.\" The piece which begins as a plaintive piano solo, evolves to include one of those \"unexpected elements\" alluded to earlier. In my mind I could imagine a scenario where jazz virtuoso Keith Jarrett is alone in his studio playing a solo piano ballad, when Carlos Santana slips in through the back door, plugs in, and begins to join in with his signature soaring lead guitar. However, in this case the Grammy-winning guitarist was David Cullen, and the pianist, of course, Heidi Breyer.\n\nThe musical interaction continues on the second track, this time between Heidi's eloquent grand piano and three-time Grammy winner, cellist Eugene Friesen, who is well known as a member of The Paul Winter Consort. While Heidi's influences range from the classical masters such as Bach and Chopin to the earthy folk music of Janis Ian, she pays a heartfelt tribute to her favorite jazz pianist, Bill Evans, on a spacious solo composition called \"My Peace Piece. The album is mostly instrumental, yet Heidi's lovely vocals also grace the recording.\n\nWhile solo piano \"passages\" are interspersed throughout the album, further creative collaborations ensue on an evocative and soulful composition entitled \"Moondancing,\" which features former Pat Metheney Group percussionist Jeff Haynes, and Premik Russell-Tubbs on sax. On the title track, Heidi is joined by the always-tasteful English horn accompaniment of Jill Haley. Insight into the inspiration for the title \"Beyond The Turning\" can be found in Heidi's reflection that \"the concept of the road is so important, precisely because you don't know what lies beyond the turning, and the only way to find out is to travel it.\"","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1346889600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"3","image":null}

There is an real 90's vibe to the track, but it is obviously modernized in all the right ways.  The vocals are creamy good, dwelling in that ambiguous nature with which Active Child stakes their claim as well (What is feminine?  What is masculine?).  This is a great introduction to a band I can't wait to hear more from.

Musically, he was one of the most influential entertainers of all time. But after the 80's and early 90's, Michael was losing his seat from the throne, and in 2009, he passed away. But he had some of the most brilliant songs during his peak of his success, and that will never be taken away from what he left behind. When the pressure was on to follow-up the mammoth success of Thriller, Bad didn't have the sales success in the long run, but Michael still had the chart success and some of the most timeless songs of his career, in fact more timeless than even Thriller, Off The Wall, or what he had with his brothers in the Jackson 5. Man In The Mirror remains one of Michael's most riveting ballad of the 80's, that still has as much serious heart reflecting on the negative world around us, and how differences can be made for a better life for everyone. It still is one of Michael Jackson's deepest ballads that is worth listening to each and every time. If you have never even heard a Michael Jackson song before, well this is one I absolutely recommend.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"From The King's Mirror","unixReviewTime":1471651200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Sadly, the lack of heart in her Basic Insinct record, hurt her in her drive and as well as her songs. She wasn't able to make it with her Fantasy Ride record either, and it failed to deliver. Now, she is trying it again with her song Sorry, from her upcoming album One Woman Army. Sadly, the song isn't as driven as she could've made it with her earlier songs. I really didn't find sorry to be so strong. It lacked in making it all the way home in voice. I really think Ciara needs to find a better tune when One Woman Army comes out. If more songs are going to be poorly made, than Ciara will lose her element. Hopefully, the next single from her upcoming record could be more than Sorry.\n\nSong: C-","summary":"Sorry?","unixReviewTime":1349740800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Hard rock is likely the riskiest medium of all for the classics, but Brewster  keeps it real both ways. The instrumental mix 'Miraculum' is quite powerful, and he slows down just in time to close reverently with \"Silent NIght'.  There are  a few tracks that aren't obviously 'Christmas oriented', and  the metal sounds a bit noisy in places such as 'Do You Hear What I Hear', but overall plenty of positive energy and a great change of pace for those of us that listen to a lot of Christmas music.","summary":"I always appreciate something different.","unixReviewTime":1387497600,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I've always been a fan of Bobbby and he has yet to flat out disapoint me on any of his album release. Highlights on the album include the lead single Mirror, Role Play and 1st Class Love. I would say the highlight of the album though is the duet with K. Michelle Put It In. Bobby V may not be the BEST singer in the world and he doesn't try to be. Bobby V reminds me of Keith Sweat in the sense that he uses his voice to the best of it's capablities and never tries to be someone he's not.","summary":"Another Good Album From Bobby V","unixReviewTime":1378944000,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Especially noteworthy is the guitar solo in the middle of the song; it's great!  The song has good energy, but the band is over-singing, and they are out of tune in several places.  The recording quality is odd; it sounds a bit like it was recorded in a hollow tunnel by a band that included screaming out the lyrics  (look at the cover!) and pounding on the drums.  Note: this is a new band, working out their sound.  Overall, it's okay, but I'd like to hear them in a couple of years when they've had a chance to grow.  I'm glad I got it on a free promotion.  I wouldn't pass by the station if this was playing on the radio, but I wouldn't want to pay to hear it, either.","summary":"Trial Run","unixReviewTime":1370476800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Only $7 bucks and you get all 32 of them! These are played by the Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando, and I have become a fan of his because of this Beethoven set. I've read that he does the same thing that Glenn Gould did when he played: i.e. he hums. You can barely hear it on these recordings though, in case you were wondering. These were all recorded in Hungary back in the late '80's to the early '90's, when the collapse of the Iron Curtain brought freedom to Eastern Europe. The recordings are simple and not gussied up in any fancy kind of way. Because of this the lighter and shorter sonatas tend to come out better, while the bigger and heavier sonatas are still good but not great. This set will not diminish in the mind's eye the 2 greatest Beethoven pianists ever, Schnabel and Kempff, but it is still a must own for lovely-lovely-Ludwig-Van fanatics. Not to be missed.-------------------PEACE","summary":"Jeno Jando plays Beethoven..........like silvery wine floating in a spaceship, gravity all nonsense.","unixReviewTime":1510012800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

When I saw this MP3 albums amazingly low price of $6.99 for the entire collection of 32 Beethoven piano sonatas, I immediately purchased it. I am very glad I did.\n\nJen Jand&oacute; is a Hungarian concert pianist who has recorded for the Naxos classical music label for over twenty years. He is the featured soloist on Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas, and his performances of these masterworks are uniformly excellent. Jand&oacute; plays in a highly polished, artistic, and yet straightforward manner that conveys Beethovens full range of emotions very effectively, but without any unnecessary musical flourishes. He is very easy and enjoyable to listen to. I don't think he is in quite the same exalted company as elite concert pianists like Murray Perahia, Vladimir Ashkenazy, or Martha Argerich, (to name but a few), but Jand&oacute; acquits himself very well indeed in each note of every Beethoven piano sonata he plays.\n\nI think Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas by Jen Jand&oacute; is an excellent way to acquire a complete cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas at a very affordable price. While perhaps not the very top choice for these works, it is certainly a clear winner, and one of my new favorites. Highly recommended.

But when she passed away in 2012, the entertainment industry lost one of its most beautiful treasures at the soul. When she passed on right before the Grammy Awards, it hit the world like a sledgehammer at the soul of the heart. I definitely know Whitney had never forgot how people treated her more like she personally was a mistake, and not a soulful and simplistic songstress. When Whitney passed on in 2012, right before Sparkle was released to the public, it felt like the world lost its voice. Arista chose to release a posthumous hits album to celebrate Whitney's legacy, and one of her last songs, I Look To You was recorded as a duet with R. Kelly. The newer version of I Look To You didn't even ignite with R. Kelly, whom wrote the song for Whitney over a decade earlier, but it didn't get to Whitney, until she decided to get back in the music industry, after she was mocked by the populace as the \"Crack Is Whack\" girl. When the song originally came out in 2009 from Whitney alone for her final album, it was beautiful and sincere at the soul, because the world was mourning the death of Michael Jackson, and it was truly beautiful beyond words. But posthumously with R. Kelly, it sincerely was no where near the \"Unforgettable\" intimacy in posthumous duets. It isn't a bad download for new Whitney fans and die hard fans of \"The Voice.\" But new fans and others, should just listen to her final album in 2009, I Look To You, and then judge for themselves.\n\nSong: C+","summary":"Nearly Two, Becomes One","unixReviewTime":1461801600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Instead, there was a new voice of someone who had gone through an experience and was still struggling to survive it. I liked her new voice and really wish that her audience would have allowed her to explore it more instead of criticizing her for not sounding like she did in the early years.

When you hear it, you rarely have to guess who the possible vocalist is (with the exception of the vocals of John's son Julian who has his facial structure).

It sounds like an instantaneous sunrise, like bwaaowww! and the sun is up. The guitarist is Jesse Ed Davis and he is playing the sweetest wah pedal tone ever. Listening to this song is like floating on a cloud. Very much of its time, breezy mid-70s production with a heavy layer of smoothness, kind of like 10CC's 'I'm Not in Love' or The Hollies 'Air that I Breathe'.\n\nNicky Hopkins on keyboards and John's pal Klaus Voormann on bass. I always feel a little sadness about John when I hear his music, but then I know he doesn't want people hanging their heads - keep yer chin up, world! I never knew that John had used the string arrangement already, on Nilsson's version of Many Rivers to Cross. It's fun to hear it on a different song. Once in a rare while I obsess over the tinniness of the reverb used on John's voice, but it's pretty well buried under the heavy string gravy...man it's thick. But so ultra-creamy. And, obviously, dreamy.\n\nAh! bwakawa pouss, pouss","summary":"SEP 5","unixReviewTime":1497139200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

To me, this song is a distant cousin of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in that it evokes a memory from childhood of discovering something both magical and profoundly emotional. They symphony playing along with John sounds way more soulful than anything ELO ever managed. \"#9 Dream\" is one of those moments where John's artsy side yields something absolutely lovely, as opposed to, say, his artsy side yielding something like \"Two Virgins\". Maybe \"ama bakawa pussy pussy\" was John having a prophetic vision of Pussy Riot and cheering them on?","summary":"Ama-Bakawa-P***y-P***y","unixReviewTime":1393286400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The 3 Buckingham tracks, especially the radiant \"Brother & Sister\" are top-notch tunes. The tunes by Graham Parker are also very good with \"What Do You Like?\" being the standout track. The songs by Paul Simon, Loudon Wainwright III, Ryan Adams, Wilco, and the Avett Brothers are also very strong ones. Really, the only tracks I don't care for are the ones by Yoko Ono and Fiona Apple.

I'll admit he doesn't have the best flow of the group or even the best rhymes, but there's something about his voice that is commanding. On this album, he brings that commanding force and rhymes really well on some songs, does good then loses his momentum, or just kind of talks in rhyme. The beats are off the hook, the music does have alot of soul in it, but I can't give this 5 stars because Masta Killa made a really solid effort but it wasn't something that I'll be spinning again anytime soon. The shout-outs to all his influeneces and his tribute to Ol Dirty, that was a really cool way to end things I gotta say. People who say this is not worth your time and bad, I wouldn't go that far. If you like Wu-Tang or even like Masta Killa, pick this up and you'll probably enjoy it. Just know it's not somethin that's gonna blow your mind or anything.

It has a laid back atmosphere that decently complements Masta Killa's delivery but the majority of the end is either talking or skits. The production is rather all over the place as some have that Wu-Tang trademark sound while others go on a West Coast synthesized appeal. Masta Killa performs decently with his slow delivery, deep lyrics, and somewhat average flow but the lack of solid hooks, too many skit-time, and change in production kills it. Add his weak attempt to sound like ODB (he is paying homage) and you get annoyed. This is more of a backpack album, beware.","summary":"starts off decently and then drastically goes downhill...","unixReviewTime":1363737600,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Enough quality songs to maintain 5 stars, some of the dups are great songs.\n\nFearless by Our Lost Infantry. Identifiable up front lead vocal over busy band. Nice Alt. song w\/peaking vocals & strong sound. Very nice 5 minutes although repeating same line to end gets old fast.\n\nHome by Lights & Motion. Opening light weight bells & keyboard, sounding little seasonal (Christmas) grows in volume & content as the song progresses. Melds into nice instrumental. Like it.\n\nStorms by Accents. Lone pleasant male vocal over acoustic guitar. Singer song writer number with some minor backing. Very nice.\n\nColors In Stereo by Moonlit Sailor. Indie Pop Instrumentation, Post Rock Atmospherics per their record label. And they are correct, ambitious almost grand sound that cruises along. Enjoyable well produced, very nice.\n\nThe Lines Above Our Heads, Again For The Win. Slow, simple build w\/steady band and great lead vocal. Song opens out to quality Indie number, controlled & deliberate. Like it, very nice.\n\nUltrapop by Ethienne. Mild distorted fuzz keyboard sound, simple pop song, electro vocal over keyboards, chorus & beat. Okay.\n\nMiles by Keystone Kids. Electronic pop (stolen from record label web site) is not a bad description. Nothing special indie\/pop, you will like it.\n\nTrack 8 is Granville by The Sky Life. Male lead singer slowly keeping up with acoustic backing. Deliberate vocals that I did not care enough about to listen to. Slow s\/sw number you will love it.\n\nSleep by The Cast Before The Break. Cool mildly threatening opening on quality ambient\/indie rock song. Layered punching sounds behind superior male vocal. Very nice 6 minutes including frantic center & end. Love it.\n\nRed Lightning Child\/Great Emptiness by Coma Recovery. Another instrumental track. Strong busy track, no vocals but pounding collection of band parts that keeps your attention. Never breaks out into hard rock (to me) but easily rides the edge for the whole wave. Very nice, like it.\n\nA Different Heav'n by The Dandelion War. Lavish Atmospherics still a valid description, choral vocal over subdued not much. Little more sound starts half way through the song. You may love it.\n\nLet Us In! (Come On) by The Lions Rampant. Great garage rock sound, energy and uninhibited sound. Nothing fancy kinda punk meets The Kinks feel. Love it.\n\nHomage To Excess by Cari Clara. Straining male vocal over acoustic guitar, kinda emotional number, not for me. You may love it.\n\nLast track, Speaking For Everyone (Version II-Piano) by Athletics. Mellow piano opening (no really?) lone male vocal unwinding & growing with the song. Nice.\n\nDeep Elm included some duplicate tracks from Postrockology released couple of days ago on this sampler. All sound great as does this sampler & it's all free pointless to complain. Mostly thoughtful, smart, well produced ambient & indie songs. Nothing heavy, very nice.\nThe duplicate songs are: Home by Lights & Motion, Colors In Stereo by Moonlit Sailor, Sleep by The Cast Before The Break and Red Lightning Child\/Great Emptiness by Coma Recovery.\nDownload & delete, more good stuff from Deep Elm.","summary":"Couple of dups more of the same from Deep Elm, very nice","unixReviewTime":1354924800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"6","image":null}

I think I came to love the expressiveness of piano via the pop music of Laura Nyro.  The track that blows me away totally is the less-than-two-minute \"Awaken the Dawn\" with its piano elegant and celebratory and the orchestration that bolsters the sound.  From there, the CD opens into a wide emotional panorama with Crane's piano always evoking emotion such as on \"Clear Creek\" that moves briskly and then gets pensive.  \"Untouched\" has a classical feel.  \"Soli Deo Gloria\" is lush and lovely & makes me want to write a lyric and have it sung by Josh Groban.  \"Archetype\" starts with a strong orchestral introduction before Crane's piano takes over announcing triumphal jubilation.

It has an inner power and optimism which stir the soul from the first moments. Sometimes quick, sometimes slow it flows as moments of your life with its joys and sorrows pass before your eyes. And you can see all your life in perspective.\n\nThe piano music of Timothy Crane full of dramatic effect as it is a soundtrack to exciting movie. Exquisite orchestrations are beautifully added to the inspiring music of the artist.\n\nAll these features of Timothy Crane's music are important. But maybe the most significant feature of his music is the composer is always in the moment, he creates in the present time and he is completely immersed in his music.\n\nI can compare the music of \"Pianoforte\" with a colorful butterfly which flutters from one beautiful flower to another.\n\nWhen the music ends one wants to exclaim: \"Why this happened so fast!\" because \"Pianoforte\" belongs to that sort of music which you undoubtedly want to listen to time and again.\n\nThe music of the newest album of Timothy Crane dies down but its charm remains with you.","summary":"Writings by Serge Kozlovsky","unixReviewTime":1355961600,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}
{"overall":5.0,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"12 17, 2012","reviewerID":"AF74UAKV3Q3W0","asin":"B00AFXD08Q","reviewerName":"Kathy Parsons","reviewText":"\"Pianoforte\" is Timothy Crane's third release, following \"Dragonfly\" (2010) and \"The Other Life I Dream\" (2004). A lifelong musician who started out in a rock band, Crane calls his music \"instrumental pop\" and enjoys including an assortment of musical styles in each collection. This group of twelve original pieces features the piano front and center and includes acoustic guitar by Rick Henley and orchestration created by Crane and Jason Rowsell. Like his previous albums, \"Pianoforte\" was produced on a shoestring budget by independent musicians \"who simply want to create and play music - even if it means recording on the weekends in a basement.\" Thanks to technology and Crane's experience, this does NOT sound like music recorded in a basement or garage. Styles range from quiet and reflective to more upbeat and energetic, making this a really good album for driving, working, or just kicking back and getting lost in.\n\n\"Pianoforte\" begins with \"What Will I Be?,\" a piece that begins quietly with oboe and piano, suggesting a daydream - perhaps a young child staring out a window, lost in thought. As it evolves, the piece becomes fuller and more orchestrated, sounding more like a film soundtrack. \"Awaken the Dawn\" is quite different with an effervescent piano flourish for starters and a big, powerful orchestra keeping the piece dancing and spinning throughout. \"Clear Creek\" goes in yet another direction with piano and acoustic guitar (with background orchestration) painting a scene of peaceful respite and reflection. \"Untouched\" reminds me of the wonder of discovering places that have been \"untouched\" by civilization - wilderness areas, mountain vistas, remote beaches, etc. Piano, oboe, and orchestra give this piece a range from playful to awe-inspiring.  \"Disappearing Moon\" includes a bold piano part, mandolin (I think!), and full orchestra. The strummed instrument gives the piece a mysterious touch that I really like. \"Red Line\" is a piece Crane often plays in concert but that had not yet been recorded. One of the faster and bigger pieces, I would imagine that this is a real crowd pleaser live! \"Soli Dio Gloria\" is by far the longest track at just over five minutes, and feels emotional and personal, like telling about very moving chapter from ones life or giving heartfelt advice to someone close who is hurting - my favorite on this album. \"Archetype\" is very cinematic and visual with a big sweep and an infectious energy. I really like this one, too! \"Stratford Road\" brings the album to a peaceful and dreamy close with a piece that evokes nostalgia and longing - also a beauty!\n\nEven though this CD is relatively short at 33 minutes, these pieces are all full and complete. Anything more could spoil the mood. Recommended!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1355702400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"2","image":null}
{"overall":5.0,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"12 3, 2012","reviewerID":"A2R35DE00SQDJQ","asin":"B00AFXD08Q","reviewerName":"Michael Diamond","reviewText":"Tim's music is something he characterizes as \"instrumental pop,\" which reflects influences from new age, rock, popular, and even classical music. Right from the opening track, a blend of distinctive melody and impressive technique is evident. Although the track, entitled \"What Will I Be,\" is barely over 2 minutes long, it feels like a complete composition and exhibits a surprising dynamic range in its brief lifespan. In fact, all but one song out of twelve are under 3:15 in length. This brings the total time of the CD to around 33 minutes - relatively short for a CD, but like a buffet of extremely rich food, small portions are just right. By the end you certainly feel like you've had a very full listening experience, given the intricacy and diversity of Tim's music. Although the piano is the centerpiece of the album, lush orchestration tastefully compliments the compositions. Synthesizers and samplers add the sound of strings and woodwinds, while the acoustic guitar of Rick Henley provides accompaniment on some songs.\n\nNeo-classical and rock influences combine on \"Awaken The Dawn,\" in a virtuoso high velocity piece that brought to mind the keyboard wizardry of progressive rockers like Rick Wakeman of Yes, and Keith Emerson from Emerson Lake and Palmer. A nice contrast to this style is a tune called \"Hopefaith,\" which showcases the more gentle side of Tim's playing, yet also exhibits his dynamic range within the boundaries of a song. I was impressed with Tim's abilities as a composer and arranger, as well as with how much detail and complexity he was able to imbue in some of his relatively compact compositions. A song entitled \"Hide And Seek\" is built on a simple descending motif, providing a platform for lavish orchestration to add to the cinematic air. I appreciated that Tim chose to end the album with one of his most sensitive compositions, \"Stratford Road.\" This was the perfect one to provide closure after a CD's worth of intricate, and often intense piano virtuosity. This piece had a pleasant pastoral quality that I found emotionally evocative. In general, the music on this album lends itself more to active listening, than background ambience. Timothy Crane has crafted a spirited mlange of diverse ingredients and influences in the music of \"Pianoforte.\"","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1354492800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","summary":":-)","unixReviewTime":1458518400,"style":null,"vote":null,"image":null}

What i am going to do is say how awesome he sounds on Now What?!  The lyrics are great throughout, he sounds like he's having a lot of fun. I really dig him as a lyricist, sometimes funny at times ominous at times bizarre Mr Gillan shines throughout this record that i think is a masterpiece and one of Purple's best.  The rest of the band are merely stunning. Don Airey has really captured Jon Lords epic Organ sound so essential to DP.  The rest of the guys are just fantastic, Roger Glover is one of Rock's best bass players.  AS far as the songs go, there is not one single throwaway on this record, even the bonus track \"It'll be Me\" is a cool tune that holds up to repeated listens.  \"Vincent Price\" is over the Top and so cool i'm almost surprised these guys came up with it at this stage of their career.  The whole record is a real feast for lovers of 70's music.  Out of all the bands\/artsits that came out of the 60's and 70's that have made records late in their careers including, YES, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, McCartney etc. etc. Deep Purple's What Now?! tops them all.  It really is that good.  Bob Ezrin also did he a great job.  The record sounds amazing, i've got in on vinyl and it's a beautiful gatefold with great band photos.

They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Little-Big-Box-Bach-Orchestral-Music\/dp\/B00KS0ASOU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Little Big Box :: Bach Orchestral Music<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Handel-Oratorio-Box\/dp\/B00KICWEN6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Handel Oratorio Box<\/a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Big Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the first of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven (the other being&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bigger-Beethoven-Box\/dp\/B01BHELQD2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bigger Beethoven Box<\/a>, which I have previously reviewed), and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including piano sonatas, cello sonatas, string quartets, three of his nine symphonies, incidental music for The Creatures of Prometheus and Egmont, as well as piano variations, minuets, sonatinas, overtures, rondos, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Big Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I do have two minor reservations about it:\n\n1. There are no piano trios on \"Big Beethoven Box.\" Some of my favorite Beethoven chamber music masterpieces  especially his Archduke and Ghost trios  belong to this sub-genre, and I think the fact that none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.\n\n2. The albums engineering does not quite rise to the level of the best Big Box albums  especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Mozart-Box\/dp\/B00B5Q7M90\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Mozart Box<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Haydn-Box\/dp\/B00CMAM8QA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Haydn Box<\/a>. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.  There are also a few technical glitches to the album that require manual editing of individual tracks metadata. (See reviewer Upstate Listeners excellent review for tips on how to fix these problems.)\n\nDespite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience. Highly recommended.

That's the point of this song. And Jim Croce, the author of this tune, proved the validity of the words of his song by the shortness of his own life.","summary":"A Prophetic Song","unixReviewTime":1498780800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Gilliland","reviewText":"This was my first Toro Y Moi album, the purchase prompted after hearing two most excellent songs (one of which, \"Say That,\" is on this album) on some compilation discs (one from Mojo Magazine, and the other part of the \"Late Night Tales\" CD series). Anyway, I was so impressed by those two songs that when I found this CD at a shop in Kuala Lumpur recently I didn't hesitate to take the plunge. About two dozen listens later I'm hooked!\n\nLike many other reviewers, I'm both captivated by this guy's music (and Toro Y Moi is indeed one guy: Chas Bundick), and also unable to categorize it, at least not easily. Toro Y Moi straddles musical borders, hops across them, and integrates a variety of styles into his songs. The closest artist that he compares to, in my opinion, is Todd Rundgren. In fact, if Todd was 30 years younger, he might be making similar music as Toro Y Moi. Both artists are virtually one-man bands, able to produce, write, sing and perform their music in a seemingly effortless fashion ... and turn your head around in process. They both share an uncanny ability to write catchy pop songs with very soulful undercurrents. The biggest difference between the two, aside from the obvious gap in ages, is that some of Rundgren's song veer off into a rockier direction, while Bundick mines a funkier musical vein. But each guy qualifies as a musical wizard who knows how to optimize his use of a recording studio.\n\nAs much as I like this Tory Y Moi album, there are a few tracks that don't quite dazzle or sustain interest. But even when it doesn't all click, you have to admire the effort. I think this guy is an incredible talent and capable of delivering a True masterpiece of an album. And that may be coming very, very soon. I'll be eagerly waiting.","summary":"Rundgren-esque Pop Genius","unixReviewTime":1412121600,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I became a fan of him with the release of the previous album, 2011's \"Underneath the Pine\".\n\n\"Anything In Return\" (13 tracks; 52 min.) starts off with an immediately inviting pick-me-up \"Harm In Change\" and an equally charming \"Say That\", both of which signal a continuation towards the more dance-oriented songs found on \"Underneath the Pine\" and also the \"Freaking Out\" EP. But then things slow down and Bundick turns more melancholic and reflective on tracks like \"So Many Details\" and \"Cola\". In fact, the album stays mostly in that same mid-tempo groove, and somehow it works quite nicely. \"Never Matter\" towards the end of the album is one last song in which the dance-along factor is increased again. In all, I am enjoying this album quite a bit. Perfect for these summer days!\n\nLast weekend at the FYF in Los Angeles, Toro Y Moi (live a full band, not just Bundick) put on a fantastic 50 min. set before a wildly enthusiastic (and massive) crowd. Bundick & Co. brought a great mix of old and new songs, featuring about 4 or 5 songs from this album (including \"Say That\", \"Rose Quartz\", and \"Never Matter\"). I must say that live these songs sounded more massive than anything you hear on the album, and their set was one of the festival's highlights for me, without a doubt, I enjoyed it a ton! Meanwhile \"Anything In Return\" is highly recommended!","summary":"Excellent album, and even better in concert","unixReviewTime":1377907200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Isadar as a unique quality to enable him to almost read you a story through his style of playing, you are literally travelling through the heart and mind with the musician and in Broken Valentine, through the journey perhaps of a dysfunctional relationship.\nThe title track is placed at two and Red seems to once more take you through this ever changing and emotive journey of love good or bad, its a piece that I found almost representative of being able to watch your life and love back in the wonderful luxury of hindsight and smart at the bad decisions and smile at the fond memories, love is indeed red and as close to anger in emotions as indeed is the colour.\nThe man who broke my heart was written about Isadars relationship problems with his father, as a listener and reviewer I found this piece almost cried out to me at such a deep level and you could almost hear the child crying alone in a dark corner of his bedroom with that helpless feeling of dejection and let down hanging over your head, this is a deeply felt composition, but where we see the music being the healer.\nThe Stairwell I can honestly say is the track I felt the most moved by, the beginning of this track could easily be a soundtrack for a blockbusting suspense movie, it has that emotive quality about it and indeed while listening to this piece and the next one I was almost moved to tears myself.\nWho could have imagined what occurred in or on the stairwell and the caressing of the keys by Isadar on this piece almost imprints memories into the very walls of this place, from the stairwell and almost towards the end of this piece I could sense a light starting to appear from the darkness, perhaps a chink of brightness from a distant window close to the Stairwell?\nLetting Go I found a difficult track personally for me, as one who has just come out of a thirty eight year relationship it is always hard to let go, especially of those like my late wife who has passed over. Part of the healing process is to eventually let go, but not just of the physical relationship but of all the regrets and guilt. Here this track really hits the nail right on the head, it deals with the very essence of the letting go process, it reflects the turbulence of emotions that seems to echo in the hard playing within this piece, as Isadar plays forcefully you can almost hear him working through this very process and of course the end result is what we should always have freedom, this piece is the perfect musical representation of the letting go process, as Isadar says about the album, its bittersweet.\nEn Face Du Miroir (Facing The mirror) This a composition of hope and renewal, but most of all courage, here Isadars style seems to be more reflective on his journey, the feeling from the chords and structure is almost like a person has come through a great time of struggle and at this point is literally looking down into his own soul for a time of reflection, the journey seems to be endless and the style here seems to reflect that and in the moment when love and hate collide there is always our passion that will set us free.\nBlood Thicker Than Water, this is the ultimate track to end such an album with, from the journey of love and emotions, here Isadar stars with a dark reflective style, but that soon changes to a more upbeat conflict and resolution feel, we can truly sense here that some sort of reconciliation has been found and from that the melody it gives us a brilliant ending to the project, we can also truly feel that here now is a person who has really found his place in life and is now finding the support he always truly wanted.  This was actually my favourite track from the album.\nRed is a very powerful concept, its a rare album that actually does address the bittersweet emotions of love and hate as they crash together on the rocks of life, simply put if you are serious about your music and are very particular of what you play, then you really need to get a cop of RED by ISADAR.","summary":"A rare album that actually does address the bittersweet emotions of love and hate as they crash together on the rocks of life","unixReviewTime":1390780800,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Some of the tunes are subtle and intimate, and others are grand and sweeping, but they are all clever and original thanks to Isadar's convention-defying compositions. Sometimes you think you know where the music's leading you, and then all of a sudden it comes at you out of left field, making it lively and engaging.\n\nThis writing style keeps Isadar's fingers on their toes, so to speak. Isadar's mastery of his craft is apparent in the seemingly effortless ease with which he can go from light to dark and from understated to emphatic. His phrasing and chord progressions are also smart and snappy.\n\nThis is a rewarding experience for those who are willing to accompany Isadar on his musical journey of love.","summary":"The RajMan Review","unixReviewTime":1365897600,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I hope the sales follow the stunning music.  \"Broken Valentine\" opens the set with Isadar's piano vibrant, joyful, with a wistful touch, like a failed love affair that energizes you to go and love some more.  The title track \"Red\" has a brisk and vibrant piano that follows several themes.  \"The Man Who Broke My Heart\" may be my favorite track with its melody expansive, perhaps with touches of anger tempering the joys of the heart.  \"Letting Go\" hits a more somber reflective tone on the longest track on the CD before soaring into orbit about two minutes into the song with Isadar vibrant runs on the piano.  \"En Face Du Miroir (Facing the Mirror)\" has a slower pace that matches the often melancholy melody.  The set concludes with the amazingly confident \"Blood...Thicker Than Water\" that to me speaks of the joys of family relationship, strong despite its ups and downs and periodic conflicts.  \"Red\" is vibrant piano, incredibly inventive and fresh.

It is also the third installment in a trilogy of solo piano albums released in the past year - \"Reconstructed,\" a Will Ackerman-produced anthology of some of Isadar's best piano pieces; \"O Christmas,\" Isadar's second piano Christmas album; and now \"Red,\" a bittersweet love-themed album that took seven years to produce and that consists of the first new original solo piano material Isadar has released in more than ten years. I have been reviewing and thoroughly enjoying Isadar's releases since his second piano album, 1999's \"Active Imagination,\" which still stands as one of my favorite recordings. Even though I have been a big fan for many years, I was still blown away by Isadar's live performance in my house concert series in July 2010. The man has magic fingers and an extraordinary piano touch that are perfectly suited to express his imaginative, distinctive, and emotionally powerful music. Isadar is also a singer\/songwriter and an electronic musician who creates the music videos for much of his music, dramatizing the stories that inspired the songs. I will always be partial to Isadar's piano albums because his voice and vision are unique, incorporating jazz, new age, pop, and classical stylings into a musical language all his own.\n\n\"Red\" opens with \"Broken Valentine,\" a free-flowing expression of heartbreak and the broad range of emotions that go with it, alternating between grief and confusion then shifting to perhaps anger and resignation - a great beginning. The title track conveys the freedom of an improvisation while weaving together a variety of upbeat themes. \"The Man Who Broke My Heart\" is energetic and in constant swirling motion - also very free and from deep within. \"The Stairwell\" is darker and much more mysterious, overflowing with Isadar's intriguing accented rhythms and picturesque compositional style. My favorite track is the almost nine-minute \"Letting Go,\" a piece that intertwines a series of musical vignettes into a powerful, colorful musical collage. I love the way Isadar seamlessly goes from flowing and smooth to a bouncy jazz style to high drama without missing a beat. Great stuff! \"En Face Du Miroir (Facing the Mirror)\" is much lighter, with fingers dancing nimbly around the piano keyboard. The album closes with \"Blood ... Thicker Than Water,\" again a combination of changing themes that could well be a musical family portrait - different personalities working separately and as a unit, bound together by the unseen ties that keep families together through thick and thin.\n\nIsadar has created another piano masterpiece that should be more widely heard than his previous releases due to the success of \"Reconstructed.\" I hope so, anyway! Very highly recommended!","summary":"From MainlyPiano","unixReviewTime":1359936000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Red is the infusion of high-energy jazz and neo-classical elements into Isadar's generally impressionistic new age style. On Red, Isadar steps out and charts a bold new direction for his music.\n\nInterestingly, Red is being released around Valentines Day, and opens with a track entitled \"Broken Valentine.\" This piece is a perfect example of the creative freedom Isadar has chosen to express on this album. As I listened to the lovely emotionally moving melody, I assumed that the entire composition would unfold along similar lines. So I had a bit of a surprise after about a minute when the piece suddenly took off in a decidedly jazzier direction, with the feel of a hang glider pilot leaping off a cliff and taking to the wind. At this point, I experienced a side of Isadar's playing that I hadn't heard before quite like this. It was powerful, passionate, and spirited, bringing to mind jazz greats Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea. Yet even in the midst of this intense forward motion, Isadar makes good use of dynamics and modulates the tempo and movement using an occasional pregnant pause as a prelude to shifting musical gears.\n\nThe title song does not have quite the same dramatic ratio of yin to yang as the first track, but does shift freely between a flowing melody and a bouncy rhythmic motif within the composition. \"The Man Who Broke My Heart\" is a lush evocative piece that highlights Isadar's ability to dig deep into emotional terrain with impeccable style and grace. Likewise on \"The Stairwell,\" which is a beautifully sensitive piece that unlike some of the earlier songs has a higher degree of thematic consistency throughout, although there are some crescendos that are quite powerful within the context of the song's subtlety. \"Letting Go\" marks a return to Isadar's pattern of contrasting diverse elements within the framework of a single composition. Starting out in a more wistful and melancholy air, it evolves, within its nine-minute length, into a markedly different space that actually had my head nodding and my toe tapping along with it.\n\nRed is a masterful recording that encompasses stunning technique, imaginative composition, and the willingness to take a risk in following the pied piper of one's muse, wherever it may lead. I have every reason to believe that listeners will happily get in line behind him on this exciting musical adventure.","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1358035200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Vesta is in excellent form, vocally, on this CD and most of the songs are truly emotional and heartfelt. In a certain way, this CD compares very much favorably to her 1998-issued CD \"Relationships\" in the sense that you hear an older, wiser and more mature Vesta singing about life's ups and downs and also about romantic relationships. Had Vesta lived to be able to see this CD released and had she been able to promote it via live performances it would probably have helped to rejuvenate her career as most of the songs would have fit perfectly onto the playlists of Smooth Jazz and Urban Adult Contemporary stations. In any event, it is all too obvious that Vesta literally poured her heart, soul and spirit into the making of this CD and it remains a fitting tribute to one of the best but most underrated R&B Divas of our time.

But I somehow missed that a few months later, \"Seven\" her posthumous album was finally released. Thanks to a casual email exchange with a friend, I was finally brought up to speed.\n\nIt is far too early for me to truly assess how I feel about \"Seven\" since I can sometimes take awhile to truly appreciate a new album. How I wish most albums were instant no-brainers like the Album(s) of the Year, \"The 20\/20 Experience Pts. 1 & 2). I will say, the last few songs on \"Seven\" drew my intention more than the first half.\n\nBut, I rate it 4 stars because I trust that this final work by Vesta will soon find a place in my heart.\n\nShe looks great on the album. A few tracks do seem to have slight sound glitches despite being informed that the indie label remastered the album again in July.......so I am thinking I just bought one of the more recent copies since it is November.","summary":"A Blessing to Receive This Posthumous Effort from the Greatly Underappreciated Vesta!","unixReviewTime":1384646400,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Blake Shelton has always been a favorite judge. I also think his now ex-wife Miranda Lambert is adorable and extremely talented. When I first heard that Blake & Miranda wrote this song together after his brother passed, it really touched me. I know that she recorded it initially because he didn't feel he would be able to as he might get too emotional. Heartstrings - Tug Tug. Then I heard the lovely Cassadee Pope sing it. I was truly blown away. Even Blake said he and Miranda thought she took it to a whole new level. I had sort of forgotten about this song until there was a recent death in the family. Then I was torturing myself with sad songs as we women often do. When I rediscovered this treasure I just knew I had to have it on my playlist. So glad I found it again <3","summary":"So Glad I Rediscovered This Treasure","unixReviewTime":1454284800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

I recently acquired The Bach Guild's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box\/dp\/B013THM8PA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Haydn Symphonies Box<\/a>&nbsp;from Amazon.com, and I liked it so much I decided to add another one of the Big Box albums to my digital music collection. This time I chose the Big Mozart Box. It turned out to be an inspired choice.\n\nBig Mozart Box features nearly 14 hours of instrumental music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all for only 99 cents. This superlative MP3 album contains an extraordinarily impressive array of music from a variety of sub-genres within the oeuvre of Mozarts music. Mozart is known to have composed over 600 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his short lifetime. Over 40 of his instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Mozart Box. They include divertimenti, serenades, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, and others. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Mozarts incredibly inventive musical genius.\n\nThese are all superb performances from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in every performance. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Mozart infused into his music. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings (a few of them are monaural), the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.\n\nOf all the Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I think Big Mozart Box is clearly the best. I listen to it constantly, and I am always highly entertained by it. Most highly recommended.","summary":"\"Big Mozart Box\" clearly shows the incredible depth and breadth of Mozarts musical genius.","unixReviewTime":1502150400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

That solid message gets muddied up and diluted through a series of execution errors.  The end result is the message is getting lost in the translation to music.

Luckily, it stops just about the time you can't take it anymore.\n\nThis song is very unusual.  I downloaded it for free, and will listen to it again when I'm in the kind of mood when I want to veg out and let the sound waves wash over me, but I'm mostly relieved that I didn't pay for it.

The song begins with an African\/reggae flavor.  In this section, the percussions are very strong.  The lyrics, however, have uneven volume levels.  Additionally, they sound distant.  Although the lyrics are unintelligible, they combine with the instrumentals, and are a bit mesmerizing.  (I looked them up on line, and they were about a woman whose behavior confuses the singer.) The chorus begins the first electronic\/new age section, and includes some odd sound effects. Finally, the song ends with a new age passage that is very short and that cuts off very abruptly.\n\nThe song is strange, interesting and annoying.  The best thing about this product is the pretty cover, which is a strange commentary on music, isn't it?\n\nI downloaded it as a free promotion.  Simply put, the high and low points cancel each other out.  It's okay, so I've rated it as 3 stars.","summary":"Uneven but Okay","unixReviewTime":1368316800,"style":null,"vote":"2","image":null}

China Cat->Rider is it's usual 1973 self which is fantastic. the set is rounded out with Big River, Brown-Eyed Women and Around And Around. The second set starts off with cool versions of Row Jimmy, Jack Straw and Ramble On Rose. The linchpin of this show is one of only three versions of Playing In The Band->Uncle John's Band->Morning Dew->Uncle John's Band->Playing In The Band which is played to the hilt. Stella Blue is pretty and El Paso was always better in the 1970s. Eyes Of The World->Sugar Magnolia brings the show to a close in fine fashion as does the encore of Casey Jones.","summary":"Saturday 11-17-73 Pauley Pavilion, University of California, Los Angeles, CA","unixReviewTime":1367625600,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":"4","image":null}

His fond reference may have more to do with the fact that Hoffmeister published his 1st Symphony and his 2nd Piano concerto rather than any affectionate sentiment. Besides running his publishing house which is still in existence today as the London firm of Peters Edition Ltd., Hoffmeister also wrote a little music. At least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works have been credited to him. Counted in in that impressive output are at least 25 flute concertos, including the 3 here.\n\nProbably written some time before 1800 and published in 1803, the C Major Concerto is listed as No. 16. Trumpets and tympani give substance to the orchestral introduction of the opening Allegro, a sharp contrast to the long fluttering entrance of the flute. Characterized by a festive tone and a broad expansive sweep, this first movement features splendid work by the soloist, especially in the final cadenza, which incorporates elements of the opening theme. Written in C Minor, the dark Adagio drops the drums and brass to achieve a tragic air. Languid and sensuous, the central section brightens into the key of E Flat with some gorgeous tonality from the solo wind before a somber ending. With the full orchestra, the final Rondo is direct and straightforward, employing a bouncy irrepressibility that not even a brief excursion into A Minor can dim.\n\nDating from 1793 if not earlier, the concerto in G Major sports a leaner sound than the first work as the strings are accompanied only by horns and oboes. A sprawling Allegro opens, noteworthy for its juxtaposition of the wide ranging symphonic passages against the more nimble, intensely lyrical work of the flute. The concluding cadenza exhibits some outstanding work by the soloist, Bruno Meier, not surprising since he wrote it, as he did all the solo cadenzas on the this recording. Composed in G Minor, the elegiac Adagio seems to unfold as a funeral march. As the music shifts into B Flat, the grief disperses, but only fleetingly before the gloom descends for the final notes. A chirping flute initiates the closing Rondo Allegretto. Darting in and out of the more structured orchestral sections, the solo wind presents a wide array of virtuosic episodes in the carefree finale of the concerto recorded as No. 22.\n\nPenned in D Major, Concerto No. 17 was likely written before the other two offerings. Buttressed by oboes and horns, the quirky Allegro starts with a formal orchestral introduction, but soon deteriorates into a startling hesitancy. Restarting with renewed vigor, the surprising timidity returns and only dissipates when the flute finally enters, bringing a resolute assurance to this clever 1st movement. Over delicately plucked strings, a gentle flute carries the ensuing Romanza: poco Adagio, one of the high points of the disc. Elastic phrasing allows the soloist to explore the subtleties of this jewel, venturing into darker regions as the music shifts into a minor keyed interlude. Using a precise, clipped attack, the jaunty Rondo Allegretto concludes the recording. Offering a bravura display of technique and rhythmic dexterity, the sprightly episodes roll by, retaining a relentlessly sunny tone.\n\nOn his 14 carat gold flute, Bruno Meier is superb. Nearly as good, the Prague Chamber Orchestra supplies sensitive and thoughtful backing while the 2013 release by Naxos is excellent, placing the solo wind front and center without shortchanging the symphonic support. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, Hoffmeister fell into obscurity upon his death. He deserves better, and this second volume of his flute concertos, all world premieres, goes a long way to correct that oversight.","summary":"Beethovens Most Beloved Brother","unixReviewTime":1478995200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him. He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit. Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.\n\nPublished in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list. With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement. Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute. Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute. And it is a virtuosic display. Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.\n\nEmploying a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune. As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending. A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato. Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.\n\nAnother spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major. Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro. Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.\n\nIn the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only. Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts. But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom. Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.\n\nThe 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail. Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support. Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death. While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn.","summary":"An Also Ran Again?","unixReviewTime":1478131200,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.\n\nEmploying a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune. As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending. A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato. Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.\n\nAnother spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major. Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro. Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.\n\nIn the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only. Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts. But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom. Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.\n\nThe 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail. Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support. Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death. While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn.","summary":"An Also Ran Again?","unixReviewTime":1453420800,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The Mann-led anthems have help up well; the \"Alexander\" not so much so despite some good solo work from the soprano and bass. Deller and the Oriana Orchestra give a pretty staid reading (with an ubiquitous organ pumping in volume) when compared with more recent accounts of Gardiner (Philips) and Christophers (who also gives us the concertos Handel performed with the oratorio\/ode) (Collins Classics).\n\n As I indicated, the Chandos Anthems 1-6 are outstanding with excellent solo contributions from Boatwright and Bressler. I think the original 3 LP set was restricted to the three part chorus (STB) anthems as they appear here, but Nos. 7-11 with four part (SATB) and five part (STTTB) choruses are available on the Chandos label with Christophers and the Sixteen - a four CD set.\n\nI've only sampled the rest. The Birthday Ode is OK despite some creaky vocalizing from an aging Deller, but the oboe concertos are pretty heavy going in their romanticized garb as compared to more recent period instrument offerings.","summary":"A mixed bag, but good value","unixReviewTime":1439769600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":"2","image":null}

RZA narrates the album in brilliant form, and the Wu Tang flavor is very much alive all throughout the album whether it comes from RZA's narration and executive production or guest appearances from emcees such as Masta Killa, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Killa Sin and Cappadonna among others. Twelve Reasons To Die is not a very long collection of songs, but what it does offer will leave the listener tremendously satisfied. In other words, quality is more important than quantity here. The whole album is smart and nothing less than classic, hardcore Ghostface.

Yet, while David did pass away from liver cancer in 2016, his soul and the heart of his music has still been recognized as one of the most innovative catalogs of talent to the world. His heart was in each and every song he had done, by changing looks, changing appeal, but being a smart and assertive human being. He really let the songs and the music speak for itself, and David had a huge impact by bring art rock into light for each and every album. When he released The Next Day, after a near decade long absence, he really had a lot to say, ever when his music wasn't on radio anymore. Where Are We Now?, the lead single from The Next Day is honestly one of those that sincerely brought his heart to the soul, and a sign that David matured, but his music hadn't changed at all. If you had never heard a David Bowie song, or if you're only discovering him from the impact of his death, than I sincerely recommend this song a lot.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"The Man Who Was Here Now","unixReviewTime":1458259200,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

With the shocking and deviating news that David Bowie had a battle with cancer, I was deeply shocked not only because he was a great innovator in art, he was a brilliant musician, whether it was through Alladian Sane, Let's Dance, or with songs like Under Pressure with Queen and China Girl. The guy was sincerely amazing. One of his last songs, showed a intimate side from his music that really showed he was still standing, after a decade-long absence from making music. Where Are We Now?, which David recorded from his 2013 album, The Last Day really showed a deepness in his music, and a brilliance in his own heart to where he was returning. The song was proof he really had, where everyone else through him off. This is a great reminder of what David showed for years in his work from fashion, art, and and sincere love for music.

He has made music for 50 years and continues to change as time has gone by, as the chameleon has has been. When I listen to his own music, I continue to think of why so many singers do not continue to grow and adapt with their sound at heart. When he had announced earlier this year that he was retiring from touring, I was not at all very shocked with his decision. He has been well advanced with his own heart, and his work continues to inspire. His song Where Are You Now?, which originally appeared on his last album The Next Day is classic Bowie at heart, and shows it by the simplicity of his own voice. He really shows it very nobly, and shows that he has not changed after all this time with his most deepest of songs. If you have loved Let's Dance or Heroes, than you'll absolutely love this song a lot. He still is here now, and will never go away.\n\nSong: B","summary":"Bowie Forever","unixReviewTime":1448236800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The lyrics explore the differences between shadows, or silhouettes, and reflections.  The instrumentals provide effective accents for the story told in the song.  This song is wonderful, and I will be adding it to my playlist so I can enjoy it frequently.\n\nThanks for the free download!

It was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from the album. \"Whistle\" was written by Flo Rida, David Glass, Marcus Killian, Justin Franks, Breyan Isaac and Antonio Mobley while production was handled by DJ Frank E and Glass. It is a song about oral sex.\n\"Whistle\" is a pop-rap song characterized by a whistling melody. Upon its release, the song received mostly mixed reviews from music critics. They generally praised its pop sound, noting that it had the potential of becoming another hit with its \"catchy\" hook. However, several critics gave a negative review for the lyrics, interpreted as a thinly veiled euphemism for oral sex, calling it \"the least subtle song ever\". The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Flo Rida's third number one hit and his first since 2009's \"Right Round\".[2] \"Whistle\" was a commercial success, topping the charts in some countries, including Australia, Israel and Sweden, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in others, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.\nAn accompanying music video for the song, directed by Marc Klasfeld, was released on May 24, 2012. It was filmed in Acapulco, Mexico and makes use of split screen at various points. It mostly shows shots of Flo Rida and several girls on a beach. Upon its release, it received positive to mixed reviews from critics, who noted that it was a perfect accompaniment for the song. Flo Rida also promoted the song by performing it during the finale of the talent show, The Voice. This song is the second track on Now 44. The cover image of the single also drew praise for its subtlety and originality.","summary":"Great song","unixReviewTime":1464134400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

However, some critics were positive towards its catchiness and club-nature. The song received commercial success upon its release, peaking inside the top ten in many countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.

They are one of my favorite bands of the era after 2000. For the most part, they maintain a flavor of classic country stemming from a time before hard rock and heavy metal oriented musicians migrated into the country genre of music. I think this occurred sometime during the '90s when heavy metal of the late '70s and '80s style fell out of vogue and heavy metal turned into some semi-melodic boring and uninspiring noise, in my opinion. This song, released in 2013 on their album 'Pioneer' was a hit for TBP. It is a wonderful song, masterfully performed by Kimberley; the back-up vocals are very sweet and harmonious. I just love it. In fact, I like the whole album. I have purchased it on virtual CD. I am an audiophile. The MP3 format does not always fill the ticket for discerning ears and a high end audio system. The MP3 download sound quality of this song is better than what I had expected, though.","summary":"Great Song - Great Performance","unixReviewTime":1487462400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Over a period spanning 16 years beginning in 1974 they recorded for three different labels, placed nearly three dozen singles on the Top 100 Singles chart and had several highly successful albums to boot. Yes, the music of Daryl Hall and John Oates seemed to be everywhere during this period.\n\nHall and Oates began their recording career at Atlantic records in the early 1970's. In 1974, they had a minor hit with a tune called \"She's Gone\". Although this record was not wildly successful it was clear that these guys were going to be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years. RCA records took note and signed Hall & Oates in 1975. Their very first release for the label \"Sara Smile\" was on the charts for some 7 months and peaked at #3 in the spring of 1976. Atlantic records took note and re-released \"She's Gone\" which also became a Top Ten hit in '76.  In January 1977 RCA released the boys' third single.  \"Rich Girl\" would become the first of six #1 singles for Hall & Oates spending two weeks at the top of the charts In March of that year.  As far as I am concerned this is one of the best songs they ever recorded.","summary":"A number one smash from 1977.","unixReviewTime":1477612800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

While Buffalo Springfield wasn't around very long during their brief stint together they made some great music including \"For What It's Worth\",their most well known song. It has that classic folk-rock sound that was at its height during the mid-60s. Thought provoking lyrics that are in many ways still relevant today 50+ years later. Despite how much time has passed since this tune came out originally it sounds and feels like it was written today about society we live in now.

For female artists, it has mainly been about her and everyone else, can go to the shelter. Sadly, her music has also lost its shine in voice and heart. Her last album 4 was absolutely atrocious. She really didn't ignite a fire in the way she did with her earlier music. That was shown in each and every song from that album, and sadly the ballads have weighed down in soul. Best Thing I Never Had is definitely a blah song, not anything to absolutely rave about. She really didn't ignite a fire from her voice into the song, and instead it felt watered down in song, especially compared to the ballads she had in her career before like Halo and Listen. Maybe she needs to find her voice again, and it will be the best thing she never had.\n\nSong: C-","summary":"Not What She Had","unixReviewTime":1386892800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","summary":":)","unixReviewTime":1452556800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Musically, I prefer the 20th century and beyond, and I get tired of the old repertoire.  But sometimes, even confirmed 12 tone enthusiasts like myself enjoy a little Bellini.  Let's face it...the great masters were, well, masterful.  This dirt cheap collection has eliminated the need for me to pull out individual operas to get just the loveliest arias.  Here the all are, glittering in the sunlight, sung by some of the finest sopranos of the last 40 years.  Sumi Jo's definitive version of the aria for the Queen of the Night from Mozart's Magic Flute is worth the price of admission alone. These arias are instantly familiar to opera buffs, but the casual listener will know many of these, and it is an easy way to bring new converts in to the fold.  Listen, this music is glorious, tuneful, exquisitely sung, and a wonderful way to sip at the chalice of immortal music.  Sound is generally excellent.  The collection would be a bargain at 10x the price, and there is absolutely no reason not to pick this up at the crazy bargain price of $1.  Yes, even you folks who usually prefer Wozzeck. This music is simply stunning.","summary":"Insanely good value, even for opera snobs like me.  And the singing?

Haydn wrote so much music that it's not reasonable to expect anything close to 'completeness' in such a collection, but what is offered here is a very good sampling and a good starting point for anyone exploring Haydn for the first time.\n\nThe point of these collections, in my opinion, is not that the absolute qualify of the music is necessarily the best. Classical collectors and serious Mahler listeners will have other performances they prefer, and nobody is claiming that this set or similar sets are the top rated performances of this music.\n\nI value these Bach Guild sets because of the value they represent, both for experienced collectors but especially for those who would like to dip their toes into classical music to see what it's all about. It is extraordinary, really, to be able to build a collection of fine music for such a reasonable price.\n\nThen, after learning the music, becoming more familiar with it, there will be the natural desire to explore other performances. For those listeners, they can go further and obtain other downloads, or really 'splurge' and buy more 'normal' priced CD collections.\n\nRegardless, this is a terrific value, and the performances are fully worth listening to. I've had this particular Bach Guild set since purchasing it in 2013, in fact, and it's about time I posted a review here to express my opinion on the worthiness of this set!","summary":"One of Bach Guild's early .mp3 collections here on Amazon, another bargain","unixReviewTime":1506124800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

This is the fourth of The Bach Guilds Big Box albums that I have added to my digital music collection, and I think I made another inspired choice.\n\nBig Haydn Box (not to be confused with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box\/dp\/B013THM8PA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Haydn Symphonies Box<\/a>, which I have already reviewed), features over 14 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns wonderful music. It is an extraordinarily impressive array from a variety of sub-genres within Haydns oeuvre. Haydn is known to have composed over 500 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his lifetime. By my count, 40 of his vocal and instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Box. They include divertimenti, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, masses, and an oratorio. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Haydns incredibly inventive musical genius.\n\nThese recordings from the mid-20th century feature various lesser-known but world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, choirs, and solo instrumentalists and vocalists who hail mostly from eastern Europe. All of them demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in each of their performances. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Haydn infused into his music. I have now listened to well over half of this album and I think the audio quality of these mostly older stereophonic recordings is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.\n\nOf the four Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I rank Big Haydn Box right alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Mozart-Box\/dp\/B00B5Q7M90\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Mozart Box<\/a>&nbsp;as one of the best in my digital music library.

This set is really good technically, but decent in sound quality, having been recorded back in the 50's and 60's. E. Power Biggs, Friederich Walcha, Simon Preston and others have made better Bach organ music recordings, which are all out there of course. Often those are quite expensive. However, you get the whole motherlode here for only about ten dollars! So, price wise, you can't go wrong if you are a Bachaphile. Let's just say I give it 3 stars for recording quality and performance quality, and 5 stars for all of that great music at an inexpensive price. So that rounds out to 4 stars. Just like the Vox Box set of the complete keyboard works, played by Martin Galling on harpsichord, Vox tends to get all of this stuff out at a pretty good price. And they have done it here too-----------PEACE\nBTW-Be careful. This set contains over 15 hours of music, so it might overload your cloud.","summary":"You can't go wrong if you are a Bachaphile.","unixReviewTime":1528070400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Her beautiful voice and excellent song choices kept me watching, even though the show itself was devolving into a horrible mess. I was very pleased when I saw that she had already released her first post AI single and after listening to a short cut from the it, bought it. (Have the AI people not noticed that some of the most successful singers from the show have an originality that far surpasses releases from others and even with the producers' almost overt distaste for country music?)\n\nEither way, I'm glad to hear Kree's single and enjoyed it. I will definitely be buying her first album.","summary":"Beautiful Song and Great Singer","unixReviewTime":1373587200,"style":null,"vote":null,"image":null}

The main totem for Abundance is the mighty Buffalo, it teaches us that at all times we will always have just what we need to get through, and we have abundance. Musically this piece works superbly and was my favourite off the album; I also like the voice synthesiser segments as well, which added a certain dimensional element to the track.\nEach track from this album also related according to the material I had been given, to a specific Chakra within the energetic field or light body, so while track one signified the root or Base Chakra we can now move to the Sacral, a somewhat unusual Celtic inspired track that used various forms of indigenous percussion and even bagpipes! The piece is entitled Loucetious or Passion Rising Once more here the rhythm is the key, but also the resonance and the energy of the track as well and Get Tribal have created a collective of world instrumentation and sounds and brought to the world something very unique indeed.\nWe move with the swiftness of a Dragon to the third track entitled quite aptly Lei Shan or Sea Of Qi. Again setting the scene nicely, Get Tribal take us east on a journey of the inner self and we make a brief detour in our light body to the Dantien (The centre of our energetic life force) using once more indigenous drums and percussion, we are treated to a piece that has a light sense about it, but also has a deep resonance within as well, a well constructed composition that was not over complicated.\nFrom the gentle refrains of the East to the sheer power of track four known as Donnar or Awakening Power a very tribal orientated composition that represents the Solar Plexus Chakra. This track gives the listener a David Arkenstone moment of pure Lord of the Rings, using the Gregorian chant was a nice touch that added a time and a deeper feel and distinction to the composition.\nAt the half way stage we move back to the Emerald Isle for our Heart Chakra piece called Taranis or A Call to Heal I must admit that I have never had healing with Celtic music, but I am willing to give anything a go. This is a curious composition that uses Lute, Fiddles and various percussive instruments that will take us further on our healing journey and toward the very centre of our heart. A very cleverly played track that just before 3 minutes has a superb low sounding drum, that I wished had stayed for longer, or been used even more.\nDear constant reader we are on a journey through the elements that make up God of Drum by Get Tribal and now our journey through that realm takes us to a very tribal sounding composition called Flow of Expression this African themed song contains assorted Caribbean percussion, with Marimba and some Kari Hone vocalisation that I have not heard since Flaming Star from Sally Oldfield. A track that represents the throat Chakra does have a very fluent energy about it and is a very smooth and relaxing piece to play.\nWe move to the composition Open to Wonder, representative of the Brow Chakra. This has a wonderfully Middle Eastern feel to it and Adad, Babylon will have a real appeal across the musical board. Having seen a Turkish Oud in my time there, it was pleasing to see this being used on this very ethnic track and the heavier rock style drums gave us a real deep piece to delve to get into another favourite of mine this one.\nWe move swiftly onto Teshub Anatolia or Transcending Boundaries which for me, still had that element of Gregorian style within it, whilst being mixed with a Middle Eastern percussion and a Sitar, this is a real fusion mix of a composition and will be much liked across the world fusion beat community, the digitised vocal an added bonus here.\nThe next one was a new one to me, Chaac, Maya or Aligning with Purpose and representative of what is known as the 8th Chakra, or Soul Star Chakra, apparently located above the Crown chakra. This was also probably the most unique track off the album with South American drums and percussion, which gave us a perspective of not only Mayan energy, but also through the music an insight to our higher purpose.\nWhich dear constant readers take us to the end of our journey through God of Drum, by Get Tribal and we finish with an Indian based composition called Endless Reflection. This was a very calm and peaceful way to end the album, once more Get Tribal have brought a mixture of indigenous instrumentation to the musical table and succeeded with a delicate composition that was in fact the longest off the album and that in a way would be a slight criticism that I have of the project. I wished that some if not all of the tracks had been longer, especially the opening piece, Abundance.\nWith that being said God of Drum is certainly unique, its certainly fresh and its most defiantly very different from any Chakra based album that you will have ever heard before in the New Age genre. If you like albums with a good drum beat you will love this, if you like a world fusion theme, you will adore this album and if you like to find the occasional little gem of an album, in a world filled with wall to wall bubble gum music then God of Drum by Get Tribal will certainly lift you out of that malaise and bring your ears a treat of musical distinctiveness.","summary":"A unique chakra based album","unixReviewTime":1390780800,"style":{"Format:":" Audio CD"},"vote":null,"image":null}

It blasts off with the chant like \"Wakinyan, American Indian\" with its hypnotic drum and flute.  \"Loucetious, Gaelic\" comes across like a Druid dance under the full moon.  I like \"Donnar, Norse\" with its almost military epic feel with the drums building and \"oh oh oh\" male vocals as counterpoint to the throbbing drumbeat.  \"Adad, Babylon\" exotically reflects the Middle East with its drums, snaking vocals and throbbing string sounds.  The concluding track, \"Indra, India,\" is a sitar-flavored meditation with the high-pitched \"Om shanti\" chorus.  I like this music very much.  Quite frankly, all the chakra information in the insert is off-putting to me, not significant nor particularly helpful to appreciate the music.  I think this is a strong disc for those of us who love inventive world music.

However, God of Drum by Kari Hohne, who records under the name of Get Tribal, is certainly one of the most unique. She describes the album as a collection of percussion-based tribal music inspired by the thunder deities of world mythology. According to Kari: Each track was composed based on an archetype and shamanic drumming pattern from different parts of the world.  These reflect Native American, Celtic, Chinese, Norse, African, Mayan, and more. As can be expected, there is a broad spectrum of ethnic instruments, while her parallel interest in electronic music brings in synthesizers, samplers, and other contemporary sounds. Although meditation music is generally soft and soothing, Kari purposely sought to unlock energy.\n\nWhile there is a lot of metaphysics behind the music, and it can be helpful or interesting to know, ultimately its also fine to just press play and go with the flow. The album is a spirited multi-cultural musical experience that anyone can enjoy and groove to. But at its heart, God of Drum by Get Tribal is a powerful musical tool for unlocking energy to create harmony and balance. Her extensive research into archetypes, mythology, and shamanic studies is particularly evident in the music heard on the album. The emphasis on earthy rhythms and world music influences make this one of the most notable offerings in this particular genre. A lot of vision and creativity went into sonically designing each track, and it shows. For me, this album was a pleasant surprise, and one Id recommend in a heartbeat.","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1382832000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The music was composed and performed by Get Tribal, the artist name of Kari Hohne, who is also a Mayan language preserver, master diver, best-selling author, tablet app designer, dream analyst, business consultant, Tai-Chi instructor, and world traveler - whew!\n\nAncient cultures revered thunder for activating spring each year and used drums to synchronize the heart, mind and soul with the vital life force. It is believed that the pounding of the drum awakens the heart, allowing us to achieve higher states of awareness. The ten tracks on this album are designed to stimulate the seven major Chakras as well as the Dantien, the Soul Star and Spirit Chakras, and the compositions reflect world-wide cultural influences that include Native American, Gaelic, Chinese, Norse, Celtic, African, Middle Eastern, Mayan, and Indian. It's an impressive and stirring album from a world music perspective as well as from a more earthy and sensual enjoyment of the pounding rhythms.\n\n\"God of Drum\" begins with \"Call of Abundance,\" inspired by Wakinyan, the Thunder Bird of the Lakota and one of the many feathered serpents found in indigenous cultures. This piece is mostly drums and chant, with flutes and electronic effects floating a melody over the drum. I love the intensity and energy of \"Passion Rising,\" composed for Loucetious, a Gaelic deity. The powerful drums, chanting voices, and bagpipe-like sounds stimulate the sacral chakra, which can separate fear and anger from the sensation of pleasure. \"Donnar\" the Nordic thunder deity, inspired \"Awakening Power,\" which is very dark, intense and cinematic.  Powerful, hypnotic drumming meshes with wordless vocals, strings and organ to get the pulse pounding and the heart racing - another favorite. \"The Flow of Expression\" is quite different. Inspired by Xango from the Afro-Caribbean region, the piece has a Reggae beat and a chant intended to \"polish the mirror of the mind.\" \"Open to Wonder\" is a haunting and exotic nod to Adad, the storm deity of Mesopotamia. The subtle changes in rhythm are designed to be unexpected in order to make us more receptive to a sense of wonder. \"Aligning With Purpose,\" inspired by the Mayan thunder deity, Chaac, is more orchestrated and cinematic. It is intended to stimulate the Soul Star chakra, which regulates our connection to a sense of purpose and helps us assimilate the wisdom of the higher self or purveyor of dreams. \"Endless Reflection,\" inspired by Indra, the thunder deity of India, contains a mantra that is sung throughout the peace, repeating the words, \"om\" (the sound of the universe) and \"shanti,\" which means peace. The combination of traditional Indian instruments and electronics creates a fascinating juxtaposition that brings the album to a peaceful close.\n\n\"God of Drum\" is a mesmerizing musical exploration of thunder gods throughout history and from all corners of the world. Certain to stir the ears and soul as well as the chakras, Get Tribal has created a unique and inspiring work of musical art (I love the cover artwork, too!).

Rather, Suzuki uses Hiroshima as a jumping-off point to explore the journey of an imagined soul after the end of its corporeal life in a real catastrophe. Suzuki has basically created the soundtrack for that conceit.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is!\n\nAll the sounds on the disc are generated entirely by Suzuki's synthesizers, which is easy to forget because this is as far from sounding like electronic music as you can get.

Born and currently residing in Hiroshima, Japan, Suzuki  designed a monument for Edmund Blunden's poem, \"A Song for August 6th, 1949,\" which won first place in a competition in 1975 and stands in the garden of The Hiroshima Central Library. The sculpture features the words to the poem in both English and Japanese and is still a stunning and moving tribute to the spirit and resilience of the city and its people following one of the darkest days of modern history. Despite the title, the music composed for this album is neither a memorial nor a protest against nuclear weapons. It is Suzuki's imaginary story of someone who died in the event and then journeys through the unknown spiritual world. The eight tracks and their titles are the imagined stages of the journey, ending with reincarnation and a new life.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Suzuki composes his music in a similar manner to creating his visual artwork, finishing one piece before moving to the next and allowing the previous work to influence the new work. This gives his music a linear quality and continuity that is its own evolution. Very minimal as well as ambient, the music has a dark, soulful quality that is sometimes mysterious or mournful and sometimes a bit lighter and more hopeful (but not joyous). The mood lightens gradually as the journey progresses and the spirit finds its way and discovers its purpose. Created with synths, the instrumentation includes ethereal and atmospheric sounds, strings, voices, bells, light percussion, and other sounds without any specific cultural reference. As with Suzuki's previous releases, the sound quality is full and rich. \"Resonance,\" his debut, received the 2011 Best Ambient Album award from Zone Music Reporter, and \"Cycle\" was nominated as the Best Relaxation\/Meditation Album and Best Ambient Album for 2012 by the same organization.

His music has been well received and he has developed a compositional style that bears resemblance to his minimalist painting style. \"Voyage\" exudes a Zen-like serene spaciousness. From the monochromatic cover art to the sparse uncluttered graphics, everything about this release is ultimately ambient. On the inside, a poem that pays tribute to the spirit of his home city of Hiroshima. The album references the tragic event that happened there in 1945 from the imaginary perspective of someone who died in the bombing and is making a transition through the unknown spiritual world and the realizations that come at the end.\n\nThe expansive soundscapes drift from track to track maintaining a homogeneous vibe through out. There is a sense of continuity that flows from one song to the next carried by Takashi's signature style that is more about texture than melody. What I wrote about his \"Cycle\" CD is equally True for \"Voyage:\" \"Following in the comparison to Zen, the music is more about `being' than `doing.' Synthesizers provide the medium he creates his `ambient tone poems' with. The waves and washes of sound can best be described as floating, dreamy, and atmospheric and lend themselves to meditative states and quiet reflection.\" Comparisons have been made to Takashi's music and that of Brian Eno's early ambient albums, Steve Roach's \"Structures from Silence,\" and particularly the \"Liquid Mind \"series. I feel that there has been an evolution in Takashi Suzuki's music with each successive album he has released.  For me, \"Voyage\" is his best work so far. Given the critical and popular success his music has enjoyed, I'm sure that this album will appeal to his listeners as much or more.","summary":"Review excerpt from Music and Media Focus","unixReviewTime":1370304000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

Well, there's also my friend Jeff, Willie Nelson, Hank Hill, Freddie King, Buddy Holly, etc.\n\nCheap Sunglasses rocks, and it's hilariously ridiculous too. A humorous ode to eyewear. The first verse is about acquiring cheap sunglasses, the second verse is about stalking a woman who is wearing cheap sunglasses, and the third verse is also about acquiring cheap sunglasses. If there is a chorus, it's Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.\n\nInstrumentally, there is the prominent use of a Planet N keyboard, heard in the halting breaks at 0:37, 1:05 and 3:21, at the end of each verse\/chorus. At 1:06 and 1:50, you get the keyboard and this funny woo-woo-woo alarm sound. Perhaps that's the police coming after the stalker, or a signal that if you currently are not wearing your sunglasses, now is the time to don them and keep your head down. There are some great guitar solos as well, starting at 1:26 and again at 2:10, displaying some excellent distortion and harmonics. Billy Gibbons rocks! Finally, at 3:23, they slow things down for a nice bluesy outro.

Schubert wrote so much music that it's not reasonable to expect anything close to 'completeness' in such a collection, but what is offered here is a very good sampling and a good starting point for anyone exploring Schubert for the first time.\n\nThe point of these collections, in my opinion, is not that the absolute qualify of the music is necessarily the best. Classical collectors and serious Mahler listeners will have other performances they prefer, and nobody is claiming that this set or similar sets are the top rated performances of this music.\n\nI value these Bach Guild sets because of the value they represent, both for experienced collectors but especially for those who would like to dip their toes into classical music to see what it's all about. It is extraordinary, really, to be able to build a collection of fine music for such a reasonable price.\n\nThen, after learning the music, becoming more familiar with it, there will be the natural desire to explore other performances. For those listeners, they can go further and obtain other downloads, or really 'splurge' and buy more 'normal' priced CD collections.\n\nRegardless, this is a terrific value, and the performances are fully worth listening to. I've had this particular Bach Guild set since purchasing it in 2013, in fact, and it's about time I posted a review here to express my opinion on the worthiness of this set!","summary":"One of Bach Guild's early .mp3 collections here on Amazon, another bargain","unixReviewTime":1506124800,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

The past several years had shown some fitting songs to keep them alive, but not as strong as it could've been from them. Their latest song takes them back to the success of songs they have had in the 90's with songs like Iris and Name. Their latest song Rebel Beat form their 2013 record Magnetic, actually is a upbeat and driven song. It definitely is catchy and strong with what John Reznik and the guys have badly needed, after having some lackluster songs for the past several years. It definitely is much better than the joke songs that many of today's artists have shown. I hope there are ore good songs like this from the guys from Buffalo, New York soon. Hopefully, another good black balloon should be on the horizon.\n\nSong: B 1\/2-","summary":"Rebel Rhythm","unixReviewTime":1371254400,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

As Martha recalls \"As part of my job I had to audition other artists, schedule musicians, maintain studio logs and be 'girl-friday' to all the writers and producers. If I clapped or sang background on sessions that was an additional $5.00 each.\" Like so many other artists who came to work at Motown in the early days, Martha Reeves just wanted to get her foot in the door. You see in her spare time she was the lead singer of a local Detroit group known as the Del-Fi's. Her ultimate goal was to get an audition and get a recording contract for her group. Soon the Del-Fi's were hired to sing background on several of Marvin Gaye's early records. Berry Gordy quickly realized that these girls were something special. The group changed its name to Martha and the Vandellas and within just a few months the group was riding high on the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single \"Come And Get These Memories\". It was the beginning of a fabulous run for this extremely talented and highly energetic group.\n\nMotown wasted little time in issuing the follow-up single. Released in early August 1963 \"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave\" would become one of the biggest records of that summer peaking at #4. To me the pulsating sounds of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were the personification of Motown's moniker \"The Sound of Young America\" and this is one of the finest examples.

I thoroughly enjoy listening to this album.

This kind of music is perfect for just about anything.

If you are a diehard TSFH fan, I would highly recommend buying this album asap. If you are new to TSFH or the \"epic music\" genre then I would recommend starting out with other albums from TSFH first such as Battlecry, Vanquish, or Invincible.\nHighlights on the album: Nemesis, Jump!, Sons of War, Eternal Sorrow (this one is a beautiful, sad, amazing piece!), The Ancients, Ironheart, The World is Mind.

Never really sure of the extent of her contributions as a vocalist in the group, and since Im really not a solid fan of gospel I was reluctant to even give her a try, but she came hard on this trackI know its a gospel track but it has the sound and feel of a classic R&B sound from a very lovely vocalist deserving of the time of day and air-time, and certainly a great addition to my music library.","summary":"Love this track","unixReviewTime":1388880000,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}

But Michele has had honestly the most to prove after the trio broke up in voice. If We Had Your Eyes, the latest song from Michelle is not a bad song, but not actually as striking as other songs. Still it is a very uplifting song that speaks well from Michelle. Still, it isn't one of her better songs, but at least it is much better than the lackluster songs that have been on radio. I do hope there is more from Michelle to be better though.\n\nSong: C+","summary":"She Shows Her Eyes","unixReviewTime":1378857600,"style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"vote":null,"image":null}
