A1E78KIR64YBT6,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,my first favorite kiss song off the first favorite kiss album i own thank you for having it available and bring back those memories.,

A86WP180LOBGH,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,"Beautiful ballad by Penridge and KISS. This song, from the Destroyer album in 1976, is still a popular song with the young rockers ...after almost 40 years. Truly the mark of a great band and an awesome song!",
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,"KISS is a rock n roll band. In the 1970-80s era, they embodied an aspect of rock alongside the Who, the Stones and the others. Most of their music is high testosterone, like ""Strutter,"" ""Hard Luck Woman,"" and ""I Was Made for Loving You,"" bordering on self-parody. They were and are fun.

Then there's ""Beth."" It is a quiet song, but is gritty in its message. It isn't a metal ballad, but could have just easily been performed by Bread. There is depth, passion, and love. It is poetic, melodic, and, in my opinion, has earned its spot as one of rock music's greatest songs.

If the rest of KISS' songwriting was on par with ""Beth,"" KISS could've been more than a fun band stuck its era, but had a legacy to last until the end of rock n roll.

It begins:

Beth, I hear you callin'
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playin'
And we just can't find the sound

It ends:
Beth, I know you're lonely
And I hope you'll be alright
'Cause me and the boys will be playin'
All night

Look, if you are reading this review, you already know the song. Nothing here that's new. I suppose my review is for that one guy on the planet who loves KISS but magically, mysteriously missed this song. Is that even possible?

AB0ARZZCB97SK,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,No problems.  Thanks!,
A19DLBU0S995WP,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,Great,
AVLSVMBRYFGHF,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,Love it. You wouldn't believe that it is Kiss..,
ARJT7QGL9IVDP,B000VZO4TW,1,1,4,Vintage Kiss,
A3DHMGQ93GIJCR,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,"Love this song!! I would recamend this to anyone who loves ballets!! This was the way my hubbie and i were. but not now, but good song anyway!!",
A135GWMXMTR58Z,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5,. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great,
A3GJ6CFWN47N0U,B000VZPI7Y,1,1,5,"I enjoyed this song. I often listened to this song, repeatedly. I am happy to state that it is part of my music library.",
A2JY0CRCF9GWCH,B000VZQISW,1,1,5,"This song is from early in Trisha Yearwood's career.  I like some of her music, but this song has always captivated me.  Her voice is nice, but the combination of the vocals, the melody, and the words work extremely well together.  You may find yourself singing along and actually reminiscing of some ""back when"" moments of your own.  That is True song magic.",
A26GW9GHWZJ0UY,B000VZQISW,1,1,5,Just a poignant sweet reminiscing song to cause the listener to think of the one that got away or a fabulous memory with the significant other.  Trisha sings flawlessly in this song.,
A2W9LEXD3BAETW,B000VZQISW,1,-1,3,"I like this song and wanted to add it to my huge music collection, so I purchased it. Keeping all of that in mind, there are a whole lot of Trisha's albums/tracks that I'd put ahead of this and consider ""essential"" tracks too.",
A22PZBENWG6IM0,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5,THIS SONG IS AWESOME!!!!,
AXCE4WRBKMLY0,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5,Love it,
AOZCXHUOIBLE3,B000VZQHNS,1,1,4,Nice!,
A205K5U0M2K8QC,B000VZQHNS,1,1,4,"Product works great, great item to purchase.  I really enjoy it.  Thank you very much.",
A1QOYWEU4UPUML,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5,"One of the best tracks ever produced. I love the music, beat, tone, everything. This is a near perfect song and I wish she would have had more like it in her career. Get it now!",
A1203Q0HWECJXU,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5,"Overall, this is a great product due to its high replay value. I would recommend this product to both music aficionados and casual music listeners alike.",
AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000VZQHNS,-1,1,5,"Nelly Furtado completely remade herself in 2006.  Her earlier work, including hits ""I'm Like a Bird"" and ""Powerless"" were fun and entertaining songs (and Nelly is a very attractive, appealing artist), but they didn't excite the mass audiences.  They had more appeal to the Adult Contemporary chart.

  2006 saw the debut of her song ""Promiscuous"", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take ""Promiscuous"" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This set the tone for the remainder of her album ""Loose"", which showed her new image to be genuine instead of posed.",
A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL,B000VZQHNS,1,1,4,I saw this as a song choice for a book and once I heard the preview for the song I was hooked. This is a great song to listen to or work out too. I would highly recommend it,
A26GRWSM1Z4EAZ,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5,I am a big fan of this song and it's a great club song. I really like it a lot,
A1LGGZXCURHFLC,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5,This is a song that makes you want to get up and dance. It's a feel good song! I love this song.,
AS02LU5CR8VJP,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5,This is the same version I heard on the radio when it first came out. This is the studio recording and is not a live or concert version.,
A1PBK25WOPM6QA,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5,The beat is tight. Lyrics are well on point. Just a fun song to dance to. Nellly Furtado and Timbaland are a great combo.,
AN70QAG4P5TIS,B000VZQHNS,1,1,4,"I have no idea why I got this song or when, but I do like it. It's fun to clean to! hahaha",
A6DSDTFL9O4HB,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5,"I'll be honest... it's an Mp3 download.  It downloaded, I listened to it, end of story.  No problems getting it on my computer or accessing it.  Good times, man, good times.",
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5,"In this simple song, Lisa Loeb and Nine Stories express the conflicting emotions of people in many relationships, wondering if they should stay with someone who confuses them or drives them crazy.  Nice guitar work in particular, and lovely vocals.",
A33EIZD6GMJ1WL,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5,My favorite song from the 90's. Still great and I would recommend this song for your library. Great rhythm and beat.,
A3PYQ6EULBFXOL,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5,"Great vocals, lyrics, and Lisa's so cute.",
A15JTJXQXO22JJ,B000VZSC8G,-1,-1,1,"I can't figure out why this song was so popular in the first place?
Only thing I can tell you is stay away from this one. worst song in the 90's period.",

A2LMRQVT4ZWPOF,B000VZSC8G,-1,-1,2,this is a song I remember from a movie but I think now listening I know why this was a one hit wonder,
A2VG6FKR3WQ84A,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5,her voice is just calming and sweet.  I like originality and Lisa seems to have that down pat.  I like it.,
A1YJKLHQJ10GJZ,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5,Finally got my hands on this GEM! One of my favorites of all time. This song plays well. I think this was like $.69 cents.,
A3B2F2086QK67Q,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5,"I just heard this song today i thought the title was ""You got the music in you"" till i tried to download it (My BAD!)........This song reminds me of records from the late 60's early 70's groups like the Young Rascals Tommy James & the Shondells, even The Doobie Brothers to a degree............LOVE IT!",
A3QMW0R63QGZT2,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5,"Great song by great band. Love the pick me up every time I hear it. And, it makes me smile.",
A8IVYKSKP8QFY,B000VZSBPK,-1,1,5,"If you have heard of Jeff Lynne and or ELO (The Electric Light Orchestra), this song from The New Radicals will sound a lot like the 70's version of ELO.

It took me about two weeks to track this tune down, and everyone I explained it too thought I was crazy saying it ""ELO who?""

The ELO song best close to this is

""All Over The World"" (from the Xanadu Soundtrack)

Listen to that and you'll see what I mean...

This song however is a great inspirational song and a great sounding one at that.",
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5,"The 90s backlash has been ugly, with this not only 90s classic, but music classic being pushed aside since radio chewed it up and spit it back out, 1,000 spins later. It still lives on in the minds of millions of fans who still put this high up on their life's soundtrack.

It's a song that runs on a million trains of thoughts, ranging from karma, to self-appreciation, to celebrity-bashing. It's certainly ground-breakingly awesome, bringing awesomeness to another level not only in the world of pop rock, but music period. Hearkening back to those piano-driven pop ballads of the 70s, this outwardly simple song holds a lot of complexity to it. Just ask U2 guitarist/song-writer ""The Edge."" When asked in Time Magazine back in '06 what songs he would most like to have written, there was ""Wonderwall,"" and ""You Get What You Give."" And even though some would say it's a throwback to years gone by, it keeps itself a modern eye, staying relevant not only in the 90s, but also in the 00s.

Then you gotta love those vocals, using the False, and they're just so perfect for the song. And again, it's a throwback to the 70s. As for the last few verses, although some outlets have cut them, I don't really care about them, and they kind box the song in the 90s a little bit too much. Although the way he sings it is great, it's kind of here nor there, didn't need that.

So looking at best 90s songs, this ranks in the top 10, which is pretty impressive considering the litnia of the decade. Once the brutal 90s backlash is over this song and ones like it will once again receive the credit they deserve, but until then, ""You Get What You Give"" will play on as the soundtrack for a moment in time, forever frozen in splendor.",
AEVAPEHXQRIDP,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5,Great soumd,
A5QN0QWD8Y49P,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5,"While training for a Ragnar relay race, I downloaded songs that will motivate, encourage, and push me to do my best. For that to happen, I need clean lyrics with positive and uplifting messages.

Since it was a Ragnar relay race, I was on a team and this song also helped foster that team spirit, something is much needed for a 72 hour, 200 mile adventure across the state.

I can listen to it around kids too because the lyrics are clean. Essentially, Having this song has helped keep me going when I am exhausted and tired from all the running.",

A2IKFX7NYHXVOC,B000VZSBPK,-1,1,5,"New Radicals is a classic example of a band that showed great promise, but broke up just as I ""discovered"" them.  ""You Get What

A2Y7A8F738CUY6,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5,"Upbeat, fun song from the 90's economic boom period which for the longest time I thought was titled ""The Music in You."" Remember you got potential ""you got the music in you!""",

A1PQNXFH9Q2KUJ,B000VZRASO,1,1,5,These guys can't seem to make a bad song huh?  This is another band that has been around for a very long time and their music should be written in the rock & roll hall of fame.,

Remember when your purchasing from iTunes, your only RENTING your music, once you quit iTunes, they yank back all the rights for you to play your music. So whats this mean?... your hundreds of dollars of music, is worthless files if you quit itunes... why? because the awful DRM that your music has been infected by. You don't own your iTunes, you will never own it as long as DRM, the RIAA and Apple have anything to do with it.

High production value and good mixing only add to this records greatness, and you'll probably have it in your cd for more than a couple weeks before moving on to something else.

Pretty much any fan of pop-rock in general can find something to appreciate on ""say it"", and because replay value is so high, you find that the songs that just didn't stick before get better and better with time

Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul.

'My Favorite Mistake' in particular, the first track talks about a relationship that is almost just for show and not working out well. Even Sheryl admits it's a ""mistake"".

Soft Cell, which has been labeled a one-hit wonder from the 80's, still has not been able to master having another smash song.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000W03ITI,-1,1,4,"Over the years, we've had our share of rock/pop, pop, and who can forget power-pop, but Fall Out Boy brings back, if it was ever gone, Power-Rock. In this case, FOB goes for a breakup song, which most creative in the song title, is written in TXT MSS. Thankfully, the song is not sung in that. In style, this song resembles 'Arms Race' a little to closely, but differs in minor, but better, changes in the verses and chorus. Also, the song sounds a little better when Patrick Stump sings solo.

So overall, while it's not a bad song, it's not a great one either. But it is a great power-rock song.","Over the years , we 've had our share of rock / pop , pop , and who can forget power - pop , but Fall Out Boy brings back , if it was ever gone , Power - Rock ..

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000W03IQ6,-1,-1,3,"In the follow up to 'Cork Tree,' Fall Out Boy had to capitalize on their success to engrain themselves. Their first single here, comes off less as a single, and more as an arena-anthem. As a single, I thought it was good when in first came out, catchy, unique, good build-up. However, this song has worn on me, and not by radio mind you, but just the song itself. The song could be described as an angry power-rock (rather than power-pop) anthem, and because of the style that goes along with a song like this, it just doesn't hold any staying power. Maybe for a month or two, but then it's history.

So overall, if you've never heard the song, try it, you might like it. Beware though, it's not very long before it'll get sentenced to the shelf.","In the follow up to ' Cork Tree , ' Fall Out Boy had to capitalize on their success to engrain themselves ..

The chorus loops could then be played by using the mixing desk rather like a keyboardeach chord could be sounded by bringing up the fader for that loop. The instrumental break featured the repeated spoken phrase, ""Big boys don't cry..."", spoken by Kathy Warren, the receptionist of their own Strawberry Studios where the band recorded the track.

Sometimes, Johnny gets a little mellow on some cuts given the maturity and adult romantic feel of the songs. I still love the gorgeous Let's Get the Mood Right. It makes for good music to hear in the bedroom late at night.  Other favorites are Touch, Maybe and Having Illusions. I love the sexy It's Your Body and the late Roger Troutman of Zapp being on it. One of Roger's best of his final performances when he was alive. It still surprises me that he would follow the somewhat uneven Provocative with this well sung, well performed effort.  Staying True to himself and his vocal style is what makes his third Motown album my second favorite album by him.","This is such a wonderful effort ..

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W11NDU,-1,-1,3,"Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album? Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself, and everyone said he was coming off too cocky. Well, Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition's Home Again came out, so wasn't he being a little cocky himself? Yeah, everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo, but to be honest, this wasn't his best album.
Take the Babyface-penned title track, for example. The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus: ""Let's get the mood right/Turn on your heart light."" Turn on your heart light? That's too cheesy, even for Babyface. And ""Love In An Elevator"" is full of corny lyrics like ""They say there's no luck on the thirteenth floor/But I found love and so much more"" and ""Like The Staples, I wanna take you there."" ""Simply Say I Love You"" is okay, but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember hearing Stevie in that song.
The only songs that really stand out are ""Maybe"" and ""It's Your Body"". The latter features Roger Troutman, and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible. The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing: sex, sex, and more sex. The sleepy production doesn't make things better, either.
Another problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs, especially the very last track, ""So Gentle"". It features a rap from Ron DeVoe, so you know what the main problem is. But the thing is that the preceding song ""I Know You Want Me"" features uninspired rapping from some other guy, and his rapping is actually worse than Ron's.
I still like Johnny Gill, but this album seems like it was rushed. And the strong adlibs he's known for usually adds feeling to the songs, but here it seems like they're trying to hide the questionable material. You're better off getting the solo albums he made before this.","Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album ?.

AJK5WHV1GW941,B000W11N6W,1,1,5,"It isn't hard to say that this is a good album, it fact, it is not hard to say this album is nothing short of a masterpiece.  India. Arie delivers a brilliant sophomore album entitled, ""Voyage to India"".  In fact, if this album was really a ""voyage"" to somewhere, many would probably pay top dollar to be there!

 This is such a positive album.  The lyrics just make any listener smile.  Anyone who knows anything about India knows she loves to play the guitar, and it is evident that she loves the guitar when listening to her album.  There is a guitar in every song on the album.  Although I think she's a bit indulgent with the guitar, she doesn't bore the listener with it.  It actually sounds right nice and adds something distinctive to her album.

 ""Good Man"" is definitely an album highlight.  The lyrics are meaningful and real.  The song is about a man who has children and if anything ever happens to him, he wants his children to know he loved them and that he was a good man.  Many parents can relate to this song because it's the same way they feel about their children.  ""Talk to Her"" has one of those beats you can snap your fingers and bob your head to.  Aside from the laid back beat, the song offers a very relevant message in today's world; talk to women with respect (men).  This song has simple lyrics, but they say so much.  I love it!  ""God is Real"" is another one of the many beautiful songs on ""Voyage to India"".  This song has a very noticeable guitar in the background.  India's vocals are really good on this track, they help the song to be more believable.  The song is about questioning the existence of God.  India does an excellent job of stating her claim of why she thinks or as she says ""knows"" that God is real.  ""Can I Walk With You"" and ""The One"" are just nice love songs.  India's vocals are, again, on point for these tracks.  If anyone were to ask me to pick to tracks to listen to on this album, I'd go with these.  The album contains no fillers, just brilliant work by a great artist of today.  If debating on whether or not to cop this one, GET IT NOW!  India will take you by surprise, like she did men.  I am very impressed with the talent of this woman.  She's a shining star! 5 star album!

A24P8BEJ26FU01,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3,"RnB/Soul singer, India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002. Most sophomore albums by other neo-soul artists, such as D'Angelo and Macy Gray (note that I haven't heard either of these albums) were deemed by fans to have fallen to the dreaded sophomore slump so India Arie had a lot to prove. India Arie proved she had undeniable talent with her debut album, both lyrically and vocally and most fans tend to compare the two albums. On both, India Arie wrote or co-wrote all the songs and she writes about meaningful topics such as self-respect and communication in relationships. On her sophomore album, ""Voyage To India"", India Arie provides her wonderful lyrics and vocals in songs that seem to tell what many women are thinking of, rather than being self-reflective as she was on her debut.
India Arie starts her sophomore album off with a short intro, just over a minute in length, called ""Growth"" which states that the only thing that is constant in the world is change. It's a somewhat pointless intro, but the statement she makes is definitely True. The second track is an mid-tempo song called ""Little Things"". As expected by the title, this song talks about appreciating the little things in life such as a ""call in the morning from my little sister singing me happy birthday"". As with most of India Arie's songs, the lyrics are not complex but are beautiful in their simplicity. Next comes ""Talk To Her"", a somewhat preachy song about how to talk to a woman. India Arie instructs the listener to treat the woman with respect and ""talk to her the way you want someone to talk to your mama"". In other words, talk to her respectfully no matter what she's wearing (""It doesn't matter if she's wearing a miniskirt or a business suit""), a message that desperately needs to be heard in today's society. The song also talks about the importance of respect and communication in relationships.
Afterwards comes the mid-tempo ""Slow Down"", a debatable album highlight. The song speaks about taking life day by day and not rushing through everything. The lyrics are once again simple yet beautiful. It's about remembering that speed isn't always the best way to achieve your goals. Next comes the romantic ""The Truth"", with its lyrics seemingly half-spoken, half-sung (more like spoken to a tune). Nonetheless, a sweet, romantic song about what India Arie loves about her man. The next song, ""Beautiful Surprise"", has a similar theme about finding love when you least expect it. It was written by India Arie alone and really shows off her talent for songwriting. After comes a short interlude, ""Healing"" which talks briefly about releasing all sadness from you. Like most interludes however, it is not too memorable.
Subsequently come two songs about moving away from the pains of the past, ""Get It Together"" and ""Headed in The Right Direction"". ""Get It Together"" is another somewhat preachy song that talks about having to get it together to heal your body and heart. It is a beautiful song when you listen to it but in the grand scheme of things, it does not stand out. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" fares much better, probably because it is more upbeat however it is fairly short compared to the other songs on the album. After that comes ""Can I Walk With You"" is an album highlight that seems to talk about taking friendship to another level and it is probably my favourite song on the album. Then comes ""The One"", a very overused song title but this is probably one of the better songs of that title. Lyrically and vocally it is a unique (in a good way) song but it is also quite short.
Next comes ""Complicated Melody"" another romantic, metaphoric song that compares India's man to colours, numbers and songs. It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice. Otherwise, it adds little to the quality of the album. The song, while it sounds nice, is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons. Following this comes another interlude, ""Gratitude"" which is not much different from the other two. Then comes another highlight, ""Good Man"", another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album. India's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well. The second last track, ""God Is Real"" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album. Finally, there is the bonus track ""Interested"" which doesn't stand out at all compared to the other tracks. The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great.
Overall Mark: 3/5
Although this is still a great album, ""Voyage To India"" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie's debut so good. The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other. As a whole the album sounds great, but when you break it down, many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and, of course, different lyrics. India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists, like Jewel (similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop), so memorable. The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable.","RnB / Soul singer , India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002 ..

A1IV4XBV2XEQPQ,B000W11N6W,1,1,4,"Sometimes simplicity can go a long way. That is why artists like India. Arie manage to survive and succeed in an industry of overproduction and glitz. Arie returns after bearing her ""Acoustic Soul"" to the world. She is now ready to take us on a ""Voyage To India"" and it's worth taking.
Although the first track'""Growth,"" is an interlude opening up the second chapter in Arie's anthology, this record, in many senses, is more of a continuation of the previous rather than an evolution of the artist.
The only difference is the first single ""Little Things"" which is a track that, surprisingly, does not have any guitars on it, but its lyrics capture the same granola down-to-earth essence as her debut single ""Video.""
""Talk to Her"" is a run-on song. But Arie's way with melodies is best depicted by the mood jam ""Slow Down"" and the uplifting folk ditty ""Beautiful Surprise.""
Considering all aspects Arie brings into her craft, one could say that Arie's sound is a cross between Erykah Badu and Tracy Chapman.
Arie's diverse influences play a role in her distinct sound. As she has stated in her previous album, her influences range from Stevie Wonder to Karen Carpenter.
""Get It Together"", a song about maintaining strength when times are rough, captures that with her warm vocals and guitar-lead melody. Then, ""Headed In The Right Direction"" starts out like an '80's Luther Vandross anthem and then wanes towards the end.
All songs aside, Arie shines most on ""Can I Walk With You"" - a song about the need to belong. Arie's vocals on this song depict a yearning like no other. This is definitely a gem, if Motown Records had any sense this would be the next single.
""Voyage To India"" then meanders into sharp beats on ""The One"" and ""Complicated Melody,"" which is exactly what it says - it doesn't go anywhere. But the fall is cushioned by ""Good Man"" and the bonus track ""Interested,"" which keeps Arie's soulful tradition alive.
This album is bound to be a coffee shop favorite.
It contains slow jams, simple, yet deep folk numbers and sultry vocals. Although it is a well-rounded album, it sounds more like ""Acoustic Soul 2"" rather than a record with its own unique taste.","Sometimes simplicity can go a long way ..

A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B000W11N6W,1,1,4,"I read some of the negative reviews of India. Arie's Voyage to India album and I wonder if those reviewers listened to the whole album. Sure, she gets preachy at times on here, but that's only on two or three songs, and even those are good. And every time I listen to this album, I love it even more.
""Little Things"" is an okay song for a first single, but there are better songs than that on here. Check out the two highlights, ""Good Man"", where India tells a story about a man who tells his wife to remember him if he dies someday, and ""Talk to Her"" (which is still very preachy), where India tells men to respect their women. The latter, as well as a few other songs, features Laurnea, who's been M.I.A. from the industry for a while. Where did India find her??? Even as a backup singer, she shines like she always did.
""Can I Walk With You"" has that ready-for-VH1 feel to it, as does ""Interested"", but that doesn't make these songs any less engaging. Also, I noticed that ""Slow Down"" has the same melody as last year's ""Back to the Middle"". But this album is still solid. Don't buy it expecting some kind of growth in songwriting or spiritual evolution (it's only been a year since her Acoustic Soul album).

A2ZTFPWOPNNHTW,B000W11N6W,1,1,5,"My Voyage To India was a delightful excursion. I'm grateful that all I have to do is play the cd to take the trip. I've Voyaged To India numerous times since I've acquired this cd and just can not get enough of this mind, body, and soul candy.
The songs on this cd are beautifully arranged and performed flawlessly. Alot of the lyrics are pure poetry; expressing love, exhortation, positivity, and all the things that would make us better people to humanity, ourselves, and loved ones.

ABE14SVILZLNY,B000W11N6W,-1,1,5,"With the surprise double-platinum success of 2001's Acoustic Soul, India. Arie became that rare bird -- particularly in contemporary R&B -- who straddles the line between artistic innovation and schmaltz. Certainly a talented guitar-playing songstress, she also takes her lyrical cues from Hallmark cards, a mix at once comfortable and off-putting -- and difficult to put one's finger on.
This follow-up, seemingly rushed into stores, doesn't clear up the confusion; as with Alicia Keys, it's almost impossible to criticize a contemporary urban artist who writes life-affirming, organic songs, yet this journey ends as unconvincingly as Soul or Songs in A Minor. What's more, it lacks any sort of knockout number -- Soul had two, ""Video"" and ""Brown Skin"" -- leaving us to wonder just where Arie intended on taking us.
Which is not to say that the potential isn't there, only that balance is not. Is she the younger visage of Tracy Chapman (""The One,"" ""Power of Words"")? Channeling Chaka Khan on two gleefully old school steppin' tracks, ""Interested"" and ""Slow Down""? When she takes her own advice to ""live for the moment,"" she gets better results: ""Get it Together"" is a swirling slam-dunk of a love song, and ""Good Man,"" an overlooked track off the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, makes a nice fit here. When she comes off preachy, it's with treacly results: ""God is Real"" and ""Little Things"" are cloying bits of armchair philosophy.
Voyage is at its most interesting, and often its best, when Arie tries to come from out of the shadows of her influences and chart her own path. Though she stumbles on ""The Truth"" trying to incorporate slicker R&B-style beats into the mix, the titular Spanish folk tinges of ""Headed in the Right Direction"" says it all, as does ""India's Song,"" which could have been the album's most overwrought track but instead perfectly mixes Chapman's subdued introspection with Woody Guthrie's wide-eyed folk. These are the tracks suggest the voyage isn't over; it may have only just begun.","With the surprise double - platinum success of 2001 's Acoustic Soul , India ..

A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3,"It's amazing what a few Grammy nominations can do.  India. Arie's debut album of folk-laced soul didn't break any new ground, but it was an overall appealing mix of catchy tunes and positive messages that were a welcome alternative to the talk-show/men-bashing lyrics of her ghettoized peers.  And even though she walked home empty-handed on Grammy night, her debut album, ""Acoustic Soul,"" enjoyed robust multiplatinum sales.  Expectations are naturally high, and I hoped that her followup ""Voyage to India,"" would be a musical and lyrical step forward from her debut.  While the album is thoroughly listenable from start to finish, ""Voyage to India"" just doesn't serve a platter filling enough to stick to your ribs.  Arie has her heart in the right place, and her intentions are noble, but the truth remains that she's a passable lyricist, often resorting to ""love yourself"" cliches that become one-dimensional.  And while the music is pleasing, the folkish, acoustic-based melodies and choruses seem a bit predictable.  However, I really dug ""Little Things,"" the sincerity of the love song ""Beautiful Surprise,"" and ""Get it Together.""  While ""Voyage to India"" is an okay album, it pales in comparison to better, superior albums we've heard in the last year from ""Cookie"" by MeShell Ndegeocello, the flawed yet fascinating ""Unplugged"" set from Lauryn Hill, and ""How Do I"" from Res.

A23KAWGZ4RE1RI,B000W11N6W,-1,-1,2,"After the multiplatinum success of ""Acoustic Soul"", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup ""Voyage To India"". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on ""Voyage"" as this album is severely so-so.
First off the production is weaker than on ""Acoustic"" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either.
Tired duds like ""Little Things"" and the predictably titled ""God Is Love"" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for ""deep"" when they come off like Hallmark card messages.
Bland ""folk""-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead ""Voyage"" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. ""Good Man"" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record.
Fortunately, ""Voyage"" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. ""The Truth"" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired ""love yourself"" retreads.

Look, ""Voyage To India"" makes India to be more of a ""Black-girl"" version of bland, ""folk"" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being ""bootylicious"" or partying or ""her man"" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on ""Voyage"" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not ""deep"".
India. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'. She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the  bland R&B that dominates this album doesn't do much for both the listener or her.","After the multiplatinum success of "" Acoustic Soul "" , India ..

A3FWHXSZSTKFIU,B000W11N6W,-1,-1,3,"Coming off of a classic first album, we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician/singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts.  The grooves swing, the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great. The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record.
But you know how an artist's intentions can be TOO clear?  The messages too in-your-face?  How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away?  That's what's wrong here.
The problem I have is with the lyrics: they're WAY too preachy.
I thought that the music was so well-done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio, but that's turned out to not be the case.  A song will come in with a great beat, great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you're inundated with Sunday School-level lessons for three minutes.  Where's the risk-taking of ""Brown Skin"" or the gutsy self-confidence of ""Video""?  Where's the humanity of ""Ready for Love"" or the philisophical punch of ""I See God In You""?  It's just not there this time around.  It's almost as if she's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages.  This album is cursed with the kind of ""We Are the World"" heavy-handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year.
Great playing mired in WAY heavy-handed and too-simple lyrics.  The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar, which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much-needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity.  This, however, is too far at the other end of the love/hate spectrum.  If I wanted a gospel album, I'd have bought a gospel album.  She's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well, which is fine, but because of that there's a lot of not-great sap here too.  Not even racy, midnight-mood, slow-jammy sap...it's just simplistic I'm-in-love type stuff that, lyrically, you could get anywhere.
The shining track here is ""The One"" but it's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record.  This is all a terrible shame; I wanted to like this one, especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of (groan) Alicia Keyes, but this record falls short in the most important department: the message.","Coming off of a classic first album , we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician / singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts ..

I have this on my running playlist. There is are mariachi-style horns and guitar-drum beat which pace this excellently for runners looking for more pep in their step.

AKGF27HN0OF19,B000W11NQ2,1,1,4,"Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one, and for the most part it works well.  After dabbling with country on the ""Riddles In The Sand"" album, Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on ""Mango"".  ""Please Bypass This Heart"" is nothing spectacular, but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it's best with ""If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me"".  I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song (this is coming from a guy who does not like country music).  Other highlights on the album include ""Frank And Lola"" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re-kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida.  ""Desperation Samba"" is another great Buffett ""south of the border"" tune.  The title track ""Last Mango In Paris"" is classic Buffett.  The album closer ""Beyond The End"" is a song a lot of Buffett fans don't seem to care for, but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc.  The album also includes several of Buffett's popular concert favorites ""Jolly Mon"" and ""Gypsies In The Palace"".  Some of the production on this album is very 80's oriented which dates it a bit, but overall this is another good album from Jimmy.","Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one , and for the most part it works well ..

A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000W11NQ2,1,1,5,"Last Mango In Paris is a classic Jimmy Buffett album.  After the fairly putrid Riddles In The Sand, he comes back strong with the perfect mix of satire and Caribbean rhythms.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W1774O,1,1,4,"Hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary Johnny Cash passed away. Yet, his music was definitely a cavalcade of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well. But when he did a cover song that was out of the ordinary, he not only made it his own nicely, but it sometimes still stands taller than the original artist in that tone. The prime example of Johnny's musical intimacy came nearly at the end of his life when he did a cover of Nice Inch Nails song Hurt. The song is definitely something still worth listening too. Not just from Johnny's voice, but also because of his simplicity of the guitar and piano. It is a great song to listen too, not just if you are a die hard Johnny Cash fan, but also for anyone who is new to his music. Get this, and you won't be hurt.

Then comes a 13 min. blow-out version of ""Cosmia"", from the ""YS"" album, which here live sounds much more invigerated than the album version, and I can't stop playing it.

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000W1877U,1,1,5,"Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year's ""Ys,"" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk.

And after the solemnities of ""Ys,"" apparently Newsom has decided to go a bit more lighthearted. ""Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band"" is an unpretentious little EP, with some new songs and new takes on older songs -- a fun little treat.

It opens with the strong folky chords of ""Colleen,"" a slice of Celtic-flavoured balladry that trickles through an oddball melody. ""I tell it as I best know how,"" croons Newsom in her crazy-fairy voice. ""Pick me up and toss me round/I lost my shoes and tore my best gown...""

She then follows it up with new versions of two older songs: the gentle haunting reimagining of ""Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"" and a full-band version of ""Cosmia,"" which seems nicely fleshed-out and polished.

After to the legendary grandeur of ""Ys,"" this little EP seems relaxed and laid-back, as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set. They're done with an ear for fun, but that doesn't take the delicate, appealing edge from the music.

Her twangly, delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes, and what sounds like some soft drums, all mingled together. In ""Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"" we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp. And over it all is Newsom's creaky, meandering vocals, wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy.

One new song and two reworkings, but ""Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band"" is stil worth getting for anyone who likes eerie, weird little folk songs.","Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year 's "" Ys , "" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk ..

AJK5WHV1GW941,B000W176MM,1,1,4,"I would hear Kem on the radio, mostly on the stations which focused on playing jazz music and said to myself, ""This is just where this artist belongs"". I liked his voice from the first time I was introduced to it. It's very unique and befitting for jazz. It has been a long time since I have heard Kem on the radio, but something just compelled me to pick up his debut album and listen closely; I'm glad I did.

Please be warned: The younger generation may not like or appreciate this album. For example, when I was listening to this album, my brother gave me a crazy look and said, ""What the hell are you listening to?"" On the contrast, my older sister heard me playing the LP and said, ""You know about Kem? I didn't know you liked Kem!"" I really don't want to limit him to a particular audience, by this really is grown folks music. There is not one up-tempo song  in sight, just slow jams and mid-tempos. Everyone doesn't always like fast music anyway; I'm one of them. I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music. I get so tired of it, I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays. ""Love Calls"" was the first single from ""Kemistry"" and what a fantastic song it is! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about. This song is very laid back and mellow; it's sure to put one in a romantic mindset. Also, the lyrics are really good. He's letting the listening know that when love calls, there is no where to hide. ""Inside"" and ""Cherish this Moment"" are fine moments on the album. These tracks actually bring Sade to mind. I love the hook on ""Inside"" simply because it's catchy. This album is slightly flawed because it was boring in a few areas, but overall, I was impressed.  He did a fine job.

The rest of the songs are totally and unmistakably, KEM!!

I love the vibe of this entire album and had a hard time not pressing repeat on a few songs, namely: LOVE CALLS, MATTER OF TIME, SAY & YOU ARE.
Yes, it is more of a ""chill out"" album but certainly not one that bored me - I found myself paying attention to the adult lyrics and the beautiful music production.  I'd highly recommend this disc to lovers of r&b mixed with subtle jazz notes - it's a great debut from a real artist who I hope to hear much more from in the future (despite his sorry label and lack of promotion).","First let me say that I love the wordplay used for the title of Kem 's debut album ..

It did not matter that he could not dance very well, I was just on top of the world that I was dancing to one of my favorite groups singing my favorite song at the time.  LTD was not the same for me once Jeffrey Osborne left the group but I still listen to his music.  It was and is still soothing, I play it when I am studying or when I am having trouble falling asleep or when I want to go back to sweet memories.

Just take your time and listen to the meaning of the words and you will love it to.  What great music we had back in the day.

After listening to each song on this album the soothing vocals, music and lyrics he has establish a following with me along with other fans because is breath of Fresh Air from the  Music Mainstream.  If you like new comer John Legend, Kem is Several notch better than John Legend.  Just vocally and lyrically, Kem is a fore runner and his record company should spend lots more money marketing him. His life story Kem should be a Movie.  It amazing what God when you let him put his destiny for you and how when you tapped into your God Destiny and Purpose what Radiants witnin a person talent and abilities.  This album is a good showcase.

My  Personal Favorite song is Love Calls,  this by itself establish his prescence in the music industry.  I have rated each song. Other favorites

1. Matter of Time  -Excellent intro

2. Miss You  - Calming & Amazing

3. Say  - Soothing Vocals

4. Inside  - Another Wonderful Example of Kem's vocal ability

5. I'm Missin' Your Love  -Anazing Song and Soohing melodies

6. Love Calls  -  SO VERY AMAZING VOCALS, LYRICS & MUSIC Arrangements - Kem at his Finest

7. Brotha Man  -  Rich and Wonderful Vocals

8. Cherish This Moment -Great

9. This Place (Dedicated to the Church of Today) -Slow but so Meaninful, Brilliant Vocals arrangements.  It is another example of Kem Ability to tap into his roots

10. You Are - Amazing and Soothing Vocals

I would encourage everyone who likes a Great Vocal and Lyrical &Musical arrangements that will elevate your mind  to a Positive and Loving Prescene.  A Calming effect this album  is a Keeper to purchase.  Kem is Unique & Original.  His music is in a Class of it own.  I Look Forward to Kem Music in the Future.

A3IC5E3OFHYAZX,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"Yeah, the '80s may have watered it down with excessive layers of synthesizers and the general favoring of style over substance. Sure, the '90s have all but stomped it out due to the ubiquitous presence of hip-hop's ""dark"" side (heavily-programmed instruments, blatant sampling, offensive lyrics, bad singing). However, thanks to budding artists like Kem Owens, soul music has finally come around full-circle after 20+ years of musical diarrhea.

Kem's sparkling debut should truly set the standard in terms of what to look for in good soul music: REAL INSTRUMENTS (played by REAL MUSICIANS, of course), REAL SONGS (inspired, meaningful lyrics and solid composition skills), and REAL SINGING ABILITY (knowing HOW to sing in addition to having vocal talent). If more and more artists today would just adhere to these relatively simple guidelines, then there wouldn't be so much bad music out there to begin with. An album containing a few hit singles and a load of filler doesn't do it for me. That's why I'm recommending 'Kemistry' to ANYONE who honestly craves good music without the hype to go with it.

p.s. It's no wonder why most reviewers on here keep giving this album 5 stars. They know what they're talking about. So do I.

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W176MM,1,1,5,"I remember hearing ""Love Calls"" being played on the radio at work all the time, and the DJ never said who made the song. Maybe the DJ didn't know, because nobody else did either. When I finally found out the song was from a newcomer named Kem and that his album Kemistry was out, my brother and sister told me to pick the album up. And boy, talk about good advice.
Since ""Love Calls"" is the first single, it's probably also the most recognizable song on the album - but I don't know if I would necessarily say it's the best song. Not to say it isn't a great song, but there are other great tracks too, like ""Inside"" (no, it's not about sex) and the gospel-flavored ""This Place"". And ""Brotha Man"" is a great storytelling track.
With ten tracks at around 47 minutes, it's clear that Kem isn't a debut artist who's trying to overprove himself. And he doesn't need to, because every song on this album is great. So why isn't he getting the recognition he deserves? Probably because he's on Motown, the label that seems to only promote artists when they feel like it (see also Remy Shand). But hopefully Kem will soon sell several copies of this great release.","I remember hearing "" Love Calls "" being played on the radio at work all the time , and the DJ never said who made the song ..

AA8HFTJIAQA4G,B000W176MM,-1,-1,3,"Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound. Well not new just different from most contemporary music today. Essentially he's a jazz singer when you break it down. Listening to his CD is like an extended set of the ""Oasis After Dark"". He released this CD on his own a year ago and after sellin 10,000 copies he managed to get the attention of Motown. Listening to this CD is difficult because while the tone is great and his vocals are good there seems to be something missing. I often found myself asleep before the CD was finished. Kinda like listening to one of those ""Sounds of The Earth"" CD's ... or something to help you go to sleep. 10 distinct songs about love and life. He goes from an Al Jarreau sound on Track 7 ""Brotha Man"" till a Simply Redd feel on Track 3 ""Say"", my favorite track on the CD by the way. Soothing is the best thing I guess you can say about this CD. A nice CD to go to sleep to. Now whether that's a compliment or not I'm not sure. This is definitely not for everyone, but the Jazz Enthusiast will probably be more likely to find use for this CD. ""Is it like Floetry""? No. They are more hip than this CD. ""Is It like SADE""? No. She invokes more soul in her music. ""Al Jarreau?"" No. Jarreau is more livelier than this cat. This one still kind puzzles me. My favorite cuts are 3,4,5,and 6. See if you can get a better grasp on it than I can.","Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound .. Well not new just different from most contemporary music today ..

A2ZTFPWOPNNHTW,B000W176MM,1,1,4,"After hearing ""Love Calls"" on the radio, I had to hear more from this gifted vocalist. At first listen, I could hear the purity and the many dimensions of that VOICE, which is soothing, smooth like 18 year old Appleton, seductive, and playful. Kem is not your ordinary run of the mill singer but an extraordinary song stylist. His voice dips and dives, rounds syllables (much like Al, Anita, & Phyllis), scats, and just downright croons.
After getting ahold of Kemistry I was not dissappointed, rather joyous of the fact that I owned a solid musical experience. This is adult music at its finest. The ambience is intimate and jazzy. The instrumentation is also complimentary to Kem's vocal prowess. There are also nice percussive elements that add to the vibe of the cd. My favs are ""Love Calls, Brotha Man (lyrics are beautiful), Inside, and This Place.""

AGEIT17HENDIS,B000W1AO4Y,-1,-1,3,"I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw (in the good sense) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums. First, on the Hank Williams tribute album, ""Timeless"", where she did a cover of his classic tale of love's trials and tribulations ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself. I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt's ""Beulah Land"" on his tribute album. Finally, I noted the fine job that she did on a duet with John Prine on ""Wedding Bells"" on his ""In Spite Of Ourselves"" cover album of country classics.

That said, although I have high, very high regard for Ms. Williams' cover work I am more ambivalent about her own albums. This album under review is such a case. I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs. She, obviously, can write thoughtfully of love, lost, the cruel nature of the world, her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above-mentioned efforts is missing here. A few do, however, stand out. ""Mama You Sweet"", ""Words"", ""West"" and ""Rescue"" clearly rise to the occasion. As I say, the rest is so-so and suffer a little from trying to cross-over from her country base.","I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw ( in the good sense ) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums ..

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4,"Although Lucinda Williams has been doing her thing for almost thirty years, it seems that she didn't really get a WHOLE lot of attention until she released Car Wheels on a Gravel Road in 1998. That album was so influential that it seems that all of her albums after that point will be compared to it, which might account for all the negative reviews for her latest album, West.

Actually, now that I think about it, this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options. But if this is your first Lucinda Williams album, I suggest you get educated on some of her earlier material first. She doesn't sound different or anything, but, well, Lucinda is another one of those singers that makes great songs yet she doesn't have a great voice, so if you're not a fan of hers, this album might put you to sleep. But it really IS very accessible.

Lucinda composed this album following the death of her mother, which is probably why most of the songs are mellow. They don't drown into each other though, as I can easily pick up highlights like ""Are You Alright"", ""Learning How to Live"" and the title track. And the songs about her mother are poignant yet exceptional, as shown in ""Mama You Sweet"" and especially ""Fancy Funeral"". But my favorite song would probably have to be ""Words"".

While I can do without ""Come On"" and the nine-minute spoken word ""Wrap My Head Around That"", the rest of the album is quality Lucinda. It might not be her best album, but it's far above-average, so if you want to find exceptional music, go west.

A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"The career of singer/songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP, ""West.""

A moody collection of life, love and Americana, the record testifies to her ever-evolving talent and drive for musical perfection.

Williams is a tough chick -- the kind you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of -- but her sensitivity comes to the forefront once again.

""Are You Alright?,"" the lead single and opening track, is beautiful in its stark vulnerability. Asking questions such as, ""Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?"" and ""Is there anything I can do?,"" Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would-be lover. She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored, unyielding honesty.

This upfront quality permeates the collection. ""Everything Has Changed,"" for instance, underscores the monotony of life, whereas the richly melodic ""What If"" has Williams questioning many so-called facts of life.

""Where Is My Love?"" is passionate and pleading in its quest for the ultimate affirmation, appropriately going hand in hand with the autobiographical song ""Learning How to Live."" A particular standout, the latter finds Williams picking up the pieces of her life and moving on after a difficult breakup:

""'All I have left is this dime store ring/But I wouldn't trade it for anything/The days ahead will never be the same/For you I might have even changed my name/I'm learning how to live.""

The melancholy edge of the disc can also be attributed to the recent death of her mother, whom she pays tribute to in the desperate yet understated ""Mama You Sweet."" This experience surely played a part in the composition of another standout track, ""Fancy Funeral."":

""So don't buy a fancy funeral/It's not worth it in the end/Goodbyes can still be beautiful/With all the money that you'll spend/There's no amount of riches/Can bring back what you lost.""

Her search for love continues on the haunting, lyrically intense ""Unsuffer Me.""

Alternately, ""Rescue"" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress.

Different melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album. ""Wrap My Head Around That"" has funky, organic grooves with clean-cut lyrics that don't mess around with pretense or metaphors, and the surprisingly upbeat ""Come On"" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame.

""Words"" attests to the life-affirming power of language, whether uttered or harbored within, providing the most seductive melody of the disc, while the title track closes the album with her most evocative lyrics yet:

""I sleep out in the desert/Under the stars above/And keep making an effort/To wander into love/Who knows what the future holds/Or where the cards may fall/But if you don't come out west and see/You'll never know at all.""

Williams will likely never be able to replicate the cultural impact of her already classic 1998 album ""Car Wheels On a Gravel Road,"" but ""West"" proves that her talents as a musician continue to mature.

With her compelling abilities to connect with listeners on such an intricate, personal level, it is no surprise that more than 20 years into her career, her fanbase only continues to expand.

iTunes and Best Buy are among a myriad of music retailers that sell slightly different versions of ""West,"" offering various bonus demos of the album's selections.","The career of singer / songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP , "" West ..

I do agree with others the lead-off track is one of the weakest on this disk. The repetativeness is completely distracting and not worthy of Willams' talents.  Ditto w/""Mama You Sweet"".

The strongest tracks are by far ""Unsuffer Me"", ""Where is My Love"", ""Rescue"", ""What If"" and ""Wrap My Head Around It"".  Especially the strings on ""Unsuffer Me"" and the guitar on ""Where is My Love"" really make the songs.  They are subtle yet make all the difference.

I do like ""Fancy Funeral"", though it is a little down...even for me.  ""Come On"" starts really good, but it doesn't really go anywhere.

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4,"Lucinda Williams is in my opinion one of the most overlooked musicians in our era, considering that it's taken way too many years for her to get critical and some commercial acclaim, starting with 1998's ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". The current decade has found Williams to be very productive, with 2001's ""Essence"" and 2003's ""World Without Tears"" studio albums and one live album. Now comes the new studio album.

On ""West"" (13 tracks, 69 min.), Lucinda Williams sings about her usual topics of relationships, loss, loneliness, heartache. She also confronts the death of her mother (""Mama You Sweet"" and ""Fancy Funeral""). The opener ""Are You Alright"" sets the tone for the album: a slow-tempo, aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame. There are not many up-tempo songs on here, which may bother some people, but it doesn't bother me as in the end this is a mood album. Highlights for me include ""Unsuffer Me"", which is the best song on this album; the bitter yet funny ""Come On""; the epic 9+ Min. ""Wrap My Head Around That""; the sweet ""Words""; and the title track, which closes the album. The CD I bought came also with a 2 song (11 min.) bonus CD, which brings demo versions of ""Where Is My Love"" and ""Rescue"". Nice, but not really essential.

In all, I have come to like this album more with every listen. This is certainly not the most accessible Lucinda Williams, nor her best (that would still be ""Car Wheels""), but this is a rich album in every sense. But it's not for anyone in a hurry. I saw Lucinda Williams live on her ""World Without Tears"" tour, and was blown away by her stage presence.

The opener "" Are You Alright "" sets the tone for the album : a slow - tempo , aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame .. There are not many up - tempo songs on here , which may bother some people , but it does n't bother me as in the end this is a mood album .. Highlights for me include "" Unsuffer Me "" , which is the best song on this album ; the bitter yet funny "" Come On "" ; the epic 9 + Min . "" Wrap My Head Around That "" ; the sweet "" Words "" ; and the title track , which closes the album .. The CD I bought came also with a 2 song ( 11 min . ) bonus CD , which brings demo versions of "" Where Is My Love "" and "" Rescue "" .. Nice , but not really essential .. In all , I have come to like this album more with every listen .. This is certainly not the most accessible Lucinda Williams , nor her best ( that would still be "" Car Wheels "" ) , but this is a rich album in every sense .. But it 's not for anyone in a hurry .. I saw Lucinda Williams live on her "" World Without Tears "" tour , and was blown away by her stage presence .. I ca n't wait to see how the songs from "" West "" will translate in a live session ."

A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B000W18GBW,1,1,4,"Hearing the four man crew from Queensbridge, The Lost Boyz, once again brings back nostalgic memories of the golden age of hip hop music. Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah (R.I.P.), Spigg Nice, and Pretty Lou knew the formula to making good music, with most concepts working. With many dope recognizable singles such as ""Music Makes Me High"", ""Renee"", and ""Lex, Coups..."" (there is a remix floating out there I strongly recommend you hear). But what separates this crew from other groups is personalty. Mr. Cheeks is very charismatic on the microphone, and Freaky Tah plays the background vocals (those unfamiliar, think of him being what Flava Flav is to Chuck D in Public Enemy, only more serious).

One reason that makes this album great is their creative hooks, some of them will have you remembering for a while. ""Music Makes Me High"", and ""The Yearn"" are both entertaining (although I believe ""Da Game"" is very similar to the latter song). ""1,2,3"" is another great song too with the late Freaky Tah on the solo. ""Get Up"" is another song to easily remember, and slightly changes the atmosphere on the album. Other dope tracks to check out are the title song, and ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless"".

This album is great for the '95/'96 era and can easily stack up to the many east coast hip hop albums that came out around that time. The album flows great, and I personally believe many fans will enjoy. The lyrics are definitely on point majority of the album. Peace.

A175TPTHMNS7S4,B000W18GBW,1,1,4,"In my mind, this CD is what east coast hip hop should sound like.  This album had an impact in that was summed up well by one reviewer that said: ""When this album dropped in '96, everybody's ears perked up a bit and heads turned.""  This was one of those albums that you could turn on and just zone out to.  Tracks like ""The Yearn"", ""Music Makes Me High"", and ""Get Up"" were sure to get any party started while cuts like ""Legal Drug Money"", ""All Right"", ""Straight From The Ghetto"", and ""1,2,3"" were equally effective tales of ghetto life.  Then you throw in classics tracks like ""Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz, & Benz"", ""Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless"", and ""Renee"" and you have as good a rap album as you're gonna find on the east coast.  Even the intro is hot without taking all day to get to the point.  This is easily the best album released by the Lost Boyz.  It seems that Mr Cheeks leads the charge while Freaky Tah picks up the slack.  Tah doesn't rhyme much, but he does manage to spit a few bars on ""Legal Drug Money"", ""The Yearn"", ""All Right"", and ""1,2,3"".  And when he's not rhyming, he's ad libbing in the background on most songs (don't front like I was the only one that was singing along with Tah in most of those songs).  There are a few shortcomings that keep this album from achieving classic status.  Freaky Tah has a very simplistic flow that can come off as boring from time to time (but not often).  Then there are tracks like ""Da Game"" and ""Is This The Part"" that could've been left off the album and no one would've missed it.  Aside from those mishaps, the rest of the album is flawless.  It's been 8 years since this album came out (damn, that was 8 years ago?!) and you can still zone out to it in 2004.  Overall, this album is near classic with party jams and street tales that are effective in their purposes.  This CD is definitely worth your money if you're considering buying it.

A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"On August 10, 2005 Lucinda Williams played at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh.  It was the last live concert that my wife and I saw together.  Lucinda was touring in support of ""Live @ the Fillmore"" & said she was writing songs for a new record.  As I recall, she played a new song she said she'd recently written, ""Everything Has Changed.""  I preordered Lucinda's ""West"" set while my wife was still here.  Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe.  Lucinda lost her mother; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me, they punctuate every breath I take.  I spin the CD & Lucinda's gentle aching voice comes on, ""Are you alight?""  When people ask me that, I want to say, ""He*l no!""  But when she sings, ""All of a sudden you went away; I hope you come back around someday; I haven't seen you in a real long time; Could you give me some kind of sign?  Are you alright?  ...Cause I've been feeling a little scared,"" it sounds like she's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love.  What an amazing song, ""Just tell me that you're okay.""  If this were the only song on the CD, it'd be worth it.

""Unsuffer Me"" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss.  Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it.  ""Anoint my head with your sweet kiss, my joy is dead; I long for bliss,"" she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone's electric guitar churns mercilessly.  Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity.  During my wife's last weeks, my daughter said to me, ""It's like watching a train wreck; you can't look away.""  There something of that strength that comes through in Williams' music.

Other cuts are also amazing.  ""Learning How to Live"" is a breakup song, adjusting to loss.  ""Fancy Funeral"" may sound a bit bizarre, but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed.  The sheer force of Lucinda's anger in ""Come On"" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed-breakup song, ""Dude, you're so fired; shut up, I'm not inspired.""  ""Words"" has Lucinda's voice, weathered, worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best, writing a good song.

Yes, Lucinda has an amazing catalog of recordings from ""Happy Woman Blues"" to the self-titled record to Car Wheels & World Without Tears.  ""West"" takes a well deserved place at the table as one of her most compelling, moving works.  Bravo!","On August 10 , 2005 Lucinda Williams played at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh ..

AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"This is an album about loss and survival. It's darker than some of Lucinda's other releases. It may not be for all Williams fans; it certainly is very different and more experimental than her last three albums. If you're uncertain about it the first time, give it a couple of other spins--it'll grow on you. The depth of emotion and Lucinda's raw vocals (meaning they weren't re-recorded--producer Hal Wilner used the demo vocal tracks as he loved the emotion in the performances) give this album an extra kick. I've seen some mixed reviews from fans here--I suspect this is an album that fans will probably come back to later and realize how good it is.

Clearly under the influence of later Dylan (perhaps ""Time Out of Mind""), the album features a nice mixture of midtempo numbers and killer ballads. Williams' voice which aches with longing and bitterness in many of these songs continues to be one of her strengths in addition to her top notch songwriting. She strikes reminds me somewhat of John Hiatt. ""Words"" has one of the sweetest melodies Williams has come up with the opening line sums up much of this album--""I would rather suffer in sweet silent solitude"". She may feel like she's in solitude but these moving, observant songs open up a world to music fans everywhere.

The music clips might be a bit deceptive. This is a moody, atmospheric album (even more so than her previous efforts). It also sounds even more personal than usual. The musicians that provide backing on the album including vets such as Jim Keltner give the album a distinctive sound. Producer Hal Willner does a great job of capturing the rich, distinctive qualities of Williams' voice.

This is one of Williams' finest albums holding its own with ""Lucinda Williams"", ""Sweet Old World"" and ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". Be aware, however, if you are a Williams fan that this is probably one of her more experimental albums and one of her most moody, atmospheric productions yet. Kudos to Hal Willner who convinced Williams to keep many of her raw, demo vocals for the album. What they may lack in polish they make up for in emotion.

BestBuy is currently offering an edition with a second disc featuring two demos for tracks on the main album. ""Where Is My Love"" and ""Rescue"" (both terrific songs). Personally, I'd love to hear some acoustic demos or performances of some of these songs vs. electric demos but that's me. Pick it up today!","This is an album about loss and survival ..

A26TWY9AD935HC,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5,"Lucinda Williams has made a career out of doing things her way.  Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be.  With the success of CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD, that relentless fight finally paid dividends as the commerce finally caught up with her art.  Rather than repeating CAR WHEELS formula over and over, Lucinda left behind the Southern travel logs and delved into more emotional material.  The songs on ESSENCE and WORLD WITHOUT TEARS not only dug into the deeper depths of her psyche, but also loosened up musically, mixing more rock and hard blues into her Americana palette.  WEST seems like a logical extension of the two previous albums emotionally, while moving into new territory musically.

Produced by veteran Hal Willner, WEST takes a quantum leap from her previous releases by taking arrangements far beyond where her previous music went.  Saving the vocals and guitar from demos, the songs are built up layer by layer with strings and keyboards and various session players including Jim Keltner and Bill Frisell to create music quite different from her past efforts.  The good news is that the production is not camouflage for weak material.  Williams has delivered a solid set of tunes, at times harrowing, as she pokes at he emotional scabs of broken relationships and the death of her mother.  I can see how this material will put some off, when they are looking for material closer to CAR WHEELS regional sketches.  Still, you cannot deny the solid songwriting on songs like WHERE IS MY LOVE, WORDS (a ode to her poetic muse) and ARE YOU ALRIGHT?  Other songs like UNSUFFER ME, RESCUE and the talking blues/rap of WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT move into new territory, to my ears at least, with great success.

I'm glad that there are artists like Lucinda Williams who choose to challenge themselves and their fans with each new output of work.  Those that take the ride with WEST will be rewarded with a CD of solid songs and performances that rank with the best of Lucinda's previous work.  WEST seems to me to be the end of a trilogy of work that includes her post CAR WHEELS work.  If you're not a big fan of the previous two albums, you'll more than likely be disappointed with this new one.  In that case there is always the back catalog to enjoy.  I'll be interested to see what new directions she chooses in the future, and will no doubt, continue to enjoy this CD for years to come.","Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be ..

A beautiful mid-tempo from Miss India. Arie. This is definitely in my top 2 favorite songs by her. In fact, if you were to ask me what song is better than this one from her first two albums and a few of the tracks from her third, I'd say this one takes the cake.

It just doesn't get more contemporary soul-ish than this. The runs and the deep notes are so amazing on this track. And it means that much more when you actually know like all the lyrics to the song!

Other songs with meaning recommended (all by India):

Nature (Acoustic Soul)
Slow Down (the remaining three are from her second album, Voyage To India)
Little Things &
The Truth.

""My Dick"" is nothing but pure crass comic genius. It doesn't sample the tracks of songs far greater than it, it doesn't labor to spin some BS thug life fable, nor does it try to be anything other than what it is. What it acomplishes is laying down old school rap with only one concern; busting out awesome rhymes, and doing so in fantastic comedic fashion. The only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is my aforementioned bias against rap in general.","Generally speaking , I have an extremely low opinion of the entire rap genera , but a small few pieces I give exception to ..

AB6O8EM172B74,B000W1QVYG,1,1,5,"As a guy who has been hurt by women (as we all have been!) - this song turns out to be a terrific release of some of the frustration and anger which a man may feel as a result of having been hurt, dumped, or somehow otherwise 'offended' by a member of the 'fairer' sex.

The lead singer, a man called Graham Bonnet, does an awesome job of getting the message, and 'feeling,' behind the Title (and lyrics) out to the listener.

The video inspired me to purchase this song, and, although my mood is not always angry, spiteful, or vengeful - I am usually able, upon 'demand,' to 'conjure up' the proper memories and female related pain and torment to completely, and thoroughly, enjoy this classic British rock song from the late 1970's!

You can't literally give 110% in anything that you do - the numbers will simply not allow it.  But (and you need to watch the video to fully understand appreciate where I am coming from here) in this case, with this song, and in this video, 110% is, in fact, given.

A1Q8TMHHMPQHO9,B000W1MEEC,1,1,5,"Lovely music!

This beautiful album was RECORDED on September 16 and 17 (not originally released as the data on the amazon claimed at the time I wrote this review)- Kenny Burrell, a True giant of mainstream and moderately modern jazz guitar really shines here in the illustrious company of Richard Davis on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.

Some of the songs are really swinging, some are beautifully sad, some are pretty darn modern, but the general feeling of the album would be - in my interpretation - warm. The cozy tone of the leader's guitar really enriches his fanciful solo flights as well as the numbers where the rest of the trio has a larger role.

Initially issued on LP in 1960, the album was re-released in 1966 under the title ""Man at Work"", with really beautiful photo by Don Brownstein reproduced inside the CD's package (the cover photo of Burrell, taken from the original edition, is by Chuck Stewart). Actually, my only problem with this lovely CD is that the original liner notes - printed twice, are too small even for a reasonably young fellow with a normal eye-sight... Keeping the cover art was smart, but the backside of LP is not visually interesting enough to compensate for too small letters.

If you like jazz-guitar or mainstream jazz, you should get this album, to hear fresh and convincing versions of various standards (f. i. Ellington-Strayhorn's ""Just a sittin' and a-rockin'"", Monk's ""Well, You Needn't"") as well as some less often performed songs.","Lovely music !.

A32T2H8150OJLU,B000W1SRR0,1,1,5,"Nina Persson's ""Black Winged Bird"" is lilting and soothing, romantic and bordering on melancholy.  The relaxing flow of this song makes it inherently listenable as foreground or background music.

I particularly like the fact that the song relies on Nina's vocal talents and not on overdone electronica or instrumental overkill.  The strings and other back-up instruments that complement Persson's voice are spot on.

While this song may not have the pop appeal or driving force it usually takes to gain major recognition, I've had this track on my iPod's playlist ever since it was made available at Amazon.com.

This song isn't what I'd cal mainstream country, folk, or even pop, but is an intruiging mixture of those genres.  I don't really like country that well, but I LIKE this song.

Thanks for a nice track Nina and Amazon!

Longtime fans call it their poppiest, and while it's definitely the mellowest, that doesn't mean that it's not noisy or self-indulgent for the mainstream. While the lyrics don't mean all that much, it adds up the eccentricness of the album, making it more fun with each listen. About the only other flaw with this album is that Lee Ranaldo doesn't sing on any tracks on this album.
""Bull in the Heather"" is a classic, as is its video with that Le Tigre girl cameoed in it. Kim has an excellent voice on it, as well as it being loved among the fans. The outro part sounds real cool.
Opener ""Winner's Blues"" is a real nice track, as it's an acoustic-like track, a brilliant track on this album.
I just love ""In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader"". It's a punk-like track here, probably the fastest one, and Thurston sounds as if he's having a lot of fun during the recording of it. Then it goes into ""Sweet Shine"" the only song with any real length on the album. It's a great love song.
She has some pretty interesting tracks as well. Her style overall has a sexy sound to it. ""Bone"" is very awesome, I love the energy of the drums on it, then the chords are well-progressed. It's just a real memorable one on this album. She sings 7 of the 14 songs.
'Experiental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' is something that really shines on track 12 ""Tokyo Eye"", a very noisy song. It's very awesome to listen to either in the car or on your stereo.
This one's good for introducing people to SY. I got this January of this year, and I think it's excellent. There are some flaws, but overall, I think it's pretty good.

A1ANRKHR4QWXJU,B000W1UOTY,1,-1,3,"This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto.","This CD is more than Rodrigo 's Concerto ..

A37ZKZP74PYAVY,B000W1SB94,1,1,5,"""Dry"" is P.J. Harvey's debut album, released in 1992 it was a critical success while it did modest on the commercial side of things. Harvey was a breath of fresh air to the industry and was that generation's Patti Smith. Her mixture of pounding riffs and raw vocals created one superb album, the multi-talented Harvey wasn't content with just singing she had to co-produce the album, play guitars and violin, and write all but two of the tracks (those two she co-wrote). There are standouts but the album is overall a solid effort and flows well.

The album starts with the simplistic ""Oh My Lover"", the track is simple yet effective and isn't an all-out assault on the ears. I really like the starkness in P.J.'s voice.
""O Stella"" seems a bit like a reprise of the previous track, though I do like this song better, it's shorter and does more musically, but that doesn't mean I hate ""Oh My Lover"".

Next up is ""Dress"", I like the repitition in the lyrics and the double bass part which is played to perfection. The song has a very syncopated feel, even though at times an irregular feel.
""Victory"" is another great track with a nice echo section in it and some nice guitar parts. The bass is great, the drums are probably stronger than ever since the start of the album.

""Happy And Bleeding"" sounded like it had elements of country and folk in it upon first listen and I still can hear little elements of it, though not as much now, it's another great track though a bit of variation in the riffs would've be nice.
""Sheela-Na-Gig"" is one of the best songs on the album and the most successfull single off the album, the structure of the song is perfect, especially the 'I'm gonna wash that man right of my hair...' bit. I like the chorus, it's really catchy.

""Hair"" keeps the same formula that has made the album what it is and doesn't interrupt the flow at all. All the basic things are here, good lyrics, catchy hooks and superb instrumenation.
""Joe"" is another short track that is set at a very fast tempo, it seems to be gone and over really quick. It's still a nice track though.

""Plants And Rags"" is the best song on the album and seems a bit out of place on the album, I love the way the strings are used and written. This song is without a doubt the most emotional album on the album and P.J. proves her voice's potential well on this track.

""Fountain"" starts off incredibly lo-fi and then breaks into the signature sound of the album. I like the contrast and how it makes the song a bit segmented. ""Water"" has been described as the 'lightest' track off the album, although it does seem a bit light, it still has that punch about it. Great vocals by P.J. again.

Overall, ""Dry"" is special, it retains it's rock-alternative sound while still displaying emotion and beauty. The two best tracks would have to be ""Plants And Rags"" & ""Sheela-Na-Gig"", simply because they well, standout. This album though is incredibly solid throughout and flows nicely making this an irresistable album by a True musical genius.",""" Dry "" is P.J.

Often proclaimed to be one of females rawest and toughest albums this album took me as a suprise it is nowhere near the desription I read. Dry may be perhaps PJ.
Less accesible efforts along with Is This Desire however it is an aquired taste and of course what kind of music you listen to. Less heavy and hard rocking and agressive as it's follow-up Rid Of Me. Dry has 7 fantastic songs Oh Stella, Victory, Happy And Bleeding, Sheela - Na - Gig, Hair, Plants and Rass and Water but the 4 other tracks are so forgettable. And also do to poor production the album which was obviously recorded in mono does not deliver the goods that it is supposed to deliver. It is sometimes disturbing and heavy but it doesn't exactly kick your butt because it is so hidden. It also laks in great hooks and brilliant guitar riffs like her other albums.
However PJ. Harvey's Dry has indeed something special about it and lyrically it is very good much better then Rid Of Me but musically it is less compelling and challenging then any of her other albums but it is her debut and if this had only included these 7 songs it would have been an artistic triumph and something that polly jean would be proud of all her life.","The Album Dry was released on an indie label and the budget was just around 5 thousand dollars ..

A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000W1W96K,1,1,4,"After Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown's biggest female stars.  But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition.  Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session.  The song, ""I'll Have to Let Him Go,"" which is not included in this collection, was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas.  The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes, although the lineup changed over the years; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites, Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese).  The group's second single ""Come and Get These Memories"" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way.  Other Top 5 hits included ""Dancing in the Street,"" """"Nowhere to Run,"" ""Jimmy Mack,"" ""I'm Ready for Love,"" ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,"" and ""Honey Chile.""  These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968, when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip.  The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown, Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 1995.  This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group's hits, but is limited to only 11 cuts.  Consequently, while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy.","After Diana Ross and the Supremes , Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown 's biggest female stars ..

Other Top 5 hits included "" Dancing in the Street , "" "" "" Nowhere to Run , "" "" Jimmy Mack , "" "" I 'm Ready for Love , "" "" ( Love Is Like A ) Heat Wave , "" and "" Honey Chile . "". These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968 , when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip .. The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown , Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame , Class of 1995 .. This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group 's hits , but is limited to only 11 cuts .. Consequently , while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy ."

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000W20FY2,1,1,5,"Now I have a feeling that following the disappointing reception of his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steve-Winwood/dp/B001GHSFMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steve Winwood</a>&nbsp;three years earlier that some refinements had to be made in order for Winwood to become as commercially successful as he was creatively so. One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic/harmonic instincts he might've developed during his Traffic period. Also he might've also had the sense that,although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi,that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall. And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings. The result was this album-one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist.

  ""While You See A Chance"" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for. With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction? This is essentially an electronic/new wave re-imagining of the uptempo gospel/soul he started doing from the outset. The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder-like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number. ""Second Hand Human"" is a hugely melodic,chiming synthesizer heavy pop/pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album. Starting off as a melodic,folksy ballad ""Slowdown Sundown"" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains. ""Spanish Dancer"" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody. ""Night Train"" is a sleekly electronic jazz/funk jam while the dynamic ballad ""Dust concludes the album.

  To my way of thinking? Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose. Winwood didn't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out. He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco/new wave synthesizer touches. And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive. He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them. I include Prince and Stevie Wonder in with that too. Although this album does have its detractors for that very reason among some of the less tolerant followers of the ""keeping it real"" music critic brigade? It would be very difficult to debate how much this album successfully extended on what was started on Winwood's commercially failed debut album and actually began an entirely new and fruitful career for him as a solo artist with a lot to say.","Now I have a feeling that following the disappointing reception of his debut album&nbsp;<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Steve - Winwood / dp / B001GHSFMQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Steve Winwood</a>&nbsp;three years earlier that some refinements had to be made in order for Winwood to become as commercially successful as he was creatively so ..

A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000W20FY2,1,1,5,"During my MTV days, Steve Winwood's big 80's splash with songs from Back In The High Life didn't go unnoticed by me.  After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat ""While You See A Chance.""  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.  I find myself enjoying this song more than ""Higher Love.""

The title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  ""Spanish Dancer"" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called ""lazy music"" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.  This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life.

I wonder why ""Second-Hand Woman"" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being ""a slot machine to take my dime"" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds True for the near eight minute on-the-run opus ""Night Train"" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.

Two non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are ""Slowdown Sundown.""  A wistful ballad, calling wine that ""glassful of memories""  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track ""Dust"" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, ""a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing,"" meaning time, ""the universal healer.""  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote ""the sands of time wash us all clean.""

Mellow, but not ""lazy music"" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads.","During my MTV days , Steve Winwood 's big 80 's splash with songs from Back In The High Life did n't go unnoticed by me .. After discovering that album and Chronicles , I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver , which I copied .. My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat "" While You See A Chance . "". Winwood 's sweeping organ - like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit - it reached # 7 in 1981 - along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio - friendly beat , with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing .. I find myself enjoying this song more than "" Higher Love .. "" 

 The title track reached # 48 on the singles chart , a slower midpaced affair .. "" Spanish Dancer "" along the same languid lines , may be an example of what many called "" lazy music "" to describe Winwood 's early solo stuff .. This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life .. I wonder why "" Second - Hand Woman "" was n't a chart - topper , as it 's a more lively affair with Winwood 's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat .. Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being "" a slot machine to take my dime "" but it is quite the danceable track .. The same holds True for the near eight minute on - the - run opus "" Night Train "" with its funky beats mixed with guitars , particularly a solo around the six minute mark , and the usual keyboards .. A single mix of this could 've done well , but alas .. Two non - singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs .. A wistful ballad , calling wine that "" glassful of memories ""   and something to soothe the balm of yesterday 's pain .. The tempo goes up during the bridge , which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life .. The closing track "" Dust "" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away , in this case meaning time with a woman , yet how to deal with a love that 's gone , but a friendship that still remains ?. Indeed , "" a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing , "" meaning time , "" the universal healer . "". That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote "" the sands of time wash us all clean .. "" 

 Mellow , but not "" lazy music "" as was described by some , Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic .. Considering the turn - of - the - decade changes going on in the music scene , i.e. punk and new wave , it 's fortunate that Arc found an audience .. And Winwood played all the instruments on the album , much like Prince had done his own debut For You .. Despite having only seven songs , Arc benefits from a consistent synth - keyboard style , upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads ."
A10XJR7CWHNKWU,B000W20FY2,1,1,4,"Steve Winwood's second solo album, 1980's ""Arc Of A Diver,"" remains one of his most popular releases, and it is indeed an excellent album. Winwood produced it, co-wrote all the songs, and plays all of the instruments himself. And, of course, he sings with that marvelous Ray Charles-ish voice. The album is a keyboard-heavy platter of pop, and it's all good. The catchy ""While You See A Chance"" was a big #2 hit for Steve on the U.S. singles chart, but there are also other goodies including the atmospheric title song, the breezy ""Second Hand Woman,"" the great grooves of ""Spanish Dancer,"" and the up-tempo funk-pop of ""Night Train"" (featuring some fine electric guitar from Winwood). Steve also slows things down a bit for the cool mellowness of ""Slowdown Sundown"" and ""Dust."" ""Arc Of A Diver"" is a great Steve Winwood album.","Steve Winwood 's second solo album , 1980 's "" Arc Of A Diver , "" remains one of his most popular releases , and it is indeed an excellent album ..

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000W20FY2,-1,-1,3,"I have several Steve Winwood CDs, which admiddetly I don't play much anymore. But when I recently saw this CD in a second-hand store cheap I couldn't resist. I mean, I used to LOVE this album when it originally came out in 1980. I played it over and over in those days.
""Arc of a Diver"" (7 tracks, 40 min.) contains the hits ""While You See a Chance"" and ""Second-Hand Woman"", and the title track is well known too, but it all sounds a bit... 80s synth-lite now. The only track that really remains a stand-out now is the brooding, grooving ""Night Train"".
This album set the stage for the commercial blockbusters ""Back in the High Life"" and ""Roll With It"". With the hind-sight of 20 years or so, it is strangely clear to me that Steve Winwood's solo output simply hasn't aged well. It was exciting music then, but isn't now, sorry.","I have several Steve Winwood CDs , which admiddetly I do n't play much anymore ..

A2HWD9PTM7RBXN,B000W20FY2,1,-1,2,"My title is kind of blunt isn't it?  However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies.
The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.
After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.
Dear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment.","My title is kind of blunt is n't it ?.

Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W21FZU,1,1,4,"If there is honestly one thing that I do adore about Sting, is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own. He has been doing it for 30 years on his own, and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police. I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock. But when he has a song come out, people will really listen to him, most of the time. When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999, many people weren't very eager at listening to the album at first, after the title track was released. However when Desert Rose was released as a single, many people really flocked over to the album. Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90's. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold. This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan.

Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting 's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work .. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90 's .. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold .. This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan ."

A2IK776FY6MEMG,B000W21ER4,1,1,5,"I'm in a Weezer mood today. I'm listening to their entire catalog this afternoon and it's not getting old.

I was in high school when these guys rocked the world with 'Buddy Holly'. It meant nothing to me at the time though. Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90's (You know, the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE's thing. I didn't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth. I was just super lame.)

Looking back on it now, after having enjoyed Weezer for the last decade or so, they really are amazing. They have a distinctive sound that's very alternative but also very much their own. It's also not a hard sound. I find their instrumentals to be soothing ear candy.

And it's not an accident that 'Buddy Holly' is the song everyone remembers form the blue album. It's the best song on the album. Yeah it's the one with the most radio play, but that's because it's awesome. 'Susanne' is a close second, mainly because it reminds me of the closing credits to Mallrats.

It's not available via the Prime streaming option. If you're buying the album, the Deluxe version is the only way to go. Don't get just the basic version.","I 'm listening to their entire catalog this afternoon and it 's not getting old .. I was in high school when these guys rocked the world with ' Buddy Holly ' .. It meant nothing to me at the time though .. Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90 's ( You know , the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE 's thing .. I did n't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth .. I was just super lame . ). Looking back on it now , after having enjoyed Weezer for the last decade or so , they really are amazing .. They have a distinctive sound that 's very alternative but also very much their own .. It 's also not a hard sound .. I find their instrumentals to be soothing ear candy .. And it 's not an accident that ' Buddy Holly ' is the song everyone remembers form the blue album .. It 's the best song on the album .. Yeah it 's the one with the most radio play , but that 's because it 's awesome .. ' Susanne ' is a close second , mainly because it reminds me of the closing credits to Mallrats .. ( Which I loved in the 90 's but had no idea it was Weezer sining .. I told you I was lame . ).

The album is amazing, certainly reminds me of grade school and staying up late during sleep overs jamming this on cassette.

Years later, they release it on vinyl, and suddenly I am re-experiencing it for the very first time, with subtle imperfections and a more pronounced acoustic range.  If you have high end headphones, you will enjoy this.","Beautiful , there is really nothing I could say about this recording that is in negative spotlight ..

A25KDGSE2EVYXY,B000W21ER4,-1,1,4,"This is Weezer's first ever album, and I think it's pretty good. I think Raditude might be my first favorite. I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin' tune to listen to, but it's not quite hard-rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.

""My Name is Jonas"" might be a song about the singer's brother, since the actual singer's name is Rivers. A punk rock song with a light guitar intro. The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first.

The Amazon sample for ""No One Else"" says ""My girl's got eyeballs,"" but the whole line is ""My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head."" The music is fun, catchy, and a little simple.

""The World Has Turned And Left Me Here"" is so Weezer-y, you can almost immediately tell who sang it if you hear it for the first time on the radio. I would've given it a 5/5, but it kind of got old after a while.

""Buddy Holly"" is Awesome! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly? Kinda, kinda not.

Next comes ""Undone"", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.

""Surf Wax America"" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.

Next comes ""Say It Ain't So"". This one has everything that a Weezer fan would like; Pretty good lyrics, rockin' chorus, guitar solo, and it's really catchy. Say it IS so!

Somebody said that ""In The Garage"" this one is an anthem for nerds/ rock 'n' roll lovers, and I might have to agree. It's my favorite song on the album. I like the intro because it sounds so different from the rest of the song. [Is that a bagpipe?]

""Holiday"" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure. Yes, it has a middle section, but much louder and better than the one SWA had.

""Only in Dreams"" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5/10]

Now for the bonus tracks:

For ""Mykel and Carley"", I'm not so sure who Mykel and Carley are, but the song was great! It had a guitar intro that reminded me of the intro for My Name is Jonas. Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band's newest album, Death to False Metal.

""Jamie"" is Just boring. Enough said.

However, ""Susanne"" is Another great hit from Weezer!]

Finally, we have ""PaperFace"". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it.","This is Weezer 's first ever album , and I think it 's pretty good .. I think Raditude might be my first favorite ..

A19I5KZQM3CA6W,B000W21ER4,1,-1,1,"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?

To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.

After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.

On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.

A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):

I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.

If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as ""You're just jealous!"" or ""I'd like to see you do better!"" or ""How is it in your parents' basement?"" or ""You must jerk off to your computer!"" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:

""Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!""

FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.

To those of you who would call me ""pretentious"" or ""music snob"" or ""self-righteous"" or ""self-absorbed,"" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is ""simple,"" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:

""Devil's Night Out"" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" by The Sex Pistols
""The Essential Heart"" by Heart
""Highway To Hell"" by AC/DC
""Meat Is Murder"" by The Smiths
""The Strange Case Of..."" by Halestorm
""Greatest Hits"" by Tom Petty
""Complete Greatest Hits"" by The Cars
""Ugly"" by Life of Agony
""Remain In Light"" by Talking Heads

As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!

I also wish to point out that arguments such as ""Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!"" or ""You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!"" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)","I can remember owning this album when I was in high school , so even though I now can not stand Weezer in the least bit ( now being 26 ) , it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time ..

AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000W21ER4,1,1,5,"Weezer's infamous self-titled debut (otherwise known as ""The Blue Album"") is one of the few pieces of music from it's time that still holds up just as well today. When they made their mark in 1994, Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling, uninspiring grunge clones. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate, they did, however, create a quite perfect debut, one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today, but Weezer remain vital, and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple. You can't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who, whether they realize it or not, knows a good Weezer tune. So, it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release, a Deluxe Edition made it's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b-sides, outtakes, demos, live songs etc. The question is, is it worth buying again?

The answer? A resounding yes. For starters, I'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it, what better time to get yourself another copy. And even if it's still in perfect condition, the bonus material is worth it alone, for the Weezer fanatic. I don't have to tell you how good the original album is. You've heard it, you know. It's perfect, front to back. The material on the second disc, while admittedly not as good as the album itself, is still worthy. Take, for example, Rivers' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub, ""Mykel and Carli"" (who passed away in a tragic car accident), with it's chorus that, in typical Weezer fashion, sticks in your head for the rest of your life. ""Suzanne"" and ""Jamie"" are probably the most well-known b-sides among Weezer fans, while a trio of demos -- referred to as ""The Kitchen Tapes"" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history. There are also live songs (""My Name Is Jonas"" & ""Surf Wax America"") and acoustic versions (""Jamie"" and ""No One Else""), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of ""Say It Ain't So"" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album). Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics (finally) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer. The package is very well done, and surely outshines the bare-bones nature of the original release.

Overall, a good album just got even better. Despite it's price tag, the average Weezer fan just should not be without this. It might make you love the band even more. You definitely get your money's worth. And as I said before, the original album itself is just classic. Say what you will about Weezer's newer material, but this stuff just can't be beat. They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty. I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album, an accomplishment a lot of musicians cannot acheive.","Weezer 's infamous self - titled debut ( otherwise known as "" The Blue Album "" ) is one of the few pieces of music from it 's time that still holds up just as well today .. When they made their mark in 1994 , Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling , uninspiring grunge clones .. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate , they did , however , create a quite perfect debut , one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today .. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today , but Weezer remain vital , and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple .. You ca n't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who , whether they realize it or not , knows a good Weezer tune ..

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000W21ER4,1,1,5,"It's kind of hard to expound on Weezer's classic debut. In the aftermath of grunge and the death of Kurt Cobain, along came four noisy geeks who made the world safe for noisy hook laden songs about loudmouthed girlfriends (""No One Else""), the joys of high-school love (""Buddy Holly"") and a great metaphor about an unraveling relationship (""Undone - The Sweater Song""). Along with seven other great songs, this was a first album that yielded some perennial material, and founded the cult that Rivers Coumo rides today.
So why should you pony up the extra dough for the ""expanded"" edition? Is the second disc really worth it? For a change, the answer is yes. You get four great live tracks, complete with some funny self depreciating comments, one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer (""Jamie""), and a handful of demos. The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled ""My Evaline"" that highlights Weezer's uncanny harmony abilities, something occasionally lost in the din.
If you're reading this, you're probably already inclined towards buying this. Go ahead. Maybe we'll get lucky and ""Pinkerton"" will get the same royal treatment.","It 's kind of hard to expound on Weezer 's classic debut ..

A2VHYWSV7ZLZOV,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5,"Ah, the Supreme Warbler!  She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical.  Were they parody?  Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil and spat them out when they were spent?  There were, after all, musical satirists like Anna Russell and much later, The Bonzo Dog Band and Monty Python, who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits, and made pots of money doing it, too.  But they knew exactly what they were doing.  What about Mrs. Miller?

Jonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller, but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller.  The former act was, in case some readers don't know it already, a gifted piano player/bandleader Paul Weston, and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer's singer, Jo Stafford.  She eventually became Weston's wife.  They were best known as themselves, but forged a separate career in musical parody.  What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing isn't easy, and Jo did it by singing sharp.  Try it.  It's harder than singing flat; believe me (and sounds even more horrible).  Now, you may be asking, what do Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have to do with Mrs. Miller?  For me, it's personal, but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people.

I tried to introduce a foreign-born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene.  He would have none of it.  He said, ""she's doing that deliberately; that's not funny.""  You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller.  In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny, and Mrs. Miller roll-on-the-floor hysterical, I got an unexpected response.  No, he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you, and maybe even some songs you hate.  Somehow, she's innocent, charming, and yes, very, very funny.  Whatever the True story, and you'll read of several in these Amazon reviews, what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures.  She may or may not have been exploited, or she may have exploited herself, but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal.

Just listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming.  How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time?  And face it, who's gonna take ""Sweet Pea,"" ""Catch A Falling Star"" and ""I've Got A Tiger By the Tail"" seriously, anyway?  This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting.  And her ""Boots?""  Sorry, Nancy, Mrs. Miller's is The Definitive Version.

My one, small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of ""Up, Up And Away.""  Talk about Definitive! (If you're a Mrs. Miller fan already, and haven't heard ""Up, Up and Away,"" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity). But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in ""Lover's Concerto.""  She NAILS it!  And people said she couldn't sing!

I think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task, both musically, and as comedians, but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof, enjoyed it, made some money, and did it with purpose; you can even hear them winking in their recordings.  I do think they are funny, but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny.  My coworker was right about one thing:  Mrs. Miller was Grandma.  And you might laugh WITH her and even AT her when her back was turned, but never would you sneer at her face to face.  No, you want to give her a hug, because somehow these crazy, one-of-a-kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer.  I completely disagree with those who say that laughing at Mrs. Miller's music is cruel.  I think Mrs. Miller might have understood, had she lived to witness her digital revival, that she had created something entertaining and unique, even if it wasn't taken as she had intended.  Nothing to be ashamed of there, and if her life was in some ways tragic, its legacy is not the least bit sad.","Ah , the Supreme Warbler !.

She was Mrs. Miller, who sang with a quasi-operatic soprano.  She mostly recorded cover versions of recent pop hits.  She often went off-pitch, and sometimes she fell behind (or got ahead of) the beat.  She sang with more vibrato than Tiny Tim, and occasionally she would perform bird whistles.  Of course, the whole thing was a joke by the record company.  It's pretty funny, although it wears a bit thin after a while.  I don't think too many people can take 21 songs by Mrs. Miller!

A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5,"Elva Ruby Connes Miller was truly one of the most amazing voices of the twentieth century. That isn't to say that she has a great voice, or even a good voice, for that matter. What she has is an amazing penchant for an off-key vibrato intensive warbling that makes her second only to Florence Foster Jenkins for most hilarious soprano of the last century. Miller was a fixture in local community theater and amateur productions, and at one point even took her talent to Vietnam to entertain the troops. I am sure they were very entertained. Truly this woman had a heart of gold, even if she had a tongue of lead.

This compilation is stunning in its breadth. The treatment she gives to these songs cannot even be imagined until heard for oneself. She covers a variety of styles, with a heavy concentration of 1960s sugar-pop like ""Monday, Monday"", ""Let's Hang On"", and ""Yellow Submarine"". (Yes, it's True that Ringo sings substantially better than Mrs. Miller.) Particularly entertaining is the truly dreadful altered lyric masterpiece ""Queen of the House."" I can't imagine having been a supporting musician or recording technician that had to sit through multiple takes of these masterworks.

Listening to this CD is delightfully awful, and I recommend the experience highly to any audiophile who thinks they have heard it all.

Rock on, Mrs. Miller!","Elva Ruby Connes Miller was truly one of the most amazing voices of the twentieth century .. That is n't to say that she has a great voice , or even a good voice , for that matter .. What she has is an amazing penchant for an off - key vibrato intensive warbling that makes her second only to Florence Foster Jenkins for most hilarious soprano of the last century .. Miller was a fixture in local community theater and amateur productions , and at one point even took her talent to Vietnam to entertain the troops .. I am sure they were very entertained .. Truly this woman had a heart of gold , even if she had a tongue of lead .. This compilation is stunning in its breadth .. The treatment she gives to these songs can not even be imagined until heard for oneself .. She covers a variety of styles , with a heavy concentration of 1960s sugar - pop like "" Monday , Monday "" , "" Let 's Hang On "" , and "" Yellow Submarine "" .. ( Yes , it 's True that Ringo sings substantially better than Mrs. Miller . ). Particularly entertaining is the truly dreadful altered lyric masterpiece "" Queen of the House . "".

This is what I gather, anyway, as her 15 minutes of fame was already up several years before I was born.  I was introduced to this phenomenom as a young child, as my parents had a copy of this floating around that they'd received as a Christmas gag gift from some friends circa late 60s.  Always rearing it's bed-haired head around the holidays, when the whole family gathered around the stereo for a good laugh.  Funniest selections are:  the frightening ""Monday, Monday"", Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Are Made for Walking,"" as well as dad's ""Stranger's in the Night"" (dooooo-beee-dooooo-beeeee-dooooooooo!!)  and the all time Mrs. Miller classic ""Downtown"", complete with out of time vocals and ear-piercing bird whistles.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000WCZW7M,1,-1,3,"The past few years have really brought out anew for pop star Amy Grant. She had moved back into her Christian roots well with her core audience, but unfortunate, she hasn't been able to click with newer music buyers. Since her A&M catalog was recently moved over to EMI, on her label Sparrow. While so many acts have done well with a new label in catalog sales, Amy still has a long way to return to the success she had a long time ago. A few years ago, it was well said with her previous hits package Greatest Hits 1986-2004 which did very well with the actual appeal. Now that she has another hits package, does Amy Grant really have the appeal she once conquered with record buyers?

Amy Grant's 2007 Greatest Hits mixes in a bit of the old and the new that Amy had delivered well from her 90's pop mix, to her contemporary mixes of soul and Christian music. The songs have been remastered nicely, and tries to deliver nicely as a re-introduction to Amy to a whole new audience. The collection includes some of her great gems like Every Heartbeat and Baby Baby, to her contemporary Christian classics like Lead Me On and Father's Eyes. While the collection works fairly well for new fans, it misses a few great songs from her pop era that worked better from her previous hits package. The collection overlooks a few great tracks like The Next Time I Fall, her often overlooked duet with former Chicago singer Peter Cetera, as well as The Things We Do For Love, which she did for the Ellen Degeneres film Mr. Wrong, and her delightful cover of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi from House Of Love, which had a very colorful video, and a better beat than when Joni recorded it years ago.

All in all, Amy Grant's Greatest Hits isn't a bad collection though, but it just doesn't deliver like the A&M days really did, or her previous Greatest Hits 1986-2004 album, which unfortunately is no longer in print. Hopefully, there could be a better hits collection that could attract Amy's great pop days like that one did, but this one could've had more to be desired, and that makes it a missed heartbeat.

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000WCZW7M,-1,1,5,"With three decades of music under her belt, Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections.  And while they are both great, there was no place to find a sample of her entire career.  Until now.

This disc is an attempt to collect the hits from Amy's entire career, and it does a remarkable good job.  With just nineteen songs, it hits all the highlights.  It includes ""Simple Things,"" the title track from her last major studio release and ""Old Man's Rubble"" from her self title debut.  In fact, it includes at least one song from each of her major studio releases (not counting the hymns projects or the Christmas releases) except for her third, ""Never Alone.""  Heck, it even includes ""Stay for Awhile.""  That song originated on Collection and went on to become a hit in its own right.

And there are plenty of classics here, from ""Baby Baby"" and ""Saved by Love"" to ""Thy Word,"" ""El Shaddai,"" and ""Father's Eyes.""

Having said that, there are some drawbacks.  Fans who already own all her releases will find absolutely nothing new here.  All nineteen tracks have been previous released.  While they have been digitally remastered to sound better, I must admit I don't notice the difference.  Of course, when you are getting almost an hour and twenty minutes of music, this is being picky.

An equally picky point is the over representation of ""Heart in Motion.""  I know it was her biggest release by far.  But it gets five tracks, which is about a quarter of the disc space.  And, to be honest, it's not my favorite of her releases.  Seems like one or two could have been cut to include a song from somewhere else.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"" didn't make the cut.  That would have been a good switch.

Finally, there's the timing.  Amy's last two releases have been a greatest hits and a live disc.  I know she just changed record labels, but I would have preferred to see this after another studio release.

In reality, these are all minor quibbles.  Any fan of Amy's music will find lots of memories in these nineteen songs and be glad to have them all in one place.","With three decades of music under her belt , Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections ..

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000WGRNA2,1,1,5,"This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits. In Europe, an expanded 13-track collection was released adding the other three but this version is long out of print. So this album, apart from being a high quality original album, also served as hits volume 2 until the more comprehensive Definitive Collection was released.

The one track that made it onto the American hits collection is Where've you been, which has become Kathy's signature song. However, in this particular song it is the lyrics that people seem to love - they relate to the sentiments expressed. The other hits were all upbeat, catchy songs - Come from the heart, Burning old memories and She came from Fort Worth Texas.

Of the other songs, my favorite is Hills of Alabam. No surprise, really, as this was written and originally recorded by my favorite bluegrass singer, Claire Lynch, who adds backing vocals. Claire's own version can be found on an untitled album by the Front porch string band, of which she was lead singer. The title track is also excellent, as are Here's hoping, True north, Love chooses you and I'll take care of you.

While I slightly prefer her two previous albums (Walk the way the wind blows, Untasted honey), there isn't much to choose between the three and those two are better represented on that hits collection. So if you already have that, this should be the next Kathy Mattea album on your shopping list.","This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits ..

A8SCX6VUTE05H,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5,"CooleyHighHarmony is a classic album that has yet to be topped by any of these so-called R&B artists that are out now. Boyz II Men put Philly on the map as well as laid themselves a strong foundation in R&B with that album. There was only one way they could have went after Cooleyhighharmony: up. And they did with this superb sophomore release.

There are too many tracks that are vintage Boyz II Men tracks. Thank You, All Around The World, Vibin and U Know are excellent tracks the the Philly quartet. I'll Make Love To You and On Bended Knee were on Blender(cheap knockoff of Rolling Stone) and Vh1 as awesomely bad songs countdown but those love ballads are classics so the hell with Blender and VH1! These are the songs that these immature little freaks were conceived to and they have the nerve to trash it but never once do they mention any Eminem, D12 or any Shady records artists as well as Justin Timberlake. Are they trying to say that none of these artists make awesomely bad records? Really? I find that type of favoritism questionable. Plus forms of media like Vh1, Blender and GQ only appeal to idiotic trendies that think that saying ""Meh"" at the beginning of every sentence and defending movies that stink to high heaven makes them hip.

50 Candles, Water Runs Dry, Trying Times and Yesterday are more smooth R&B ballads that give this album a much needed boost. There are no bad songs on this album so I'll keep going on.

Bottom Line: Boyz II Men's II is the best sophomore album from an R&B quartet of all time. The ballads are exceptional and the fast songs aren't bad plus the group still has what most groups R&B groups now sorely lack: harmony. If you love 90s R&B in its purest form you cant go wrong with this sophomore effort by Boyz II Men.

AYOO12C9Y2T95,B000WKT6B2,1,1,4,"Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to ""Cooleyhighharmony"", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group.

HIGHLIGHTS:

This album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before ""Khalil"") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half.

Part 1 has ""Thank You"" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. ""Vibin'"" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'/dancin' the night away/Groovin'/Vibin'/non-stop until the break of day). ""I Sit Away"" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and ""Nobody Knows""..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)

In the ""slow side"", Babyface's ""I'll Make Love to you"" set a record for the length of time at #1. ""On Bended Knee"" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and ""Water Runs Dry"" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic ""Yesterday"" and they pull off the True feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.

LOWS:

""All Around the World"" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's ""Travelin' Man"" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, ""Khalil"" is a pretty blah track. ""Jezzebel"" is a dull overlong affair. ""50 Candles"" includes the lyric ""Holding your body like a plastic molding""....'nuff said.

BOTTOM LINE:

There are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like ""I Sit By"" and ""Yesterday"" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans.","Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups ( Temps and Tops ) with more up - to - date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip - hop stylings ..

"" On Bended Knee "" ( from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis ) and "" Water Runs Dry "" ( another Babyface composition ) also made some chart action .. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic "" Yesterday "" and they pull off the True feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic .. It 's a wonderful rendition .. LOWS : 

 "" All Around the World "" is Boyz II Men 's rewrite of Ricky Nelson 's "" Travelin ' Man "" more or less , but not nearly as memorable .. Considering how pivotal it is to the album , "" Khalil "" is a pretty blah track .. "" Jezzebel "" is a dull overlong affair .. "" 50 Candles "" includes the lyric "" Holding your body like a plastic molding"" .... 'nuff said .. BOTTOM LINE : 

 There are enough hits to make this a mini - greatest hits all by itself , but the extras like "" I Sit By "" and "" Yesterday "" make this one worth owning .. Recommended for R&B fans ."
A2LNEZD3YBO12O,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5,"Boyz II Men were at their best with this album!  Excellent songs with I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, Water Runs Dry and some others.  They tear it up on the funky songs of the first half such as Vibin', I Sit Away, Thank You, Jezabel, and All Around The World. Loved their remake of the Beatles' Yesterday. This is an album that gave them many awards and multiplatinum success for the music and the harmonies alone.  And people like Babyface, Jam and Lewis, Brian McKnight and others produced some fabulous stuff here! A dynamic R&B effort with pop leanings that still holds up 10 years later!","Boyz II Men were at their best with this album !.

ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5,"This CD is a throwback to my youth.  I was about twelve years old when it came out--back when Boyz 2 Men was truly  a hot commodity.  They have a wonderful ""old school"" flavor reminiscent of the old doowop guy groups of 1960s.  This is especially evident in the four part harmonies, the smooth and romantic lyrics and the original interpretations of old standards (""Yesterday"").

Where do I begin to describe the mood of this wonderful and innovative R&B album?  There is something for everyone on this CD.  We have the funky, catchy ""Thank You"" that samples from ""La-Di-Da-Di"" performed by Doug E. Fresh.  The hook is infectious!  We have ""All Around the World"" to get you up and dancing, no doubt.  One of my personal favorites is ""I Sit Away,"" written by Tony Rich (of the Tony Rich Project fame).  It has a haunting hook and a beautiful, introspective feel.  Truly an ode to solitude.  There are also a couple of songs on this album that became huge hits for the fellas back in the early 1990s.  They include ""I'll Make Love to You"" (on those songs to get you in the mood), and ""Water Runs Dry.""

One of the strongest points of this album is the luscious arrangements and fine tuning of production on each of the cuts.  Even my least favorite of the songs--""50 Candles""--has a very sexy, clean and catchy arrangment.

Check this out!  And all of you young ones out there, don't write the Boyz as just another R&B band from the 1990s.  They were truly in a class by themselves.","I was about twelve years old when it came out -- back when Boyz 2 Men was truly   a hot commodity ..

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000WKT6B2,1,-1,3,"For the music of 1994, the scene changed immediately, from Grunge to Hip Hop. In the case for Boyz II Men, they became even more popular then the boys from Philadelphia. At that time, they became bigger than most of the manufactured music out there. Although they started big, the ballads they were making were explosive.
The 1994 album, II became the most successful R&B album of the decade, selling almost 14 million albums, and launching 4 smash hit songs including Water Runs Dry, I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, and Thank You. At that time, they really proved that the music spoke for itself, not an image among all boundaries. The style blended beautifully with similar artists like The Temptations, The Four Tops, and even The Jackson 5. Nevertheless, they actually were at the very beginning of the Corporate Pop era that lead to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. Luckily, the music wasn't locked into Teen Idol stardom, which made Boyz II Men one of the most popular groups of the 90's.
It is kind of sad that a lot of teen acts that are out there aren't mature enough like Boyz II Men. It is just incredible to know that some acts constantly can't capture that era. Hopefully, the next True Soul group, can recapture the legacy Boyz II Men set.","For the music of 1994 , the scene changed immediately , from Grunge to Hip Hop ..

A2BO41VARYGTAC,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5,"Ok...here I go...I have to comment on the review of ""A lover of Mew"" (poor Mew), from July 22, 2000. He compares the Boyz as being on a par with Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Sade, and Kenny G. Oh come on, the first 3, of course not, they are completely different, and terrific in their own genres...but Kenny G, DOH! I think the Boyz would give up singing if they ever heard that one. Comparing Boyz 2 Men to Kenny G is like comparing silk to polyester, prime rib to hamburger, Belgian chocolates to dog chocolates and champagne to grape juice. Come on Mew! Hey, maybe there's a reason why, in your ""About Me"" section, you give yourself the nickname of ""The Jerk"".
Ok, now I have that out, I shall get back to the album. These guys are a talented foursome from Philly. Their vocal harmonies are of the best Motown tradition, but given a modern touch and are second to none. ""I'll make love to you"" is one of the most romantic songs ever, but we've come to expect great songs like that from Babyface. The Boyz also wrote quite a few of their own songs that are featured on this album,  which further showcases their talents. This album is a must for all R&B fans.","Ok ... here I go ...

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000WLICZC,1,1,5,"Strange enough, you don't hear many songs on rock radio, that actually know how to rock.

Nope, this song isn't afraid to let out a yell or two, or three, but their not screaming through the whole song either. Nope, it's a perfect blend sure to please a real rock radio listener.

The verses work very nicely, and keep the song moving toward the main show of the chorus. And the chorus really rocks. Sure, it might be a little too familiar for rock radio in its short burst of the 1st round, but it saves all its energy for the rest of the song, when it brings the house down with its catchy and infectious energy that sounds right out of the 90's.

Overall, with its loaded gun of energy, and familiar, but still rockin' elements driving it, if you listen to rock radio, you're going to love it. This song really took me back to that 90's alt rock movement with bands like Collective Soul and Nirvana, and ""Psycho"" certainly does the greats justice.","Strange enough , you do n't hear many songs on rock radio , that actually know how to rock ..

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000WLIE7I,1,1,5,"The album picks up George's career where the boxed set (Strait out of the box) ends, so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998. It shows that George's style was evolving but still firmly rooted in traditional country music.

The album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album, the first (The best day) being an excellent ballad. The second song (Murder on music row) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle, a bluegrass performer. Here, George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson. George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet, George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song. While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place, they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days.

The remaining tracks are taken from just four albums, these being Lead on (Adalida, Lead on, You can't make a heart love somebody), Blue clear sky (the title track, Carried away, I can still make it to Cheyenne, King of the mountain), Carrying your love with me (the title track, Round about way, One night at a time, Today my word slipped away) and One step at a time (True, We really shouldn't be doing this). Of these songs, Today my world slipped away is a cover of a Vern Gosdin country hit but the others (as far as I know) are original songs.

Picking out highlights in such a strong collection is difficult, but I'll nominate Murder on Music Row, Adalida, Blue clear sky and King of the mountain. If you are new to George's music, this compilation makes a great introduction.","The album picks up George 's career where the boxed set ( Strait out of the box ) ends , so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998 ..

A1ALPL858XSDE,B000WLIE7I,1,1,4,"Hallelujah!  George Strait and MCA have finally released a single-disc collection of hits that isn't skimpy!  Unlike Strait's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks, of which two are new recordings.  Specifically, it picks up where the multi-disc retrospective Strait Out Of  The Box leaves off, with the old hits culled from Strait's 1994 through  1998 albums.
 While more extensive, this anthology is far from  perfect however.  ""Lead On"" and ""King Of The Mountain"" (the latter barely  scraped into the top 20) drag along unmelodically and are slower than  molasses.  Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits  (""I Can Still Make Cheyenne"" recalling ""Amarillo By Morning"" and  ""Adalida""  bringing to mind ""The Love Bug"").  With ""Carrying Your Love With Me"" and  ""Carried Away,"" Strait even repeats himself within the same collection.
  If you think I am getting too nit-picky about this set, you may be right.  The crisp, heartfelt delivery on ""You Can't Make A Heart Love Somebody"" is  just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country  music.  And as ""Blue Clear Sky"" and ""Round About Way"" illustrate, no one  handles a play-on-words more effectively than Strait.  You'd also be  hard-pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than ""We  Really Shouldn't Be Doing This.""
 The two new singles contribute in  mixed degrees to the Strait legacy.  Recent chart-topper ""The Best Day"" is  nice, but it also seems too similar to some old hits (""Love Without End,  Amen,"" ""Check Yes Or No).""  Here our protagonist progresses through a love  for camping, cars, and finally, his ideal woman.  Much better is ""Murder On  Music Row,"" a duet with Alan Jackson.  This mega-event pairing of two of  modern country's most traditional (and successful) artists is an  effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today's  country....
 As  noted earlier, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is not flawless.  In light of  its several strong points, however, it has to be recommended as a must buy  for all country music listeners.","Hallelujah !. George Strait and MCA have finally released a single - disc collection of hits that is n't skimpy !. Unlike Strait 's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits , Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks , of which two are new recordings .. Specifically , it picks up where the multi - disc retrospective Strait Out Of   The Box leaves off , with the old hits culled from Strait 's 1994 through   1998 albums ..

AQ81L25HHHB18,B000WLNUN6,1,1,4,"As odd as it may be, out of the hundreds of CDs in my collection, few of them are Christmas CDs, and of the Christmas CDs I do have, there aren't many of them that I listen to very often, even during the holidays. This one is one of the exceptions. One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall ""laid-back"" feel. I like that it isn't wild or very rocking. Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me (usually, anyway). Burl, with his warm, friendly voice, doesn't come across as a ""celebrity"" but as more of a ""grandfatherly"" figure. The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back-up vocals. Of course, the title track and ""Rudolph"" are probably the most-known tracks on the album, but the others are good, too. The album has one of the best versions of ""Little Drummer Boy"" that I've heard! ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" closes the album perfectly. Right now, it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s) from the album, but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song, and it would probably be ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away.""

There are a few different Burl Ives Christmas CD's on the market and so I encourage you to check them out to see which one you like the best.  This is a very very good one.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5,"Burl Ives really isn't remembered as much as he should be these days; and that's a shame. On this album Burl sings wonderfully; and his friendly, grandfatherly vibes go into every song he sings! This CD is a must-have for fans of Burl; and anyone who wants some very special holiday songs would do well to add this to their music collection. The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is very nicely done.

The title track opens the album; this catchy, infectiously happy and upbeat tune could never go out of style; and Burl practically owns this song the way he delivers it. He puts a lot of positive energy into his version of this song; and it shows quite clearly when I hear him perform it. Great! ""Christmas Is a Birthday"" is very easy on the ear; what a charming ballad--and it's religious, too. ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" switches gears back to a more secular song; Burl puts his own stamp on this tune by playing a bit with the tempo and a few key changes--and it all holds its own very well.

""White Christmas"" glows brighter than silver and gold combined when Mr. Ives sings it; that background chorus rounds out the number nicely although wisely the arrangement makes it so that they can't attempt to share the spotlight with Burl. ""The Little Drummer Boy"" has another terrific arrangement; the percussion and guitar are used very well and the music fits perfectly with Burl Ives' singing. In addition, ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" leaves nothing to be desired--this music is all THAT good!

""Winter Wonderland"" shines bright in Burl's capable hands; I really like this number. ""Silver Bells"" couldn't have been done any better and the CD ends with Burl Ives performing ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day."" I haven't heard this number as often as I've heard the other tunes on this CD but it's really quite beautiful and it even leaves me wanting more.

Burl Ives turned out a wonderful record album back in 1965; and it's amazingly wonderful to have this on CD in our times so that we can enjoy it over and over again. I highly recommend this album; it's full of splendid holiday music.","Burl Ives really is n't remembered as much as he should be these days ; and that 's a shame ..

A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5,"The only complaint about ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas"" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums.  His first, ""Christmas Day in the Morning,"" came out in 1952, followed by ""Christmas Eve"" in 1956.  ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas"" came out in 1965, with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" the following year.  The title song of this album was written by for the special by Johnny Marks, who also wrote the song ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" which Ives sings on this album, and the final track, ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.""  That is a pretty good trio of Christmas songs, which would make Marks one of the best writers of Christmas songs ever.

How this album is different from the previous Burl Ives Christmas albums is that he has shifted to this point to more of a pop-oriented approach to singing Christmas songs that the traditional folk style that defined his earlier albums.  There are still some folk songs on this album, with ""Christmas is a Birthday,"" ""Christmas Child (Loo, Loo, Loo),"" ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away,"" and ""Snow for Johnny.""  But most of the songs are definitely more popular than secular, with ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"" ""White Christmas,"" ""Winter Wonderland,"" and ""Silver Bells.""  I tend to think of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" as being more religious than it really us, but that is more because the music is more hymn-like.

The net result is that you have Burl Ives singing eight recognizable Christmas songs and introducing you to four songs that you have probably not heard before that are perfectly suited to his strengths as a singer.  Ives started out in the 1920s as an itinerate folk singers, moved to Broadway in the 1930s, appeared on the radio in the 1940s, and became a popular folk singer in the 1950s.  But most people today probably remember him as the Snowman who narrates the story of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" that still airs each holiday season forty years later.  Because of that connection it is entirely possible that a Burl Ives Christmas album will be warmly received in your home by those who do not know about the rest of his resume.  He certainly produces the requisite warm seasonal feelings.","The only complaint about "" Have a Holly Jolly Christmas "" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums ..

A3LPZ3KE5TAZMA,B000WLTDIM,1,1,5,"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play ""Amarillo By Morning,"" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to ""Amarillo by Morning.""

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","I grew up in rural West Texas , where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals ..

I hadn't heard of Enrique Iglesias until he showed up on my Pandora radio play list, but this song is a truly lovely dance song. The instrumentals are stunning, and Iglesias' smooth and deep strains complement the style perfectly. There's nothing terribly *new* in this song - it's a very standard dance-and-romance song - but a song doesn't need to be innovative to be beautiful, raw, and real. Listen to the sample and you may love it.

Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.

A3LPZ3KE5TAZMA,B000WLTDIM,1,1,5,"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play ""Amarillo By Morning,"" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to ""Amarillo by Morning.""

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","I grew up in rural West Texas , where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals ..
