AXQ89O6YRT7AX,5557706259,1,1,5.0,"I love the song Slow Fade by Casting Crowns, especially how they put the children version at the end... its a song that speaks to everyone of us to be careful on ""itching ears"" that may take our faith and attention away from the Lord and to be watchful all the time and put on our armour at all times in the gospel. The song slow fade speaks to those who does not just live and walk in faith but also those who are still in the process of finding themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the Lord, the lyrics simply say ""people never crumble in a day... its a slow fade when you give yourself away..."" this is so True, nobody changes over night and we can start by being careful on what we feed our minds, body, ears, eyes, and soul for our body is the temple of the Lord and we are to keep it holy and live a christ-like life all the time, not just at certain times but 24/7, with or without people around us... we may not get it all right at ones, but its a ""slow fade"" when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it starts by the choices we make on what to feed our body and soul."
A1M379MK8MKGUF,5557706259,1,1,5.0,This is an awesome album from the amazing Christian group Casting Crowns. You can't go wrong with this album. Amazing and worth the buy! I think if you like Casting Crowns you'd probably also like my current new favorite artist I found through myspace. I think they'll be as big as Casting Crowns and already starting to see a huge interest in them. See my other reviews for The Warehouse Band
AA762OWLWCPQ2,5557706259,1,1,5.0,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this album yet! Maybe I didn't buy it from amazon, lol! I love this album to pieces. All the way from What This World Needs to Every Man, Slow Fade to all because of Jesus...great just awesome! I had the privilege of seeing this band perform at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, VA back last November with my brother and I tell you what..this band cares for souls! I, only being a new christian for a couple of months prior I was on a spirtual high already and this band lifted me up higher! Casting Crowns is one of those exceptional Contemporary Christian Bands that you would feel comfortable having your 6 or 8 year old son or daughter listen to. I had Lifesong and I knew how much I enjoyed that album, still there most phenomenal work to date and then picked up the debut album self titled Casting Crowns. If you want to listen to a band that actually loves Jesus and wants everyone to know it, I can guarantee this band will fulfill your craving."

A16QJ649N8PRV,5557706259,1,1,5.0,"This latest effort by Casting Crowns is an outstanding project.  As with their other albums, it is lyrically powerful and has a great sound.

There are several very good songs on this album.  The album has a theme of challenging Christians to live their faith all the time, not just on Sunday mornings.  There are a couple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers.

As with their previous albums, I think that this one will produce several hit singles.  'East To West' is already in that category.  Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'Every Man', and 'Slow Fade'.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns.  For those who are unfamiliar with their music, I would recommend starting off with their self titled debut.  In any case, this is well worth buying."
ADVX0P3EIKWBK,5557706259,-1,-1,2.0,"I have gotten ripped on previously Casting Crowns reviews because I gave them 4 stars instead of 5...so there is no doubt people will go crazy with this review.  But with that being said, this CD just wasn't very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with ""If We Are The Body"" and ""Does Anybody Hear Her,"" but with ""What This World Needs,"" it's just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn't doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!

This CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.  Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album.  This one will sell a lot of units, but will not stand the test of time.  It will collect dust on my shelf."
A25B8W9VSY0C5Y,5557706259,1,1,5.0,"I remember the first time I heard Casting Crowns on the radio several years ago. It wasn't Mark Hall's voice, the band's music, or even the harmonies sung that drew me in. It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that ""Voice of Truth"" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time. I decided to go ahead and buy that album and found every song spoke volumes to me. Now here we are 3 albums later and once again, Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again. They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart.

I really like the way that Casting Crowns' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the 'gray area' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...'no way!'. We give God a list that says I'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don't step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.

The first song on the album: ""What This World Needs"" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along. I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say.

Song #2: Every Man- This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we've done there is Hope for us. Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through.

#3: Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day. No, instead it is a slow fade. Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray.

#4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn't giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I'm the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )

#5: The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates, this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail.

#6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. ""The Altar and the Door"" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.

#7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my ""anthem"". I admire Mark's clever word play- ""Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is..."" What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.

#8: I Know You're There: This song is great! One of the ladies from Casting Crowns sings this. She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem. This song is about knowing that God is always there for us.

#9: Prayer for a Friend: This song, which sounds close to a ballad, is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord.

#10: All Because of Jesus: This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world.

#11: White Dove: This song is completely different from anything Casting Crowns has ever done. I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different.

I highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music. I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world. Casting Crowns does a great job of helping its listener connect (or re-connect) with God.

One more note: This album is GREAT to work out with!!! I do my strength training and cardio workouts with this album. I also like jogging to this album."
A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,5557706259,1,1,5.0,"Christian soft rock group Casting Crowns has taken the Christian music world by storm thanks to two strong previous releases.  And their third project should continue the trend.

The group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music.  There's nothing earth shattering with either, but both work together to create some great music.

The disc starts off with the rock anthem ""What This World Needs.""  Think ""If We are the Body"" but faster.  The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100% perfect outward appearances.  After all, the heart is what counts.

The title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I'll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, ""Somewhere in the Middle.""  In fact, the phrase ""between the altar and the door"" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.

As with other Casting Crown's CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don't grab me.  There's nothing wrong with ""I Know You're There"" and ""All Because of Jesus,"" but they aren't as special as some of their other tracks.

My two favorite songs are back to back.  ""Slow Fade"" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith.  It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day.  It's a slower song with a haunting sound.  And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall's daughter singing ""Because Little Eyes.""  It's enough to give me chills.

Appropriately enough, the next song is ""East to West.""  As you might guess, this song talks about forgiveness.  It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God's forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under.  As with so many of their songs, the lyrics are powerful.

Musically, there are few surprises here for the long time fan.  But that's just fine because their music is wonderful.

I'm surprised I haven't worn out Casting Crown's first two releases I've listened to them so often.  This one will certainly suffer the same fate."

A9Q28YTLYREO7,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"Michael Jackson has always Been Badd period. from his days as a Kid leading the Jackson5 to His Incredible Adult solo Run. His Vocal Instrument alone has touched so many lives. His Instrument of a Voice has gone through so many styles&Eras. no matter what the Era or what was the ""IN"" Sound or vibe you could always count on MJ hanging tough. His Voice as a Kid was that of a BluesMan in a Kid. He explored so many styles&Influenced so many era's of future Musicians. as a songwriter he has composed some of the Most Timeless songs Ever in ""don't Stop Till you Get Enough,Billie Jean,Beat It.

He has His Own Mount Rushmore of Music Makers in the History of Making Music.for the new Listener to His Musical Genius this is a Great place to Start."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,7799420340,1,1,4.0,"It is hard to imagine enigma's from so many artists. Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.

The Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.

All in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon. What ever reflection, The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005.

A1KCA1O8SPOE8P,7799420340,1,1,4.0,"This is almost a definitive look at Jackson's career both with the J5 and solo.  There's still a 5 star 1 disc compilation in Jackson's future.  But as of 2005 there are none on the market.  But the 2 disc's here (compiled chronologically) move along nicely. You get the Jacksons' biggest hits and Michael's early Motown solo hits.  So, why isn't this a 5 star package?  For one there's no ""Dancing Machine"", which is a cruel trick played by Epic/Legacy to make you buy one of the numerous J5 compilations with that song on it (or just download it).  The liner notes consist of a few paragraphs that aren't worth anyone's time.  And they included ""Dangerous"" a decent album cut that's not essential.  Better choice would be ""Working Day And Night"". All told not a bad CD to have by Jackson if it's only a Greatest Hits CD you need."

When I saw it was available on kindle, I thought ""about time.""  A classic Michael song.  Perfection.  I only wish I could have downloaded the video to it as well.  Hey now, kindle, there's an idea!"
A3U3W7URZU9259,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"I finally decided to add 'The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0' set to my collection, and it's almost perfect. Unlike the original release, this one comes in a digipak fold out case, which hold the 3 CDs in slits and can be a problem if you handle them often, so plan on uploading the music to iTunes (etc) to avoid scratching your discs. The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael, and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos, plus complete details (chart info, etc) for each song. As for the music, this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael (and his Brothers on Disc 1). The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs, many of which are featured as 'single edits', which is fine as I already have the full versions. The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat, but could've been perfect if 'I'll Be There', 'Dancing Machine', and 'Scream' (Duet with Janet) were included. It does however feature Michael's #1 duet with Paul McCartney ('Say, Say, Say'), which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now. At any rate, I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than 'Number Ones' or aren't ready to purchase the 'Ultimate Collection' (which also failed to include a number of classics!)."

A2S0OMLVU7HWW9,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"we usually listen good music when driving somewhere, usually a road trip will take 2 to 4 hours. we like Michael Jackson's music and is never boring or annoying at all. sound quality is great as well."
A1RXVSBGGRKIIW,7799420340,-1,1,5.0,"Good luck finding any artist or group putting every song hit on one cd - it just doesn't happen.
But if you want to buy a Cd with a lot of Michael's hits- you cannot go wrong with this selection.
Pricing was very fair."
A1W4TFTFA0V39V,7799420340,1,1,5.0,i have nothing bad to say about this product.  It works well and i use it everyday. nice and easylove
A2YNL0PAKAQPRQ,7799420340,1,1,5.0,I was a bit late in becomming a fan of Mr. Jackson (unfortunately!) so I'm trying to catch up on his works. Hopefully I'll find more CDs to add to my collection; this CD is a great start. I definitely recommend this to other fans--existing ones as well as new ones like myself.
A2IJ7JFHB94EKX,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"I've purchased this album in iTunes and again through Amazon because this album has so many of Michael Jackson's awesome works, it's a great one shot deal. Some of the songs here I never (or may have been too young) remembered like, ""Ben."" Michael Jackson is great house cleaning or sitting in traffic music."
A1GIIPXONCEEHP,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"There's no denying the impact Michael Jackson has had on popular music over the course of forty years. From the Jackson 5's first No. 1 (""I want you back"" when Michael was eleven) through his untimely death at the age of fifty.

I was still in high school when Michael and his brothers released four consecutive No. 1s (something not even the Beatles did). Despite Michael's popularity, I remained essentially a casual fan. I didn't buy a Michael Jackson album until THRILLER--an album that spawned seven hit singles and has sold over 100 million copies to date.

I eventually bought 1995's HIStory and later 2001's GREATEST HITS. But if you're looking for one collection to hit all the highlights of a brilliant career (I bought mine as a Black Friday deal), this is everything the casual fan needs:  solo hits starting with 1971's ""Got To Be There"" through 1999's ""You Rock My World"" along with a sprinkling of Jackson 5/Jacksons hits. [The only glaring omissions are the duets with his sister Janet (""Scream"") and Paul McCartney (""Say Say Say"")]

Overall, this is two and a half hours of music that changed the landscape of popular music forever. This music belongs in any serious collector's library. ESSENTIAL  [Running time - Disc 1, 78:56; Disc 2, 78:50]"
AEMV9IMH665B9,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"The title says it all. It has all the classics and popular MJ Hits 2CD pack, a must have for everyones collection."
A2U80IPZXN5V1U,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"It's no secret that Michael Jackson was incredibly talented and gifted musician, the fact that he also had a passion for his art must have helped. This two discs collection covering the man's entire career from the time he was a little kid up to his later years as one of the most famous person on this planet. It serves as an example of how great his music was and how it's still amazing today. Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry, Michael revolutionized it, and in the 1980's Michael was fashion. MJ's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need, we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time, or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time, or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael's numerous accomplishments in the music industry, it's how good his music was.

The first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael's time in the Jackson 5/ Jacksons. Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall (1979), 7 songs from Thriller (1982), 8 from Bad (1987), 7 from Dangerous (1992) and 1 from both History (1995) and Invincible (2001). All the hits you would expect are here: Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad and much more. There isn't much to say about the songs included, they're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this ""essential"" collection. Besides the ""Ultimate Collection"" boxed set, this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael's career. It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc, Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career.

I can't hide the fact that I'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible. Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael (although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could/should have been included. ""They Don't Care About Us"" and ""Earth Song"" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career-spawning collection. From Invincible I think ""Whatever Happens"" should have been here and perhaps ""Butterflies"". It's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included, they do not really match the pop ""hits"" in terms of lyrics or musicality, they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance. That aside, The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want, the hits and more well-known songs. I must add it does a good job at doing so!

The Essential Michael Jackson does an excellent job of going further than your average compilation and offers Michael's hits and some of his best songs. The fact that it covers his entire career is great; you get a proper overview of Jackson's music. For someone who is relatively new to Michael Jackson's music this is really The Essential Michael Jackson.  4  /5."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,7799420340,1,1,4.0,"While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the ""King of Pop"". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.

The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.

Overall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record, and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry. If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record, this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure. R.I.P. Michael, you've rocked the world, and so many hearts along the way.

A36RS7KTNOBROF,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"All the Essential CD's are fantastic. Heart,Barry Manilow,and alot of artist have the Essential collections at Target for 9.99.
This Michael Jackson collection is also great. All the hits are here from the Jackson 5 years,and Michaels hits,including his last,""You Rock my World."""
A2R6RA8FRBS608,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"Michael Jackson gave us so much wonderful music during his lifetime; and this two CD set showcases his fine talent. Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks; there's not a dud in the bunch. The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well.

""I Want You Back"" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! ""ABC"" is very catchy. ""Got To Be There"" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings ""Got To Be There"" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! ""Rockin' Robin"" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?

""Ben"" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes ""Ben"" even more beautiful. ""Enjoy Yourself"" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. ""Blame It on the Boogie"" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in ""Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground)."" Listen also for Michael to deliver ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings ""Rock with You;"" ""Off The Wall"" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled ""The Girl Is Mine."" ""Billie Jean"" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever. It's got some beat! ""Beat It"" is yet another jewel on the first CD. ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" is another catchy, infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it; and I especially like ""Thriller;"" ""Thriller"" is timeless and just one listen proves it!

""Bad"" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ--he stands right there, front and center where he belongs! ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett; and ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is pop music at its very best. ""Man in the Mirror"" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it; and Michael does a superb job on ""Another Part of Me."" I love it! ""Black or White"" is very well done; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot. ""Heal The World"" is very sweet and easy on the ear--this music lacks nothing, it's all THAT good.

""Remember The Time"" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good; it's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it. ""Will You Be There"" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect; and ""Dangerous"" has some beat! ""You Are Not Alone"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson's songs! The second CD ends well with MJ performing ""You Rock My World."" Awesome!

Michael Jackson fans should consider this a ""must-have"" for their collections; and it has so many songs that it makes the perfect introduction to MJ and his music for newcomers just discovering his magic. I highly recommend this two CD set."
A26Q3LIFIMUYMX,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"This CD is awesome and I have enjoyed it so much his music is so inspiring to me. He has talent no one else will ever possess and the music on the CD shows it. I am truly devastated over the loss of MJ I am still crying about it.  He will live in my heart forever.  I only wish the negative people would have known the real MJ. Listen to his words, look at his various videos on the web in regards to children, read the court transcripts and read the book on his conspiracy.  You will know why he was acquitted because he was totally innocent from day one and every juror knew it.  God Bless his beautiful children.  I am looking forward to the day his children are older and they give an interview on what a wonderful ""DADDY"" he was."
A1F9Z42CFF9IAY,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"This is the only Michael Jackson album you need to buy. It has all the essential hits/tracks spanning his entire career!

While he had tons of hits, all of his individual albums had songs that were not hits and not good songs. So, there is no need to buy the individual albums unless there is a particular song that is not on this 'essential' album that you are looking for."
ANOOQD9XOQWSM,7799420340,1,1,4.0,"Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in ""Billie Jean."" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into ""Bad,"" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire ""Dangerous,"" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding."
AE9GUE3HHOX3U,7799420340,-1,1,5.0,"Who would have ever thought Michael Jackson would die in this era?  It doesn't seem real, he wasn't supposed 2 die.  This collection of hits is almost as good as buying all of his solo works.  I actually would rather have each individual album but I don't have time for all that and I already own hundreds of cds, so The Essential Michael Jackson makes the most sense, for content and consolidation reasons.  But I still would like the artwork and other tracks from the other cds but I just don't feel like buying them, so i just bought this.  I went to 5 different stores and they were all SOLD OUT.  I finally got the last copy but I had to pay $25.  I think alot of people are just buying this cd as a trinket, I actually want to LISTEN to the music, so stop buying it if you are just going to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it.  As for the music, I don't like any of the Jackson 5 stuff, it sounds dated and all the songs are overplayed.  I like ""Ben"", in my oppinion, that's the only good song MJ did when he was really young. They left out ""Never can Say Goodbye"" which is about the only good Jackson 5 song, so that sucked.  All MJ's other hits are on here from ALL the albums.  The only other song I'm pissed about is ""Jam"".  I wish they would have included that song, but I don't want to have to go out and find a copy of ""Dangerous"" just for that song.  Life is complicated and the music industry always makes it complicated for music fans. I wasn't really impressed with the pics in the liner notes, they could have included better, unreleased pics of Michael.  I am a Michael Jackson fan even though I disconnected with him and his music during the child molestation stuff.  Now that he died, I can feel better about paying him tribute and listening to his music again.  After all, I did a lip sync of ""Bad"" in full costume in high school drama class.  MJ was a part of my life.  God Bless u Michael, this world loved u.  *One last note....""Farewell My Summer Love"" should have been included on this cd, that song is probably impossilble to find.  I used to have it on 45."
A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"Even though Michael Jackson's personal life was rocked with scandal and I didn't always approve of his antics but I cannot ignore the cultural impact this gifted performer had on me as a child. I was in born in 1982, I remember hearing him on the radio and thought wow what a voice! The song was Dirty Diana from his Bad album. It wasn't until 1991 when his Dangerous album was released that I became a fan of Jackson, Black or White was a stellar video and the cd was just pure pop candy, I ate it up! After the scandal broke in 1993, I lost interest in Jackson but now that he is no longer with us - I hope will be remembered for his music and dancing ability - he was one-of-a-kind. This collection of greatest hits is spectacular! There are couple of Jackson 5 classics and of course the best tracks of his career like Thriller, Billie Jean, Human Nature, The Man in the Mirror, In the Closet, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), She's Out of My Life, Will You Be There?, and Don't Stop Til You Get Enough. He changed the sound and look of pop music forever, RIP Michael!"
A2OAKHL0E0A4YQ,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"Thjere are many Michael Jackson CD's on the market. This is the one to own however since it captures all of his big hits and well represents my two favorite albums ""Off The Wall"" and ""Thriller"". His best songs are all here"" Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Beat It, Billie Jean,The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, etc. as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"". THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard. There are 37 cuts. Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon. If you can only own one CD, this is the most logical choice. My only quibble is the omission of ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" which was my favorite Jackson Five song. At one time, he was selling over one million albums-CD's a day (1983-84). He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics. Highly recommended!"
A14GK0E64J0WAS,7799420340,-1,1,5.0,"In 2005, Sony released without much or any fanfare the terrific ""Essential Michael Jackson"", which easily is the best Michael Jackson compilation available these days. It also released a slightly different international version, which I recently picked up while in China. No, I didn't buy it from a pirated-CD hawking character on some street corner. In fact I bought it in a regular CD store in Shanghai, for all of 39 RMB (about US$ 5.50), if you can believe that.

The international version of ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:

1. The Jacksons' ""Can You Feel It"" replaces ""Enjoy Yourself"" (an improvement);
2. Somehow ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" (from ""Bad"") is lumped along with (and in the middle of) the ""Thriller"" songs on CD1, obviously not an improvement;
3. The title track from ""Dangerous"" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's ""HIStory"" second CD of new material are added (""Earth Song"" and ""They Don't Care About Us""), a wash as far as I'm concerned although ""Earth Song"" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How ""They Don't Care About Us"" ended up on the ""essential"" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).

Would I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover). That aside, ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" is a terrific album, whether you buy the US version or the international version, and it really showcases Michael Jackson at his best."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"Michael Jackson is a timeless Musical Genius. He Owned the Last Century. Dick clark got it right  when he gave MJ the Award as Artist of the Last century. nobody before or since captured the whole World's Musical  Complete Attention as the soul Brother from  the Dirty of Gary Indiana. these songs showcases His Greatness for  Decades upon Decades. His Vocal Range&ability to adapt to Musical changes highlights a Genius without Limits.  Michael Jackson is the ""DON OF MUSIC"" period. Michael back in the day was a Event all unto Himself.  there aren't too many artists who cover as much Ground as MJ past or Present.  He changed the game of Popular Music.  these songs made me go and get Penny Loafers and get my dance on.  these Songs reprensent a wonderful time in Music.  without Michael Jackson I wouldn't even really care about Music. he was that Cat that Made a Brother truly appreciate the Art form to the Highest form."
A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"Isn't this unbelievable? Another Michael Jackson compilation! Many of Jackson's fans own HISTORY-PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK I,NUMBER ONES and the ultimate 4 disc(3 CD and 1 DVD) compilation.

A1KNYQPZ1JQD62,7799420340,-1,1,4.0,"Michael Jackson is the biggest selling artist of all time. Also one of the greatest artists of all time. This is the 3rd greatest hits album in row. First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more. But that is why they released the Essential Jacksons. Disc 1 continues into all the ""Off The Wall"" & ""Thriller"" classics. Starting on Disc 2, it goes into all the ""Bad"" singles..the only one that was missing is ""Liberian Girl"" which was a single in the U.K., All the singles from ""Dangerous"" are here besides ""Jam"". I am not sure why the title cut ""Dangerous"" included. That should of been where ""Jam"" should of been. Also the final single from the ""Dangerous"" album is not included ""Gone Too Soon"". Now it starts to slip a little. We only get 1 song ""History"" & One song from ""Invincible""? No No!! Where is Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song & Childhood? From Invincible, where is Cry & Butterflies? and also his 2003 hit single ""One More Chance""? All of these titles are missing. Hopefully we will get a new album from him soon and not anymore greatest hits album."
A2LNEZD3YBO12O,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"This is just as strong and vibrant as the box set that came 8 months before it! I sent a copy of it to my uncle in Georgia a few days after it came out on July 12! Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent.  This one, like the box set, combines his Jackson 5 hits, his Jacksons hits and his solo hits going up to 2001.  Past albums stopped at Thriller, but this goes even further to Invincible.  But my favorites are on here, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little loud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener.  The packaging said 37 songs, but there are 38 songs here, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, ""But why isn't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here?""  It must have been tough deciding what to put on here, because Michael has always made quality music.  To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100-170 miles or so on a road trip?  This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than 2003's Number Ones. Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends!"
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I,7799420340,-1,1,4.0,"Truth is, Michael Jackson needed a 2-disc collection as much as anybody. Those single discs didn't quite do it for somebody who's still often called the ""King Of Pop"". So, the pros and cons. I personally don't need the Jackson 5 material myself, but some might. I also think this is a bit shy on his most recent work. I do miss ""Earth Song"" and the duet ""Scream"" with Janet too. However, many of his best songs came from ""Thriller"" and ""Bad"", and we get most of those here. In fact there are 7 of the 9 songs from the original ""Thriller"" album, and even more from ""Bad"". Plus we get the best of ""Off The Wall"", and again some of his earliest stuff. The fact is, after listening to this collection of Michael Jackson, you almost can't not like him. It's just ""Human Nature""."
A1QEWOSV05RYEO,7799420340,1,1,4.0,"Despite all the controversy that has occured with Michael Jackson, he is truly the king of pop and he truly has one of the best recording voices ever.  You can't deny that Michael Jackson is one of the most influential artists not only in pop, but also in the Twentieth Century of music itself.  THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.

This collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including ""I'll Be There"", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.

It is wonderful reliving hits such as ""I Want You Back"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Thriller"", ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"", ""Don't Stop Til You Get Enough"", and etc... 4 stars."
A1534MBU6VJXYN,7799420340,1,1,4.0,"When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their ""The Essential..."" series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his ""not guilty"" verdict.

If this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and ""Thriller"" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.

If you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though ""I'll Be There"" and ""Dancing Machine"" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: ""Off The Wall"", ""Thriller"", ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit ""You Are Not Alone"" and the 2001 Top Ten single ""You Rock My World"".

As with most if not all entries in the ""Essential"" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that ""Thriller"" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as ""I'll Be There"", ""I Wanna Be Where You Are"", ""Dancing Machine"", ""Ease On Down The Road"", the Paul McCartney ""Say, Say, Say"" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), ""State Of Shock"" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans."
A344FQSEVEAG75,7799420340,1,1,4.0,"...But not so because of it's lack of completion. As in the past Greatest Hits compilations by Michael and The Jacksons, there has always been filler...but no thriller, hits with pits! So this compilation IS the best so far!! Pictures included are his best photos showing off a talented singer/songwriter and not the everchanging cosmetic mess. The quality of the mastering is far superior than previous compilations including that of the earlier hits from Motown...like I Want You Back, ABC and Got To Be There. The track information is informative and I don't recall another compilation that has such details.

  But the reason for the 1 less star is that it did not complete the Essential and added 2 songs that were not Essential for this type of CD. Granted he has had more #1 hits and more top 40 hits than most!! Over 4 decades here, from 1970 - 2000!

But where is the # 1 Essential I'll Be There or Dancing Machine?

They could have left out Dangerous which never charted and Leave Me Alone which is an essential, but not a hit as well. The video was a bigger hit!

  OK now what's next?  Maybe Volume 2 Essential ...and!"
A14GK0E64J0WAS,7799420340,1,1,5.0,"Whoa!!!!! Where did this come from? Without any hype or media attention, Sony has just released ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" (37 tracks, 157 min.), perhaps the ultimate Michael Jackson compilation.

CD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the ""Thriller"" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as ""ABC"" and ""I Want You Back"", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include ""State of Shock"" or ""Lovely One"" instead of ""Enjoy Yourself"". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 ""Thriller"" album tracks (the other 2 being ""Baby Be Mine"" and ""The Lady in My Life""; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when ""radio tracks"" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.

CD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from ""Bad"" and 7 from ""Dangerous"", and finishes off with ""You Are Not Alone"" from HIStory and ""You Rock My World"" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is ""Scream"", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.

In the end, this ""essential"" compilation is better than any other compilation available (HIStory Vol. 1; Number Ones, etc.) as it covers both the Jackson 5/Jacksons era and his solo output. It's very strange to me that this was released without any hype or advertizing campaign, but the main thing is that it's out and available. Hihgly recommended!"

A26N27LJVQNVI1,9714721180,-1,1,4.0,"These single disc remasters were done on the cheap end. They didn't even bother to paint the disc. The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.

The three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it. I just wish they had given the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet. Bare minimum quality digipack, but it is low cost I guess. I just expected some kind of decent booklet with this remaster."

A1DW48CPF98IBR,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"I already had one of the finest versions of Ride the Lightning on CD as a basis for comparison. I hadn't been able to find many reviews on the new $18.99 vinyl.

I purchased this at B&N with a coupon in-store today, but will share with my Amazon brethren as I get 95% of my new vinyl here and love to add to the reviews that I myself greatly depend on.

I have decent mid-fi equipment, not really a reference system but certainly good enough to expose the quality of an inferior recording. 1978 Japanese Technics SL-220 with AT95e > TC750 > Yamaha RX-V377 > HD598 and the CD on the same RX and phones via Yamaha CDP-S300

I prefer the vinyl by a good margin, though the only fault I can find is the vocals are a little low in this mix. Record was dead flat (as in free of warps) drilled dead center, poly lined paper sleeve, lyrics sheet, download card. Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. #6 via KABUSA EV-1. Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks, generous lead-in area and dead wax, I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00.

It may be the most quiet metal record I own as far as background, and darn sure is the best for $18.99 or less. The record volume overall is a tad low but nothing that's not easily overcome by the volume control. I was impressed to the point that I will now seek out the new releases of Kill em All and Puppets, despite Puppets having some issues according to reviews.

So yeah, mix sounds nice and balanced, good bass, vocals recessed a tad, but not a big deal IMO. Very happy with the price/quality. Would recommend. Kill EM All is my favorite Thrash era Metallica and this album bridges the gab between that album and puppets."

A2L167UOLOYOO0,9714721180,1,1,5.0,Since Amazon has lumped the Elektra CD release of this album i must specify which release i am reviewing. I am reviewing the 2000 24 karat Gold CD edition of Ride the Lightening remastered by Steve Hoffman. This is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab release just so people know. I own a few of their Miles Davis LP's remasters which sound amazing. Now back on track i have owned and played the hell out of Ride the Lightening (1995) CD put out by Elektra. While that version sounds good the 2000 Hoffman remaster blows any other CD edition out of the water. The album just has more life organic sound and does not sound harsh or filtered. The source material Mr. Hoffman worked on this release with was the original master tapes of the album. While the 1995 CD edition of RTL does not sound much different from the original vinyl version it did go through digital filtering possibly noise reduction and a few other things.  My reason for buying this version was i had heard Metallica had remastered Ride the Lightening again and were releasing a box set for the album. After hearing the sound on the album in that box had fallen victim to the loudness war i searched for an alternative. Snagging a decently priced copy of this long out of print remaster was luck on my part. All i have to say is if you care about sound stay far away from the RTL (2016 box set) it has nice extras which are tempting but yeah this 2000 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster is the way to go. Best sounding version of RTL in my humble opinion.

A19I5KZQM3CA6W,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Like with a handful of the albums I own in my now far larger CD collection, this album has been in my possession since I was about 14, so needless to say, I should have done this review a very long time ago. Straight to the point: I really have to say that this is my absolute favorite Metallica album of all time. As a perfect follow-up to ""Kill 'Em All"" the sophomore album ""Ride the Lighting"" marks a point in their career when they were in the prime of their quality brand of thrash metal, making a name for themselves as a band, and further rising to prominence in the '80s metal scene.

With a dark and eerie atmosphere, coupled with massive, thundering guitars, skull-crushing drums and raspy vocals, no metalhead in existence will be dissatisfied upon even the first listen, and will never want to skip over any songs. Every one of the songs on this album is a perfect illustration of what defined the True sound of Metallica and what made them such a great band. From the high-speed, neck-breaking insanity from songs such as ""Fight Fire With Fire,"" ""Trapped Under Ice"" & ""Creeping Death"" to the more steady, yet eerily menacing ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade To Black,"" this is the type of metal album that will never fail to disappoint any True Metallica fan.

Honestly, there is so much more I could say about this album that other have said before, I could go on all day about it! This, my friends, is the TRUE Metallica in their prime, and the defining sound of revolutionary metal greatness as we know it. Sadly, this period of their career in which they valued their art and staying True to themselves as musicians would not last beyond the '80s. We all know how they started to care more about money and sold out to the mainstream by going in a more alternative direction, ultimately destroying their own legitimacy as a metal band (See my review of their self-titled ""Black Album""), but at least we still have this album, along with ""Kill 'Em All,"" ""Master Of Puppets,"" and ""...And Justice For All"" to remind us of how awesome of a band they used to be.

All in all, this is definitely one album that makes no sense not to own, if you consider yourself a True Metallica fan, or a True metalhead in general. Just buy this album already! You know you want to. HORNS UP!!! \M/\M/"

A18A3UVA3GXTN4,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"I recently got into Metallica, and so I'm obsessed with finding everything they have done. This is an older album, but it's amazing. I watched some documentaries about them and had no idea that they were an underground band which makes their success even cooler. Every song is great. The Call of Ktulu is insane. They are all extremely talented and this shows why people like their music so much."
A2VSNUK7YLRKRE,9714721180,1,1,5.0,I love this album!  I still have the original vinyl picture disk but wanted to add the CD to my collection.  In my very humble opinion this is their best album with Garage Days a close second.
A35GNQK1DC7WXU,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"METALLICA create a THRASH masterpiece with RIDE THE LIGHTNING.....After their glorious debut KILL EN ALL, METALLICA refined their raw punk THRASH into something more meaningful...While KILL EN ALL is a hallucinated young raw THRASH petard, RIDE show a mature side in METALLICA, with introspective lyrics and even a powerful ballad(FADE TO BLACK)....well, in my opinion is a COMPLETE MASTERPIECE with gens like the title track, FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS and CREEPING DEATH!!!!!! WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!!!"
A2H1WNB30JNAWU,9714721180,1,1,4.0,"Ride the Lightning is another example of good metal music done by a great metal rock band.  The album itself is just like And Justice and All dealing with death in certain songs like Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Creeping Death.  The album had a deep impact on me on many songs off the album because at the time I bought it I was dealing with thoughts of death and the Metallica music infulence my release threw my poems I wrote and really help me get threw a dark period in my life.  But the actual music has some amazing metal music within it and deep powerful lyrics in it.  So if your looking for some good thrash metal type music pick this album up and see how many songs off it you enjoy and maybe the album will help you threw a dark period your going threw just like it help me threw mine as I wrote my poems and other items I write."
A1X6WS9PPQC3GI,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Sometimes you just need to blow off steam! And when I get tired of my boss at work or I can't find a date I like to rock and/or roll!

Metallica has been rocking the free world for big time and I am one of their most passionate fans. I love the way the guitars sound like a garbage truck going over the side of a cliff!

Sometimes, I'll be driving and I'll pull up to some ying-yang playing hip hop way too loud out of their Ford Focus and then I flip the switch on my stereo to ""Ride the Lightning"" and it blows their high school BS off the road!

If my parents let me I'm going to get a ""Freedom"" tattoo on my neck and one of Lars Ulrich's face on my right hand. That way, if my parents go out for the night it'll be me and Lars alone and there's not a court in the land that can stop us from doing ANYTHING we want."
A3J8ABVGK7ZL6H,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"This is an awesome CD! From start to finish. I love the way the CD starts off with a slow guitar intro on Fight Fire With Fire,then all of a sudden it gets up in your face with hard metal! I love it. My favorite song on here is,Fade To Black,which is my favorite Metallica song of all time. But every song on this album rocks. Just a shame there is only eight tracks on here though. I wish there was a re-release of this,with bonus tracks,such as outtakes or something cool like that."
A33M07VZBYRMPY,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Ride the Lightning is one of my favorite Metallica album. It presents a fast and harsh music and lyrics, respectively, similar to that style of Slayer. I often state that Ride the Lightning and Kill'em All are two progenitors of thrash and death metal albums."
A1432KCCCZL550,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"If you're new to Metallica, this and the follow up, Master Of Puppets, are the albums to get, if you're a metal fan anyways. these 2 are hands down their best.

For an, at the time, little known metal band, the production is really good. Everyone is in top form. James's vocals are a little higher than they'd be after this album, which adds to the charm of this album. The band was driven. they had some good material, partly thanks to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. And they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan's attention.

Fight Fire With Fire 10/10 - starts off with an acoustic intro that fades out as the electric guitars fade in. All this to lead into possibly the fastest Metallica song ever. This is a perfect opener with great guitar work, and vocals. this is definitely in a long list of favorite songs by Metallica, which every song with lyrics on this album actually are on.

Ride The Lightning 9/10 is an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verses. Plus a catchy chorus. Overall a very good song.

For Whom The Bell Tolls 10/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever. Granted it has stiff competition, but it might be. This one has a nice groove to it. This one's still fairly heavy, but not as heavy as the past 2 songs. There are some good melodies, and the guitar playing is really good. I hate to give credit to Lars, but his drums really add power to this song.

Fade To Black 9/10 is the first Metallica ballad. It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads. It doesn't really have a chorus, just a riff, instrumental based chorus, similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot. And it works fine. The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style, then the song speeds up for the bridge and solo. Overall a very good song.

Trapped Under Ice 9/10 after a ballad, what do any good metal bands do? They come back with a fast paced thrasher, which is what they did here. This is the second fastest song on the album. The song has a nice pace to it, and is an overall fun listen.

Escape 9/10 is kind of the pop song of the album. Odd it gets no recognition. This is probably the catchiest song on the album. This one's similar pacing to Ride The Lightning. It has a really good chorus, and is yet another in a long list of great songs on here.

Creeping Death 10/10 is another contender for favorite Metallica song. It's a fairly fast paced thrasher with a great horus. It has some slower parts as well and is a great way to close out the album.

Then there's an instrumental which I won't rate because I'm not really into instrumentals. It's played just fine, so I'm sure for fans of them it'll do.

Overall if you're a metal fan new to Metallica, which would be surprising, this is a good place to start. You won't be disappointed."
A38T0YN4VC4ZIE,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Ride the Lightning is a lot better in my opinion but both are still great albums. RTL has the best of early thrash/speed metal but it also has some progressive influences that would show more on their next 2 releases. Ride the Lightning has the perfect mix and it's a classic. The band matured also from their previous both musically and lyrically, it's a but darker than their first album. It's also their first album to feature Cliff Burton on bass in every track, replaced Ron McGovney which he was the original bassist. Dave Mustaine was fired in 1983 and formed Megadeth, former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet replaced him and RTL is their first to feature him on guitar. The band gets their line up together here. All of the songs are great but Creeping Death is my personal favorite."
AWSYTZ2I2MW0V,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"This is a piece of metal magic. All the songs are glorious one, all the songs are classics. Metallica really creates metal magic on Ride the Lightning. The lyrics are truly amazing and the sound is the finest thrash metal. If you like metal, you reeeeeeally have to listen to this absolutely classic."
A2U80IPZXN5V1U,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Metallica are truly one of the forces to be reckoned with in their genre of music whether you call it Metal, Heavy-Metal or Thrash is of little importance, they're one of the greats. While everyone has their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely cannot take away their achievements and the great music they have put out. Metallica already proved themselves to be a great band with their debut album Kill `Em All which has that early real raw and unpolished sound that makes it a fan favorite. 1984's Ride The Lightning expands on the formula of Kill `Em All and shows a bit more maturity, I mean the debut is great and it shows a lot talent it also shows a lot of anger from some seriously p***** off teenagers. You can see a certain progression, a development from the first album and they were becoming more and more the band that would release Master of Puppets. Ride is a dynamic and solid album all the way through, it also features tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that's still very much present more than 25 years later.

The opening song ""Fight Fire With Fire"" with its gentle guitar opening gives the impression that it's going to be a slower and softer song than usual for Metallica. WRONG! It soon changes and suddenly becomes very fast, perhaps one of the fastest Metallica songs. Excellent track to begin an excellent album. The title track, Ride, remains to this day one of my favorite Metallica songs with its incredibly fast solos and powerful lyrics. ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" has one of the most iconic intros in Metal, once again amazing lyrics by James (""take a look to the sky just before you die, it's the last time you will"", sounds nice doesn't it?). ""Fade to Black"" can almost be considered a ballad for the band, the lyrics are so personal and depressing yet the song is uplifting. It's a slower song for Metallica but it progressively gets heavier, the song has such a strong feel it's hard to overlook how great it is. In fact it's one of my favorite Metallica track to this day.""Trapped Under Ice"", ""Escape"" and ""Creeping Death"" are also very good songs that should not be ignored, those songs are excellent but have not often been played live.""The Call of Ktulu"" is an amazing 8+ minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that.

Ride The Lightning while not a concept album is mostly about the different types of death and ways of dying and it shows in the song titles (Ice, electrocution and others) making of Ride a dark record. Ride is also the last album on which Dave Mustaine receives credit; here he is credited on two tracks, the title track and the instrumental ""The Call of Ktulu"". James came up with some particularly great lyrics on Ride The Lightning as he usually does, but here it's really special. Ride has terrific guitar work courtesy of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet, excellent bass from Cliff Burton and solid drumming from Lars Ulrich. It would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that had a huge role and impact on the Thrash movement. These songs are classic Metal tracks and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt knows all about them already.

Some prefer the early raw Metallica sound of Kill `Em All and some prefer the acclaimed Master of Puppets album. With respect to those two amazing alums, out of the three first Metallica albums I'll have to say that Ride The Lightning is my personal favorite out of the three and is probably the one I like best of all the albums the band has done. I love Master just as much as the next guy but it's been overplayed, some of the stuff here has been overplayed as well but to a lesser degree. As much as I love the rawness of Kill `Em All I think the band is better on Ride. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that Ride The Lightning is an amazing Metallica album, it features deep lyrics, skillful guitar playing and is everything there is to like about the band to begin with. A total Metal album, I very much enjoy this ""Ride"" years later. 5/5 for this one, a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general."
A1NF9WS7RR82MX,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"When fans talk about Metallica, many of them refer to the first four albums as thrash classics, grouping them together as if they all feature the same style and fit into the same genre.  What I see many people fail to point out is that Ride the Lightning was just as huge a shift in sound and style from Kill `Em All as The Black Album was from And Justice For All.

When Metallica wrote Kill `Em All, thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal didn't exist yet.  They were influenced by speed metal bands like Venom and Motorhead, and produced a debut album where the musical traits of those bands were stamped clearly on just about every song.  Starting with Ride the Lightning, Metallica made a full shift to thrash, essentially defining the genre by making far more use of shredding riffs, melodic solos, and high-speed double bass drumming.  While James still utilized his scream on tracks like Trapped Under Ice, he employed a deeper overall tone and used a more gruff delivery.  You really don't hear many similarities to Kill `Em All musically; I mean, what songs from Ride the Lightning would sound right on that album?  In my opinion, none.  They  showed incredible progression and maturity from the wild, intense nature of Kill `Em All to the controlled powerhouse approach of Ride the Lightning.

The album itself is an easy five stars (bold statement, right?).  What metal fan doesn't know For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade to Black by heart?  Crushing thrash songs like Fight Fire With Fire, the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping Death are relentlessly aggressive.  Escape highlights the melodic NWOBHM influence that was virtually non-existent on Kill `Em All.  The perennial favorite Metallica instrumental, The Call of Ktulu, rounds out one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  It has a sound completely distinct from their others, has some of the best songs in Metallica's catalog, and without question belongs in any collection of heavy music."
A3GP5YP52BD4EX,9714721180,1,1,5.0,first of all if you don't know about Metallica you probably be very young. Just buy it for the beginning . All the songs are master-super-heavy metal songs. I remember how many times i have heard this album. Fade to blcak - For whom the bell tolls - Creeping Death - The call of Ktullu - and the other songs are just amazing . there is a strong feeling by hearing this songs .
A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"It seems like Metallica is turning into a band that you either love or hate as years go by. That's pretty sad, because the band is essentially one of the all-time great metal bands of all time. Some people will say that they're overrated. Well, I say that I still enjoy their music a whole lot. A majority of their albums are living proof that they can create powerful and haunting music. Ride The Lightning, the second album and the first without former member Dave Mustaine, is an all-around masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's pure brilliance. Songs like ""Fade to Black"" and ""Creeping Death"" are sure to please every Metallica fan out there. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is not only my personal favorite on the album, but also my personal favorite from the band themselves. It's five minutes of pure awesomeness. ""The Call of Ktulu"" is a 9-minute instrumental that may be boring to some, but I find the melodies and sounds to be completely engaging. In short, I won't describe what the songs mean or sound like, since I'm sure almost every reviewer on this page are Metallica fans. I'll just conclude by saying that Ride The Lightning is a great metal album.

Grade: 9.8/10"

A2TAPL67U2A5HM,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Ride the Lightning being Metallica's 2nd studio album and their 1984 release is truly an incredible album.

All the lyrics are included in the book along with some photos of the band. We also get a list over whom plays what. The album was met with rave reviews by the critics. Allmusic and Kerrang! both giving the album very high marks in their reviews. 5/5."
A20DZX38KRBIT8,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Metallica's second album is nothing short of amazing, the riffs are amazing, the solo's are epic, the vox are stellar and the songs are second to none.  With classics like Ride The Lightning, For Whom The Bell Tolls, Trapped under Ice, Call of ktulu etc this album is a fine example of thrash at it's best.  Metallica's second best album mostly due once again to Mustaines amazing songs."
ASP7N59L4E90M,9714721180,1,1,5.0,This is one of the best thrash metal albums ever and it's just raw and powerful totally recomend this to any old school metallica fan or any metal fan in general. But I can't put this ahead of Master Of Puppets.
A3KZ7OH4VRL048,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Talk of Metallica albums usually passes over ""Ride the Lightning""; you hear how great ""Master of Puppets"" is, the transition that was ""the black album"" and general disgust at ""St. Anger."" The truth is, without ""Ride the Lightning,"" we never would have seen any of the others.

""Ride the Lightning"" was Metallica's sophomore album, and it represents a quantum leap forward over ""Kill 'Em All,"" setting the sound that has come to be known as ""Metallica"" to us. The songs are more refined, yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor. While it would later be refined into ""Master of Puppets,"" arguably the greatest metal album ever, this album is still a masterpience, containing ""Fade to Black"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" as well as the very-well-done instrumental track ""The Call of Ktulu.""

Definitely an essential pickup for a Metallica fan, and one of the first few albums you should buy if you're just getting into the band."
A34HYQ9BQZPE78,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Metallica's sophomore album, ""Ride The Lightning"" certainly showcases some interesting and classic thrashers. It's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album. It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica's early catalogue, considering ""Kill 'Em All"" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal, ""Master of Puppets"" is regarded as Metallica's magnum opus, and ""...And Justice For All"" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for ""One"".
Regardless of whether or not ""Ride The Lightning"" is overlooked or not, it's still a classic that should be in every metalhead's collection. One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica's debut, it seems to have a thicker, more polished, and at times, more epic sound. Don't get me wrong, though, I still think ""The Four Horsemen"" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics, but to get a full review of ""Ride The Lightning"", simply read on.
""Fight Fire With Fire"" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute. Suddenly, a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour. The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare. The singing is also very raw, with James singing a very staccato pattern, ""Do!...Un!...-to others!...As!...They've!...Done to you!"". Great way to start off the album.
""Ride The Lightning"", the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high-pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy, Devil's Tritone riff. Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here, along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment.
""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" is a progressive, five-minute classic with plenty of great guitar riffs that occupy the first two minutes of the song. The nastiest riff of them all is featured in the chorus, and some wild guitar playing closes this war song out.
""Fade To Black"" is a personal favorite of mine, one of the best songs on the album, and one of the very best songs Metallica's ever written. Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo. Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses, then comes a powerful chorus riff. More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out.
""Trapped Under Ice"" is another heavy song about struggle, featuring some dirty riffage and wild soloing that definitely makes itself worthy to be on the album.
""Escape"" is a more melodic, radio-friendly sounding song, but nonetheless a great track, as well. A bit shorter and a pretty cool song.
""Creeping Death"" is a song that defines thrash metal. This is an overall great song that you gotta hear. Its lyrics refer to the Seven Plagues in the story of Moses in the Bible, and the thrashing riffs pummel their way into your brain. And, as always, Kirk Hammett shows us why he's an amazing guitarist when he screeches out those awesome guitar solos.
""The Call of Ktulu"" is a nine-minute, progressive instrumental. A cool way to end the album, it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums, alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone. I personally prefer ""Orion"" off ""Master of Puppets"", but this song is definitely a great one, too.
So as you can see, ""Ride The Lightning"" is undoubtedly a classic metal album. I've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time, and when you give this a listen, you'll see why. All of the tracks are very strong, the songwriting's great, as are the singing, guitar-, bass-, and drum-playing. Get this, along with the other three Metallica releases in the '80s, and even ""The Black Album"" if you're interested. Overall, this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrash metal, and heavy metal in general. Good job to the 'tallica guys! Thanks for the time, and peace."
A1L1NYH387VKGM,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"This just gets better every year.fade to black, trapped under ice, just 2 reasons to have this cd.no metal fan in the world should be without this. This album was also themed in a way - all the songs are about ways of dying.
Fight Fire With Fire - Nuclear War
Ride The Lightning - Electrocution
For Whom The Bell Tolls - On the battlefield
Fade To Black - Suicide
Trapped Under Ice - Drowning
Escape - Difficult to explain, listen and make your mind up about it
Creeping Death - Murder
All these songs are classics with great big crunchy guitar riffs, thick, heavy drumming, powerful bass, and to top it off great lyrics."
A356RFKNIG043B,9714721180,-1,1,4.0,"4 stars for what it is in the history of metal, 3 stars for how it now
compares to what it was back in the day.

In short: when this came out, heads turned and then banged, hard. Seemed miraculously heavy at the time, but of course this looks like Romper Room now after bands like Carcass etc (none of whom do much for me after a ""tune"" or two). I love True heaviness, which comes (to my ears) from extreme tightness between the drummer, bassist (kickdrum and bass locked in tight over the riff, specifically) and guitars. Here we have one of the great heavy rhythm players and a fine metal drummer.

But Lars and James are only half of this band. Kirk is WAY overrated as a lead player, very prosaic and uninspired, miles from someone like Randy Rhoads. And man, after the decades of Cliff-worship, this album proves that legend is often myth. The bass playing here is merely average, truly. There are dozens of heavier and tighter bassists; Cliff may have been a party monster and added to the vibe that way but his playing is average. Geddy, Geezer, Harris, etc etc etc blow him off the map.

  That said, there are some fast and furious highlights here, but frankly everything is so on top of or ahead of the beat that it gets wearing after a few tunes. About one minute into Bell Tolls is a highlight because everybody locks in but the guitars are finally a bit back in the pocket and everything gets much heavier and fatter due to that. That's why the Black album hit so hard: producer Rock knew how to make their groove much fatter and got them focusing on melody as well as heaviness. The Black is too poppy to be real metal but is good for what it is, as is this. But neither is as good as Puppets, which has their most intense moments.

  This is a great thrash album, but that genre gets real old if you want music as well as power. But if power and release is all you want, this will do it for you. But if you really want that, go to the various (FREEEEE!!!) Metallica tape-trading sites and get the live shows from this and later periods; that's where the real heaviness lays. Funny that the best stuff is free, ain't it? Who says life is always unfair?"
A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,9714721180,1,-1,3.0,"Metallica is boldly and appropriately named as it's virtually impossible to have any meaningful discussion about the Heavy Metal genre without any mention being made about the vast impact that this band has made over the 80s and up to the mid 90s.  They lifted up the genre from mindless, juvenile topics of wild sex, drugs and fast cars to discussions about serious topics from the meaninglessness of war to environmental disasters and so forth.  What U2 did for pop/rock, Metallica did for Metal in blending intelligent topics with very, very good musicianship and hence making the genre more accessible to a much wider audience than ever before.  In doing so, they extended the life of Metal and ensured an audience at a time when people were more interested in synth-pop ala Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones etc.  Metal owes a great debt to this band for ensuring the endurance and evolution of the genre to what it is to this day.

This version of the 1984 album comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very, very well executed and is one of the best that I've ever seen.  The gatefold sleeve is made from very good quality thick cardboard and assembled so well that you don't fear it coming apart easily once the glue starts to get old.  Also included is a 12 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese.  For the English ones you'll need a good magnifying glass to read it from the gatefold sleeve itself which very faithfully replicates the original lp design.

Unfortunately, the sound quality is the same as it was in the original release and hence has not been remastered.  Although good by 1980s standards, the quality is not as good as what we have become used to with all the releases that have been well remastered these days.  For this reason, although the content is very good, I cannot give this version 5 stars as it's hard to justify the value proposition here as you are effectively paying for the mlps design only if you already have the album.  I suppose if you don't already have this or if you are a big fan of well-designed and executed mlps sleeves then you may be tempted to cough up the mulah for this.  If the sound had been remastered and hence improved over the original cd, I would have no hesitation to give this the full 5 stars and to recommend that you part with your hard-earned dough for this.  With ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade To Black"" you are getting two of Metallica's best ever tracks here and again contentwise you can't fault this album but you'll have to decide if the overall value proposition of this version of the album is worthy of the upgrade."
A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,9714721180,1,1,4.0,"After the blistering debut Metallica delve further into their psyche, further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated NWOBHM muse. And it's a more difficult metal experience in general, the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument. Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener.

After that however the differences start seeping in. Ride The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I'm not sure it needs it. For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it's excellent musical and lyrical assault. The production values on this album seem a little dull, the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door.

But the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release. The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu. And the literary references are a nice touch. Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends (hey, we've all been there), it's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it.

All up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice. There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there. But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff. In fact I'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it's debut Kill `Em All through to the black album. If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum."
A2582KMXLK2P06,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Ride the Lightning is the one Metallica album that seriously has a lot of aggressive power and remains a classic to this day.  While I'm not particularly thrilled with a few moments here and there, overall it's much better than what many of the metal bands in the mid 80's were doing (with all their big hair, constant partying and chicks).  Metallica's music remains fresh and exciting all these years later.  This album was REALLY underrated back in the mid 80's.  People back then didn't know how to approach something with this much speed and punch.

Fight Fire With Fire- a plodding guitar riff, and the idea for an acoustic intro is ripped off from a couple old Black Sabbath tunes.  The verse melody is horrible but the chorus is decent.

Ride the Lightning- the best part of the song is the 15-second guitar intro.  I love that.  Great chorus as well that remains memorable no matter how many times it's played.  Great guitar solo as well.  Some parts of the solo remind me of the mid 70's Rainbow song called ""Light in the Black"".

For Whom the Bell Tolls- let's just call it the way it is- this is a classic metal track in the same way ""Iron Man"" is Black Sabbath's classic.

Fade to Black- a softer number that gradually builds into a much heavier and typical Metallica track.  It's not really a ballad.  It's a shame the verse melody has been copied time and time again by Metallica themselves as early as their Black Album in the early 90's.  The original idea was right here on this album.  The lyrics don't sound very emotionally honest though.  I like the second half of the song more even though parts of the guitar solo sound ripped off from Black Sabbath's ""Snowblind"".

Trapped Under Ice- flashy guitar playing that sounds like a leftover from the Kill 'em All album.  Not that that's a bad thing, mind you.

Escape- really good song, though the chorus sounds stuck in the 80's with that dated sound.  I like the way the verse melody chugs along.  Great lyrics by their standards too.

Creeping Death- another memorable heavy/speed metal track.  These guys were clearly more talented than most.  The guitar solo sure sounds like it was copied from a popular Scorpions song at the time.

Call of Ktulu- a very slow, rocking build up.  It's really good but 9 minutes might tire out some people.

You need to have at least one Metallica album in your collection, and none of them are better than this one.  Get it."
A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"RIDE THE LIGHTENING, Metallica's second album, is notable for its musical direction, combining thrash metal with more symphonic, and much more complex, songwriting than previously seen in metal music.

When Metallica recorded their debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Em-All/dp/B000002H5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill 'Em All</a>, the record was brutal, fast, and noholds barred.  The music barrels ahead, and there isn't nearly as many different instrumental subtetlies and flourishes that Metallica would later use to adorn their music with.  Instead, the focus was to play the music as loud, and as fast, as humanly possible.  They sounded rather like their contemporaries in drawing from the same overall musical milieu.  A lot of bands from NWOBHM (""New Wave of British Heavy Metal"") were covering a lot of the same territory, such as Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Motorhead, early Def Leppard (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Through-the-Night/dp/B000001F7R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Through the Night</a>, their 1980 album, not their hair metal stuff), Saxon and other bands considered part of that movement..

Beginning with this record, and culminating in ... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, Metallica changed their approach.  Still retaining the aggression and attitude of punk, mixed with the loud, bone-crunching amalgamation heavy metal sound popularized the major bands of NWOBHM then put in progressive songwriting that owes as much to classical music as pop or rock or traditional heavy metal, and you have a good idea of what RIDE THE LIGTHENING,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Master-of-Puppets/dp/B000002H33/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Master of Puppets</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/And-Justice-For-All/dp/B000002H6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">...And Justice For All</a>&nbsp;sounds like.  Those three records are what I call their progressive metal trilogy; with each album their song writing got more complex and more symphonic.

As much as I like KILL `EM ALL, this is the album in which Metallica really comes into their own.  While KILL `EM ALL has some very strong songwriting, they don't display the same complexity and melodic integrity as they do on this record. All over we see Metallica opening their sound up.

""Fire with Fire"": The soft intro to ""Battery"" from MASTER feels like a nod to the great acoustic intro to the opening track, ""Fire for Fire"".  After the mellow intro, the band kicks the song into high gear.  This shift is clear evidence the band is mastering different dynamics and integrating shifting tempos into a coherent song structure, and they're not just brutally fast like KILL `EM ALL.

""Ride the Lightening"" is one of Metallica's more epic compositions.  Lyrically the song sets up themes of being powerless in a hostile situation, a theme Hetfield would often return too.

""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" deals with the futility of war, another theme the and would revisit on both MASTER and JUSTICE, and is titled after the Earnest Hemingway novel.  One of the band's more famous early songs.  The intro is pretty long, at over two minutes before Hetfield starts singing.

""Fade to Black"" is notable as it is the first ballad ever commercially released by the band.  [Just because they were labeled sell outs during the load era doesn't mean it diddn't happen fore then.]  Those people who hate LOAD and RELOAD should take note that accusations that Metallica sold out first surfaced with this very song, due to how much of a departure this was for the band's clearly established sound.  Now, however, most fans and critics, as well as the band itself, considered this one of Metallica's great songs.  The song is very much a study in dynamics, and while it is primarily a slower ballad, Metallica works in some heavy passages in the song as well.  The song deals mainly with death, and is considered a ""suicide classic"".  This is one of Metallica's most important songs, as it showed the band's fan base there was a lot more to the band than just mind numbingly fast thrash.

""Trapped Under Ice"" has some killer chorus work and interesting lyrics.  Musically it's very solid as well.  The song has some absolutely intense guitar work.  Probably the second weakest song though, next to ""Escape.""  Metallica has only performed the song four times live.

""Escape"" is one of the few songs the band has never played live.  Written as filler because they didn't have enough songs for the album, the band has pretty much disavowed the song.  While I don't know why the band hates it that much, it is True that this is easily the weakest song on the entire album, though not necessarily bad par se.  It's just the other songs are that good.

""Creeping Death"", written from the point of view of the angel of death coming to kill all the first born in Egypt, remains one of the band's principal early epics, and is still one of their most frequently played songs.  Drawing their inspiration from the movie THE TEND COMMANDMENTS, Cliff Burton made the observation that the plague of the first born was like creeping death, and the band wanted to use it for a title they liked it so much.  One of the band's most famous of their early songs, this one's an undeniable thrash classic.

And last, but definitely not least, is ""The Call of Ktula"".  The second instrumental released by the band (after Anethestia, Pulling Teeth from KILL `EM ALL), this is the last song primarily written by David Mustaine of Megadeath fame that Metallica would record. Originally entitled ""When Hell Freezes Over"", Cliff Burton had the song renamed, because he was a H. P. Lovecraft fan and was referencing THE CALL OF CTHULHU.  Megadeath actually uses the chords for their song ""Hanger 18"". Discounting the two covers ""Tuesday's Gone"" and ""Mercyful Fate"" it's the band's fourth longest recording, and the longest song on RIDE THE LIGHTENING.  For my money, this is one of my favorite Metallica songs, and when I really started listening to this album in the late 1990s, this was the song I would play over and over.  It's much better than MASTER's instrumental ""Orion"".  Absolutely brilliant, even if Mustaine did write it.

Overall, this is the album that would set Metallica on the artistic path they would follow for the rest of the 1980s.  This is the album they became truly progressive.  If it weren't for ""Escape"", this could arguably be one of their top albums; as it stands, this is still one of Metallica's best records, just only slightly flawed for the inclusion of ""Escape"".  And it's important that while hair metal and spandex were giving metal a bad name, bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden were still keeping the hardcore music close to its roots.  Hair metal and glam/pop is rather dated.  It's too Metallica's credit that their albums stand up as well as they do and aren't dated at all, given they were, recorded in that same era of Def Leppard, Poison (damn Brett Michaels), Ratt, Slaughter, Warrant, Stryper, Europe, Journey, and other rather ridiculous bands were doing commercial hair metal and power ballads."
A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"This is only Metallica's 2nd album, but already they were turning into a great, ""thinking man's"" heavy metal.  Sometimes I like to think this is Metallica's debut, because this is really the first album where they became Metallica.  Many early fans bemoan Metallica's later albums, wanting them to return to the days of thrash metal with Kill 'Em All (their weakest album in my opinion).  They say they sold out by using slower tempos and multi instrumentation (like pedal steel guitars and hurdy-gurdy).  The reality is that Metallica has always been ambitious, and here on their 2nd album, they prove in conclusively.  This is a fantastic album, one that has really stood the test of time (it was made over 20 years ago, and still sounds fresh today).  It is loaded with classic Metallica tracks.  The thrash opener Fight Fire with Fire, the fantastic title track, the brilliant For Whom the Bell Tolls, the magisterial, signature track Fade to Black, another majestic, signature track in Creeping Death (one of my all time favorites), and the brilliant, prog influenced instrumental that closes the album, The Call of Ktulu.  It is also interesting to note that Kirk Hammett has a much larger role on this album.  He co-wrote many of the songs, and his lead guitar doesn't seem thrown in like it did on Kill 'Em All.  This is one of my favorite Metallica albums.  It's the 2nd step in a discography that just keeps getting better."
A1OML05BTJBEKS,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Metallica's second album, and their first for a major record label Elektra, entitled Ride the Lightning is also arguably their best album ever.
First released in August of 1984, Ride the Lightning was considered a metal masterpiece in the underground at the time of its release.
After the promising debut album Kill 'em All in 1983, Metallica (which was comprised of singer/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich and the late great bass player Cliff Burton), the band's cult following got them a major record deal with Elektra Records and the band went to Denmark with the band themselves producing and using one-time Rainbow engineer Flemming Rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which I found to be the case when I first got this album in May of 1989 on cassette.
The album starts off with ""Fight Fire With Fire"" which at first sounded like it was going to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars playing a relaxing melody but then Hammett and Hetfield's guitars come screaming in as was Ulrich's drumming which sounded like Bruce Lee on speed and Burton's bass playing which was superb. James' vocals on the track sounded sinister. We continue the rocking on the album's classic title cut which is a classic thrashy cut with tempo changes that would make the prog rockers happy. Next is another classic metal track ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" which is a superb rocker with a beat that sounds like marching off to war. The first half ends with ""Fade to Black"" which for the most part was a ballad before speeding up and was IMHO the Stairway to Heaven of the 80s as, like that song, starts soft then picks up then softens then gets harder and harder before the big finale.
The album's second half kicks off with a classic thrash number called ""Trapped Under Ice"" which is just superb. Next is another great metal number ""Escape"". However, it's a shame that these two great songs are overlooked by many. We then come to one of Metallica's best pre-1991 masterworks ""Creeping Death"" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing. We end the album with the epic instrumental called ""The Call of Ktulu"" which sounds like the band had been listening to ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes as the piece is filled with tempo changes, key changes and is just stellar, especially Hammett and Burton's solos on guitar and wah-wah bass respectively.
While Ride the Lightning scraped the Top 100 upon its release without either radio or MTV or even mainstream media support, the album today is now their third largest selling album with some five million copies sold in the US alone today.
Most Metallica fans from 1991 onward probably don't like this album but us purists who liked their speed metal sound in their early days then this album is for you.
Highly recommended!"
A1JIW8GOSSGUQR,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"There are many agruements of what the best Metallica album was. I have to say that Ride the Lightning was easily their best effort, and might be one of the top 10 metal records ever made. Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10, and every single tune is heavy as hell (except for Call of the Katula, but it does some crunching at the end) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again. True the Master of Puppets is great to, but I don't think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning. Master has really been worn out since I listened to it soooo much, that it really doesnt do it for me anymore. I still love Ride the Lightning as they day I bought it in 1986. ENJOY!"
A2H22I2RWE0HOV,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"The division between Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning is huge.  The albums sound like two different bands.  Amazing.  Where KEA was juvenile and garage-bandish, Ride The Lightning was the polished effort.  Don't get me wrong, a lot of great songs came from KEA, but Ride The Lightning is better.  Fight Fire With Fire opens up the album (back when it was an actual album) and never looks back!  Absolute pure shred!  Ride The Lightning, Creeping Death, Fade To Black, & For Whom The Bell Tolls!  All Classics!  Their first really professional effort for Electra, with the final batch of Dave Mustaine co-written tunes. Clearly one of the greatest metal albums of all time.

Dig it!"
A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Metallica.  Once brought up into a conversation, two things pop into a mans mind.  One of a historically important Thrash band, that made an impact upon almost anybody who cared to listen, and a historically important band that practically changed their name to Nutallica and also practically sold their souls for money.  Both of these are True, but the first is so fresh and original and important that to this very day, we still love these songs.  The True Metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best.  Although there are only 8 songs here, they are all of a decently long length and are all so beautiful that you never want them to end.  This was Metallica, not the Metallica of today with 6 minute songs containing stupid lyrics, a trash can and no solos.  After the Black album pay no attention to them,  you'll only be disappointed, but back to this album.  Kill `em All was the beginning of Metallica, and here on their second album, they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of Hit the lights or Whiplash (great songs but not important lyrically speaking).  Almost all of these songs are about Death.  Not death in the sense of Cannibal Corpse's Hammer Smashed Face, but more so in that that each is about a different issue, and makes a point and has something important to say.  With a short break down I'll show what I mean.

1. Fight Fire with Fire 10/10: one of the best and fastest metallica songs in my opinion.  This one is about Nuclear Warfare

2. Ride the Lightning 10/10: Beautiful solos, a song that you'll be happy to have stuck in your head.  This one is about the Electric Chair.

3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 10/10: slower, but one of the most important tracks here.  It's about the Spanish Civil war and also has something to do with H.P. Lovecraft, an author whom Kirk has a fascination with.

4. Fade to Black 9/10: a friend of mine finds this to be relatively boring.  In my opinion you need to be in the right mood for this song.  But when you are in the mood, this song rocks.  It is about Suicide, and from what I understand this song was also controversial because a man killed himself while listening to it back in the 80's.

5. Trapped Under Ice 8/10: Great song, the solos are great, the atmosphere is great.  It's about, well, being trapped under ice.

6. Escape 8/10: the only song not about death, more so about escaping from a town that wants you to be a certain way, and therefore rebelling.  Remember, 8/10 still means good, it's just that track 1-4 are classics.

7. Creeping Death 9/10: It's told through the eyes of the Grim Reaper.  An all around great song.  I love the middle part.

8. The Call of Ktulu 10/10: A beautiful instrumental, once again about an H.P. lovecraft story. I actually read this one and it's a good read, very strange.  In my opinion, this is far better than Orion from Master of Puppets, but that's just my opinion.

There is something about Ride the Lightning that I can not explain with any other record.  It has this strange dusty feeling to it.  When glancing at a copy of it, it appears to be rather old and unused (even a brand new copy).  Popping it into a CD player, the production has this weird dusty feeling to it that has the same feeling.  But when listening to it, it seems like a gem or relic that one has discovered in the attic of an old house.  It has this mystic atmosphere to it that can not be replicated or understood really.  James's voice also has a rough edge to it as well that isn't on other Metallica records.  This is my favorite Metallica record, as I can listen to it from start to finish and NEVER become bored at all.  Anyone who likes metal should have some Metallica in their collection.  I don't consider them to be the best metal band in history, (as a matter of fact I don't give that title to any band) but this is a valuable history lesson from the world of thrash.  Metallica were once great, people listened to metallica for those beautiful solos, for the touching and fun lyrics and song meanings.  But if you want a great drummer than look elsewhere because Lars is easily disposable, and I could name [insert any number here] of drummers that are better than him.  Lars just does enough to get by but he'll still have his moments of talent, though in this present day, I don't think there is a single person who doesn't want to just punch him in the face.  Well enough about this album, just find it, get it in your collection and enjoy.  Hoped this helped."
ASVNSWIXBV72Q,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Metallica's second album, 1984's ""Ride the Lightning,"" was the first real metal album I ever bought. When I bought it, I was looking for a really heavy album, so when the first track began with an acoustic intro, I was sorely disappointed. Luckily, however, I skipped to the next song, the title track, and its booming intro brought a big smile to my face. Ah, nostalgia.

With 1983's ""Kill `Em All,"" Metallica helped create thrash metal; but they followed up their debut with their sophomore album, which was released only a year later. Most metalheads have given it the credit it deserves, but I feel ""Ride the Lightning"" is still somewhat underrated, since the album that followed this one was ""Master of Puppets.""

""Ride the Lightning"" is still fast. Most of it shoots by like...well, lightning; but it's slower, darker, heavier and more mature than ""Kill `Em All."" James' voice is somewhat lower than it was, and his lyrics are improved. As the above Amazon editorial review mentions, James discusses several different ways to die: Armageddon, capitol punishment, suicide, being trapped under ice, etc.

""Fight Fire with Fire"" has the aforementioned acoustic intro, but it's just a tease-it doesn't last. The power chords fade in and the song becomes a breakneck speed, with rip-roaring, almost Slayer-esque guitar work. Lyrically, this songs seems to be about the Apocalypse.

""Ride the Lightning"" is the album's most popular single. It's another thrashy number, with booming rhythms, fiery chug and churn riffs (which go from fast to faster to slow to fast), and an awesome, lengthy Hammett solo. ""Ride the Lightning"" has good lyrics about being executed by the electric chair, and it also has a surprise ending, but most of this song is an instrumental.

""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is slower paced, but still loud and heavy. The first two minutes of this song is an instrumental, beginning with a bell ringing, then the heavy, repetitive, churning guitars kick in. This song has another good, winding solo near the end.

""Fade to Black"" is really morbid because it has depressing, introspective lyrics about suicide. It begins with a distant guitar solo, but the acoustic strums actually make the first part of this song rather pretty. (Pretty in a dark and depressing way, but pretty nonetheless.) The choruses still have heavy riffs, and the end is an ascending and cascading solo.

""Trapped Under Ice"" is very fast paced with another short but sweet guitar solo near the middle.

""Escape"" has vocals which make it radio ready (it has good vocal hooks). Most of the song has propulsive riffs with thunderous drumming, but the choruses are slower.

""Creeping Death"" begins with machine gun guitars and drumming, before changing to another fast beat with guitars that burn straight ahead. And, of course, there's another stellar solo near the end.

""The Call of KTULU"" is the album's instrumental. In my opinion, this song IS as great as ""Orion"" (from Metallica's next album, ""Master of Puppets,"") and it's a very good way to end the album. It starts out slowly and ominously with wind wooshes, but then it suddenly becomes a lot faster. This song builds well and has superb guitar and drum work.

So, this disc is another wonderful landmark album and it's still one of the best C.D.'s of the past two decades. All of the qualities of a classic metal or thrash metal album are here: long songs (about 6 minutes per song), rapid fire riffs, ripping solos, an instrumental track, and even some acoustic guitar licks. In conclusion, if you want a complete metal collection, or if you just like heavy metal, you need this album more than you need your next breath."
AE42JLYPXUI45,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"In 1984, Metallica had released their sophmore album entitled, RIDE THE LIGHTNING. This album turned out to be even better than KILL 'EM ALL. This album was definite in proving Metallica to be the best Heavy Metal act out there. This album has all the sound you could ever want from a Heavy Metal band.

FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE

This song is just astonishing. Any self-respecting Metallica fan would love this song. I sure as hell love this song.

RIDE THE LIGHTNING

Ah. The album's incredible title track. Can't get enough of this song and it sure can't get any better than this.

FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS

When I said it couldn't get any better than ""Ride The Lightning"", I was wrong. This album just keeps getting better, especially on this tune. Damn, this frigging guys can rock.

FADE TO BLACK

This song is my favorite off of the album. All I do is listen to this song a first time, then I start again for an encore presentation. If you listen carefully, you'll notice the song is talking about suicide. Gotta love this song.

TRAPPED UNDER ICE

Incredible.

ESCAPE

A great song with great lyrics and a rockin' sound.

CREEPING DEATH

As much as I love hearing this one, it creeps me out because of the title. But I can't help it when I just sing along with James on this one.

THE CALL OF KTULU

Instrumental song.

What an album! These guys know what fans want in a Heavy Metal album. This band is definitely going to be here for a long a** time. So get up off your a** and buy this album if you don't have it already."
A3TKL7X26QKKMO,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"This is Metallica's second album Ride The Lighting which was released in 1984. Although it's not as good as Master Of Puppets, but it's still a classic gem. Picking up where their debut album Kill'Em ALL left off, Ride The Lightning has better production. The opening track Fight Fire With Fire starts off with a little accoustic intro, and suddenly warps into thrashing speed and will have you headbanging throughout. The title cut is another menacing headbanging track as well. For Whom The Bell Tolls and the awesome thrash ballad Fade To Black are two of the band's most popular songs. Creeping Death is another great song, and of course the closing track The Call Of Ktulu is an epic instrumental. James Hetfield's vocals are good, and his rhythm guitarwork is good as well. Kirk Hammet's lead guitarwork is splendid. Cliff Burton's bass lines are very menacing, and Lars Ulrich's drumming is good as well. Anyways, this is a great album and should be a part of your collection. Buy it now! R.I.P Cliff Burton

A3BQCZNB97XUNY,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Is it me, or was just about everything a lot cooler in the past? For instance, back in the '80s, Metallica was known for pounding, crushing, headbanging METAL, and now they're known for ripping fans off and liking money. It's a sad state of affairs.

But I digress. ""Ride The Lightning"" is easily one of the most awesome, headbanging, and skilled metal albums ever recorded. It rightfully earns its place in every metalhead's favorite album list. Insane drumming, loud riffs, blistering solos, and actual melody worked into the mix... once again, THIS is Metallica! From the intense, apocolyptic opener ""Fight Fire With Fire"", to the epic ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", the beautifully written semi-ballad ""Fade To Black"", and, of course, the metal classic ""Creeping Death"", this album grabs a hold of the listener, and never lets go throughout the whole album!

Anyway, yeah, this one's a classic. Buy it, and steer clear of emo!"
AX94XE2KY5WK4,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"If Metallica's 1983 ""Kill 'Em All"" wrote the book on thrash metal, then their sophomore release ""Ride The Lightning"" re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of. It was simply revolutionary at the time. Since ""Kill 'Em All"", the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents, technique and their approach with this groundbreaker. Every track offers something new, and experimental. The instruments aren't the only improvement. Hetfield's lyrics are much more personal, and conscious. The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from ""Kill 'Em All"" out of the water. Tracks such as ""Fade To Black"" and ""The Call of Ktulu"" were absolutely phenomenal works, untouched by the standards of 1984. And although it's up for debate, Hammett's guitar solos are my favorite on this album. Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on ""Ride The Lightning"", that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen, and still does to this day. Other highlights include ""Fight Fire with Fire,"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". This album rocks in epic proportions.

Overall, Metallica ruled the world at this point in time. There was no limits to their re-invention of raw, hardcore thrash metal. I was a huge Metallica fan growing up, and this one got spun the most. This is a absolute must have for anyone that claims they are a Metallica fan."
A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"THE 2ND ALBUM FROM METALLICA IS ANOTHER HEAVY METAL MASTERPIECE. AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLY EVEN MORE ENTERTAINING THAN ''KILL EM ALL''! AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CD ARE ''TRAPPED UNDER ICE'', ''THE CALL OF KTULU'', ''FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE'' AND ''FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS''. BETWEEN THE MONSTROUS GUITAR RIFFS AMD JAMES HETFIELD'S INTENSE VOCALS, I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT! FOR METALHADS, THIS IS NONSTOP EXCITEMENT. OTHERS SHOULDN'T EVEN CHECK THIS OUT."
A366JNHOWLQWQQ,9714721180,1,1,4.0,"This is one of Metallica's pure best. Classic songs, good lyrics, adrenaline, and youth. The band was really coming together with this one. No MTV to sell to, little real radio support, this was the boys pounding out some of their best songs. Some of them are a little rough around the edges, production quality and musicianship reached its best with the next album, but this one is very good."
AYCOHV27P91NM,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Metallica's ride the lightning is a great cd. It is tied foe my favorite Metallica cd. The best four songs on the cd were ""Ride the Lightning"" ""Fade to Black"" ""For whom the bell tolls"" and ""Creeping Death"". My favorite two songs from those four are creeping death and ride the lightning. The other four songs are still very good. Overall, Ride the Lightning is a great cd, and one of the best of Metallica."
A36489F4G8T4E7,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"This album is just plain good and very well worth owning. Ride the lightning is not as raw or fast as kill em all was,but its heavier and the production is better. It's a step up from their previous album. GO OUT AND BUY THIS TODAY!!!"
A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Ride The Lightning is one of the best albums of the thrash/speed metal genre and along with their next album Master of Puppets is Metallica's best work. While their first album Kill 'Em All relied more on speed metal, Ride The Lightning showed the band expanding their musical horizons and their songwriting abilities, which would lead to their breakthrough in America.
Every track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics. The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs, death, and the struggle within. There is much diversity to be found here whether it's the excellent speed metal of ""Fight Fire With Fire"" and ""Trapped Under Ice"" or the longer epics ""The Call Of Ktulu"", the title track, and the awesome ""Creeping Death."" The menacing ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Escape"" are also very strong tracks. Then there's ""Fade To Black"", the best track the band has ever recorded, and is to heavy metal what ""Stairway To Heaven"" is to classic rock. This is simply an incredible song, between its several different movements and its lyrics which tell of a man contemplating suicide. The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song's outro is one of the best ever of the genre. Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal. Highly recommended."
A2WFT4BUHNQZ1X,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Although many people say that The Black Album or Master of Puppets are Metallica's best albums, don't get me wrong they're great albums and they're in the 5 star worthy material but Ride the Lightning is my favorite Metallica and quite possibly my favorite thrash metal album, I think that 5 stars is not enough for Ride the Lightning, I easily give this album an 11.
'Fight Fire With Fire' starts off with a soft intro and it turns into a thrash metalhead's heaven and it's a killer song and I love the explosion at the end of the song. 10/10
'Ride the Lightning' is the title track and it's another Metallica classic although it isn't nearly as fast as the previous song but it's worthy enough to enter inside a thrash metalhead's mind. 8/10
'For Whom the Bell Tolls' starts off with the tolling bell and although I didn't think much for this song at first but the chorus lines helped me like this song and the tolling bells is awesome. 10/10
'Fade to Black' is a bit slower and softer than the previous songs they've done but Metallica can do a slower song very well (that is up until they're Load stuff) and the loud guitar's somewhat reminds me of Black Sabbath's Iron Man which is also a classic, and there are more songs to come that have the same vein as 'Fade to Black'. 10/10
'Trapped Under Ice' is probably my least favorite song off of this album but it's still a good song especially compared to their post-Black Album era. 7/10
'Escape' is probably the most underrated song off of this album and I actually like this song alot, and I wish that the same thing can be said with the other Metallica fans. 9/10
'Creeping Death' is another standout for this album and it's one of their heaviest songs off of this album. 10/10
'The Call of Ktulu' is the closing track and believe it or not, I actually didn't think much for this song but I gave it a few listens and now this is my favorite song off of this album and I could listen to this song like 5 times in a row and never get tired of it, Ride the Lightning is worth it for the price of this song alone and this song is easily one of heavy metal's best instrumentals of all time. 10/10
If you never heard of anything that Metallica has done before the Black Album? Then you're going to be in for a total surprise and this is the way how Metallica first started, if you liked the later Metallica stuff then you should get into their early stuff when they were total thrash but the best of both worlds, Metallica is now the MTV Icons."

A2K150EBPF8LT7,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Do you remember when Metallica used to rock? I mean, they still rock(well, sort of), but do you remember when they used to ROCK? If you don't, I suggest you get Ride The Lightning ,not now, but right now! If you aren't convinced, check out this imaginary conversation between me and a potential customer:
hiphopforlife(ME): Welcome to my review of Metallica's second album, Ride The Lightning. before I start, let me give you some background on the band......
Average Joe:Whoa, hold on. If your name is hiphopforlife, what are you doing reviewing a Metallica album?
hiphopforlife: Be patient, homeboy. Yes I am black and the biggest lover of hip hop alive, but I am no joke as far as hard rock and metal go, since my taste ranges from Tool(LOVE EM!), Dream Theater(very underrated),Creed(very overrated),Limp Bizkit, Testament,Nirvana,Pantera,Slayer, Korn and Metallica;my first album was And Justice For All ten years ago
(anotheralbum you should pick up). I am more than qualified to
review this album. Now on to buisness. Ride The Lightning is the second album from the artists formerly known as Metallica. While their first album, Kill 'Em All, was raw and off the wall as you can get, the guys calmed down(somewhat calmed down) and created one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever; and the scary part is that the album after this one, Master Of Puppets(a legend in it's own time) is BETTER! It starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, arguably Metallica's fastest song. Ride The Lightning is up next, which brilliantly looks into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair. For Whom The Bell Tools relaxes on the speed, but cranks up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player Cliff Burton. Fade to Black is next, which is Metallica's attempt and sucess at a ""power ballad""...
Average Joe:Hold on ,hiphop;this has a ballad? Don't tell me that Metallica's gone Barbra Striesand or worse,Bon Jovi on us?
hiphopforlife:To quote one of my rap idols, Ice Cube, KILL THAT NOISE! They have not wimped out by any means(the wimping out will be in 7 years).This is the second best metal ballad of all time(Sanitarium on Master Of Puppets is of course, number one. It is excellently written and sung by James Hetfield(the greatest metal vocalist of all time; sorry Ozzy).Trapped Under Ice and Escape are next; and to be honest, these two songs are just okay, in my opinion,which is why most people rank Master Of Puppets higher than Ride The Lightning; they aren't horrible, just okay. But the pace definitely picks up with the next two songs; DO NOT SKIP THEM! Creeping Death expounds on James' Christian scientist upbringing with a story on how Moses frees the Isrealites; it has a great middle part which makes the whole song worthwhile. Now it all comes down to the final song; the Call OF Ktulu, a superbly constructed instrumental which showcases all four members of the band's talents, especially the aforementioned Cliff Burton, who wraps up his title of the greatest bass player of all time.  That's Ride The Lightning, one of the most influential records from metal's most influential band. I would advise you to pick this up YESTERDAY, if not sooner.
Average Joe: Thanks hiphop; you sold me. You are the greatest reviewer ever.
And you, dear reader, will be sold as well on the past greatness of the band once known as Metallica. Get Ride The Lightning, as well as their whole 80's catalog(and the Black album ,if you must)."
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"Contrary to just about everyone else saying ""Master of Puppets"" is Metallica's best album, I have always felt ""Ride the Lightning"" was Metallica's finest, and my all time favorite album.  The album starts off with ""Fight Fire With Fire"", a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield, and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  The title track deals with whats on the cover, awaiting execution in the electric chair.  The track also showcases Lars Ulrich's double bass drums.  ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", one of Metallica's most recognized songs, showcases every band member's talents, especially Cliff Burton's sonic bass assault.  Up next is ""Fade to Black"", a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide, and this as well has become one of Metallica's most popular songs.  The song has a special meaning to me personally, it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard, and it helped me through some bad times.  ""Trapped Under Ice"" is about, of all things, being frozen suffocating under ice.  The lyrics give a chilling (no pun intended) feel to it, and the song has a great chorus.  ""Escape"" is hte only song that could be classified as ""filler material"", but it is a solid track in itself.  Next up is ""Creeping Death"", which is a concert staple to this day, and contains biblical references as lyrics.  This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents.  The final track, the instrumental ""Call of Ktulu"" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar.  The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more, but that's not really much of a complaint.  All in all, ""Ride the Lightning"" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and the second of the first five Metallica albums that are essential to every metal fan's collection."
A3CBNR1SZJJJDE,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"I bought Ride the Lightening upon its release in 1984 when I was in 8th grade. My friends practically laughed me out of school for liking such ""[junk]"". Motley Crue and Ratt were the real metal bands back then. Well, I never have been one to be affected by peer pressure so I stuck to my guns. By the time we graduated in 1988 everyone of those guys who made fun of me in junior high were Metallica fans and they were the biggest metal band of the 80s. Here it is almost 20 years after its release and I still believe it is the best metal album ever made, even though I fell out of the Metallica camp by the early 90s and a lot of great metal albums have been released since."
AAOMG1YP0VNP9,9714721180,1,1,4.0,"This is one of the best metal albums ever! I think most would agree that Master Of Puppets is better and I think I go against most people when I say that I prefer Kill Em All, but still this is fantastic.
After releasing the killer (and at the time - original) debut, Metallica they release an even better album! Fight Fire With Fire sounds a bit cliched today with the quiet intro but it is one excellent song. Ride The Lightning is another great song and For Whom The Bell Tolls is quite sludgy and very good. They don't make riffs like that anymore! Then comes one of the best Metallica songs ever: Fade To Black. This is a quieter song which builds up progressively and is excellent. Trapped Under Ice and Escape are not so good but are listenable and they don't have me reaching for the skip button. Creeping Death is another excellent Metallica song and along with Fade To Black is one of the albums highlights. Then comes The Call Of The Ktulu. This is probably THE best metal instrumental I've ever heard! And to think that Lars was the only member of the band who was over 20 at the time - you won't find musical maturity like that in most bands - never mind that young - and certainly no nu-metal band will have it today.
This belongs in any True Metalheads collection - there aren't many albums that are better than this."
ARHOZP9Y49IH4,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"I have the very original release of the LP on the metal indie Megaforce, released just before Elektra here signed them and reissued the LP only a few months later, making the Megaforce original a collector's item.  Just total kick@$s metal all the way! The bonus CD could be ""Jump in the Fire"", but I aine sure.  On Vertigo or Sony (Japan)."
ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,9714721180,1,1,4.0,"It's like this baby: Metallica helped define thrash metal in the 80s. With Kill 'Em All, they proved that they could play hard, fast, and with reams of energy. However, the subsequent release of Ride The Lightning proved to be a more thought-out collection of songs. Hetfield's peerless riffing is more refined, and his growling vocals are coming along (he still wasn't too great, though). Hammett's solos are mostly exciting, and he became one of the most copied lead guitarists around (in metal). Even Ulrich, whose drumming was always relatively simple, fits well with the music is gives it a crushing edge. Metallica has never been too focused on bass, so I feel sorry for Cliff Burton he doesn't really get too much attention. He still plays an important role in adding extra punch to the riffs, but one thing that's nice about Metallica's newer work is that the production is more accommodating to the different instruments. (Just a small gripe.)
Anyway, this album tells you what Metallica was all about. The highlight of Ride the Lighting one of my favorite Metallica songs, ""Fade to Black."" It's a great anti-suicide song, that starts with slow, lugubrious guitar that builds up into heavy, powerful riffs. It concludes with exhilarating, punchy riffs and a glistening solo. Fans have written to Metallica saying that this song deterred them from taking the course of suicide...that's how good it is!
""Call of Ktulu"", the big instrumental, is almost symphonic in its interplay (which is why it works so well with the orchestra on S&M). ""Creeping Death"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" are heavy, clomping thrash songs with interesting progressions and killer riffs. ""Fire Fire with Fire"" is mindless thrash with lots of kick. ""Trapped under Ice"" is tight speed metal.
Ride the Lightning isn't as ambitious or complex as Metallica's follow-ups, Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. However, most of the songs are great one way or another. Here, Metallica driven by pure intensity and delivers a great, great metal album."
A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ,9714721180,1,1,4.0,"THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, rhythm guitars), Kirk Hammett (lead guitars), Cliff Burton (bass guitars), Lars Ulrich (drums & percussion).

THE DISC: (1984) 8 songs clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet with black & white band pictures, song credits/lyrics and thank you's. All music written by Metallica. Recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Label - Elecktra.

COMMENTS: I grew up with this album. Played the vinyl record in college so many times I wore it out (thank God for compact discs). This is still a classic Metallica album. However, decades later, I go back and forth with ""Ride The Lightning"". Thinking it totally shreds one week, and then the next week thinking it's so hard to get into. This album takes an acquired taste, and perhaps 'mood' is the better word. ""Lightning"" is Metallica finding their roots. Sure 6 of the 8 tracks are fragments of brilliance; atom splitting; rapid-fire assaults on the senses. The lightning quick songs are important in the band's library of songs. They had to go through these early stages to get to where they are today - so many years later. The title track is perhaps my favorite fast track on the album. The two slower songs - ""For Whom The Bells Toll"" and ""Fade To Black"" - are perhaps two of the best songs in the entire Metallica catalog. I can still listen to these songs anywhere, any time, any day. Both feature some amazing guitar work (both electric and acoustic). ""Call Of Ktulu"" is a 9 minute instrumental slugfest that I fell in love again with after their 'live' version on ""S&M"" simply blew me away. Decades after this release, it's still a classic in my book, but I have to be in the mood for it. Just a notch below ""Master Of Puppets"". Still a great disc."
A3M97WKI0FP3JF,9714721180,1,1,4.0,"Right up until last year, I was never really much of a Metallica fan.  Then for some reason, I decided to get Garage Inc..  That in turn was followed by Justice, Black, Load, Reload, S&M, Puppets, and now, Ride.  Before buying S&M, I deciding to get the Cunning Stunts DVD.  And  believe me, I really enjoyed the spectacular concert the guys performed,  particularly, ""Creeping Death"" (probably the best song on the  DVD), ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", and especially ""Kill/Ride  Medley"".  Those performances (along with the tracks on S&M) were  what prompted me to buy this CD. I was especially interested in hearing the  original versions of ""Fight Fire With Fire"" and ""Ride The  Lightning"" from the Medley.  And let me tell you, they are definitely  killer!  The machine-gun guitar and drum riffs were probably what made this  CD popular in the first place.  IMHO, Metallica help create speed/thrash  metal in the early/mid-80's.  Not only do you get the killer riffs, but you  also get the popular ""Fade To Black"" which is similar to  ""One"" in that it starts out really slow, then gradually picks up  speed before peaking at a fast guitar solo.  And then you have ""The  Call Of Ktulu"" which is an excellent instrumental by itself (however,  I prefer the S&M version; it sounds SO much better with the  orchestra!).
Being a new Metallica fan, so to speak, I can start to see  why many of the longtime fans out there don't prefer the newer stuff  they've put out (I personally like both of the Loads).  Ride (along with  Puppets and Justice) was unique in the sense that Jaymz and company had the  guts to put out something that would stand the test of time to this day.  Even though I've heard it only a few times, I'm starting to appreciate it  already!"
A1EKTLUL24HDG8,9714721180,1,1,5.0,"This is one of the best Metallica albums, behind only Master of Puppets and the self-titled ""Black"" album. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade to Black"" are two of their best songs, and there isn't a bad one. The songwriting is a HUGE leap over their debut, with some of their best lyrics, not to mention countless classic riffs and solos. This is a must-have."
AAOMG1YP0VNP9,B000002TTH,-1,-1,3.0,"...and the quality of Queensryche's music has done just that.
Promised Land is a strange album for Queensryche to release, mostly because they had just enjoyed mainstream success with the likes of Empire. In contrast, Promised Land is much darker, more brooding and certainly less mainstream (arguably the least mainstream album the band have ever released). And that's a good thing right? Well, not necessarily.
The fact that this is boring. Just because it is dark does not make it really intelligent. I respect the fact that they did what they wanted rather than lap up the commercial success like Metallica did at the same time. But that doesn't mean that everything they do is automatically brilliant because of it.
The fact is that this has hardly any decent songs to mention. It lacks the energy of Warning and Queensryche EP, the accessiblity of Empire and the brilliance of Operation Mindcrime. It does have the wierdness of Rage For Order but in a bad way since it is resorts to uninspired sluggishness rather than the sinister almost industrial feel of Rage For Order.
For an album that took 2 years to write and record, Queensryche don't have a lot to show for it. It seems like they were going out of their way to be different rather than just letting the music flow."
A1EYSN1T55SV7U,B000002TTH,1,-1,3.0,"I give Queensryche credit for trying something different with this album.  Clearly the music scene had changed immensely from their previous smash hit release ""Empire"", and yet Queensryche went is a direction of their own--not following the trends of the times.  And yet, this effort falls a bit flat in my estimation.  Maybe I am just like others who are fans of ""Empire"" and the epic ""Operation Mindcrime"" and shouldn't expect the band to remain the same.  Nonetheless, the catchiness of previous efforts is clearly lacking.  The song ""Disconnected"", which actually did make it to rock radio for a brief stint, sums up this album perfectly for me.  The first single released, ""I am I"" is one of the better tracks."
A331OF34UX4Y1K,B000002TTH,-1,-1,2.0,"After amazing albuns ""OPERATION MINDCRIME"" and ""EMPIRE"", this was a disapointment for me. Boring at the extreme, overproduced, it clearly show that the band was already losing their creativity vein."
ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B000002TTH,1,1,4.0,"Queensryche has evolved considerably over the past 20 years of their prolific careers. They've gone from fiery heavy metal in the days of their EP to the lush rock-opera of Operation: Mindcrime, to the sublime perfection of the commercially successful Empire, to their current status as a generic rock band. In the middle of these last two phases comes Promised Land. Compared to the remarkable accessibility of Empire, Promised Land is a little more difficult to appreciate. Living up to the amazing success and quality of Empire is nearly impossible, and I do not envy Promised Land for what it tried to do.
The problem lies in the fact that Promised Land's excellent songs are not as densely packed as those on Empire. Most of the songs are good, but not all the songs are excellent. There are moments of mediocrity that drag the album down from levels of excellence. The superlative production alleviates some of the boredom associated with the passable tracks, as do the thick wall-of-sound arrangements. However, interspersed amonst the middling pieces are some of the best tracks they've ever recorded, including some of the finest lyrics. The acoustic balladry of ""Bridge"" made for a lucrative single that deserved all its enjoined success. The sad, thoughtful ""Out of Mind,"" the ominous ""Lady Jane,"" and the hard rock trappings of ""Disconnected"" are all great. The True standouts are the stormy title track, with those monstrous arrangements and the harrowing tone, and the moving closer, ""Someone Else?"" The latter is the most un-Ryche song they've ever done, consisting only of piano and Geoff Tate's emotive vocals. The memorable piano riffs, thoughtful lyrics and Tate's passion are what makes this one special. Tate even strains on a note...guess he's human after all! Without the songcraft to elevate it to greatness, the production helps.
A good Queensryche, almost a great one. Still, it can't touch the monolithic status of Mindcrime and Empire. In terms of songcraft, those albums are the band's best."
A1EKTLUL24HDG8,B000002TTH,1,1,5.0,"Though not a True concept album like Operation: Mindcrime, Promised Land is an engaging conceptual-esque song cycle unified by simarily themed songs and myriad sound effects. From the opening collage of 9:28 AM we get right into the ""story"" with I Am I, which, along with The Bridge, was a minor album rock radio hit. Other standout tracks include Out of Mind, the epic title track, One More Time, and the personal, moving closing track Someone Else? which is made all the more poignant as it's arrangement consists solely of piano and Geoff Tate's world-class vocals. This is possibly the band's best set of lyrics ever, they are, for the most part, intensely personal, moving, and, at times, uplifting. Out of Mind, with it's conveyings of guilt and the sense of perspective it gives you, and the all too typical father/son story in The Bridge are the standouts in the lyrical department. The music and overall arrangements are also the best and most dense that Queensryche has ever put together. Though not their top album (that honor still belings to Mindcrime) this is one of their most interesting, and certainly one of their best."
A3IR5M75J6MDV4,B000006045,1,1,4.0,"A friend said I would love this band.  Well... it was good.  Rock, some nice songs, but not too memorable. I like tecnho, nice beats, good poetic lyrics.  This wasn't' quite that."
A3NZTWXHPPG41G,B000006045,1,1,5.0,One of the best trip hop albums ever.  Still terrific two decades later.
A1UN0CRXCIWMG9,B000006045,1,1,4.0,"I like most of the songs, but I find I can't listen to it over and over.  But great stuff to turn on in the background when I'm working."

AD44J46ASZDNA,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"Oddly this album leaves you in a state of highness and in a good way.  The beats along with the oddly transfixing voice of the artist leave me wanting and needing more, just like a drug."
ALWINJYUDI92N,B000006045,1,1,4.0,I purchase few complete CD's but this was one that I had to get. Most of the songs are really good and I love the smooth sound. I'm glad I've been introduced to trip hop.
AWSYTZ2I2MW0V,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"MEZZANINE is another masterpiece from MASSIVE ATTACK!!!! This is just the perfect music to relax and reflect about life...Its either great in a party!!!! It's amazing!!! The mix of REGGAE, HIP HOP, eletronic and ROCK are worderful on MEZZANINE!!! A MUSIC MASTERPIECE!!!! Try BLUE LINES and PROTECTION too....WELL DONE, MASSIVE ATTACK!!!!!"
A1F9Z42CFF9IAY,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"This is simply the best Massive Attack album. If you only get one of their albums, make it this one. It's hard to explain the vibe of this album but it's very cool indeed, more so than their other albums. I guess I would say it's a real smart album."
A8IFUOL8S9BZC,B000006045,1,1,4.0,"With a solid set of cold embraces, this massively influential trip-hop unit's most mature construct to date can fizzle off slightly in overly pseudo-cool but remains a must own for anyone interested in electronic music."
ADKHI1TUGAX4,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"There aren't many trip hop albums I have bought over the years that has managed to sound fresh every time I throw in the cd into my stereo or listen to it on my iPod. Massive Attack's 1998 classic ""Mezzanine"" is one of those few trip hop albums that still sounds as fresh today as I first heard it almost ten years ago. The music is a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beats, seductive male and female vocals, and a diverse mix of samples from bands like The Cure.

What I love about ""Mezzanine"" so much is that the music is dark and sinister. All the death/black metal bands in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as ""Mezzanine"" is. There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller. The first two songs ""Angel"" and ""Risingon"" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares. I can never get tired of listening to ""Teardrop"" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals. The production is neither too slick or too gritty. ""Mezzanine"" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless. Every song is a Massive Attack classic."
A25PM9JGHPU8EI,B000006045,1,-1,2.0,"Teardrop, with the mesmerizing vocals of Liz Fraser, is the standout track - unfortunately the rest doesn't quite measure up. Don't get me wrong - Mezzanine is a very ""listenable"" album, something that works well playing in the background at night (some tracks work especially well for seductive exploits). It's just that the rest of this album sounds like second-rate Portishead."
A2JAKHFYI88ZX0,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"This is one of my favorite trip hop albums. The first four tracks are just amazing, and have me repeating them over and over. The songs respectively are  ""Angel,"" ""Risingson,"" ""Teardrop,"" and ""Inertia Creeps"". ""Angel"" has a stark production featuring pointed beats and a distorted bassline that frames the vocal and a two-minute flame-out with raging guitars. ""Risingson"" is a dense, dark sounding song with a ton of dub throughout. ""Teardrop"" is an awesome song where they collabored with Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins. ""Inertia Creeps"" is a highlight with an atmospheric sound, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen. These songs are definately the highlight, and the other songs are still good, just not as good as these four in my opinion. Overall an awesome album that should have a place in every music collection."
A1HQWPU9DCL9Q8,B000006045,-1,1,5.0,"Massive Attack were one of the first gasps of trip-hop noticed outside of Bristol, and sadly they will be one of the last, it seems.  They are urban without the bounce and easy egotism of hip-hop.  They conveyed menace, but not the sinister pangs of angst echoed by Trent Reznor and Tori Amos during the same era.  They spoke volumes without words, and like Paul Oakenfold provoked an atmosphere, although Oakenfold reached for lofty heights while Massive Attack belongs in the darkened alleys and underground clubs.  Through its incarnations, Massive Attack has been an intellectual's house party in a 1930's brownstone in Chicago's Wicker Park, rain on the windows of a high-rise over L.A., and the smoke, mud and confusion of a college rave.

Mezzanine is complex, both within the tracks and in the connective tissue between them.  It is dark on the bright side, more a 4 a.m. flicker of streetlamp than a dawn of any sort.  Its power is in a balance of rhythm, drive and deep-seated anxiety that begs for further listen."
A3G10NPD661EQD,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"""Mezzanine"" is another classic album by the legendary group Massive Attack, and I would even argue that it's better (there aren't any bad songs and the best songs here are simply extraordinary)! The best tracks are the first four songs which deliver a 1-2-3-4 of such creative genius that it'll instantly make you a fan. Sometimes relaxing, sometimes haunting, and always groovy, ""Mezzanine"" delivers a worthwhile follow-up to ""Blue Lines"" that ""Protection"" failed to be. Like ""Blue Lines"", ""Mezzanine"" features several singers who are ALL very likable and charismatic (""Blue Lines"" suffered from the track ""One Love"" where the singer arguably kind of ruined the song). The lyrics aren't as memorable as on ""Blue Lines"", though, but you won't mind. Overall it's a much darker album than ""Blue Lines"" as it occasionally blends metal and industrial music with their trip-hop sound. Hip-hop and probably casual music fans will love this album. A word for the wise: the rest of the album might take a bit before you  realize how good it is. Anyways - very highly recommended along with their first album ""Blue Lines"" and Portishead's ""Portishead"" (though this one isn't as good).

Highlights include:
the entire album!"
AAV3HU72C3R3G,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"You've heard their music in commercials and movies and may not have realized it. I didn't until I picked this album up within the past six months. Of it, Blue Lines, and 100th Window (only ones I have), it's the best, and that is clearly in consensus with other MA fans. This is a very good album...just really interesting and exceptional musically.

If you're at all interested in this kind of music, you cannot go wrong with Mezzanine.

EDIT: I've actually been listening to this album more over the last 24 hours and am now of the opinion that it's more masterful than I originally thought. It's easily listenable from start to finish. There are no weak songs. If you think you've found a weak song, you've just not listened to it enough yet. This album will be especially enjoyable for somebody with a good sound setup (be it high quality earphones or, preferably, a nice car stereo) because some of its bass lines are truly praiseworthy.

As others have alluded to, or stated, this is the kind of CD that holds a constant spot near the top of one's music collection. I knew it was good, but only now do I fully understand that fact. Isn't it a breath of fresh air when a single album is full of such greatness and not just one or two songs, as with 99% of the music out there?"
A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is True, the fact that several years after its release, the opening ""Angel"" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!"
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I,B000006045,1,1,4.0,"I don't know too much about their other albums, but I can't imagine any other being better than ""Mezzanine"". You can call this trip-hop or electronica if you want, but this is just cool mood music that is beyond beautiful. Perfect for putting on after the bars at home, with that last drink or smoke of the night. With guest vocals from ""The Cocteau Twins"" singer, and a cool sample of ""The Cure"" on track seven, you know this is gonna be good. ""Teardrop"" was the big song from this, and the rest is just as moving. It will go great with your ""Portishead"" and ""Sneaker Pimps"" cd's."
AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"I haven't been into Massive Attack for too long, probably a couple of years now. ""Mezzanine"" was my very first MA album. I bought it because I heard nothing but good things about this group as well as this album. The rest is all history. I have their other three albums [""Blue Lines"", ""Protection"", and ""100th Window""]. I think of all the MA albums I own, ""Mezzanine"" resonates with me the most. The music is dark and foreboding, lyrically and musically. The cd starts off with the dark sounds of ""Angel"". I particularly love that songs for the dark, slow, hip hop beats mixed with the haunting vocals. The choices in samples is astounding, if not refreshing. Normally I loathe the use of samples but Massive Attack is able to use samples and manipulate them into a totally different sound than what the original artist intended. My personal favorite songs off ""Mezzanine"" has to be ""Man Next Door"" and ""Teardrop"". Those songs are simply amazing. I recently put in ""Mezzanine"" into my cd player for the first time in months, and amazingly enough it still holds up very well in today's current music scene. I really think that ""Mezzanine"" set a standard for the whole genre of trip hop music. It is one of the best albums in that genre as well as one of the best albums in general to come out in the past decade or two."
A5889INEGKCQY,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"Mezzanine is one of my all time favourite albums. It's just that good. the arrangements, the production and the wibe on the album. It's dark and beautiful and the musicianship is also top notch. the Album has many guest appearences and the lads from Massive are geniuses to find the right people to sing the right songs. Teardrop is now a classic and many other songs are also brilliant. I recomend everyone who claims to be a music fan to buy Mezzanine. It is indded one of the best albums of the late 90's and probably of all time."
A3M97WKI0FP3JF,B000006045,1,1,4.0,"...seductive, spellbinding.  There are probably many other words out there that can describe this record, but the five I've mentioned are probably the closest that will match the feeling I get from listening to it.  Imagine a dark, tranquil atmosphere with shimmering electronic music and bassline grooves and narrative, soulful vocals in the background.  ""Mezzanine"" perfectly fits this description!  Some of the highlights include ""Angel"" where the music starts soft and then builds up into a screaming frenzy.  Or how about ""Teardrop"" (w/former Cocteau Twins vocalist Elizabeth Fraser) which features an angelic voice, an acoustic guitar, and the same shimmering electronics.  I could go on and on.  But I think it's best that you go out and buy this fine record and experience it for yourself.  If I'm not mistaken, it was one of SPIN magazine's top 20 records of 1998.  Heck, I bought it just before Christmas last year and wondered what took me so long in doing so.  In any case, I'll definitely look into buying their other stuff including the DVD!  And I look forward to their new record which should be coming out sometime this fall!"
A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000006045,1,1,5.0,"What struck me first after hearing Mezzanine was its sheer weight. The sound, with its low beats and (in a first for Massive Attack) thrashing guitars, succeeds in actually oppressing the listener....and that's very  much a good thing, because the music in this album is just so very novel  and smooth you want to feel every part of it.
As usual with Massive  releases, ""Mezzanine"" features the vocals of two female vocalists  on several songs, Liz Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins) and newcomer Sara  Jay. Liz's contributions are some of the higher points of the album, and  ""Teardrop"" is just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998.  Sara Jay's one song is the insidious and sneaky ""Dissolved Girl,""  which has Massive Attack doing some new tricks with electronica.
Horace  Andy, the reggae singer who is a mainstay of Massive Attack's albums, has  three songs here, the industrial ""Angel,"" and the almost-retro  Massive Attack ""Man Next Door"" and ""(Exchange)"".
The  songs featuring the vocals of Massive's members 3D and Daddy G are also  well-done, and 3D's threatening whispers on ""Risingson"" do a lot  to make it one of my favourite songs.
Although certainly some of the  songs are better than others, this is one of the few CD's I've ever  listened to where there is not a single bad song. The album as a whole is  perfect, and I would recommend this to any person who is breathing and has  a pulse."
A3M88RCAR2T804,B00000747R,1,1,5.0,I remember when this came out on lp in the early 70's.  Thank God it has been re-issued on cd.  This is what Philly sould is all about!
A3GTI1Z7YE49ZS,B00000747R,1,1,4.0,"The Stylistics make moody soul music, atmospheric. There's also a hint of Warrick - Bacharach  in their music, well, after all they did cover ""You'll never get to if you break my heart"", and the joyous ""Make it last"" carries on in that vein.

Other than that song, in my opinion this album doesn't really get going until the second half - the jazzy slow burn of ""Love comes easy"", the off-hand rock 'n' roll title track, the soul classic ""You make me feel brand new"" and the exuberant ""I won't give you up"".

But, the highlight for me is undoubtedly ""There's no reason"" with it's off-kilter melody, interesting arrangement and rolling chorus with the perfect vocal harmonies. Along with most of the other songs, the gentle, understated sound adds to the whole atmosphere.

Songs like ""Only for the children"" and ""Could this be the end"" - I don't know. I've always thought Russell Thompkins Jr is at his best singing love songs, because it suits his vocal style than angrier songs. Overall I would give this album a 7, or three and a half."
A14W1VNMMYLWND,B00000747R,1,1,5.0,"1973, the Philly wonder group Stylistics release their third album after the first 2 albums, 2 straight classics.  Thom Bell and Linda Creed make a great production team, and Russel Thompkins Jr. keeps hitting the high notes as the lead tenor.  The music is lush again like the second album Round 2, and there are some surefire winners here.  ""Make It Last"" has the same lushness of songs like ""You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart)"" from Round 2.  ""Payback Is A Dog"" is about how a woman who does wrong will finally know how it feels when she is on the receiving side of the heartbreak, and has impeccable harmony.  ""Love Comes Easy"" has that smooth lush feel again and deals with finding one great thing in life in an uneasy world: love.  ""Rockin' Roll Baby"" has a vintage 70's rock feel with the great Falsetto lead (giving it a soul inflection), and a light touch of funk.  Not my fav, but it shows that the Stylistics can expand into different territory effectively.  A persistent sentiment of love even if unrequited is expressed in the nice mid-tempo ""I Won't Give You Up.""  Then we have a great jam with the slower ""Let Them Work It Out,"" which is more laidback and deals with a certain friend who gossips about other friends' love lives (and troubles in said romances), and that it is getting annoying.  The song is about letting couples work through their difficulties.  A somber joint is ""Could This Be The End.""  It is another slower joint with perfect harmony.  Rockin' Roll Baby is another classic in the Stylistics catalogue.  Thom Bell is a genius musician, especially considering his classic works with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, The Spinners, among others.  The Stylistics are right next to the Delfonics as 2 of my favorite soul groups ever."
A22N03OBDDVSEB,B000007UVW,1,1,4.0,"I'm a life long Blue Oyster Cult fan from way back, in 1988 they released ""Imaginos"" #122, at the time I thought this was a tremendous record, but after 22 years of reflection, it's a 4 star release at best.  This is a upgrade after ""Club Ninja"", but that wasn't very hard to do.  The thing about ""Imaginos"", it has too many special guests and the recording was 5 or 6 years in the making. (I didn't know that at the time I bought it in '88).  I still like these songs after 22 years, ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", ""Les Invisibles"", ""Magna Of Illusion"", with some fine piano by Allen Lanier, the remake of their own ""Astronomy"" #9 mainstream rock and my favorite tune is the classic ""Blue Oyster Cult"", just a great track, Buck and Eric at there best."
A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B000007UVW,-1,1,5.0,"OK, it may have started out as a great ""concept album"" in the mind of Sandy Pearlman. It may have grown into a Joe Bouchard solo album, which stretched out over multiple recording dates. It may have ended up as the ""final"" BOC album in 1988 because of the fact that Joe Bouchard was joined in sessions by Eric Bloom, Allen Lanier, Buck Dharma and Albert Bouchard.

So WHAT?

It's got the bone-rattling, truly unique ""The Siege and Investiture of Baron von Frankenstein's Castle At Weisseria,"" featuring Joey Cerisano and Jon Rogers on additional lead vocals and the unforgettable shout/chant/refrain ""CARPE DIEM"" followed by doomsday crashing riff-heavy guitars, and the opening track ""I Am the One You Warned Me Of,"" which is easily as good as any of the tracks on the early BOC albums.

There's also a remake of two songs from the second album (""Tyranny & Mutation""), ""Astronomy"" and ""Subhuman"" (which is retitled ""Blue Oyster Cult"" here).

Sometimes it pays to focus on what an album IS as opposed to what it ISN'T.

This one will shake the fillings loose from your teeth. It may be a patchwork quilt but it rocks like a mother, and the fact that it's back on CD is worth celebrating."
A1IH46GF4BNPIQ,B000007UVW,1,1,5.0,"Back in the day BOC was Huge. I loved their music and got everything they ever put out EXCEPT ONE, Imaginos. I was overseas in the Navy when it came and the 2 albums prior to this were a bit of a disappointment, SO when it came out I was busy and just didn't get around to getting it. when I did go to get it it was gone. Pulled from the shelves everywhere for what I don't know but nowhere to be found. No big deal right? I mean tha last 2 releases were rather dull so I figured BOC were tapped out,  becoming Nostalgic and Nundane. Many years before I even expressed interest in it again after I heard from others that it was actually very good. Some of the best BOC has ever done many say. Hmmmm. better get it. NOT, everybody wanted like mega bucks for a copy. Anyway when I saw it here re-released I jumped all over it. Damn glad I did. When I first listened to this and keep in mind, for 30 years I have never heard even one track from this CD, it was like hearing the latest release form one of my favorite bands and it rocks. As a whole I give it an 8 on a 10 scale but there are about 5 songs on this that are the best BOC has ever done. Those songs get a solid 10. Buck is blazingly fast and imaginitive. ie the title Imaginos. These are Blockbuster, Genious Level Guitar Riffs that prove once again that Buck Dharma is one of the greatest guitarists alive and way too many people have never heard of him. A shame really. BOC has a Dark Inteligent perspective that always kept them to, well, cult following status. I am a member of that BOC Cult. I like just hearing this now because it truly feels new and fresh to me. I know it came out in 1978 or 79, and it is now 2008. But you can'yt tell that from hearing this for the first time. It sounds like so much of BOC's greates work. Classic and Timeless. If like me you are a BOC fan and you don't have this. You already know from the years that you gotta have it. If you are a new BOC fan or wondering if this is Vinatge BOC or just mediocrity from BOC, let me assure you this will top your collection as some of BOC's finest and without a doubt Buck Dharma soundly places himself in the Guitar God Status like he wasn't there already.

Kev."
AKGF27HN0OF19,B000007UVW,1,1,4.0,"An album that has always seemed to divide BOC fans.  ""Imaginos"" is a concept album concocted by Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman whose origins go almost back to the beginning of the band.  Two of the tracks on this album appear on ""Secret Treaties"" which serves as somewhat of a companion piece to ""Imaginos"".  The original BOC lineup re-united for this one along with a host of guests.  The concept is the story of Imaginos a time traveler of sorts who appears at different times in the world's history to influence historical events.  The problem is that the story is not told in a linear fashion and it ends up being completely confusing.  I have read essays on the story behind the story and still haven't really figured it all out.  This is a weird album for me, I think most of the songs on this disc are outstanding to the point of being some of the best stuff BOC has ever done, but looking at the album as a whole it is not quite as good as I think it should have been.  Being a big progressive rock fan maybe I set my expectations too high when I found out BOC was doing a True concept piece, but on this one the sum is not greater than it's parts.  That being said there is some really great material here.  The remakes of ""Astronomy"" and ""Blue Oyster Cult"" (formerly ""The Subhuman"") are better than the originals.  ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", ""Les Invisibles"", ""In The Presence Of Another World"", ""Del Rios Song"", ""The Siege....."", ""Magna Of Illusion"" are all awesome.  The title track is a bit of a letdown, but still ok.  Still......even with all this great stuff, I think the album could have been put together better and re-worked to an extent.  Anyway this is a minor quibble as this album really is a must for any fans of BOC.  I believe it is currently out of print and hard to find."
A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000007UVW,-1,-1,3.0,"This is an album the Blue Oyster Cult fans will really get into, a concept album that showcases the bands unique song stylings. For the casual listener, or sometime BOC fan, stick with ""Agents of Fortune"" or ""Fire of Unknown Origin"". ""Imaginos"" is a heavy album and features a great remake of ""Astronomy"", the best song on the CD. But unless you are prepared to invest some time, deciphering the story, and songs you won't get much out of the album. I picked up ""Imaginos"" on CD after hearing ""Astronomy"" late at night (the best time to play the CD), and there was a narrative about the ""Imaginos"" myth read by Stephen King as the song opened. I heard this only two times on the radio, and picked up the CD because I was a huge Stephen King fan, and enjoyed some of BOC's earlier albums. Needless to say, the Stephen King narrative is not on the album. I was disappointed, but played the disk a few times. I enjoyed ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", a pretty straight ahead rocker, and ""In The Presence of Another World"" which is a more down-tempo song. Actually most of the songs are good, and you will find yourself humming the chorus for hours after listening. The only track that I found lacking, was the title track ""Imaginos"". For some reason, most likely the background singers: ""Oooohhhh Imaginos, Ooooohhh Imaginos, Oooooohhhh, ooooohhh, ooohhhh Imaginos"" the song sounds like fanfare for a two bit magician about to perform in Vegas or something. Once I got that image stuck in my head, I just kept picturing Imaginos The Great performing card tricks and turning newspaper into doves. If you see a copy of this disk used for under $10 pick it up, but I don't think it's worth the $20 used price I see here."

A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00000I7LP,-1,1,4.0,"I wanted an album so rugged, nobody could touch it, Eminem proclaims. If hes referring to rap albums, this LP might just be that. Ill say here and now, with no hesitation or reservation, that Eminem is easily the best rapper Ive ever heard. No popular rapper you can think of, alive or dead, even comes close. I mightve been saying the same about guest Royce Da 5-9 if he weren't upstaged by a rapper whose comedic wit, clever wordplay and sheer rhyme skills near genius.

There is very little filler in Eminems verses. Even when hes lacing them with unnecessary profanities; the Slim Shady persona is a deviant (white-trash) druggie who aims to offend; almost every two bars are a quality set and many of those sets are classic quotables. Unless hes cheating it somehow, his creativity is close to amazing. He even does his own sound effects. The beats are also impressive, so the albums only major drawbacks fall on faulty choruses and silly skits.

A10DNCYK7YISHU,B00000I7LP,1,1,5.0,"Before the Slim Shady LP, a no-name emcee named Eminem was probably ripping the mic at the Lyricist Lounge or other underground hiphop spots...back when he was an ill lyricist hungry for attention by scaring you sh**less with raw punchlines and excellent verbal battling ability.  Back when he was able to step into a rhyme cypher with Canibus, Mos Def, Last Emperor, and Chino XL and dominate...  To a hiphop standpoint, by focusing on his lyrics and comparing with his earlier efforts, this CD is the beginning of his downfall...  But with the variety of ideas it saves the CD.  And by being so creative brings it up to 5 stars...
Unfortunately, because he's not on a dependable label he's forced to rap to garbage beats (which is Dre's specialty, but this release are some of his better ones), he's forced to do exactly what the higher level employees he works with say.  He's not able to make his own decisions and the contoversy that has become of him has forced him to listen to Dre and others and rap about that instead of making his own ideas... ARTIST - one that can use their imaginative ability to create something...
But, none the less, an excellent debut CD by a good artist who's stuck with a bad label...  Hopefully one day Slim will wake up and leave DRE in his footprints and join a True HIPHOP label 'RAWKUS' ...
plus he's not the only white rapper out there today: Evidence (Dilated Peoples), The High and Mighty, Smut Peddlers, Everlast/Whitey Ford, El-P (Company Flow), and RA Rugged Man...
I'm Out ... Mind Power!"
A1WHO8TXC8GJHA,B00004TTUZ,1,1,5.0,"Now this is what you call some quality recording by a quality artist.  Ledisi is a good definition of ""grown folk"" music. The songs were well written and I can about imagine what her performance was like. She seems to really be into her music.  There is nothing scripted about it.  You can feel the passion coming from her voice as well as the creativity that was put into the music, which is somewhat of an lost art in today's world of music.  I highly recommend this cd to any fan of real soul music."
A2RXC61UJQQSWZ,B00004TTUZ,1,1,4.0,"Now I have just finished my reviewing Ms Ledisi's major debut:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-and-Found/dp/B000RO8UAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost and Found</a>, which, whilst being a nice safe release, is nothing like this. Now this is a album, and I can well understand why this is an in demand CD. I like the live feel to this CD, and the excellent choice of songs on offer: from the excellent 'Get Outta My Kitchen' 'Coffee', and the controversial 'Papa Love to Love me'
I think what this CD has that her:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-and-Found/dp/B000RO8UAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost and Found</a>&nbsp;CD lacks is, apart from edgier songs selection, is a jazz influence that runs through this CD. It's sad that with an independence like this, the freedom that an artist has is lost when dealing with the majors. As Ms Ledisi owns the master for this I do hope it sees a re-lease on her new label, because the masses need to hear this."
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B00004TTUZ,1,1,4.0,"Ledisi - Soulsinger (2000)
Word has it that this album is to be rereleased this year on Tommy Boy Records. If this is True, then I'm glad that she's getting a second chance. Soulsinger is filled with Ledisi's ability to mix little spoken word with jazz, R&B, and soul. She puts her all in every performance, as evidenced in ""Take Time"" and ""Coffee"". She has the voice of a throaty Southern gospel choir singer and she truly delivers. It's too bad that some of these songs have uninspired lyricism like in ""Groove On"", a song about her wanting a one-night stand. Also, she tends to sing so hard that she gets off-key, which is a problem throughout the album. But it's hard to find powerful singers like her these days and by listening to ""Free Again"" and the very revealing ""Poppa Loved to Love Me"", Ledisi should start getting props soon. -EJR"
APZSWNPMVSZ84,B00004TTUZ,-1,-1,2.0,"Ledisi is less than average...there, it had to be said! if hating on this album is wrong, then i'ma be wrong. being a good poet doesn't always equate to being a good recording artist. she is definitely different than anything else being offered out there now, and i'll always give an artist props for originality, but i'm just jaded and expect more for my money. this just doesn't move me, sorry."
A218E8UBV7GBZB,B0000564WK,-1,1,5.0,"I REALLY ONLY BOUGHT THIS CD FOR TWO SONGS, AT FIRST THEN I LISTENED TO THE WHOLE CD AND IT IS REALLY NOT BAD"
A1QJ5AX049KOGM,B0000564WK,1,-1,3.0,"The Left Banke were one of those groups who seemed to shine briefly but brilliantly and then fade into relative obscurity. That said, they did manage at least one better than ordinary album (this one) and an OK follow up (Left Banke Too), the latter release sadly missing the original group's principal songwriter Michael Brown. For all that these guys did record one of the best and most beautiful songs ever put down by anyone in Walk Away Renee and that is way more than many other musicians will ever achieve.. First class packaging and well written booklet with band history etc. Worth buying if you like quality 60's music"
A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0000564WK,1,1,5.0,"The Left Banke is one of those bands from the 60s that kinda fell through the cracks as the years went on.  Pretty much looked at as a ""two hit wonder"", they were much more than that(as One and Two Hit Wonders tend to be sometimes).
They're classified as ""Baroque Rock"".  What the hell is that, you ask?  Oddly, it sounds exactly like it's description.  The band members of The Left Banke weren't the most technically savvy of musicians, so the sound of the band revolved around youngest member, Michael Brown.  Brown was trained in classical music and played piano and harpsichord, both of which are very prominent in The Left Banke's sound.  Add to that, the smooth Beach Boys-esque vocal harmonies, and you have.....Baroque Rock!!  One song, Evening Gown, almost sounds like a harpsichord driven punk song!
I'm surprised I like this album as much as I do.  Though I'm big on vintage rock music, this seemed a little too different than what I normally listen to, which is rockabilly and surf. I initially bought it because I've always had a soft spot for Pretty Ballerina, but much to my surprise I found this whole album to be great!
I am very glad I picked this one up!  If you like the late 60s stuff, The Left Banke deserves a resurrection.  If you like Justin Bieber, you're a schmuck!"
A1PLX7O7HW809U,B0002HA8IA,1,1,5.0,"This is a very special cd. It is a tribute to Debby's mother-in-law Rosemary Clooney so that makes it special in itself. But whats really special is this womans' voice - so perfectly suited for this material. As a fan from the start of her career I know how versatile she is. Here she sings with authority and with the technique of a jazz legend. For us fans who have been waiting for new material from Debby for years this is just what the doctor ordered. This cd is perfect for a night of romance with fine wine and Boones' beautiful vocals washing over you. The production has class written all over it from the players to Debby Boone. Looking forward to the live show - it will rock! Congratulations Debby and thanks for keeping your music and your life real. God Knows :).....postscript - i was lucky enough to catch Debbys' live show at Scullers in Boston 6/22/05 and she truly charmed and dazzled her audience. Debby - thanks for being such an inspiration and a True lady...as I said ""keep the good music coming!"". :)"
A1PLX7O7HW809U,B0002HA8IA,1,1,5.0,"This is a very moving collection of Debbys' Christian music as is the recent ""You Light Up My Life - Greatest Inspirational Songs"" - if you like this you'll like that too. Boone has a dramatic soaring voice that comforts the soul. Can't wait to get her latest on Concord Records ""Reflections of Rosemary"" a tribute to mother in law Rosemary Clooney. She may finally get the props she deserves."
A35MQ03ZBF585E,B0002HA8IA,-1,1,4.0,"I would have liked a dance band with at least 15 pieces or more to accompany Debby. She has the ""chops"" & I believe that this would enhance her sound. The band was still good but it could be a fuller sound."
A1D44YT0P8Q8XL,B0002HA8IA,1,1,5.0,"The songs in this album ""Reflections of Rosemary"" from ""Blue Skies"" and  ""Mood Indigo"" to ""In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning"" and ""Time After Time"" are some of the nicest popular standards identified with Rosemary Clooney, one of the best female vocalists of all-time. And Debby Boone is singing the same songs as her special tribute to her mother-in-law. This album promises the listeners an unforgettably, wholesomely beautiful listening experience. There is something to captivate the ears of every listener as she is backed by some of the best musicians we have in the music world today: Rosemary Clooney's arranger/pianist for twenty years, John Oddo, arranger Earl Brown, guitarists John Pizzarelli and Jim Fox, bassist Chuck Berghofer, drummer Gregg Field, percussionist Daniel Greco, saxophonists Gary Foster, Dan Higgins and Scott Hamilton, trumpeter Warren Luening and cellist Armen Ksajikian.

I have enjoyed the music of Debby Boone since she recorded an album of great inspirational songs in the seventies and eighties most notably ""Sweet Adoration,"" ""Can You Reach My Friend?"" ""Sincerely Yours"" and ""You Light Up My Life."" Her father's music, Pat Boone, has been part of my very musical family when I was growing up. He was one of my late parents' favorite singers and mine, too and I was especially fond of his hit song, ""Love Letters In The Sand.""

On this elegantly charming tribute album recorded with love and dedication,  Debby Boone sings sixteen classic standards starting off with an uplifting  Irving Berlin classic, ""Blue Skies,"" which Rosemary Clooney used to sing to her first grandson Jordan, whenever he was ""sad, when he took a fall and was crying, or anytime he needed his spirits lifted."" It's a surprised added track - Ms. Clooney's A Capella version. Ms. Boone stated that, like her son Jordan, she would always find comfort in this beautiful song, which highlights Scott Hamilton on tenor sax solo.

While all the tracks are so enjoyable, I really love the way she sang ""Mood Indigo,"" which features a vocal quartet - herself and her sisters Cheryl, Lindy and Laury with vocal chart arrangement written by Earl Brown. With its vintage-sounding arrangement and its nostalgic rendition, this classic from Duke Ellington/Barney Bigard/Irving Mills evokes a sentimental feeling that will flood your eyes with an ocean of tears as the sisters sing...

Little sister, you ain't been blue
No, no, no
You ain't been blue
Not till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to your shoes
Then you cry, you just sit there and cry
Go long, so long blues...

Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evenin' when lights are low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The wonderful tone of John Pizzarrelli's guitar as well as his soft and mellow scat can be heard in ""I've Grown Accustomed To His Face"" while Dan Higgin's flute plays beautifully in ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" complementing Ms. Boone's gorgeous vocals. The Van Heusen/Burke medley is also surprisingly stunning ""But Beautiful,"" ""Moonlight Becomes You"" and ""Like Someone In Love."" One of my all-time favorites ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill was rendered so beautiful and heartfelt making it one of the best interpretations ever recorded. And she dedicated it to her hubby, Gabri. The delicate medley of ""It Never Entered My Mind"" and ""In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning"" was selected as a tribute to Frank Sinatra, whom Ms. Boone had worked with on several occasions in the past. The enchanting Bossa Nova arrangement on ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" is so pleasing to the ears.

An all-time top favorite, Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne's ""Time After Time"" is also a highlight and one of the singer's favorite songs that Chet Baker recorded in an album called ""Chet Baker Sings."" According to her, ""she fell in love with that album in 1996 and developed a real school girl's crush on Chet. She spent summer tirelessly delighting in his trumpet playing and melting at the sound of his voice, not to mention his picture."" She then sent a copy of the record to Rosemary knowing that she would absolutely ""love the way this guy sang."" And to her surprise, Rosemary told her; ""Do you know I carry around a picture of Chet Baker in my wallet to this day?"" In other words, they had a crush on the same guy! Co-incidentally,  ""Chet Baker Sings"" is also my very first Chet Baker CD from my collection and I have written a review on this outstanding album about a year ago. It's a very nice album that focuses on Chet Baker not as a trumpet player but as a singer with a soft and mellow vocal style.

Listen to Debby Boone at her utmost best as she pays homage to one of the best female singers of all-time, Rosemary Clooney. You'll also be delighted with the Liner Notes, which include in great detail Ms. Boone's heartfelt sentiments for each and every song she selected for this great tribute album.

An album of sheer beauty, elegance and perfection."

All the songs are first rate by original artist.  Perry, Les, Eddie, Tony, and the rest are excellent and their version has been the definitive this past fifty years. Not a groner in the bunch.  Arrangement and accompaniment is beyond compare.  Technically excellent.

While it takes awhile to get me in dance mode, each song foretells the coming rock n rock era. Never fails to put me in a good mode. I usually get in the mode along about Dragnet.

Bought it used, and was as advertized; like new.  Arrived on time, well packaged."

A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B000FWGU84,1,1,4.0,"The alumnus of the previously-manufactured and now-defunct N'Sync has returned with a follow-up to his hugely successful debut of 2003, Justified. While that effort shows promise, its slight disarray is sometimes jarring.

Now forward to 2006, the golden boy of music returns with first single Sexyback off FutureSex/LoveSounds. The single is an incredible piece of sweet funk, combining the sensuality of yesteryear's Prince and the deft execution of pre-scandal Michael jackson. With a hot salacious video to boot, the song is sure pop ecstasy.

At the helm of things is once again hip master Timbaland whose collaborations always bear edible fruits. Remixes of the song range from mediocre to superb, beginning with the lackadaisical Pokerface Club Mix which sounds like a piece of early 90's recycled house mix.  The slightly more varied Linus Loves Remix ups the ante with a more danceable electro beat. The best mix has to be the cool Tom Novy Ibiza Mix that cleverly uses a verse of Timberlake's sung vocals wrapped around some hypnotic and lackbaid grooves."

Justin Timberfake stated in an interview he was trying to bring back the sexiness of the 1980s. Well, he failed big time with this one."

A2WLRNFTHI67WX,B000LWZD7M,1,1,5.0,"The self-titled release by the Atlanta based band, Theocracy first appeared in 2007 but has been out of circulation since that time.  For several months, fans have long-awaited for the release of Theocracy's original album - an album that has been remastered and remixed.  On November 19, fans around the were were thrilled to listen in to Matt Smith and the boys hammer out their unique style of Stryper meets Dream Theater heavy metal music.

Track by Track:

After a 80's-like keyboard intro the album begins with a double-base drum anthem that celebrates victory in Christ.  Here's a few lines from Ichthrus.

Forced into the catacombs
unite to praise the King of kings
they fear a revolution
and the power that He brings
heaven's sons stand as one, as believers
in the blood of Christ
even in death we have True life

CENTURIES FLY
BUT THE FLAME IS STILL ALIVE
THE MAY HIDE IT, BUT IT WILL NEVER DIE
CARVED IN OUR SOULS,
SEE THE TWO HALVES OF THE SIGN
THROUGH THE AGES HIS GLORY WILL ARISE
FOR ALL TIME

The Serpent's Kiss begins as a ballad and speaks candidly about the curse of sin that has been inflicted on the cosmos.

Born into the darkness
thrown into the viper's den
the serpent in the cradle
takes the child into its nest of sin
slowly suffocating
the souls of victims it has found
into the vicious cycle
on the path that only leads us down

Rat-race-fueled machinery
this system of corruption
have we become so cold and numb
we're blind to its destruction?
We're forging in the fires made of greed
Our idols made of gold
then bowing down before them
with corrupt, adulterous souls
opened eyes,
realize...

WHAT WE HAVE DONE
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
WHAT HAS BECOME OF OUR LIVES
CORRUPTED OUR DREAMS
WHAT WE HAVE LOST
AND WHAT REMAINS
PARALYZED BY THE VENOM THAT RUNS THROUGH OUR VEINS
THERE'S GOT TO BE MUCH MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS
THE WORLD'S CARESS IS JUST THE SERPENT'S KISS

But the venom that has plagued mankind has been defeated by the power of the cross.  So the song continues ...

I stand before you as a child
by this world I've been defiled
stained and poisoned, burned and beaten
bruised and wounded, sick and vile
with hands reaching out to you, I run
realizing what I've done
you take me in your arms, a reunited father and son...

The song is not only a powerful reminder of the gospel but also leaves listeners with a permanent and painful warning:

And all illusion ceases to exist
the world's caress is just a serpent's kiss

Mountain paints a vivid portrait of the journey that every Christ-follower faces.

Step by step the climb gets harder
my being weakens as I struggle farther and farther
flesh is weakness, darkness, sickness
my dreams are shattered, my ambitions crumbled
my will defeated, my spirit humbled once more
I am hopeless, helpless without you

The tune resembles John Bunyan's classic work, Pilgrim's Progress and leaves listeners with hope as they plod their way through the Christian life:

Take me to the places I can't go
Transcending
I'm sick of living in the status quo
New Beginning
And when it seems I've given up
On eagle' wings you life me up again
and this time I know, in the end
...You carried me

The title track, Theocracy is a metal dream that challenges every listener with the direct claims of Christ's lordship:

At the center of my heart there sits a throne
That the rightful occupant's not always
free to call His own
For how can I give the King
His place of worth above all else
When I spend my time striving
to place the crown upon myself?

The chorus hammers the lordship theme with a holy vengeance:

I TAKE MY CROWN AND CAST IT DOWN
CASTLES BURNING
CASTLES BURNING
LEARN TO GROW, GROW TO BE
A FLESH AND BLOOD THEOCRACY
TO TAKE THE LOSS AND BEAR THE CROSS
RAISE THE KINGDOM
RAISE THE KINGDOM
BURN AWAY ALL IVE BEEN
TO RESURRECT THEOCRACY WITHIN

2 Corinthians 10:5 is employed to remind Christians to submit every thought to the lordship of Christ:

and the would-be rulers of my heart
that I place upon the throne
each lead the kingdom of my life to ruin
to bring every though into submission
to tear the idols down
is to break the chains, to rearrange,
to give the king his crown

The Healing Hand is a powerful five-part masterpiece that begins with the prophecy of the Messiah - the hope of nations.  The tune leads listeners from the cradle to the Cross of Christ where the ""healing hand becomes the bleeding hand.""

His kingdom forever, the Lion of Judah in strength
everlasting redemption, atonement complete
resurrected in power, as King now he stands
FOR THE BLEEDING HAND HAS BECOME THE RULING HAND

Faith-born forever, a part of His kingdom become
Or reject him, stand back
and watch his kingdom come
Alpha and omega almighty is he
Christ reigns victorious for eternity
Eternity

Several more songs grace this stunning album.  There is simply too much to share in a short review in this format.  But suffice it to say, this piece of work by Theocracy is about as good as it gets.  The music is tight, the production is crisp, and the vocals are spot on.  Again, as I have noted elsewhere, Matt Smith is one of the premier songwriters of this day.  For whatever reason, he has gone largely unnoticed - a tragedy in its own right.  This young man should be commended for his God-given gifts.  But as every God-fearing man recognizes, all the glory goes back to the Giver of every good gift.

Thanks to Matt Smith and the band for writing such God-honoring music; heavy metal music that truly honors the Lord Jesus Christ and magnifies his gospel!"
A18V2E6MMO8KLO,B000LWZD7M,1,1,5.0,"For those not familiar with the self-titled debut release, band founder Matt Smith composed all of the songs and performed all of the instruments (sans acoustic drums). Despite this deficiency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print. Fast forward to 2013, Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5, released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue/rerecording of the debut became a reality. As Smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds. These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm. Bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal. And while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking, he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music. Reissues rarely add much to the original  especially when the original was near perfect  but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded, transforming a classic of epic Christ-centric power metal into a masterpiece."
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B000MSTZV0,1,1,5.0,"Bonnie Pointer's First Solo Album is a classic waiting to be rediscovered. A varied album of different styles, all produced & performed so amazingly, it holds up well today. There is funk, Motown oldies, acoustic tracks, & a great orchestrated ballad. The music, the musicianship, and the vocals are all very creative and of the highest calibre.

 Side One has 2 Motown oldies WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU that are both done in the old Motown style. They even have legendary Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON playing on them. This version of HEAVEN is five minutes and features scat singing by Bonnie in the middle. This is a different version from the disco hit single that went to #11 on the charts. Bonnie redid it as a single, and I much prefer the album version , with it's homage to classic Motown. The other 2 tracks are both stellar, with inventive arrangements, singing & playing. The single FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [ HANDCUFF ME ] is amazing. Pop/funk with Bonnie singing all the background vocals herself, and in the middle there is a banjo solo! That's what I mean about the creativity and work that Bonnie, the musicians and producer Jeffrey Bowen [ who previously produced The Temptations ] put into this album. And you have not heard a funk track as hot and funky as AH SHOOT, I guarantee you since Sly & The Family Stone's THANK YOU. This song is 5 minutes of pure funk nastiness with an organ that drives it, blazingly funky horns a/la James Brown, Bonnie's muti-faceted  vocals & just sheer musical genius at it's height. Outkast must have heard this track. It's just waiting to be sampled. The musicians on this album are of top calibre with Family Stone member TRUMAN THOMAS arranging, playing & co-writing , Funkadelic guitarist EDDIE HAZEL, Rolling Stones sideman OLLIE BROWN, original Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON, NIGEL OLSSON of Elton John's band on one track, and string arrangements by noted arrangers LEE HOLDRIDGE and PAUL RISER.

 And Side Two illustrates another side to Bonnie Pointer, with 4 acoustic rhythmically driven & played songs MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], and the beautiful ballad MY EVERYTHING that closes this unique, diverse album of sheer musical pleasure. These 4 numbers all co-written by DONALD BALDWIN are amazing - filled with hooks, catchy choruses, and pure musicianship. Remember Bonnie's solo on BLACK COFFEE from The Pointer Sisters 2nd album THAT'S A PLENTY. That is just a taste of what Bonnie can do with a ballad.

 Also of note is that this self-titled album is the one with a RED COVER. For some unknown reason, Motown released Bonnie's 2nd album with the same self-titled name, and that has a purple cover. Also it's not as great as this one. Released in Dec. 1978, the same time as The Pointer Sisters equally excellent ENERGY album, this is a classic that has to be heard. It is by far the best of Bonnie's 3 solo albums. Catalog number is MOTOWN M7-911R1.

 Tracks: WHEN I'M GONE, FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [HANDCUFF ME ], HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, AH SHOOT, MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], MY EVERYTHING.

 Released on MOTOWN M7-911RI, December 1978, Red Cover."
A28FNKCGFS03VL,B000MSTZV0,1,-1,3.0,"For those who may not know this, there are actually 4 Pointer Sisters, not 3, but second-youngest Bonnie (born in 1950) broke away to pursue a solo career which began with this album for Motown. She had a couple of sizable hits from it with ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"" and ""Free Me From My Freedom"" both of which are great songs. However, as a whole, this album is not quite on par with late 70s Pointer Sisters material, as nothing else on the album quite measures up to the hits."
A2REF5NAGDO02L,B000MSTZV0,1,1,5.0,"I was all of 14 years old when I had this project on vinal, and I swan ... I wore the grooves off the album! It captured my musical mind back then and finding it on CD at last has been almost more than I can hadle! Every song is Motown production at it's best! While each song is perfection and I cannot pick out a 'best' I am partial to AH SHOOT; funky and bass driven ... it gets this white boy to dancin' like no white boy should!! Then there's I LOVE TO SING TO YOU ... a wonderful love song in itself, but Bonnie sings it so sweetly and simply that it amazes me. The original line up of songs ends with MY EVERYTHING ... another love song sung with total honesty ~ pure magic! The bonus tracks are the icing on an all ready perfect cake, and I am thrilled to have this back in my collection."
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B000MSTZV0,-1,-1,2.0,"I waited decades for this amazing album by Bonnie Pointer to be released on CD. It is such a highly unique album. The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning albums by a female artist. Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect side of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979. The real big surprise was Side 2 with Bonnie singing 4 new original songs with acoustic guitars, layered vocals and a variety of instruments, like  California soul. Nobody else sounded like this. And all ending in the majestic "" MY EVERYTHING "" with beautiful orchestration. But I got a major shock, and am hugely disappointed. This reissue on CD does NOT have the original version of "" AH SHOOT "", but instead an alternate take! Unbelievable, but disappointingly True! Did someone not know that this was a totally different alternate version? The original is nowhere to be found. Instead we get this inferior version that was never released. If anyone knows this album, "" AH SHOOT "" is one of the funkiest songs ever recorded, with Eddie Hazel on guitar and Ollie Brown on drums, plus funky as Sly and James Brown horns and hammond organ, and Bonnie singing these stellar funk lyrics. Big Break Records could be re-named Big Blunder Records for this mistake. Where is the original version of this major funk opus??? I still have to play my original vinyl album to hear "" AH SHOOT "" the way it was released. What is the reason for this fiasco and why isn't the original on this release? Did anyone even know that this was an outtake? Big Break made a major screw-up with this mistake. I'd give the original album a 5 star rating, but because of this Big Break Blunder, their reissue screw-up deserves 1 star. Have someone who knows the original album listen to it before you make it on CD."
A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY,B000MSTZV0,1,1,4.0,"It's encouraging to see that a batch of late-'70's and early-'80's albums have been newly (circa 2012) reissued on CD--by a label called BBR (Big Break Records).  ""Bonnie Pointer"" is the first one of them I've bought, because it contains one of my all-time favorite disco songs, ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"".  The original LP did not contain the disco version that eventually became a #11 pop and Top Ten Disco hit, but this reissue cures that by including both the 7"" and 12"" versions of it.  The other three bonus tracks are all versions of the record's first single, ""Free Me From My Freedom/Tie Me To a Tree (Handcuff Me)"".  The latter, which is not a medley by the way, has a very interesting lyric that seems to have caused the single to stall at mid-chart, at least on the pop side.  Some programmers & listeners felt it was either an S&M reference, or as the liner notes say, ""a step back for the feminist movement.""  It is open to either that interpretation or Bonnie's--that she meant to be tied and handcuffed with love, not literally, after finding independence to be disappointing.  ""Put love's chains back on me...""

The rest of the record covers a wide range of styles.  I think Bonnie sounds a lot like Carole King on ""More And More"" and I'm hearing some Billie Holliday in ""My Everything"".  Another Motown remake (besides ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"", originally a hit for the Elgins) begins the album:  ""When I'm Gone"" is a (literally) snappy version of the Brenda Holloway classic.

I wouldn't say the sound is ""muddy"" as another reviewer put it, but I can't say it leaps out of the speakers either.  I'd be curious to hear/read what other buyers think about this.  On the plus side, the packaging is excellent, with great photos and an extensive essay by Christian John Wikane.  The notes give a brief history of the Pointer Sisters before (thoroughly) discussing the making of this album.

More about ""Heaven"":  it opens with a machine gun drum blast, has the guitar jangling all the way through, features a 2-minute wild string-and-drum break, and ends with Ms. Pointer channeling Louis Armstrong.  One of the most amazing disco productions ever!"
A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000MSTZV0,1,1,5.0,"For those who grew up during the 70s like me or those who are just fans of the period The Pointer Sisters are infamous.  Bonnie Pointer was the creative force behind the original quartet and after years of huge success she broke from the group in 1976 and joined Motown.  Her first release was this gorgeous recording with the glorious red cover, her beautiful face and simply titled BONNIE POINTER.  Side one had the uptempo tracks and side two was more reflective.  There are glorious covers of WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. The Motown sound was again loud and strong.  But Bonnie also brought FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM a disco track with much funk and AH SHOOT.  The second side totally shined with emotional standouts MORE AND MORE and MY EVERYTHING.  Raw and emotional, Bonnie gave her all.

The album was a huge success and then HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was released as a disco track and it roared up all the charts and became a disco/dance/soul/r&b classic.  It also brought even more attention to the amazing album.  Here BBR has done their magic and brought this superb release to life with beautiful and glorious remastering.  The sound is amazing.  What a gift.  And then we get 5 bonus tracks and a huge booklet of pictures and extensive liner notes.  If this release brings back memories it has never sounded better.  I highly recommend it to fans of soul/disco/r&b as well as fans of the 70s.  And a huge thanks to BBR.  You are reuniting listeners to the True music classics the way they were meant to be heard.  Don't hesitate to purchase this.  The crystal clear sound of Bonnie's pure vocals will pull you in from beginning to end."
ALLU4SGSA4SJG,B000MSTZV0,1,1,5.0,"I was living in a small apartment in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, the year this album hit the shelves. Heaven Must Have Sent You, both in English and Spanish, rocked every juke box on the island. Radio Mart, broadcasting from Cuba, had the Caribbean airways poppin'."
A39P9MWS8L0FZH,B000MSTZV0,1,-1,3.0,"Bonnie Pointer made two solo albums for Motown and both were called BONNIE POINTER. One has her picture of her head with earrings on a red background, the other has a picture of her head with flowers in her hair on a blue background. (I call them the RED or the BLUE albums). There is different music on each, the blue has a few covers of older (mostly Mowtown)music, like JIMMY MACK. The track listing for this RED album is: 1: WHEN I'M GONE, 2: FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM, 3: HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, 4: AH SHOOT, 5: MORE AND MORE, 6: I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, 7: I WANNA MAKE IT (IN YOUR WORLD), 8: MY EVERTHING. / The song HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a single, it was even released as a ""Disco Single Remix"" with a longer disco sound. I've owned both the Red and Blue albums and I personally think the Red album is the better album."
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B000MSTZV0,1,-1,2.0,"The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.

 As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.

 So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.

 Released in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover. Songs: I CAN'T HELP MYSELF, JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES, DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL, COME SEE ABOUT ME, NOWHERE TO RUN."
A1CT884F9HEA8Q,B000P56BSK,1,1,5.0,"This 2 CD set contains 61 tracks many released for the first time and others only found on very limited edition vinyl. The producer, Bob Celli together with Bobby Vee's family have done an absolutely exceptional job in remastering the various tracks - Bobby Vee never sounded so good! The stereo is lush, the definition superb. ""Party Doll"" with the Crickets, an unreleased track from the 1962 album and ""Gone"" (which was apparently an atrociously sounding 45 due to a mastering problem) are wonderful. If, as gas prices top $4.00 and the economy flounders you need a trip back to the 60s in technicolor stereo - this is a must have set. One issue, Amazon lists a digital download in addition to the 2CDs - there is no info on this in the package."

ARHOZP9Y49IH4,B000P56BSK,-1,-1,3.0,"Please know that this is a pirate release.  Rarities UK or US was never on CD.  These tracks are on official CDs now, especially Past Masters (the same reason Hey Jude/The Beatles Again isn't on CD either).  MFSL sure didn't release this (theres also a fake MFSL pirate of Abbey Road mono).
When the original UK LP was released in 1978 (I have a continental copy), most of these tracks were never on an album there before.  These classics are generally well known among the fans.  This is more for completists really.
I wouldn't mind getting the edition which is combined with Let It Be.  If I do come across this one, and it's not too much, I'd probably buy it."

A3DYXPZ34Q45ZP,B000PHA2XS,1,1,5.0,Good ole rock and roll
A3B0CI4MUZ627,B000PHA2XS,1,1,5.0,Good
A1DFAAZTL1IAV2,B000PHA2XS,1,1,4.0,Some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play (I haven't heard the Knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly).  And most of these won't get much play 30 years from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality songs not heard much today.
A2AJVRTVD7D1DU,B000PHA2XS,1,1,5.0,Great music
A22KMCKYE5KQ2X,B000PHA2XS,1,-1,3.0,Songs that are familiar but don't get alot of regular airplay. Worth price and no issues w songs. Happy w purchase!
A1ZVZI3MNS3M2V,B000PHA2XS,1,1,5.0,Wanted music to exercise to. This is a good album for that.

A1NF8KHPO7L8TI,B000QLO4IM,1,1,5.0,"Another great song by Charley Pride.  I love the song, it has such a good upbeat message and he has a good voice."
A1EK0SWZ4JON11,B000QLO4IM,1,1,5.0,"Charley's voice is incredible, he is truly a country legend though he doesn't get as much recognition as he should! This is his biggest hit, take a listen and you'll be an instant fan."
A3UCQ3MT3S5J30,B000QLYCAC,1,1,5.0,I like this song and love Allison's voice. It is haunting and moving and powerful. She sings the song as though she is trying to convey a serious message and I am on the verge of understanding the message. I recommend this song.
A2OTVNYVIVMM9J,B000QLYCAC,1,1,5.0,"This is a great song and I have downloaded several copies.  It has been done by practically everybody from rock bands to opera singers and there is something to say for all.  The lyrics are stunning - it is a very sad love song.  The singer or chorus who does it needs quite a range.  It needs to be belted out, not whispered with the help of electronic equipment.  I liked Allison Crowe's renditon.  Bon Jovi does a good job, as does Jason Castro,the Canadian Tenors, and Brandi Carlile."
A2N4DA6L54YN99,B000QLYCAC,1,1,4.0,"Crow does a decent job on this song, my recent favorite lyrics.  Gives it a strong clear sound and image."
A3U6W30C8NV11Y,B000QMFUJ8,1,1,5.0,THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.

A1Z6WNG6RCCB0U,B000QMFUJ8,-1,1,5.0,The lyrics and melody to this song mean as much in 2013 as they did in the 70's when it was released.

A1X3AM904OIM4X,B000QMCWMG,1,1,5.0,This song is one of the greatest songs ever. They don't write music like this anymore. All they have now is rap and rock music that is dark and dreary. truly a feel good tune with simple lyrics. I am biased but I love the vibes by the man Vince Montana Jr. he is the Philly sound.  This song takes me to another place another time. truly beautiful music that will live on forever at weddings and many other places. I love the sitar sounding guitar.
A3M70XDZOU49AW,B000QMCWMG,1,1,4.0,This song brought back memories from when I was a teenager. Definetly a great song and they sing it well.

A25ZLRIEMZR6ZT,B000QMG34E,1,1,5.0,Love this style of music
A310MXGFV4RIK0,B000QMG34E,1,1,5.0,"Growing up, I was raised on all kinds of music, none of it Motown. But secretly, I loved the stuff, and would listen to it and sing to it all the time. And now, today, I sing at various bars and restaurants with a predominantly country audience (simply because that's the area where I live -- out in the country!) And whenever I sing a Motown classic, like Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition,"" I see feet and hands a tappin' to the beat! But when I do ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" by the Stylistics (because, yes. I can sing both the low and the high parts myself,) people start slow dancing. And I get all kinds of compliments. If you can pull it off vocally, then you really owe it to your audience, and to yourself, to share this wonderful love ballad with the world."

This song brings back many memories for me of the girls that I really liked back then. I like nearly all of the songs that were done by the Stylistics. If you like mellow music then you would like this song.

A1D1IDI5S9TN9D,B000QNVB5E,1,1,4.0,"One thing you have to give Howard Jones, even his most depressing break-up songs are penned with sunshine.  Things Can Only Get Better (1985) is one of those forgotten mid-80's gems you throw in a mix and everybody loves.  It has a very 80's synth-vibe and an ""oh-wow-wow"" that is highly reminiscent of the following year's Bon Jovi smash&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Livin-On-A-Prayer/dp/B000V66VYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Livin' On A Prayer</a>."

A2O2TK53QQQVPK,B000QO3H3W,1,1,5.0,I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.
A1R4N457AE3902,B000QO3H3W,1,1,5.0,I can listen to this song repeatedly and not get tired of it.  This is a fantastic song written by Lee Hazlewood that is perfectly sung by him and Nancy Sinatra.  He has the classic cowboy voice and Nancy Sinatra has that smooth and silky voice.
AHMEG9CAAT2KF,B000QO3H3W,1,1,5.0,"I had not heard this song before, and just happened to stumble across it on Youtube.  It's very pretty and I love listening to it.  Once again, I'm learning to play it on my ukulele."

And then I remembered what a great song.

Some Velvet Morning is also a great song.  You have the soft voice of Nancy...and the deep gravely voice of Lee."

A3JRW716H3AX14,B000QO6B1C,1,1,5.0,In this classic rocker we are treated to a driving beat intertwined with soaring lyrics. Musically it is a fusion of early 70s rock with strong Motown flourishes such as ample use of fuzz and wa-wa on the guitars with lively choral back-up on the vocals. The lyrics are upbeat as was typical of the era. It makes you smile and wish more music of today could impart such a good feeling. There is some really great drumming throughout.
A25W5VJ3VN8D5P,B000QO6B1C,1,1,5.0,Great song

A1DAJZO8DIGDYS,B000QO5DAC,1,1,5.0,Oldie from the old days
AO2FZ2DWUOXV7,B000QO5DAC,1,1,5.0,"The  fact that songs such as this are still available confers a degree of merit, I suppose.  I purchased this along with about thirty others from the period because I was sitting around feeling nostalgic for my youth and the days I shared with some friends in a band in Detroit (EVERYone in Detroit in the sixties was in a band).  Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it. The only thing remarkable about this group and those like it is that the guys only had one hit in them."
A135GWMXMTR58Z,B000QO5DAC,1,1,5.0,. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great

A1OGZ5BBG9MQI0,B000QO76U2,1,1,5.0,I couldn't find this song in other website but found it in amazon.com. It was for my wife and she liked it. So I'm happy with it too.
A2XF6EFU44M9J0,B000QO76U2,1,1,5.0,"I really miss great groups like Santo & Johnny, they took the sound of music to another level which all of us back than just couldn't get enough of."
AOR7VND4GXUJ9,B000QOCEMW,1,1,5.0,I really love the harmonization Frank and Nancy did on this too. It is clear and a very good song. I thank the person who put this up.
ABXVTZKI9UWU6,B000QOCEMW,1,1,5.0,Recommend to all my friends. I like it but don't have 12 words for it so I am really babbling.
A18XXW70NTBQVZ,B000QO8WUU,1,1,4.0,"Do you guys remember Art Bell when he hosted the radio show ""Coast to Coast""?  He had some great bumper music and this song was one of them.  Very Haunting."
A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B000QO8WUU,1,1,4.0,"What got me caught on this song was hearing a remake from the Webb Brothers. The remake took the best aspects of the song and gave it a updated polish. All that means is the original, while sounding dated, still holds both a unique and familiar feel to it. The song has two different parts to it. These parts are completely different from each other in just about all things. The feel, groove and even time signature are different. The first part is very much a forward moving and brooding feel to it reminiscent of the old western films. The other part switches to a 3/4 time signature with Nancy Sinatra singing softly about nature. Both sides seem to switch back in forth in either a dance or a duo between each other. Kind of a one side masculine and one feminine.

Much has been said about the meaning of the song and lyrics. The obvious is one part is a man who was influenced by somebody named Phaedra, and the other is Phaedra herself speaking of what she is all about. Is it all about romance? Is it about evolving to a higher sense of being? Is it just about sex? I found no definitive answers out there. I like to think it's about redemption given to somebody hardened by life by one who is at one with her surroundings.

It's such a simple song yet it is filled with complexity not just in lyrics but musically as well. It's been covered many times, but I find going back to the original keeps me in touch with just how beautiful the song is in both its darker and warmer tones. If you like 60's psychedelic music they don't get much better than this."
A4S2GMZIQKEHY,B000QO760C,1,1,5.0,Like most folks I heard this song in Kill Bill and was very curious who sung it and the like. I really like the guitar on this and how it accents with the lyrics. Its a good one for 99 cents.
AQYKAM1XQ9779,B000QO760C,1,1,5.0,Love this Music
AB223NDBZMVA8,B000QO760C,1,1,5.0,Good
A2II87QJ1YIDWQ,B000QO760C,-1,1,5.0,Classic
A2J096HDALTSMA,B000QO760C,1,1,4.0,"Nancy Sinatra at her best. Slow, sultry song with memorable lyrics, what more could one ask for? Typically of 60s songs and more ballad than rock. A must have for any Nancy fan."
A252UVOWRR2KPW,B000QO760C,1,-1,3.0,...Cher or Nancy Sinatra.  But it was Nancy Sinatra's version of Bang Bang that was used in the movie Kill Bill.
A3RMZPK9F8EV1M,B000QOIE8K,1,1,4.0,"Good tunes, did I mention I dislike writing reviews ??"

A2GV4NJZVK1228,B000QOIE8K,1,1,5.0,"I never get tired of listening to this music, reminiscent of a more innocent time. Wish I was back there"
A2W556IHVPZJVC,B000QOIE8K,1,1,5.0,"This edition is just as I heard it on the radio growing up.  The lyrics are still powerful and well-phrased, the vocals still include harmonizing Falsetto (which I cannot stand normally, but these guys did it perfectly), and the guitar work still has the slightly metallic electric guitar sound of classic rock.  Have to love it."
A1PQNXFH9Q2KUJ,B000QOIE8K,1,1,5.0,This was one of many that made it through the 70's and touched peoples hearts as they were growing up. I've loved this group all through school. Giving away my age but music is not the same anymore!
A135GWMXMTR58Z,B000QOIE8K,1,1,5.0,great song from a great era of music brings back lots of memories of my childhood great band who had some good songs

A1KD0VWHR8GCPH,B000QOEN6W,-1,1,4.0,"I've always liked this tune but its really a short run-time  Reminds me of the movie Full Metal Jacket, this tune is played about midway thru the video."
A2TCS5WHOWV1D3,B000QOEN6W,-1,1,5.0,Music of my ear an dlove it
A2WHVAVATUFFSS,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,Nancy Sinatra's most notable song is one of my favorites.
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,These Boots Are Made For Walkin by Nancy Sinatra is a bold pop song about a singer expressing in an assertive way of what she plans on doing with her boots. The music to the song is also well-timed with when she expresses with the lyrics how one of these days her boots are going to etc. etc.
A10M52OJSDB8WK,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for.  This is the version I remembered.
AC6H5O5PPZ9FG,B000QOEN6W,1,1,4.0,"I heard Jessica Simpson (I think) sing this and really wanted to hear the Nancy Sinatra version I heard as a kid, which I think sounds better."
A1IQV4GY77TJKU,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,"WHAT'Z TO SAY. IT'Z A SONG D/LOAD AND IT PLAYED FINE, FULL LENGTH..."

AZ5WZ0KJKPFLC,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,The only song with a real beat.  Still hooks me every time.
A3BHOM951PY42M,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,This is a much better copy you have in store! The first one I had shared online years ago either went viral or no longer fits well in my iTunes library. But now I have this copy in my iPod! Thanks so much!
AZGFIBEPXL8VT,B000QOEN6W,1,1,4.0,SATISFIED
A2O2TK53QQQVPK,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.
A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,"I loved the 1960's the songs were so strong and almost militant by standards of the day.  In the backdrop of the times These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was one of the rallying cries of women fed up with the traditional roles of homemaker and mommy.  These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was more than a song it was a metaphor that spoke to empowerment of the so called weaker sex.  More than just a woman's rallying cry this was a darn good song too.  This song like so many others is a joyful part of my 1960's era childhood.  In 2014 its fun to look back into the world now long gone.  Sometimes when I listen to these songs like These Boots Are Made For Walkin' I remember listening to the car radio, the memory is sometimes so vivid can almost smell the Ford Fairlane 500 that was our family car."
A1R4N457AE3902,B000QOEN6W,1,1,4.0,"When Frank Sinatra have kids, they all follow in his footsteps and make it in the entertainment business.  Nancy Sinatra is talented in her singing style of telling a story of  what is going to happen.  The song have great melody and lyrics!"
A2J096HDALTSMA,B000QOEN6W,1,1,4.0,"Four stars because it is 60s ballad music. Though this is an iconic classic and has much more rock and roll sounds than many of her other songs, it still is a Sinatra ballad. A must have for any Sinatra collection."
A3SA4B38HG3UEL,B000QOEN6W,1,1,4.0,Love the music great beat. Sometimes I Sing along. I would recommend this to anyone and I hope they like it like I do
AIEILJSYAWK09,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,This song never ever ever gets old.  One of the best old songs to listen to even now in 2013.
A135GWMXMTR58Z,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great
A2DVC764946Z77,B000QOEN6W,1,1,5.0,This is one of the songs that I like the most of Nancy Sinatra; quality never desapoints doesn't matter how many years ago the song was recorded
A1GR2QPCD08COG,B000QOEN6W,1,-1,3.0,"Not sure why but listening to it today it doesn't have that sound that I heard when I was kid. I heard it on the oldies but goodies station when I was maybe 10 or 12; and I thought it had a great beat. Listening to Sinatra's voice today as an adult, though I notice that she doesn't seem to have much of a singing voice. The beat is still good but something's not quite right.

It's a good song."
A135GWMXMTR58Z,B000QON62O,1,1,4.0,Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.
A3QM06DR4MFUE4,B000QONMQ4,1,1,5.0,"Classic psychedelic song, by an eventual country artist.  Great song."
A348GYLVPWT8AK,B000QONMQ4,1,1,4.0,"My dad was feeling nostalgic and wanted me to download this song, who knew country Kenny Rogers sang trippy music"
A3ILDSCEJJWS9I,B000QONMQ4,1,1,4.0,Good song.
A1OKPC1K12YZEP,B000QONMQ4,1,1,5.0,Another of my favorite Kenny Rogers & The First Edition songs.
A334PU2IBXEQD5,B000QONMQ4,1,1,5.0,"For folks who only know K. Rogers as a ""Country"" artist...Take a listen to his foray into Psychedelic Rock in the 60's!  Great Stuff!"
AHX3WF4PBV9D1,B000QONMQ4,-1,1,5.0,"All i have to say is ""DUUUUDE"""
A2WE5R44SIWN8E,B000QONMQ4,1,1,5.0,It brings back memories of my youth.  I'm 59 years old.  Rogers had quite a range back then.  Who knew that he would become such a huge country star.
AVR7IAWO7Z0VQ,B000QONMQ4,1,1,5.0,A lot of people don't realize before Kenny Rogers went country he was one of the 60's Hippy movement. This is a really great album and the song is a favorite of all those that dropped out and tuned in.
A2SLOF85ZZQYEG,B000QONMQ4,1,1,4.0,to believe that this song was done by Kenny Rogers about a bad trip that he and the First Edition had. At least that is what he said in a Playboy interview shortly after they did this song but it still is a Great song from a bygone era.
A3BIV1X1K9R796,B000QONMQ4,1,1,5.0,"I grew up listening to these guys, not realizing back then what a great set of vocals the Kenny Rogers had. A great song and a timeless classic!!"
A8Y7VL4GFT3I5,B000QOSKDO,1,1,5.0,"Iris DeMent has a really great voice, she does a very haunting rendition of Leaning On The Everlasting Arms"
A33Q00PR75IBUK,B000QOSKDO,1,1,5.0,"This song made the movie, True Grit.  I hope the audience truly gave this great hymn some thought.  The everlasting arms of God are always there is reach us and take us to a secure place with Christ."
A18X6ZT4AEYVKB,B000QOSKDO,1,1,5.0,"i love this, i was really affected on how they used this in the theme music for True grit, a story about a girl who is brave and lives by leaning on the Everlasting Arms even in danger...."
A1SA8WITLQNRWD,B000QOYJWU,-1,1,5.0,"was experimenting with music downloads to my kindle, don't plan to download too many songs there, did a few old favorites"

A1DO9LRCO23EOM,B000QP0QBC,1,1,5.0,"Loved this song first time I heard it decades ago and still love it. 5 stars from me, but since music tastes are so subjective, make sure you listen to the audio clip before you buy it."
A4AK5HMUQPADK,B000QP6SVY,1,1,5.0,It's the music and artist I wanted... so of course it's a good review.
A1L0T3KRHRRYPM,B000QP6SVY,1,1,5.0,The best as advertised.

A2IZZPM37ZLKP4,B000QP6SVY,1,1,5.0,I had to download this song. It brings back so many memories

AS1WAYYI800SJ,B000QP6SVY,1,1,5.0,"Great song, many memories, it's a classic!  Just love the tune, and I realized I should opt to buy it, hot wait to chance hearing it again, on the oldies station!"
A3374Z04IJ8R5O,B000QP6SVY,1,1,5.0,"I love this song and use it as a ring tone for someone named...You got it, Louie.  The beginning of the song fits perfectly where it needs to."

AFT1VNGNMPWPZ,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"I don't even bother to listen to anyone else do this song. It will forever be etched into happy memories of my younger days.  Yes, the lyrics are simple and repetitive and the music, well, kinda silly, but I love the sentiment and the joy it brings."
A1UODWQ2K6DFXT,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"I loved this back in the 60's,and still love in today.""I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life."" Can it be any clearer or dearer?? No. It can't.
So put the top down,hook up your iPod,set it to this song,and you and your honey sing away like the kids you used to be,and still are. Thankfully."
A1MVLJ6N2ZZZZK,B000QP7U8O,1,1,5.0,Enjoyable

A2RNYF2PTOB82J,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,Excellent
A3SC4XMRTKY0LM,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"It's a song track.  I like it, I wanted it, I bought it.  It is a quick way to get a single you want.  I use these as practice aids for band work.  The MP3 format is not optimum for real listening enjoyment.  In order to compress the data, a lot of tones are left out.  Even a good cassette tape outperforms this storage medium.  But it has its uses, and is inexpensive."
AV3RNXJZ3SBZ8,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,love this song
A264LJ7DXWHJQH,B000QP7U8O,-1,1,5.0,xlint

A3RPL6GR6FPZRA,B000QP7U8O,-1,-1,3.0,Heard this at the end of a movie but never listened to it.
A2N5VE7XY18XES,B000QP4IBG,1,1,4.0,"Flo and Eddie may have had a dark side when the played with Zappa, but this ain't it. This is a classic song remastered to sound good in the digital age."
A1OTWKSJ933COE,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,Easy to purchase and download with Amazon software.
ARYVQL4N737A1,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,This is a definitive '60s song with one of the more memorable vocal chorus/harmonies from that era. A great song with that  classic '60s sound and feel :)
A3396GPI82T724,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,This song brings back great memories of my younger days when making a public phone call only cost a dime.
A1NTNTHE19LQ8H,B000QP7U8O,1,1,4.0,I really like this song a lot.  It's got just the right blend of a catchy tune with good music.  Like this one a lot!  And there's a hilarious video with this piece on YouTube.

A5ZELOQA2OY7V,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"This is a great song.  The lyrics are super, and the tune is one of those that is going to stay in your mind for a while.  If you want to feel happy and carefree, this is a song that will probably work in that wonderful way for you.  It's a beautiful song with great vocal, great lyrics, and a wonderfully happy tune."

A3HCK3UXD6WS4G,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"A great 60's teen love song! Well done, with good sound production. Great band."
A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B000QP7U8O,1,1,5.0,"People who work are expected to take part in the kind of mechanism without magic that avoids anything that is going on in this song. As personalities in a fog, we always sense an iceberg approaching at ramming speed. The key for me is she thinks crossing her legs is funny. This song works with a man and a woman singing about each other. The combination is a big door prize. There are ups and downs:

He ain't been laid in a month of Sundays.
I caught him once and he was sniffing my undies.

Intellectual involution is only aroused when magic makes whatever comes next far more interesting than what we have observed so far. The secrets that work for circus stunts, religion, philosophy, and the usual cosmic pogo stick ups keep our scrambled eggs all runny."
A2O9M97Q6WHW0B,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,Great music A+++

A36S72H1JKH2GR,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,It was played at my Sister Wedding and at mine. It is one of the best songs that the Turtles did.
A15PAOIJTZFZ52,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,I grew up in the 60's & 70's so this is the kind of music I enjoy.  Good Memories here
A16JXN9K1PA3IS,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"Sounds great.  A classic tune and aside from choosing ""how is the weather"" as the rhyme for ""so happy together"" a great song."
A2SIB3R3XTEYZF,B000QP4IBG,1,-1,3.0,"Good song! I am always looking for a good song that fits my emotional needs, and one that I can easily put on repeat. Otherwise, I wouldn't have purchased it."
ASHLINSRL21GS,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,This song takes me back to my listening youth. They are great at taking people home to a better time then nowadays. Very happy with all the transaction.
A1V0L6ZGWRVZW8,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"Grew up listening to my Dad sing this song to my Mom. Always makes me smile. It's a sweet, upbeat song you can dance to."
A3AQHY7T3FQG15,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"Just as good as when I listened to the song in the 60's. If you are from the 60's, you will love this song."
A194S9A44OLYQA,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"It is really nice to hear a song that you can sing along with.  A song that has words that make since.  A song that isn't vulgar.  If you like that kind of music, this is for you."
A2C5E8O6534UKP,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,Amazing!  Absolutely amazing...they nailed it.  Worth every penny (although I'm not suggesting in ANY way that any of the companies that sell music online should start charging more)!!
A1U4GOVZWL8ZTL,B000QP4IBG,1,1,4.0,"I like a lot of the songs the Turtles did back then but this one is border line bubble gum. Not that it's bad, it isn't. Actually a good tune."
A7KA68ILUFPOV,B000QP4IBG,1,1,5.0,"I grew up with Turtles music, I never tired of it, I will always enjoy their music, every song. Great!"
A108SSM7YMMTOM,B000QOMANK,1,1,5.0,Another Master of entertainment we shall never ever forget. Inspiring and delightful. Makes you smile every time you hear him and ashamed of how you concern yourself with your own meager problems when you remember how he overcame so much at that time.
A1CDSPVIPPELJ7,B000QOMANK,1,1,5.0,"Once again, I heard this song in the film ""Ray"" and remembered my parents playing it at home. 2 thumbs up!"
AT2NMYYV95TIM,B000QOMANK,1,1,5.0,Great oldie classic that is sure to remind you of when you were young(er)!  This is the shorter version of his recording.  I recommend it.
A3HE2PB8G19K17,B000QPL8QE,1,1,4.0,"I agree with James - the sound quality is not up to par, though a great song. However, the master tape was found at a NJ flea-mart and stored in a basement, so it's understandable about the sound quality. The original 45 or album will sound better."
A3E0EMWPWTC0L8,B000QPL8QE,1,1,4.0,"Rock, Funk maybe?
If you're +/- 40-years old, and don't recognize the title, you'll recognize the melody."
A3GUZMGGYL5BVE,B000QPL8QE,-1,-1,3.0,"This is the original re-issue of the song as is the subpar mastering, sorry. The song should have been remastered to corrospond with the digital era."
A3G6F9P47FPCIG,B000QPL8QE,1,1,5.0,I love this song
A1VJF3BCAYB3BO,B000QPL8QE,-1,1,5.0,"This immediately went intro my favorites collection and will get many plays!
Not a big follower of the rest of their stuff."
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000QPL8QE,1,1,5.0,"This was one of those unexpected songs from the 70's, from a band that we didn't know much about.  They had a great style which comes through very clearly in this song.  It's great to find songs like this to listen to again."
A2XR0RUGUVCXX5,B000QPYE2E,1,1,5.0,"Great Song, helps to worship you into praise and worship"
A2SC8X1S8P8CFS,B000QPYE2E,-1,-1,1.0,Terrible it won't play on my divice
AW9DBZ8CX8637,B000QPYE2E,1,1,5.0,Funny thing is... I fell in love with this song courtesy of Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad By Myself movie. Yip. This is definitely a pick me up song.
A1T7IK5QG4G595,B000QPYE2E,1,1,4.0,"My cousin was singing this song so I had to get plus I heard this song on ""I could do bad all by myself"" but I wish the sound track was out but I love this song."
A13465BNUF8L5A,B000QPWQ2E,-1,-1,3.0,The song I downloaded is more of a single vocal with a guitar background. I remembered it being more melodic and with some harmony. My memory is bad or there is another version of the song I missed.
A2RU9RVRSPYAA0,B000QPWQ2E,1,1,5.0,"Who doesn't know this song? If you are a rocker and you haven't heard it, you need to get more education. MP were one of the forerunners and should be in every collection"
A1ALYBBYCFD7OB,B000QPWQ2E,1,1,5.0,"This is an updated version of the song that defined Mason Proffit in the early 1970s. It is still musically beautiful, and the changed lyrics reflect less of the conflict between the counter-culture and the ""straight"" world, but rather, somewhat more universal concepts of justice and truth (and at what price they can be achieved)."
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000QQLW4G,1,1,5.0,"Mr. Desmond's voice was just so unusual and so unforgettable.  This was just a great song, no matter what kind of music you like."
AAI72UP8V9PD3,B000QQLW4G,1,1,5.0,combo of Reggae with a bit of hip hop - makes you happy to listen to it;  course its not a new song but there are so many that remain current and classic and this is one
A2WE5R44SIWN8E,B000QQLW4G,1,1,5.0,The great thing about the internet is that it allows me to rediscover songs from my past.  I never knew who sang this song until I found it on You Tube.
AFZ8M3KQY2DYY,B000QVL4NU,1,1,5.0,"Christmas jeer -- I mean cheer -- is all the rage!

I figured I would do my part for the retail industry and their obsession for Christmas in July and do a review on this tune appropriately -- in July. This sketch ranks up their with ""A Christmas Story"" and Ralphie along with his Red Rider BB gun with the Compass in the Stock/Stalk (who knows???) as being American classics.

This song is an undying testimony to America's obsessive nature with parody and an unrelenting need to kick back and say ""to hell with being up-tight"" and with good reason - stress is the killer (Fantasia and a white bat or something, anyway...) and life is not all that serious as it is irony based. It doesn't come as a surprise as to why the fine line between becoming productive or postal rests somewhere in letting go for a moment. Unfortunately, I know these things.

Enjoy!"
A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000QVL4NU,1,1,5.0,"""Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer"" is Dr. Emo's (yes, he really is a doctor) signature hit, that has gone down in history as becoming one of the most ludicrous modern X-Mas songs in recent history. The reason why I listen to this song almost everyday during Christmastime is because it's so funny and over-the-top. It's really a very tragic song (at least the lyrics are) but it's sung to sound funny and even rather screwballish. I remember there was a music-video made for it that VH1 used to show during Christmastime. My favorite part of the song is when Dr. Elmo asks deadpan: should we open up her gifts or send them back? It can't get more theatrical than that"
AOJTT268M9FLP,B000QVL4NU,1,1,5.0,"for a children's song, a little dark"
ADF3QQIDTOA6X,B000QVL4NU,-1,1,5.0,It's a classic.

A1049BXR3MAWT4,B000QVL4NU,1,1,5.0,I was missing the old christmas carrols I grew up on.  These brought back so many delightful childhood memories for me.  I was lucky to find them by the original recording artists
AK7Q7SIZL256G,B000QVL4NU,1,1,5.0,I played this song on Piano for a Christmas concert one year in High School and when I heard it on the radio one day it brought back memories.  My 6 year old son loves it and wants it played over and over. He thinks its hilarious!
A3QPDOV3OATWTU,B000QVL4NU,1,1,5.0,Awesome. Loved it. What would Christmas be without this hilarious song??? I always catch myself singing it starting in early November.
A3EXZJLQLQ8XCS,B000QVU0OE,1,1,4.0,"Very nice job on this song !
Love the horn lines !"
A1XWM9JESCL1R7,B000QVU0OE,1,1,4.0,"Great song, don't listen to when going through a breakup could induce temporary drinking...lol. I would recommend a listen though."
A3MX12O0RFMWW6,B000QVU0OE,1,1,5.0,"I had never heard of this singer prior to seeing this free MP3.  I am a fan of blues-style music so the preview sounded good to me and I am glad I downloaded it.  It features some nice guitar playing and singing, but the lyrics are rather simple.  I admit I like the kind of lyrics that break your heart (probably why I like the blues so much) and this isn't telling that kind of a story - the lyrics are a little too simple for that, but it does have a very nice sound with nice guitar riffs."
A2UHIQNHUD3XFR,B000QVT8SS,1,1,5.0,"Having served in the Marines I've heard this done by bands all over the country and world.  This was free on Veterans day, so I grabbed it."

A28LZYXYDXDM7G,B000QVXDR0,1,1,5.0,"This reminds me of going to the Sign Board Bar at Crown Center in Kansas City...Perfect for an intimate listening crowd.  I can remember people calling out, ""Oh Yeah, play it, Brother!!:"
A1XWM9JESCL1R7,B000QVXDR0,-1,-1,3.0,"I don't know if this was recorded live or not but the sound came through as if there was no mic, song would have sounded better if you could understand the singer clearly."
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000QVXDR0,1,1,5.0,"""Sadie"" by Son Seals -- This classic Hound Dog Taylor Chicago blues song finds pulse and life in Son Seals. The singer, it seems, has made excuses for things he cannot defend. Sadie has left, and he wants her to return, but she is not sure this is a good idea.

Great piano and B. B. King-like guitar.

""Sadie, will you come back home tonight
Oh Sadie, will you come back home tonight
I love you, and you know I'm gonna treat you right.""

I fully recommend ""Sadie"" by Son Seals.

A3JJ21YCMGSKGH,B000QZVK9Y,1,1,5.0,"Nancy And Lee is a fine album that pointed Nancy Sinatra firmly toward pop music in the 1960's. This album moved her beyond the rock and roll sex kitten years of Boots, and partnered her with Lee Hazelwood. Particular favorite duets are Summer Wine, Jackson, Some Velvet Morning, Sand, and Lady Bird. Nancy Sinatra fans will love this CD."
A1HBI9BBQIG1NH,B000QZVK9Y,1,1,5.0,"Nancy and Lee are a perfect combination,like Sonny and Cher. Lee is the writer with the gravel voice and the troubadour personna. Nancy is  the kitten with the school girl toughness,feminine and smart. They had several hits in their  groovy day and the best are here. Jackson,Summer wine,and Sand are great examples of the duos country pop that defined their unique sound. Billy Strange production brings out the most honest pop sound that is fresh as it was then .This is one of my favorite lps! This is the best of their sixties output,and they also did a swan song album a few years back. But,the charm is in these recordings here. The cd is out of print and sells for a small bundle,but here it is on mp3!"
A3TXWIDMKRYG3J,B000QZVK9Y,1,1,4.0,So that's why I purchased it and I'm truly not sorry. You will be sorry if you miss this deal-a great collection of songs from an era now bygone by two artist who for a moment helped define that era! A must own for Nancy fans.

AOIQXY51I12F1,B000S3KQOE,1,1,4.0,Quirky and timeless retro acid-like alternative-style rocker with kitchy lyrics.  Recommend to anyone exploring or re-exploring the alternative music movement.

A2VET003MCRZM2,B000S3KQOE,1,1,4.0,"I worked with a woman back in the 80s who would sing the hook for this over and over. And I worked PT at a Top 40 radio station at the time, so- you know- I didn't hear it ENOUGH. I hated this song. Now that I'm older (and far removed from from hearing it incessantly), it's a good listen."
AYX1DZVLYWZP7,B000S3KQOE,1,1,5.0,"Very funny song.  I first heard it when i was in college, and my roommate and i would bust out laughing every time we heard it.  This version seems longer than i remember it, but it's still fun."
A3EUXTG2UR21BB,B000S3KQOE,1,1,5.0,"Nice to have my childhood song available as a crisp digital version.

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000S3BNY6,1,1,5.0,"From my exposure of VH1, I was in 7th grade when I first heard I Ran by A Flock of Seagulls. This catchy song has a hybrid of synth-pop and electro rock in the beat and appears to be a song about falling in love with someone who is different in some way from many people. Im glad that this song is available to hear online (Amazon prime, youtube, Pandora, iheartradio etc.) because it is rarely played on local radio where my husband and I current reside."
AO1JG7SMPAAV7,B000S3BNY6,1,1,5.0,Great song

A11YRHINAJNUQJ,B000S3BNY6,1,1,5.0,A flock of Seagulls had a hit with this song as the music had a rousing beat and the voices that went so well with the beat of the song that took you along for the ride upon the rhythm of the band as they put their heart into the tune they sang and played. Years have come and gone but the songs of The Flock Of Seagulls lives on beautifully.
A29HJWVO1SAZED,B000S3BNY6,1,1,4.0,"Being an MTV generation baby, this is a fave. Reminds me of the airline clerk at the airport in The Wedding Singer when Adam Sandler runs off the Vegas to stop Drew Barrymore from eloping... Song popped into my head one day and I had to download it."
AYM5IYPZ9P02I,B000S3BNY6,1,1,4.0,"I originally started working out to this song in the 80's on an Armed Forces Workout ALBUM

so  the  download was a trip down memory lane"
A39LJ3P2XJC8ZP,B000S3BNY6,1,1,5.0,I added this to my workout mix simply because of its nostalgic value.  It takes me back to the 80's and I can just go with it.  Excellent song; excellent memories!

A2WEGDBXTCHCLI,B000S43HH6,1,1,4.0,This song was really hard to find.  But there have been several hard to find songs that I've managed to acquire on Amazon.
AVR7IAWO7Z0VQ,B000S43HH6,1,1,5.0,I heard the song on a TV commercial and thought it was one of the songs from the group Cars. But now I have learned to like a new singer. Gary has a lot of interesting songs. I hope to purchase more of his music.

me of younger days!!!! thanks again!!!!"
A3TCMA9ZVW4EM1,B000S43HH6,1,1,5.0,"To me, Gary Numan is still very cutting edge even though this song was recorded many years ago.  His musicality with the keyboards is quite striking and I can never hear enough of this song."
A2F60KMJ4DGJA1,B000S43HH6,-1,1,5.0,I needed the songs from this album to resurrect a compilation album fro the 80's.. called rock 80. An album put out by K-Tel records.
A19WTUQI42GVOL,B000S4GHYG,1,1,5.0,In the short science fiction story Transit of Mars the great science fiction writer Arthur C. Clark has his protagonist call this the most awesome piece of music ever composed.  Who am I to argue with a great man?
A28P52NLQ6VC0X,B000S4GHYG,1,1,5.0,"How does a mere musical mortal like me presume to rate J.S. Bach?  This is the fugue everyone recognizes, and this quality recording can be carried on the Kindle Fire to be played anytime, anywhere.  Carry a piece of musical history with you today."
A1OYBH8H1RMLEP,B000S4MGIC,1,1,5.0,This is a great song for the the adult type and make one laugyh and laugh. Everyone I let hear eat just laughed amd ;loved it. Get it and pass it down tn ones family. Thanks for such a cool song.

A225D4O3MFF3II,B000S4MGIC,1,1,4.0,"If You Like Collecting Odd Songs That Have A Comedy Overtone, This Is The Song For You. Although It Contains Adult Language, It Is Quite Unique And Is A Great Addition To Your Collection"
A2DAPMMYMQ2NPL,B000S4MGIC,1,1,4.0,"It's funny and a VERY vulgar commentary on person-to-person interactions.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless one is comfortable hearing a stream of expletives.  You don't want to hear from behind you, ""Honey, what are you listening to?!""  Ooops."
A2SNK9GM1IDIJU,B000S4MGIC,-1,-1,3.0,"It was a musical cattle prod when it first came out, but it just tame now.  Fun to re-visit, but it didn't stay long in my collection."
A1KQP8WGAKLN8B,B000S4JH1Q,1,1,5.0,"If you are in to classics, this is a great tune to listen to.  The orchestration in this is great and the composer did a great job making this record."

A32HMOZVKF25A,B000S4VDPE,1,1,5.0,"If you're an old ""hard""rock and roller like myself, you'll love this one.  Most young people would not be able to guess how old this song is from listening to it.  It's still awesome music."
AMPXEKJNVIX8L,B000S4VDPE,1,1,5.0,This is a classic tune that has been remastered for the Mp3 download. It put Uriah Heep in mainstream rock on the radio. I was in highschool when this came out and it moves me still.
A35XFI5R1FHQHL,B000S50DEK,1,1,5.0,"I bought the song for a dvd I was making of my parents.  Such a beautiful, touching song.  There's not a dry eye in the house when Nat sings."
AIDI6WS1XU23I,B000S50DEK,1,1,5.0,for those of us who dream of romantic love songs this one is it...
A2KMT280NB1TW8,B000S50DEK,1,1,5.0,"I have always loved Stardust by Hoagy Carmichael, and he is an IU alum, like I am. Years ago Nat King Cole was one of my favorite singers. I would wait up all night to hear some of his songs on the radio. Now I can listen to the best"
A2X695AM08AIN1,B000S50DEK,1,1,5.0,Perhaps a little maudlin but I would nominate this song and singer as the best planet Earth could produce in any intergalactic faceoff. There is nobody or no thing smoother than King Cole.
AZLR3AHKXOVAK,B000S50DEK,1,1,5.0,"Of course, Nat King Cole is the King. Some thought it was Elvis, but the real king was Nat. Stardust was his best in my opinion, although he had so many best ones some would argue and be justified."
A32EF8CKB8RSRT,B000S50W1E,1,1,5.0,I wasn't a Tina Turner fan until I was much older.  I also wasn't fond of this song until maturity changed my musical tastes.  This song is so good!
A20QVNZNN32I4U,B000S50C5A,1,1,5.0,another great song by Chris Tomlin!
A3359P76C0N5B6,B000S50C5A,1,1,5.0,Chris Tomlin has become a mainstay in Christian praise songs.  This is another of his finer hymns and I look forward to more.
A3I8GC0R44ON1L,B000S50C5A,1,1,5.0,this album is a wonderful one. Chris Tomlin is an outstanding performer and writer and this cd shows it all over again
ASP8ZHQ41Y33P,B000S50VHE,1,1,5.0,"Great song! All of the double meanings in it, the synth. The sound quality is great, very clear. Totally 80s and totally awesome."

A1RFPQKK32YPTR,B000S51XMQ,1,1,5.0,"I have listened tot he song, sung the song and also enjoyed so much about it.  Because when Jesus took my chains away - I was free.  You can be as well.  Listen to the song and surrender your will to the Lord Jesus.  He can and will set you free from Sin."

I admit to not being computer saavy, but this was very hard for me to do.  Because of that I will not download again.  I was however able to talk with a Jenny at Amazon who guided me through the steps and was very pleasant during my time on the phone with her.  If I could have I would have hugged her.  I would recommend this song to anyone who likes the old hymns and praise and worship.  A great mixture of both."

hits the spot.."
A1EFNOPYEZ0BQW,B000S51XMQ,1,1,5.0,"This song is a little bit updated version of an old standard and favorite hymn.  I would highly recommend it to any Christian music fan, to anyone who likes contemporary music, any Chris Tomlin fan, or just anyone who likes the song Amazing Grace.  There's enough of the standard/familiar hymn to satisfy the older more traditional crowd while still appealing to the younger more contemporary crowd as well."

A2UBQA85NIGLHA,B000S51XMQ,1,1,5.0,"Of all the religious songs, this is probably the most known.

There are probably over a hundred renditions available, but this one I really like.

This is one of those songs that you can search the Internet and find a ""free"" copy, but I wanted a version that the artist got rewarded for his/her work.

I hope this makes sense."
A2KQT4D0OZR569,B000S51XMQ,-1,1,5.0,"Chris Tomlin seems to sing this song from a place of faith rather than as a popular folk song that the singer doesn't really believe.  And, this version ties together Jesus' amazing grace and what it means to me personally - He set me free!"
A18IROB5G9N6L6,B000S52DRK,-1,1,5.0,"let's if you really read these post, this is a great song, Steve Wariner needs to record a verison for Grandpa, this was the second one I downloaded and paid for, the frist one I downloaded was bad, had to delete it, it was a bad, part of the song was missing."

AN87P9433INVO,B000S52DRK,1,1,5.0,"The words, the music, the artist all make this song so beautiful.  I recommend this song to anyone missing their loved ones."
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000S5111E,1,1,5.0,"Back in the 80's, there were so many great songs, that some got lost in the shuffle, only for those 80's kids to bring them back in their current work. This underrated song was all but lost to the radio time vaults till Napoleon Dynamite made it its credits song, perfectly going along with the movie. The result was the rediscovering of this classic, and amazingly, it still held up. Covers quickly ensued.

Musically, the song has a lite poppy feel, that is distinctively 80's. Is it 70's? No. Is it 90's? Nope, it is unmistakably 80's. It's a nice feel to the song, and it really adds an extra flavor to it. Vocally, while the verses lag, and fail to deliver a great punch, making for the only complaint of the song, the main chorus is perfect. Well, almost, that ""I promise you,"" does drag it down.

However, the lyrics are really the crown jewel and highlight of the song. They're as great now as they were then, if not more so. They're well written, emotional in unexpected ways, and it really speaks about the aspect of love that's rarely touched upon: Us guys who can't think of the perfect words to say to our perfect and lovely ladies. The lyrics really hit home for us poor guys, and really make it an even better song than it already was.

Overall, one of the most underrated and forgotten about songs from the 80's that was lost for so many years, but is finally making a comeback. Why iTunes doesn't have it is beyond me, and is really a musical travesty. So many fans are getting jibbed of great music.

In other arenas, the song went perfect with Napoleon Dynamite, and the song seemed better because of it. It's like they completed each other to make one another more emotional in their own little way.

And because of the movie, covers ensued. Anberlin's cover of the song wasn't that great. It was a straight up cover, with some acoustic elements added to it, that really didn't add to the song. Plus, they are so alike on vocals, you still had the same problem. New Found Glory also covered the song, but they made it more upbeat than the original, giving it more of a pop/rock influence, but it still kept the emotion of the original song, and added another layer to it."
A8OON06QWYWQT,B000S5111E,1,1,5.0,Great! Worth download!
A2UYBXJACYG1N9,B000S5111E,1,1,5.0,Awesome
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000S5111E,1,1,5.0,The Promise by When In Rome Appears to be a cheery song about the singer reassuring someone that they care about that they are always going to be there for that person.  The combo of synth-pop and 80s dance also make The Promise a good song to add to a happy love song playlist.
AV3RNXJZ3SBZ8,B000S5111E,1,1,5.0,love this song
A3Q4NULWZU3RI,B000S5111E,1,1,5.0,"It's sad that in 2015 music in general is broken and fake
There are those that love to point fingers and pick on the 80's and the music that came from that decade of excess!
The interesting thing that decade did have some dated corny music but, even some of the over-blown 1 hit wonders had great 1 hits

Case in point When In Rome  with there massive hit The Promise
I find it hard to believe that a band that craft such a flawless single only had one hit
But, it's a great timeless one hit!
Even though it sounds very 1980's with the key board nobody is using auto-tune to hide anything
It's not overly studio produced there is life in this song (it has a soul)
The Promise is a True 80's classic in every sense of the word anyone who'll disagree it and say it sucks, is lying to them self
It's a catchy perfect pop song  10/10"
AHM0BJW4T0DNB,B000S5111E,1,1,5.0,Awesome tune! Must have to complete your 80's collection!

A33Q00PR75IBUK,B000S51X9E,1,1,5.0,How can we keep from praising our marvelous God?  This song is timeless and helped me to stay positive through major surgery.  Chris Tomlin is so versatile and his music is great.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000S52E9W,1,1,5.0,"There is no question that today, music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers, Joe Cocker who passed away at 70 years old. He honestly was one of the greatest singers of all time, who knew how to belt out remarkable songs on his own, and doing renditions of other artists songs. He had his ups and downs with his life, but always kept music in tune. When he did another artist in song, he took it into another place like his cover of the classic Ray Charles song Un-Chain My Heart, which came out in the 1987. The song just remains a classic, and showcases his bluesy voice and a soulful heart kept alive in song and in real heart. It is truly a blessing at soul, and what he put out with great music. Joe Cocker will definitely be missed in song, and in spirit. His heart has been un-chained.

Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near

You'll find that life is still worthwhile

Smile, a very special piece composed by the great Charlie Chaplin for his 1936 film entitled ""Modern Times,"" had its lyrics and title added by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons in 1954. This song, a classic little masterpiece, gets the royal treatment from Nat ""King"" Cole, who delivers this ballad with panache. Nat's excellent diction, sophisticated phrasing and sense of timing make this version of ""Smile"" one of my very favorites. It never fails to move me; this is an incredibly poignant musical number. I highly recommend this music."

I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.  So if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a CD of your chosing that expresses your love for her.
A36A1ZYZH8568P,B000S55UPC,1,1,5.0,"Okay, when it comes to music, I'm from a past generation (or two). I'd never heard of Michael Martin Murphy ... even if he did hang out with Willie Nelson. I liked his voice - mostly a smooth high-end baritone - so much that I downloaded six more songs. He's great to listen to whether country-western or crossover songs. A little higher baritone than Dean Martin, and more like Gene Autry."

A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000S56380,1,1,5.0,"This fun 1982 hit by ""Bad to the Bone"" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers needs volume. I work out to it, keeping it a regular running playlist song.

I'm a car singer. When it is just me, I turn it up and sing at the top of my lungs. This one brings out my inner blues man. As a running song, it carries a strong tempo, a hard beat, and twice the attitude found in anything Katy Perry sings.

""On the day I was born, the nurses all gathered 'round.
And they gazed in wide wonder, at the joy they had found.
The head nurse spoke up, and she said leave this one alone.
She could tell right away, that I was bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone.""

I fully recommend ""Bad to the Bone"" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers.

A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000S56380,1,1,4.0,"George Thorogood plays no frills rock & roll heavily steeped in Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry.  ""Bad To The Bone"" is probably his most recognizable song and is a chunky piece of braggadocio that echoes the great Mr. Diddley.  Mr. Thorogood gravelly voice rumbles through the song alongside his buzz saw guitar with a horn piercing in and out to add an exclamation point."

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000S55TTY,1,1,5.0,"There is honestly so much that could be said about Joe Cocker and his gifts in song. The guy was honestly one of the most amazing singers that had ever came out of the Woodstock. He honestly was amazing with each and every song he had recorded and performed live. The guy was absolutely a remarkable singer But this past year had showed a sad and tragic end to his brilliant end, losing his life to lung cancer, as a result from his twenty years plus of drug and alcohol addiction. But he left behind a cavalcade of great songs from With A Little Help From My Friends, and especially Up Where We Belong. His collaboration with Jennifer Warnes which won a academy award for Best Song and a Grammy Award in 1983. It is a lovely romantic ballad that still captures the soul of the heart. Joe & Jennifer had a connection that many of today's artists couldn't even come close to at heart. If you had never even heard of a Joe Cocker song before, than this is one I would recommend going to.

Song: A-"
A2616YSIRQGFG4,B000S55TTY,1,1,5.0,"It is a great song performed by the writer, Buffy St. Marie, and it is teriffic by Warnes and Crocker."
A1P1Y27488LQ3I,B000S55TTY,1,1,5.0,A great duet and a song that was perfect for the movie. Joe Cocker had a sound all his own you never confused his voice with someone else.

A2UHIQNHUD3XFR,B000S75FHI,1,1,5.0,"I came across this song on YouTube and I remember when it first came out. I also remember Adam Curry on MTV asking, `Why is Dan Aykroyd in the video?'  Check it out if you don't believe me.  I got the song because it reminds me of simpler times and our first mass outreach to help others before corporations and governments made everything go them.  It's a great song and it was good to see some of the performers again."
AK0BQPFK2RWNY,B000SEZW42,1,1,5.0,"Songs like ""Let the Music Play"" never go out of style.  Some of my relatives who weren't born when this song was made enjoy just it as much as their ""elders""!"
A1KE19CDYIO2YN,B000SEZW42,1,1,5.0,This song reached #1 on US Danmce Chart in 1983 and #8 on US Singles Chart in 1984.  It's been covered by several artists and groups over the years.
A2PR4VEKXHZ0JU,B000SEZW42,1,1,5.0,"I downloaded this mp3 song and added it to my ""Walking Playlist"". Shannon's music brought back memories of listening to the SOS band, Expose' and other back in the day artists. I love listening to this genre of music because of it's up beat tempo."

A5ZELOQA2OY7V,B000SF2UXW,1,1,5.0,"This song is about a dog who died based on a True incident.  It is SOOOO beautiful!.

It is a bit sad about the dog, but it will bring you to the ""heart of the matter"" and it is peaceful and beautiful and lovely.  The tune is one you won't forget."

This is a great recording. The recording is impeccable. I love these old classics!

A2W556IHVPZJVC,B000SFFCTG,1,1,5.0,This performance really captures the haunting beauty of one of Beethoven's most renowned and most popular sonatas. It is exactly what people think of when they hear the title--no extra embellishment.

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000SFONMI,1,1,5.0,"For Whatever Reason, So Alive by Love And Rockets came into my awareness again when I unintentionally heard them at a Walgreens store near my apartment when my husband was getting us some things. I had thought about this song out of the blue less than 14 days prior and it is a song that I have rarely heard on local radio where I currently live or online. I remember this rock/pop song fondly because I first heard it via local radio growing up and I enjoyed the message of a mystery person captivating someones attention and making them feel very much on top of the world metaphorically speaking with lyrics such as the feel Im on top again baby thats got everything to do with you."
A1MSD57MUPHNX3,B000SFONMI,1,1,5.0,Good song

A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B000SGWZMM,1,1,5.0,"until after watching the 200th episode special. The show was my favorite of all time, I can still watch it and laugh, well crafted, well written and perfectly cast. The song had a bittersweet tone to it, reflecting the theme of the show, life may be lonely, it may get you down, but there is always someplace to go where everyone knows you and actually wants you around. Great song. Gary Portnoy also wrote the theme to Punky Brewster, at the time I used to think the song, like Punky (she's grown into a lovely young woman) was cute, and at times it felt a bit cheesy but as I hear it today that song actually makes me miss those cheesy days."

A363HKFJUQ1NHF,B000SG5W22,1,1,5.0,I have liked this song ever since it hit the radio waves. It is a nice easy enjoyable song to listen to. It is a song that I like to listen to every chance I get. I like Berite Higgins singing this song. Thank you Sandy McClaflin

ARYKNMYUIQ7H2,B000SNWFSE,1,1,5.0,"This is a great song because it shows God's sovereignty. The example of Lazarus is used to show that even when we think God is too late to intervene, He does things that we think are impossible. This song has been an encouragement to me in many difficult situations."
A2H0CYF1B7B6SS,B000SNWFSE,1,1,5.0,No one sings this song like them. I heard this song on the radio years ago and it still sounds the same today with just as much feeling.
A3K7NC2E7DZ77D,B000SNWFSE,1,1,5.0,I saw them in person in 2013 and their music is so great!  This song always makes me tear up - because it reminds me that things happen not in our time (as humans) but in God's time - and he is never late!

A3FC3FC7OGI0T6,B000SNWFSE,1,1,5.0,"I heard this song on the Gaither Gospel Hour and just had to have it.  When Karen Peck sings a song you know she's going to tell you a great story.  What a message, God has perfect timing.  Even when He's four days late He's still on time.  Amen.  You will be cheering by the end of this song.  Karen Peck and New River are an amazing group and you will be blessed by this song.  I would recommend this song to everyone."

AYWQTPVYAF43L,B000SX87C2,1,1,5.0,"By the early 1990s, Duran Duran's popularity had faded. Their album Liberty had proved a commercial failure, its two singles failing to make a significant showing on British or American charts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDLiVwpv89s

It was not until Capitol leaked ""Ordinary World"" to a radio station in Florida in the autumn of 1992 that it looked like Duran Duran mania might yet hit again. The single proved so popular that Capitol had to push the US release date up, ultimately releasing it in December.

The keyboards in the song were arranged and performed by Nick Rhodes and John Jones. The drums were played by Steve Ferrone at Maison Rouge.

The guitar solo that characterizes this song was arranged and performed by Warren Cuccurullo, former player with Frank Zappa. His instrumental rock trio version became a staple of his solo shows and was included on one of his solo albums ""Roadrage"".

The music video was filmed by director Nick Egan at Huntington Gardens in San Marino, California and the song later featured in the soundtrack to the film Layer Cake in 2005.

Simon LeBon later performed the song with Pavarotti at a WarChild benefit.[2] The performance was released on home video as Pavarotti & Friends: Together for the Children of Bosnia.

The lyrics to ""Ordinary World"" were written by Simon Le Bon as the second of a trilogy of songs for his late friend David Miles; the others being ""Do You Believe in Shame?"" (1988) and ""Out of My Mind"" (1997)."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000SX87C2,1,1,4.0,"When it came down to what Duran Duran has had in music, they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled about them in song. Still, they had crossed over nicely in the 90's with the music from The Wedding Album, and some of the songs still ignite today like they did back in the 90's. Ordinary World is absolutely no exception. The song is definitely one of their better songs that the group had came out with. I love the rhythm of the song from start to finish. It is definitely one of their better songs they had came out with. If you are absolutely new to Duran Duran's music, this is a great song to download, and if you are a hard core fan of Duran Duran, you'll fall in love with this song and that is a ordinary world.

Song: B+"
A1DWAU5QF6YK5C,B000SX87C2,-1,1,5.0,"I have never liked the radio edit for
Ordinary world.  If you're going to own this song, get it from THIS album.  Did I say that I disliked the Radio Edited version?"
A1CHLJQMZN8LHG,B000SX87C2,-1,-1,1.0,"I'm sure everyone was curious to hear this album with ""Ordinary World.""  This song debuted in the late 90's.  Beforehand, all their stuff was from the 80's.  ""...ours is just a little trouble at all..."" I'm sure is a fav lyric by most of their fans.
It's not your traditional slow song.  You will also like ""Come Undone.""  I also have the trance version of ""Ordinary  World."""
A2GW5TTEKODNL8,B000SX87C2,1,1,5.0,Sometimes you just wanna take a quick trip back to yester-year. This song is as good as it was the day it released!
A1P9PG7KCYX50S,B000SX88OY,1,1,5.0,"I heard the song ""Sunrise"" in a Grocery store music system. The OOoh, OOoh chorus is so unmistakable in this song that I had to ask who it was as I had only heard the song once before. A person told me ""Norah Jones"".
  I then saw Norah perform this and several other ""Hits"" on Austin City Limits.  I downloaded this and some other female pop singer mp3s  to put together a kind of Pop Diva cd of my own. Norah tops the list. She is also a very skilled piano player. A wonderful talent. Amazon MP3 downloads are a great, low cost way to listen to a favorite vocalist or band."
A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B000SX6NYQ,1,1,4.0,"On of the best (and best known) songs from the Band. I actually like the live version from 'The Last Waltz' more. But since that one is only available if you download the whole album (which I don't want), guess this will do."

A3PNWDTE3B3JXV,B000SX9XQG,1,1,5.0,"Great beat and chorus.  Reminds you of summer and being at a great ballpark, like PNC Park! Also reminds me of my youth with kids yelling ""swing batter swing batter'!"
A2COVEY6OYK5JF,B000SX85CE,1,1,5.0,"My husband and I heard this song as part of a sitcom montagoue and then had it stuck in our heads for days- and so had to buy it off amazon mp3s.
What we keep repeating when we listen to it in the car: bands and singers from the 80s just can't be beat-
this song is so powerful- and so real- and so emotional-

you can literally FEEL the song through the lyrics.

I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh I hope that it won't end though
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone

How do I get you alone"
A28QH2NBBLYNXI,B000SX85CE,1,1,5.0,"This is a good song and Heart performed this song well.  Unfortunately, the Wilson Sisters did not write this song.  Some of their original compositions are among the greatest songs in Rock and Roll Music!"
A1XDXAK1L7UCKT,B000SX85CE,1,1,5.0,The ladies from Heart have two of the most powerful voices everywhere. This song is perfect to belt out in the car when no one is listening.  One of the greatest power ballads of the 80s.

This music matters more than any composer imagined a wired world would love itself to death with."

I had heard it before but didn't know who sang it. What a voice! I bought a few additional songs of her's after this one.
A3AD7WKNFVISBD,B000SXHB6K,1,1,5.0,"Its soft melody sets me to a pleasant mood with its slight variation of notes and a voice that is as comforting as the sea breeze. For me, this song is best played after a stressful day or before bedtime which drifts me into calmness and hypnosis."

A2M9U31RK1PRGL,B000SXHB6K,1,1,5.0,"This song is perfectly performed, lyrics are unexpected and quirky in a romantic manner.  The melody is a bit dark the contradiction of the juxtaposition of the whole story makes the love song all the more delightful and the longing is sweet and promising.  the girl can sing and delivers the lyric and the melody with all the nuance and emotion to suspend the listener within the story.  She is a quiet and compelling force , I don't of another performer who could have pulled it off so quietly but blow you away.  Maybe Bette Midler at the outside. Again it stands the test of time, she makes some intelligent choices."

A1QNX4MVE9RLH3,B000SXM2AK,1,1,4.0,Who doesn't like this song? A great American song by a great American band. The remastering does what technology couldn't do back in the day.
A1KE19CDYIO2YN,B000SXM2AK,1,1,5.0,"Song from the album of same name, one of two albums produced by Todd Rungren in 1973 on Capital label, and went platinum.  Remastered in 2002 and is still a classic from the Seventies.  Doesn't get much better than Grand Funk."

A2IHB3M0ZIKNOZ,B000SXC10Q,1,1,5.0,"This was one of Grand Funk's real anthems and one of their most played songs before their big hit period began with We're An American Band in the fall of '73. Grand Funk was never very popular with the critics, largely, I think, because their music was fairly simple and they were real crowd-pleasers, and showed no greater ambitions than that. But these qualities made them vastly popular with the general public who gave them six million-selling albums at a time when AM radio wouldn't play their songs. This song would be heard at rock concerts all over, especially the outdoor concerts. If it was a big concert Grand Funk themselves might be playing it as they toured a lot. But many outdoor summer concerts had good regional or local bands and all of them played this song too. It really captures the feeling of a rock concert circa 1970-71."
A3TCDWQXX5EQQV,B000SXMCIW,1,1,5.0,I had no problems with the download. I mainly listen to classic rock and had no problems ever. Thank you very much!

A348GYLVPWT8AK,B000SXKWXY,-1,-1,3.0,Maybe its the reality shows with Bret Micheals but you think that after nearly dying this man would wake up and stay with his family and just plain grow up but the song is okay. I like hearing it every now and again so that was why I downloaded it...but him as a human being...definately not a Bret Micheals fan.

Just the right amount of everything in a tune that is sultry, and  visceral you can see the cold water flat and smell the world outside and in ......the song is short but it reads like a novel and you want to read it again in case you missed the happy ending.  Great stuff."

AEZNE7TR0CHFI,B000SXM3HM,1,1,5.0,There's a reason for Dierks Bentley being on the charts all the time. This song's dynamics are nothing short of sensational. He goes from almost no instrumentation to rockin' the song hard! What's not to like?

A110ZEDSNASVCO,B000SXM5WK,1,1,5.0,"This is a classic, rock n roll tune that is surreal with the idea of Major Tom floating away to die in the void of space all alone. Very sad tune but extremely good all the same. David Bowie is certainly one of the most underrated Musicians out there in music. I'm a HUGE fan of his Diamond Dogs work and this album is another one that is phenomenal."

A28HZPK2ITCGNO,B000SXKWVG,1,1,4.0,Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.
A2TQD6R721TBOJ,B000SXKWVG,1,1,5.0,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."
AS02LU5CR8VJP,B000SXKWVG,1,1,5.0,This is the radio version of this song that I was looking for. This is the version I remember and wanted to buy and that is exactly what I got. I have never had a problem with sound quality when buying from Amazon. I thought the digital remaster had a better sound than the original recording.
A2OZ50YIPNJ831,B000SXKWVG,1,1,5.0,Poison is a great band. Love their music. I would highly recommend checking them out and ordering a download or 2.

AAT1JT5M65VGQ,B000SXHII6,1,1,5.0,Awesome song...
A1WGUNGPYRR4TI,B000QZX5B0,-1,1,5.0,"Ok, people who are dogging the snot out of his album, do you really expect a band NOT to change their style?  If so, go listen to Marduk, Gorgoroth, Immortal, Nevermore or some half-baked crappy bands that bring shame to metal.  Any band that has potential and wants to keep their edge and notoriety needs to experiment.  They did a beautiful job with this album, and I love every song on it.  My favorites are ""Stabbing The Drama"" ""Nerve"" and the bonus track ""Wherever Thorns May Grow.""  I'm not saying that those who challenge them are wrong or stupid, I'm just saying that based on your reviews, you seem to want repetition and monotony.  Sorry, but True listeners don't want that.  You may as well just buy one album and not bother buying others.  This is a must have for all metal and Soilwork fans!!!"
ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B000QZX5B0,1,1,5.0,"i might look at this album differently from most Soilwork listeners. I would say _Stabbing the Drama_ is a big improvement over _Natural Born Chaos_ and _Figure Number Five_, and it's sort of a medium between the two. Just for reference, _A Predator's Portrait_ is one of my all time favorite metal discs, simply perfect. _Steelbath Suicide_ and _Chainheart Machine_ are also fantastic. all three of those are brutal and furious. That said, I even liked FNF for the most part, because of the vocals and catchy songs, but the guitars and drums and METALNESS of it seemed more half-hearted IMO, a downgrade from _Natural Born Chaos_ but that album had its own shortcomings like sounding pretty homogeneous.

_Stabbing the Drama_ has the same catchy aspect as these previous albums (NBC/FNF) but the writing on the whole seems stronger. Heck, this band's songwriting is downright outstanding in my opinion, they write GREAT catchy metal songs, their melodic acumen is outstanding and Speed is an extremely empathetic vocalist. The album shows a tremendous refinement of the band's main direction for the last while, and if you take the last three albums as a class, this is the most well-rounded and best-written accomplishment of those. but here the songs have more variety and better quality from beginning to end (i haven't heard the newest one, _Sworn to a Great Divide_)

I would honestly think of this has heavy pop music, which to me isn't a bad thing although such a description is probably a major turn-off to most people.  like pop music, the main focus is the vocals and the hooks. The general form of structure and arrangement is pretty straightforward, and by now Speed's approach to vocals is pretty predictable. Speed's voice is amazing though, whether the harsh voice or clean voice, and he's gotten much better with each album. That said, the music is much more... i dunno, fleshed out than the last few. Fat, chunky-choppy riffs and absolutely AMAZING drumming (forget Ranta, the new drummer is a fiend, did i mention that?), and very tasteful synths all drive the hooks home with amazing force behind the vocalist in the spotlight. pop music, even really good pop music, doesn't really show this kind of deadly chops.

I'd say if you really _disliked_ everything since APP, STD won't change your mind -- BUT if you liked the general approach of the previous two albums but thought they could be a little better SOMEHOW, then you should pick this up if you haven't because it rules, although i wager the fan likes or would like NBC more than this one. I think this is just as addictive as those, but more well written so it has much better lasting power. i personally have deep regrets about not getting it until very recently."
A1JIW8GOSSGUQR,B000QZX5B0,-1,-1,1.0,"If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums, was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one, and make it work. When I heard the first few works by this band, I had thought they were the most unique band since ""Hypocrisy"". Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own ""Bells and Whistles"" to stand out from the rest. So on to ""Stabbing the Drama"" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of ""Stabbing the Drama"" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic. I also found myself not liking one single track. Not a ONE! Change can be good, but here, change isn't good. Sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone."
ASVNSWIXBV72Q,B000QZX5B0,1,1,4.0,"There has been a lot of competition among metal bands these past few years, and so many of the bands offer nothing at all new to the metal scene. Plus, it doesn't necessarily make it easier if your band is from Sweden, because there are also several Swedish metal bands (i.e. Arch Enemy, Meshuggah, In Flames, etc.)

Before I heard their music, I had Soilwork pegged as just another metalcore band; but then, on an impulse buy, I gave ""Stabbing the Drama"" a listen. And when I did, I was very pleasantly surprised. This C.D. isn't 100% new or innovative, but it's melodic, and that's quite refreshing in this day and age.

The guitars are fiery and crunchy, but the vocals are what make these songs pleasing to the ears. Singer Bjorn Strid doesn't quite have a soulful voice, but it is tuneful and quite impressive. He switches back and forth between angry and aggressive to harmonic and clean. Sometimes, as is the case with tracks five and six, he can sing melodically even when the backing music is heavy.

The title track is a personal favorite because it has rapid stop-start riffs and drumming which is vaguely reminiscent of a jackhammer.
""One With the Flies"" is a punching rhythm with cascading riffs, and a nice, melodic guitar solo.
""Weapon of Vanity"" has scorching, blowtorch riffs, and ""Nerve"" begins with thunderous guitar noise and dreary vocals.
""Stalemate"" has a sprinting rhythm with running riffs and fast, thumping drums.
""Observation Slave"" has a lot of clean singing (some of the vocals sound distant), alongside riffs which are extra crunchy.
""Blind Eye Halo"" features grooving riffs, fast snare drumming, and back-to-back guitar solos.
Finally, ""If Possible,"" has more fast, surging, stop-start, punching riffs, but it ends with some light guitar plucking.

There's one thing that drags this C.D. down, which is that most of the songs follow the same structure: raging vocals in the verses and singing clearly for the chorus. This structure becomes quite repetitive and predictable, but all in all, I'm very glad I decided to give this C.D. a shot, because it is much more than typical metalcore. Soilwork deserve to have much success with it, because ""Stabbing the Drama"" makes the band stand out among other modern metal bands. So, if you've given up on In Flames, and you're not sure which other metal bands to listen to (since there are so many), I definitely recommend you give ""Stabbing the Drama"" a shot."
A3TKL7X26QKKMO,B000QZX5B0,1,1,5.0,"I hear people complaining how bad this album is, that ""Soilwork have turned to crappy nu-metal or they're not melo-death!"" Seriously, if you think THIS album sucks, go buy Metallica's horrible excuse for a new album ""St. Anger"", or that that new album from Limp Bizkit. True ""Stabbing The Drama"" isn't Soilwork's best album, but is sure blows the previous release ""Figure Number Five"" right out of the water, and at least the drummer doesn't sound like he's banging his drum sticks on trash cans, and that guitarists Ola Frenning and Peter Wichers still know how to solo. Now that I got that out of my chest, I will now review the album. 2005's ""Stabbing The Drama"", Soilwork's sixth album is one of the best metal albums I bought this year. Like I said before, this blows FNF out of the water. Even thought the bass and keyboards are somewhat drowned out (due to the bit faulty production), this album still has great vocals from Speed Strid, catchy guitar riffs and some nice solos from Peter Wichers and Ola Frenning, and some very good drumming as well. My favorite songs on here are ""Stabbing The Drama"", ""One With The Flies"" (which is very catchy), ""Weapon Of Vanity"", ""Stalemate"", ""Nerve"", ""Distance"", and ""Blind Eye Halo"" (which is an excellent dose of traditional Soilwork brutality and aggression).

themetalbeast's track ratings:

1. Stabbing The Drama: 5/5

2. One With The Flies: 5/5 (Very catchy, nice solo)

3. Weapon Of Vanity: 5/5

4. The Crestfallen: 4/5

5. Nerve: 5/5

6. Stalemate: 5/5

7. Distance: 5/5

8. Observation Slave: 4/5

9. Fate In Motion: 4/5

10. Blind Eye Halo: 5/5 (Very aggressive song, I love it)

11. If Possible (Bonus Track): 5/5

12. Wherever Thorns May Grow (Bonus Track): 5/5

The Verdict:

Is ""Stabbing The Drama"" a horrible sell-out album, an underrated masterpiece, or just a misunderstood album. Truly a misunderstood, underrated masterpiece, and one of 2005's best. You might be disappointed if you're acustomed to Soilwork's older albums, but if you're a True Soilwork fan, or just have a great taste in music, feel free to purchase this."
A3713PP4MADKED,B000QZX5B0,-1,-1,2.0,"I plan on going to Ozzfest this year, despite the unusually lackluster lineup (I'm really only going to see In Flames, Mastodon, Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Mudvayne, Maiden, and of course Sabbath), so I've been trying to get into more bands that are on this year's tour. I've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork (this was before this particular album's release), and I knew they were (supposedly) melodic death metal, and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I've give them a shot, but I waited for the release of this album, which I had seen advertised, before I actually purchased anything, as I wanted to get this first. That worked with Dark Tranquillity (""Character"" is a jaw-dropping album), but maybe I should've started with an older release with Soilwork.

After all the rave reviews I've seen of their past albums, and simply their label of melodic death, I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album. I really didn't get it. While I'm not saying that Soilwork doesn't have talent, I'm just saying that if they do have it, they're not showing it as much as they should be on this record. The songwriting is bland as can be, like a pop rock record: most, if not all, of the songs are in intro riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus formula (with a few exceptions), and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired, not at all melodic death-like. Well, at this point I realize Soilwork, at least on this record, isn't really a melodic death band anymore. While In Flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago, I still believe that they make great, though less complicated and though-provoking, music, ""Soundtrack to Your Escape"" being one of my favorite albums of 2004. But it just doesn't work with Soilwork. I honestly can't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else. Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice, but it bores me, it just seems too much like something you'd hear on a commercial radio rock album. And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal, but Speed's voice really just doesn't do anything for me. He sings on the majority of the album, but he'll also scream every now and then, but I don't see anything special in that either.

The main problem with this album is it's just too predictable, too dull, too uninspired, too generic, and way too simple. The album has some catchy tracks (the choruses to ""Weapon of Vanity"" and ""Nerve"" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them), they just don't stand out too much. If you're gonna be a metal band, you gotta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you've got, and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with, you've really gotta give it all you got. Maybe I'm just judging too hard, but I've given this album time to see if it grew on me, and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it. But since I've heard so many good things about their past releases, I'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future, because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the `Fest."
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000QZX5B0,-1,1,4.0,"After spending the past few years getting all the nu-metal trash thrown at me, it seems that that fad has finally waned down.  This new ""metal-core"" fad in metal today will most likely suffer the same fate, but for bands like Soilwork, this passing fad may find them mainstream success.  After the disappointing ""Figure Number Five"", Soilwork return with ""Stabbing the Drama"", which is a vast improvement, and while it may not harken back to the ""Natural Born Chaos"" or even ""Steelbath Suicide"" days, this album still manages to be a more than solid headbanger.  The title track features an incredibly catchy chorus, while ""One With the Flies"", ""Stalemate"", and ""If Possible"" are great as well.  However, there are times on ""Stabbing the Drama"" that it sounds too mainstream aimed, especially on ""Distance"".  Despite that, and many of the negative reviews featured here, ""Stabbing the Drama"" is an intelligent metal album, which is something the genre so desperately needs with all the Killswitch Engage's and Atreyu's running around today.  All in all, if you've never heard Soilwork before, check out ""Steelbath Suicide"" or ""Natural Born Chaos"", and then give ""Stabbing the Drama"" a stab."

I really got the wrong version of this song; I would have rather had the original that he sang on a 45.  This isn't it; it is a LIVE version; it's not bad, but see if you can find the original if you know the song well.  If you never heard the original, this version is fine, but for most of us, we can distinguish the slight differences.  My problem was I was not paying close enough attention; you only get 30 seconds to make up your mind, and this version sounded pretty good for the first 30 seconds."

Sia's voice is a bit weak and breathy at times--it bugs me a little--but overall the song is beautifully rendered, with a heartbreaking piano bit and simple yet powerful lyrics.

It was the perfect choice for one of the best TV series endings I have ever seen.  I downloaded the MP3 right after viewing it."

A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000SZDX88,1,1,4.0,"First let it be said that I've made a switch.  Having a limited budget, I have owned an MP3 player for fifteen months now.  One of the drawbacks has been figuring out a way to load my I-Tunes to my favorite personal music device.  With C.D.'s it's a breeze, but what about those times when you don't want to commit to an entire album, but go for the single essentials?  Amazon offers a solution with downloaded music that can be formatted for I-Pods AND MP3 players.

Happily, I've been in pop music bliss as I hear some of my favorite songs come in MP3 player clarity from their downloads.  Enticed by a Metamorpho review, I decided to head down memory lane and pick up a jazzy and formidable piece of rock music.  ""The Wanderer"" gets my vote as the best Dion song, and, as I refuse to contradict the merits of Meta's illuminating review, I can still wait for tomorrow to pick up the other nuggets I've sampled of his on Amazon when I get extra greenbacks.

Not to date myself, but it is quite a blessing to discover the glory of music in different phases:  a clock radio (childhood), a radio tape-recorder (puberty) to stereo and Walkman (college), and now the splendor and clarity of MP3 player resonance and selection.

(For the uninitiated, TAKE NOTE:  Write down the directions as you initiate your downloading capabilities from Amazon.  Download the complimentary starter song they offer (You may say, ""I didn't order that!"" Notice it says ""Free Download"" to start your format.  Then, play the song from its selected option.  (See if your Windows Media Player  plays it and capture it in your library.)  When it does and you've captured it, you're in business. Then, you can download songs off Amazon.  (I would also advise you to listen to the songs before you download them.  Make sure you hear the version of the song you want. [I almost downloaded a new version of The Crystals' ""He's a Rebel,"" a no-no in my book.)

Being somewhere between a newbie and computer whiz kid, I admit it's a little hard to start on Amazon.  (I had to pay twice for Cyndi Lauper's ""All Through the Night"" before I got the hang of it.)  If you write down the directions, it is easy after your first download and capture.  So pay attention and ""Don't do as I do, do as I say!""  Having the will and way, I am happy to take the Amazon MP3 Player plunge.  Give it a try and you will, too."

A26CCP0YRR14AQ,B000SZGWDG,1,1,5.0,"Mel Carter's voice is soft as silk and caressing as warm honey.  Like so many of my other purchases, I added this to my iPod oldies collection that I've been building.

The first time I heard this song I was 16 and in my first ""serious relationship"".

My boyfriend had a '57 Buick convertible and belonged to a car club, complete with a letterman's jacket and combed his hair in the Princeton style.

We'd sit at the park with the top down and listen to the radio, KJR coming out of Seattle.  It was a sweet time with Mel Carter's voice singing the words that made many a young heart soar.

Yet another great song that no baby boomer putting together an oldies collection should be without!"

A15T3Y3BL2AJ9V,B000SZIVVM,1,1,5.0,"I am a US Army veteran having served 8 years in Europe during the Cold War. This song speaks out of my heart. It should serve as a reminder to all of us as to who we are and what we should represent and what we value, such as our freedom which has cost it's price on several occasions throughout our history, starting in 1776.
This is the album version from 1992. It is very good, even though a version released in 1990 has more appeal to some folks. It doesn't really matter that much. Any of Lee's versions of this wonderful song will bring the message across. That is what really matters, I think.
The MP3 sound quality is as good as it can be."

A2CHZNEVN68UM3,B000SZIVVM,1,1,5.0,"I originally heard it because of what happened on 9/11/01.  But since there were some more state and country incidents since 9/11, I believe it's a great song to bring people positively together to help others!!"
AXCSIM0GF4NQ0,B000SZIVVM,1,1,5.0,I am very happy with this purchase and the product. I would even give this to friends and family who were interested in this type of product. .

A2PT5T9P73GXY,B000SZFP52,1,1,5.0,What can I say except it's Billy Idol at his best. The beginning of the song was played & sung exactly as the original song was. Then entered the remix which I found to be very entertaining. I would recommend this remix version.
A36GQV2C4O0DXE,B000SZFP52,1,1,4.0,"Years ago when this was a new song, a friend bought a 12 inch with this mix on it and I always wanted my own copy but couldn't find it. So here it was, right before me, I couldn't resist.  Classic Billy Idol with the great Steve Stevens on blazing guitar."
AGORW2GE15KJ0,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5.0,"This song tells how love can make you crazy. The way one person can make you feel unlike anyone else. I think this song put ""Heart"" on the map!!  The heart of ""Heart"""
AAEHOTZ1GRAUX,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5.0,"Heck!  I'd buy it ten times over just for the guitar intro.  It's a tough call between that intro and the instrumental end of Clapton's Layla as to which one is my favorite.  Either way, good stuff!"
A2GXAKB425AXNX,B000SZXEMI,1,1,4.0,"Not my favorite, but it was decent to listen to and a solid song.  I'll be looking forward to what they produce in the future."
A3JRW716H3AX14,B000SZXEMI,1,1,5.0,"This song starts with drumming with a crisp rim shot punctuating a slowly writhing clavinet melody. This is soon joined by some deep piano chords.
At one minute a wispy female vocal enters. The rim shot carries on throughout the tune with the occasional crackling, vinyl record sound entering from time to time. The rhythms are expertly intertwined to make a haunting and beautiful musical experience. I love this tune and consider it the best of Massive Attack (so far). What you hear on the sample is basically what you will hear on the download with the exception of the vocal. This is also used as the soundtrack for the TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D/dp/B002JVWR7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D</a>."
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000SZXEMI,1,1,5.0,"Like Mazzy Star, Massive Attack is good at coming up with songs which are lengthy, melodic, mesmerizing, and very appropriate for ambient music for your home or for the backgrounds of films and TV.  In this case, this song ended up being played, without vocals, over the opening credits of the hit TV series House, MD.  It is a perfect choice for the dark-toned saga of an addicted doctor in chronic pain.
Nice vocals and a heartbeat effect round out the song."

A13ZE9XWRQPPYC,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5.0,Love the melodic and etherial cast to the music these sisters have. Their voices are sent from heaven. I know they play every now and then. Too bad it couldn't be more now than then though. Love their music.
AX2MZF9A6TP9S,B000SZX8H4,1,1,4.0,"Good words and guitar - done with passion. Some people would give it five stars for sure. I should, but I have reserved that for Alone."
A306GCRD532VOW,B000SZXEMI,1,1,5.0,good
A2CEUUD4H3JV8D,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5.0,"THIS is the track that started it all for me!  The fast classical guitar piece in the beginning caught me by surprise.  Then the BASS and electric guitars, I was gone!  I had forgotten all about what I used to listen to before, and WOW, this was my ""new"" sound.  Heart was my all time favorite band after this!  SO Glad for MP3s.  YES!!!  They still are one of my top five favorite musician groups.  Heart, yeah..."
A2MZLXAK5GMHKS,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5.0,"Damn movie ""Harold & Kumar go to White Castle"".
I had to go buy this song after watching the movie."
A7491L0DLN8SQ,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5.0,Great solid Rock from a great solid Rock band. Nice to have some of their best hits finally. Should have got this years ago. Great vocal melodies and great music.
A2LTPIQG2RWNJW,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5.0,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
A15CORWW2C1YZA,B000SZX8H4,1,1,5.0,What to say? It sounds like I expected. No problems with the download or with the sound quality. Fair enough price.
A3U6W30C8NV11Y,B000SZX270,1,1,5.0,THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.
A1WLFT20EE8X6H,B000SZX270,1,1,5.0,Had been trying to figure out the name of this song for YEARS! finally figured it out somehow and was glad to find it on Amazon.
A1ID55B6ZR5OS9,B000SZX270,1,1,5.0,"I love this song! Love the beat, the horn and the melody. It's like a combination of jazz and pop. I totally recommend this song to anyone with good tast in music."
A3THSGE4JMQRJC,B000SZX270,1,1,5.0,I don't know if you can get a more classic Acid Jazz tune than this. Great mixing of Cataloupe Island with modern beats and rap. The intro taken from a night at birdland is a great touch.
A220EANOQ8R2JU,B000SZX2I4,1,1,4.0,This is one of Lenny Kravitz's best songs. He had a couple of other good songs as well. His voice is good on this song.
A1M3F4G45OXRDI,B000SZX2I4,1,1,5.0,"Sounds just like a digital file of the actual song, which is exactly what it is."
A2H6AST78ZCOIF,B000SZX2I4,1,1,4.0,Adore Lenny Kravitz! Great  song from a great artist.
A35PVJ3I3S0MCD,B000SZX2I4,1,1,5.0,Thankyou! You guys are awesome.

A1KU0TC2J73DMF,B000SZZBBA,1,1,5.0,I love the song.  It is fun and upbeat.  It is great to exercise to and has a good message.
A1OHEAMWM8PKAE,B000SZZBBA,-1,1,5.0,"I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.
See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again. Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours.
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:"
A1B1RE5IQTDPD7,B000SZZBBA,1,1,5.0,I like music and I find certain songs that are inspiring and energizing.  I have picked certain songs from different albums that I use to worship the Lord and uplift me through the day
A1C9N96N2M5D13,B000SZZA70,1,1,5.0,"""Magic Man"" by Heart is a classic rock song that appears to center around woman singing about a man who has left a memorable and/or deep impact on her. I also like how the singer made the tune even more interesting by mentioning the time when her mother was trying to call her home. Nonetheless, ""Magic Man"" by Heart is good for those who like any other songs by Heart and/or classic rock music."
AYOBDN3WZINT6,B000SZZA70,1,1,4.0,I purchased this to add to my IPOD collections so I can listen while napping before a long day at work.
ANTMZ5ZC0TLNZ,B000SZZA70,1,1,5.0,"Heart... Magic Man has a timeless sound and quality. blues like guitar opens on one of their all-time classics. ""Magic Man"" is about a girl who's spellbound with a man of her dreams, to the chagrin of her mother."
A3TY54T5QG26ID,B000SZZA70,1,1,5.0,"Everyone MUST know this song by now! A classic.  I'm a musician and a musician friend and I were going to 7-11 for something and this came on the radio and we said ""Who is that?""  We knew it wasn't Grace Slick.  We just sat mesmerized listening and then the Moog Synthesizer came in and it was WOW.  And all those guitars and guitar licks!  The announcer said it was the Wilson Sisters from Cananda.  My friend comes over a week later with the album:  Heart Dreamboat Annie.  I got my own copy.  It's considered a modern classic.  Every cut is a dandy."
A35A50LZKY0Q3F,B000SZZA70,1,1,5.0,What can I say about this group another great song buy it they have other great songs too
A2YO5MUQL6DXQT,B000SZZA70,1,1,5.0,Great song and extremely popular. Never out of style.

A3A22ATLCNYIY8,B000SZZA70,1,1,5.0,I love this song! The sound is crisp and clear. I can't wait to download more songs from this band!
A2CEUUD4H3JV8D,B000SZZA70,1,1,5.0,"I could see this played out in a music video because of the way it's presented here.  The girl hypnotized by the ""Magic Man's""  charm and personality (among other things), the mother's worry that her daughter will be lost to a stranger, and her pleas to her daughter to come home.  It's up to you to decide whether she returns or not.  I like that.  Rarely do songs involve the listener to actually think about the outcome for themselves."
A330HRJVSMZCCC,B000T00GF0,1,1,5.0,I make CDs of all my favorite songs and listen to them in the car and while I'm cleaning house. This song is one that has been on the CDs for some time now. It has so much meaning and says so much from my heart. I just love it.
A2KQT4D0OZR569,B000T00CKE,1,1,5.0,"I love this song and recently downloaded it from Amazon.com.  I love Joshua Kadison's voice.  It's warm and he conveys emotion well with it.  The lyrics to the song, though, are what makes it a favorite of mine.  They describe a love without being sappy and are realistic enough to make me think of my own relationship with my husband."
A2NRBOWFEO19S8,B000T027SO,1,1,4.0,The sick times we live in have cast a shadow over this tune.  Excellent quality.  Used as part of an audio biography of friend.  Doesn't get better than this.
A27JDEKPZITWW,B000T027SO,1,1,4.0,Second best Don song
A16G8LLLHG0SNI,B000SZZC0U,1,1,5.0,One of my favorites!

A3AX3QJDROE7UI,B000T027SO,-1,1,5.0,A++
A35GEEM9BNEDTD,B000T027SO,1,1,5.0,Beautiful song.
A14Y48GBNSJK1V,B000T027SO,1,1,5.0,Another good song overshadowed by the great American Pie song.  If it was on any other album it would have been a bigger hit.  If your a Don McLean fan you already know how good this song is.... if not take a listen and you'll find out what this download is all about.  Sound quality is good on this song.
A3LX2963LG0YH,B000T027SO,1,-1,3.0,"Good Song, with a strong message about the complex life of VAn Gogh.  This song makes you feel that the writer actually knoew Van Gogh."
A2A9T2X7ZFNN20,B000T027SO,1,1,5.0,Love this classic song.  I can just see Vincent Van Gogh painting that beautiful scene.  Paint your pallet blue and grey...
AWIGS50MFK5RW,B000T027SO,1,1,5.0,Thankful that Amazon makes it easy to find titles from long ago and the prices are so reasonable.  Love this old song.
A1N8KLT7H2BTJ7,B000T027SO,1,1,4.0,"It is as advertised at a reasonable price.  The only drawback to Amazon music is the low bit and sample rates.  I wish they'd offer a high quality mp3 product, even if it's at a higher price."

A15T3Y3BL2AJ9V,B000T006RI,1,1,5.0,"This song, released in fall of 1971, turned out to be an all time classic. Much was written about it, especially about the somewhat mystical lyrics, a lot of which remain unexplained. Don McLean recorded a few other song with deeply philosophical content. I like love it."

A29HJWVO1SAZED,B000T02G8K,1,1,5.0,"Didn't know the Group or Song... When I finally figured it out I downloaded it. Trippy and hypnotic, sexy and lithe track. Very glad that I did."

AAA1AB2WCC8TU,B000T006RI,1,1,5.0,I believe that this song was voted one of the top songs of the last century. Give it a listen sometime and don't try to figure it out. Even Don McLean won't say much about it. But it is brilliant!
A1FJQFAYC17JP6,B000T006RI,1,1,5.0,Wonderful song but sort of melancholy.  Brought back a turbulent time in American History.

A29YXBFTD7QUP3,B000T006RI,-1,1,4.0,Read where one of the purchasers was disappointed because it is the full version not the single version which was cut in half and printed each to side A and B of the 45. It is actually the same song just not cut in half. I recall people who were buying two 45s so they could play the song continuous on their record player. You will enjoy this download!
A7491L0DLN8SQ,B000T006RI,1,1,5.0,From the first time (as a little kid) that I heard this I have loved this song. It is probably The Greatest Rock-n-Roll song of all time. Any one that doesn't like this song is a complete moron. The vocal melodies as well as the music composition are superb. Add the historical references and the Buddy Holly connection and that is as they say - that.
AHF5IBUFBWIYV,B000T006RI,1,1,5.0,This song is the day the music died and Don McLean does a wonderful job and how he describes everything.

A1FMPP00DHO0A3,B000T006RI,-1,1,5.0,"bought as a gift for a friend, never listened to it.  This not my style of music prefer rock and roll"
A342BJ0QSMRKTW,B000T006RI,1,1,5.0,"Who hasn't loved and heard this classic a dozen times or more, and tried to analyze Don McLean's life experiences during his youth.  No one has ever written a better or more recognized ballad of the 60's and 70's than McLean's American Pie.  It should be made into a documentary."
A2WVNK47TV30GT,B000T006RI,1,1,5.0,this a good addition to my kindle collection of music.  i love this cd.  thanks for keeping it available to people like me.
A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B000T006RI,1,1,4.0,"A real classic rock song, American Pie is probably one of the longest songs from its era. Its all lyrics to! When you've memorized this song you can brag about it!"
ATNM9FCY8R05J,B000T006RI,1,1,5.0,"I was busy raising a family of toddlers during the 70's, Didn't have mush time to listen to the radio.

A1BEMCWM1TKEXO,B000T060XW,1,1,5.0,"David Phelps can sing any style, yet this is one of his best!  You will hear a parable in song - worthy of praise and blessing.  I believe I become teary-eyed every time I see or hear this number.  Don't hesitate - own it - you'll love it and GOD bless you."

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000T1A1YU,1,-1,3.0,"The production is a little dated but it brings back a lot of good memories from back in the days. riding around town with my white Miami Vice style jacket in my 1976 Monte Carlo Landau that had a rust hole on on the floor that permitted you to see the road under the car (and everytime ""the Look"" would come on, i'd blast the radio, roll down the windows, and drive real fast~gotta be listenin to a cool song when driving by some choice-lookin girlies-lol). Unfortunately, I was dissappointed when I bought the 'Look Sharp' cassette and the rest of the songs seemed to be just forgetful filler crap. Those were fun times though."

A1LVEPRENTHRSH,B000T1FR8A,1,1,5.0,I heard this song played during a Bruce Hornsby interview on satellite radio while I was doing housework.  I had to stop and listen to every part of this awesome production.  Bonnie Raitt and this song are a perfect match!  I told my friend about it.  She commented that it is an old song. No problem--this heartfelt song is for all times.

I've always liked this song, so why not get it. one tip though you might want to sample the sound quality before you download a song because not all downloads of this song sound alike, in fact some other downloads of this song with the same artist sound less rich in quality, so just try a few versions first to make sure you get a good music file in your cloud player."

A3QS1EPDZTLPWS,B000T1HLCK,1,1,5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous. Though the Kings of Convenience's first album is not ""electronic"" in the strictest sense (or in any sense), there's still no denying the utter beauty of this album. The first track on the album, ""Winning a Battle, Losing the War,"" is my favorite, full of shimmering guitars and pensive lyrics; the track doesn't explodes as much as it blossoms right at the end. ""Singing Softly to Me"" throws in some trumpet to emphasize the call-and-response of the song, while ""I Don't Know What I Can Save You From"" adds a mournful cello towards the end, as if underlining the futility of the situation. The haunting melodies and the powerful lyrics get under your skin and stick in your head. An underlying melancholy lies at the heart of some of the outstanding tracks like ""The Weight of My Words,"" ""Little Kids,"" and the powerful closing tracks, ""The Passenger"" and ""Parallel Lines."" The album titles says it all: QUIET IS THE NEW LOUD."
A3G10NPD661EQD,B000T1HLCK,1,1,4.0,"Though ""Quiet Is The New Loud"" lacks a hit like ""I'd Rather Dance With You"" from their newest album ""Riot On An Empty Street"", every song here is wonderfully mellow and good enough to make it a better album overall (that one had some bad tracks). Erlend Oye was clearly blessed with one of the most soothing voices in the music business. Not only are the vocals great, but the lyrics are also very interesting, even if they lack catchiness. That's not really what this album's about anyway; it's about relaxing. The instrumentation is also pretty simple - it's basically just acoustic guitars and drums, but they're wonderful here - they perfectly encapsulate the mood. ""Failure"" and ""I Don't Know What I Can Save You From"" may be the standout tracks, but, really, they're all wonderful. They may not be breaking any new ground here, but they don't really have to - you're going to love it anyway. Practically any music fan will love this, and for that it definitely earns ""5"" stars. You'll never get tired of listening to this! This is highly recommended!

Highlights include:
the entire album!"
A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B000T1HLCK,-1,-1,3.0,"I first had a chance to listen to Kings' ""Riot on an Empty Street"" and found it to be much more elaborate from a stand point of harmonies, composition and lyrics. Well into ""Quiet is the New Loud"", though it's not a BAD album, it doesn't quite catch you either and it even ends up being a  bit boring at times. I recommend you check out the band's 2004 album instead. Pass on this one."
AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B000T1HLCK,1,-1,3.0,"There is definitely a burgeoning scene coming out of the UK. Artists and bands like Badly Drawn Boy, Coldplay, Turin Brakes, and Travis are embracing folk music and incorporating it with pop and rock. Kings of Convience is the next band to come out with a cd filled with melodic folk/rock. A lot of reviewers has compared this band with the late artist Nick Drake which I can totally hear through out the entire cd.
To be perfectly honest, I really don't know what to make of this album so far. I have only listened to it twice. Compared to Turin Brakes, I much prefer Turin Brakes over Kings of Convience. I found this cd a bit too mellow for my tastes. Even Travis rocks out on a few songs on their latest album. Perhaps I just need to listen to ""Quiet is the New Loud"" a few more times to enjoy it more."

A2R6N8S68XV2T1,B000T1FR4Y,1,1,5.0,I enjoy buying single songs instead of albums. I also enjoy being able to listen to the song first before purchase.
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5.0,"""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" by the Proclaimers is about as high energy as a pop song can be. Positive lyrics, intense beat, great singing and musicianship help keep this song on my running playlist workout after workout.

Scottish identical twins, Charlie and Craig Reid -- these two brothers harmonize and sing off of each other well. Though only a modest hit in America, hitting #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988, it lives on as a stadium anthem in Scotland, and in pubs everywhere.

It is a schmaltzy love song with a catchy refrain. If that's OK with you, give it a listen.

""And when I come home(When I come home), yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you.""

A2D3BBD9EQ7KVR,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5.0,"The best songs were from the 80s and this is no exception. I heard this before the whole How I Met Your Mother hype and it has always been a fun song to jam along to, especially in the car."
A1G7YNZXPBWA4Y,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5.0,I just love this song and it really perks me up when I hear it. And sing along to it. Beautiful song.
A3LYWEVCU0AMRS,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5.0,A fun tune for kids and adults alike. It makes you just want to sing along and tap your feet!
A18KSW9IFU1RDG,B000T1EJ0W,-1,1,5.0,"I heard this song on the BBC TV series, ""The Caf"", which is running on MD PBS.  Couldn't get the tune out of my head."
A123OGWBI8VY0H,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5.0,"One of the best of the 80's.  This is a handy, more portable version of the song.  Beats hauling 8-tracks around."
A39FOO2PPLK50G,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5.0,"I remembered this song when it came out in the 80's, I believe, and I never forgot it! It's different in a good way. I've never heard another song like it. Very unique. My teenage daughter even got excited when she heard it. She said she heard the song once and didn't hear it again until I purchased it and she was so greatful because she really liked it! No regrets with this one!"
A3I8GC0R44ON1L,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5.0,I heard this song years ago when it was played while setting up for meetings. It is such a happy upbeat song. It took me YEARS to find it. When I was searching for some tunes to fill in some missing pieces for a gift for my parents I found this and IMMEDIATELY bought and downloaded it. Haven't heard the rest of the album but this song is a winner. Listen to it if you want a song to make you smile - NOT schmaltzy either.
A3G72G1NWSMS31,B000T1EJ0W,1,1,5.0,"This is probably one of my favorite songs in the whole world.  They were one hit wonders, but they sure got this one right!"

A3VXYYOF5WOTNT,B000T2K374,-1,1,5.0,"I was going thru some terrible times last May. One day while I was driving somewhere, by accident I had my radio station from what I was listening to and it fell on one of the radio channels that play this type of Christian music. I was hooked right there. It's downloaded on the computer at work AND at home. This music soothes my soul every single day and I can't be without it.

There was nothing I didn't like about it AT ALL. I would recommend that pastors, Sunday School teachers and parents make this music a daily diet for their children. Our country is in the fells of bad, scary things ahead."
AYM5IYPZ9P02I,B000T2K374,1,1,5.0,"A dear friend of mine, passed in 2012, after a 1 year battle with ALS, at 48 years young

A1LYI2GAWGU41S,B000T2K374,1,1,5.0,"1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 ""Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you"" This song is a beautiful reminder of this truth. It refreshes Scripture in my mind and reminds me to not only give praise when things are going my way but keeps me out of the ""my will be done"" mindset in times of trouble. Matt Redman has a fantastic voice and the song has a great tone and rhythm. Definitely moves me to my feet and helps me to remember that I can, through Him, take on anything that comes me way because I am His child and have within me the Spirit that cries out ""Abba, Father."" So yes, definitely, I can give five stars and a *huge* Amen to this: ""Blessed be His Name""."

AQ2FC1DLKVD8H,B000T2K374,1,1,5.0,"This is another great praise song by Matt Redmond. He is a gifted musician, and his work never fails to bring Glory to God. I have been very blessed by his music."
A3FSS9D6ROS9K1,B000T2K374,1,1,5.0,Matt Redman puts his heart into the praise music he sings. You can feel the Lord with you through this song.
A3I8GC0R44ON1L,B000T2K374,1,1,5.0,"This song has lots of really neat changes in music tempo. The best thing is the song, the words, the beauty of the singers voice and the message. Matt is singing that when he feels God he blesses His Name and when he doesn't feel Him he will still bless Him. ""You give and take away my heart will choose to say, Blessed be the Name of the Lord"". awesome"

A3RYRAREISDCLY,B000T2LZLW,1,1,5.0,I find it hard to rate some songs in 20 words.  I usually don't buy songs unless I already love them!  This songs makes me want to get down on my knees and worship!  I have woken up in the middle of the night and found myself needing to hear this song and searching for my ipod or tablet.

A3K5MD1NV1T2KI,B000T31G8S,1,1,4.0,"I am a big fan of Nat, so  when Natalie did this remake of his hit song, I wanted it for my collection. The music is sweet and both voices mesh together quite well. A must for any serious collector."
AA5C47ISI0WMH,B000T31G8S,1,1,5.0,"Good memories from Nat King Cole.  Now his daughter,Natalie, sings a duet with him.  Beautiful song, voices unforgettable.

Both were/are singers in their own right. Would recommend to family and friends."

A1MGJX4VSO7WMY,B000T31G8S,1,1,5.0,"I enjoy slow dancing, singing, and sharing this song. Both Nat King Cole and Natalie add class to a masterpiece."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000T31G8S,1,1,5.0,"It is sincerely sad whenever someone young and talented dies before your heart. Natalie Cole knew that dear feeling, not just with the death of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole, but also in herself, with her saddened passing New Year's Eve in 2015. She had showcased a brilliant and beautiful bravado of songs that really have with stood the test of time, on her own and healing through the soul of jazz and R&B soul overall. When I have thought of Natalie Cole, I think of her deepest songs that really showed all sides from pop and R&B like Snowfall In The Sahara, Live For Your Love and the dearest ballad of them all, Unforgettable. The song which Nat King Cole recorded on his own was one thing, but when Natalie did it in 1991, it really became timeless beyond what words could ever expect. It is just one of those duets that really drives you at the heartstrings so deep, you'll forget what cheap music of today really is. This is a must download for any die hard fan of Nat's, Natalie's or for anyone that really never heard of what great songs were like.

Song: A"
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000T31G8S,1,1,5.0,"I am truly devastated to hear the news that the great Natalie Cole passed away at 65 years old. He work as a amazing songstress has been delivered through the heartache, and from the soul of following in the footsteps of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole. I am definitely crushed as a hard core fan of Natalie's. Her voice defiinitely ranged from the sassy in soul and R&B, to the sophisticated Jazz intimacy of her beloved father's legacy. While she had her demons from drug abuse, and the heartbreaks of three failed marriages, what Ms. Cole did for a lifetime, was truly beyond breathtaking at soul. Obviously her biggest hit was really with her beloved father, Unforgettable. The song really showed a beauty and closeness to what Natalie had never experienced with Nat King Coke, and his heartbreaking death. Now with Ms. Cole passing on, the song is so surreal at the soul. I am just shedding tears of sadness for her. Natalie Cole was truly unforgettable.

Natalie Cole  1950-2015

I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.  So if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a CD of your chosing that expresses your love for her.

A3SR2FSNU40ZSD,B000T4EKQW,1,1,5.0,"Declaring the San Francisco Bay Area as a home base, Maze reflected the best of the Bay Area soul sound. A perrennial family picnic pleaser, ""Joy and Pain"" is easily one of their most known smashes. It was not the big chart single from the ""Joy and Pain"" album. That distinction goes to the #9 R&B ""Southern Girl"". In concert, the charts just don't matter to his core audience. ""joy and pain, is like sunshine and rain......""."

I grew up listening to Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, Quarterflash etc. If you've never really listened to the whole song, I know you're probably heard snippets of it before. Worth listening to. I recommend downloading this song, but then again, I've always been a fan of Pat Benatar. (Let's put it this way, every time I play this song, I can't help but do the Love is a Battlefield dance with it.)

A1CTC1Y3HZWJCQ,B000TDD1YU,1,1,5.0,"This song takes me back to a time before I was married and the girl who I thought then was ""The One."" Listening to the song fills me with nostalgia for what might have been, and reminds me of how lucky I am that I waited because I did finally meet ""The One"" and we've been together over 25 years."

A2CEUUD4H3JV8D,B000TDD1YU,1,1,5.0,"The 80's.  You can't close it out without this classic.  Remember Friday Nights from 6pm to 6am (Night Tracks on WTBS I think it was...?) 12 hours of non-stop music videos.  Well, this was one of 'em."
AX2MZF9A6TP9S,B000TDD1YU,1,1,5.0,"Great words and music!  The best song this group ever did. Will make you remember the good times, and somebody you danced with."
A3RM36CXFUCSV1,B000TDD1YU,1,1,5.0,"The Same can be said for this ""Cut of Music"". It's so unbelievable how the author can extract the words from my heart & those feelings that come with it, He or She  must feel Love the way I do, that it's  so Rich & Pure & Deep & Wide, that we're blinded by the light ""Like a Moth to a flame"" it's so Addictive"" that we must have MORE, MORE, MORE to the point that we're BURNED & BLIND & EMPTY. After 6 decades 2 of whch it took me to find someone who wasn't ""Playin' Games"", I had 3 decades of True Love that I lost Heart Disease & Diabetes almost a decade ago. I've lived it, Loved it, & I DON'T WANT ANYMORE. For now, 'til the end, all I want is just the Music."
A2F60KMJ4DGJA1,B000TD76UA,-1,1,5.0,I needed the songs from this album to resurrect a compilation album fro the 80's.. called rock 80. An album put out by K-Tel records.

A268P9HZD272Q7,B000TDDFUK,1,1,5.0,"I like Robbie Williams for his smooth vocals. On the this song I enjoy the smooth vocals and also the strings on this song. The strings on this particular cut remind me of a song originally from the 60's that also showcased strings that were similar to the strings in this song. I love the unique combination of Robbie Williams smooth vocals along with infusion of the strings on this song.
I was glad that Amazon offered this as a mp3 for purchase."
A2LTPIQG2RWNJW,B000TDDAJQ,1,1,5.0,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?

A1534MBU6VJXYN,B000TDF7VA,1,1,5.0,"With its shimmering production, crystal clear harmonies and in your face classic riff, ""Go All the Way"" is maybe the definitive power pop single, and a deserved classic."
A1AOQA6MY9FMB9,B000TDF7VA,1,1,5.0,"The Raspberries song ""Go All The Way"". A great song and underrated rocker. Eric Carmen on vocals (I think). I don't know why this song doesn't get any airplay on Classic Rock radio."

A344BMJP6A5KL1,B000TDFHM4,1,-1,3.0,"I previously heard this song on a ride video someone posted on YouTube of Universal Studios Florida's 'Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit' roller coaster earlier this year.  It's a good song if you like techno-style music.  I will have to listen to it more often to really appreciate it and maybe then, this rating will be higher.  If you are a Daft Punk fan and haven't listened to this song yet, you may like to sample then buy it."

It is always awesome to knock boots with this song going in the room.  Its so sexually charged, it drives my girlfriend crazy!  For this reason and this reason alone you should have this song amongst your bangin' tunes."

A200D8BOPMR35S,B000TDG0T8,1,1,4.0,This is a Great pop song. It has an interesting Reggae feel. The production quality is very good. And Boy George is at the peak of his song styling and songwriting here.

ALIBRR4PLLLX2,B000TDCZ0G,1,1,5.0,"This was the first Enigma Song I heard.

It's a wonderful blend of Tribal and New Age Music.  The Tribal lyrics speak to the soul.  The English Lyrics speak to the heart and the mind.

This is useful to anyone depressed or in pain. It revitalizes and awakens the mind and spirit.  It's inspiring and soothing."
A2Y2CLBUBP0QNE,B000TDCZ0G,1,-1,3.0,yep !
A1CHLJQMZN8LHG,B000TDCZ0G,1,-1,1.0,"There is Native American chanting present in this piece.  The instrumentals give it a bombastic aura while listening to this track.  I always thought the title of it important because the narrator repeats ""Your return to innocence."""
AVM748ITITQJ3,B000TDCZ0G,1,1,4.0,"Like the sound of this group Enigma.  Relaxing, New Age music. Very relaxing, and a nice change of pace from other music."
A2ZGI9E6771F6I,B000TDCZ0G,1,1,5.0,Heard this at a horse show and fell in love with the imagery that it invoked in me.  Sometimes words aren't the important part of a song
AMFC45VYVLWLH,B000TDF4U4,-1,1,5.0,"This is a beautiful song, done with style and class. He does not sound the same any more, so stick with the oldies. I bought the ""Jay Black"" version first, and was so disappointed! This is singing as it should be."
A23YF0A8PNFYIU,B000TDF4U4,1,1,5.0,"I hadn't heard this song in quite a while, but it's actually better than I remember it. I had never heard it in stereo before, and it is superb. Jay Black's voice is even more powerful than I recall it was, and it has seldom, if ever, been used as well as it has on this song. It cost me 99 cents, and it was a bargain at twice the price. Glad I bought it."
A35XG6755DWOJV,B000TDG3B8,1,1,5.0,I honestly can't recall any song by the Stray cats except this one. Stray cat strut is a well crafted song with a wryly amusing lyric and a lovely blues feel. So you won't run a mile an hour faster while listening to this song but you might have a slightly more swinging day.
A255DFIUTVMC60,B000TDG3B8,1,1,5.0,This song is cute and sassy. I can imagine choreography to this song. It's perfect for strutting around the house to.
ACKDSX71VI5HY,B000TDG3B8,1,1,5.0,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""Stray Cat Strut"" was released in the early 1980's by a group called The Stray Cats, a trio that featured musician Brian Setzer.  At the time, I thought it was a silly, absurd yet enjoyable tune.  Roughly twenty-eight years later, it's still fairly humorous but also I hear nuances and jazz influences and terminology that enriches the song to the status of a minor classic."
A220EANOQ8R2JU,B000TDI8V6,1,1,4.0,This is a great song. He really sounds like Jimi Hendrix on this song. One of the best songs of the nineteen nineties.
A5UTBXSLXQLQ6,B000TDI8V6,1,1,5.0,I love this song! This is going on my heavy metal / hard rock play list on my mp3 player. A must have! His star rose and fell so fast. I was hoping for more from him!
A1M3F4G45OXRDI,B000TDI8V6,1,1,5.0,"Sounds like an MP3 digital file. Hopefully, someone will teach Lenny Kravitz how to button a shirt before he becomes a senior citizen."
A3DG78OW36FASC,B000TDI8V6,-1,1,4.0,It's Lenny
A3FRR7PAGN546J,B000TDI8V6,1,1,5.0,I like this song and I play it on my I-touch. Would recommend
A2HHA4PJGSRANX,B000TDI8V6,1,1,5.0,Really love this song! Definitely worth the purchase!
A35XG6755DWOJV,B000TDI8V6,1,1,4.0,"This is a classic song from Lenny Kravitz. I suspect many, many, many men know it only as one of the best songs from Gran Turismo 3. That's where I heard it and it brings back such happy memories of the last good Gran Turismo game. That aside this is a fast, guitar and drum heavy song with a cracking music video to go with it and one of the cooles tdrummers ever. Definitely a song to keep. So, why the four stars? Well the version I downloaded from AMazon was so quiet it could barely be heard played over my computer speakers and when played on my X7/Sennheiser portable music set up I thought I'd missed it. This is really poor audio quality. There are ways around this if you're creative so whilst I like the song the download is terrible. Avoid."
A1QHNY0AOGAWHA,B000TDI8V6,1,1,5.0,"Few tunes are this exciting, creative and daring.  Amazing musicianship.  Especially that killer drumline."
AGTZ8AJQVA0SI,B000TDSQGI,1,1,5.0,OK
A29HJWVO1SAZED,B000TDSQ5O,1,1,5.0,"Yet another dancy track with a wicked rock beat, a classic Billy growl lying on top of a shredding guitar."
A2GXAKB425AXNX,B000TDSQ5O,1,1,5.0,"Just the perfect summer song, good-times song, all the time.  Any time you're in a bad mood, just pop this song on and you'll feel perked up - and probably be accused of dancing with yourself! :-)"
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TDSQ9A,1,1,5.0,"""Rebel Yell"" is a very enjoyable and daring passionate lust song. As per the songfacts website, ""Rebel Yell"" is basically about a one night stand that is very pleasurable that the lover ends up expressing that they want more. This is also made clear with the following lyrics:
In the midnight hour she cried- ""more, more, more""
With a rebel yell she cried- ""more, more, more""
In the midniight hour babe- ""more, more, more""
With a rebel yell- ""more, more, more""
More, more, more.

 Obviously, there is more to this gem of a song. Billy Idol really puts alot of his spirit into the song in such an excellent fashion that it is almost like he is telling a very entertaining story that he is simultaneously singing. I admit that I first heard this song when I was a teenager, and I currently still love listening to this song. The guitar riffs and his fantastic singing blend well together with this song to make it a musical track that is fun to listen to multiple times in a row. ""Rebel Yell"" is also another song to put in a love/lust playlist and/or 80's classic song playlist"

A29HJWVO1SAZED,B000TDSQ9A,1,1,5.0,"In the days when MTV actually played videos, if you can believe that... And we listened on audiotapes and vinyl. Classic frenetic dancy track with Billy's growl."
A1LUGVFDKPE7N7,B000TDSQ9A,1,1,5.0,"Billy Idol had a really great band. He is very charismatic and delivers a strong vocal line with an unusual voice. His guitar player is priceless. If you ever get a chance to see any of his concert videos,try and watch.
Rebel Yell makes for super driving in the car music,it will get you all pumped up for sure.
I recommend it entirely."

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000TDSPN2,1,1,5.0,"The Verve has one of their best hits, A Bitter Sweet Symphony. This song ROX from the get go, the rhythm, background vocals, and lyrics are amazing. This is another 90's something hit, after this song came out I don't know what happened to the group? They truly had something special going on when they conceived this little gem. So when someone mentions The Verve this song is the first thing that comes to mind. If you like any type of music you should like this song. This song has all samples of music rolled into it, so you should like it?
THX,

A17ZGZHO81XVC2,B000TDSPJG,1,1,5.0,"When I pick a single it's because it stands out as one that should be kept for far longer then the radio will be playing them, this is one of those. It has the praise value and tempo required to keep me playing it over and again. Time after time I hear Christian artists trying to do something with a tune which simply does not work right and sounds just plain old off, this is one of those you Keep!  IT has what is required to make itself and keep a spot as a great tune.  Newboys has done a superior job with this one."
A2I2IVPGTOT3AE,B000TDSPJG,1,1,5.0,Love the Newsboys.  Great song.  Great band.  We sang this at VBS last year and my little one remembered the motions.  He loves playing it on the kindle.

A14V9AX2JYR3ZR,B000TDSPJG,1,1,5.0,this is a classic uplifting song of praise by the newsboys.  it gives a real sense of a faith that unifies people over time and distance and beyond.
AYMHDYEA0N2CD,B000TDSPJG,1,1,5.0,"This speaks the truth, Newsboys are still great even withour Peter. I love this song even though it is an older song it is worth listening to again and again"

A2E0RW04ZJVR0A,B000TDUV0C,1,1,5.0,"The Beach Boys had their finger on the pulse of a generation.  Just prior to the darker overtones that took over in rock and roll, and just a fun fun time."
A2W98USCNTESCL,B000TDUV0C,1,1,5.0,In my younger teen years I thought these guys were the worlds best. This song locked it in.  Sounds great.
A16P4I5IWMMLUE,B000TDUV0C,1,1,5.0,"I love the voices. I saw them in Baltimore some 20 years ago at a ball game, just wonderful they could really sing. I saw them perform on HSN some months ago, not so good. I purchased this song so I could hear the True sound of the Beach Boys which used to be mesmerizing. This is one of my favorite songs, so melodic and beautiful!"

A395EZDV1PR0TT,B000TDUUZS,1,1,5.0,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC SONGS EVER WRITTEN BY THIS AMAZING GROUP; ""THE DIVINYLS"". THIS SONG CAN NEVER BE RESONG BY ANY OTHER GROUP, AND MAKE IT SOUND THE WAY THESE TWO ARTISTS MADE THIS SONG SOUND, AND CUM TO LIFE IN THERE CHEMISTRY.

A1VOSVK55YQMYD,B000TDUUZS,1,1,5.0,This song is great sounds a lot better on an ipod than any car I owned back when released. They don't make music like this anymore.
A29YXBFTD7QUP3,B000TDUUZS,1,1,4.0,"What is there to say, either you love this guys music or you don't, if you are looking at it then it's obviouse you already enjoy this music and, this is a good one to have."
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000TDUUZS,1,1,5.0,here's another great song that didn't get the air play from DJs that it deserved.  I'm sorry we didn't hear more from Divinyls.
A89ZZKNDFQH23,B000TDUUZS,1,1,4.0,"I was told recently to learn this tune for a cover band show, its always requested when they have a chick singer.  SO I knew the song but downloaded it do a brush up, it's right on the border of being crude, but stays just on the edge passing sexy off easily.  It is a good song, it's clever and well done."
A165P3MOJV3OVZ,B000TDSTK6,1,1,5.0,Enjoyed it
A3C1L3IUFBEYBP,B000TDSTK6,1,1,5.0,Great for my luau party!
AOSMJHTFNUXRB,B000TDSTK6,-1,-1,1.0,How can I review this when it didn't download? I was told to call here and there-now THAT'S too much trouble. I have learned to NEVER download a single song for my MP3 player again from Amazon or iTunes.
AD3VJNKDVFDYG,B000TDSTK6,1,1,5.0,You'll find no surprises here: this is one of the most popular Beach Boys songs and a fun summer song.
A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000TDSTK6,1,1,5.0,"I just like the harmonies of the group.  The words are empty, mostly filler, but the song flows  well."
A1BPOYZDY1KYQA,B000TDUOCC,1,1,5.0,"My wife wanted this in her iPod and on a cd for her car.  Good music, the right price and just a straight download."

AOR7VND4GXUJ9,B000TDUOCC,1,1,5.0,This is a very feel good song. I used to love to dance to it. I remember I was real thin then. What happened!
APVQY5E1BUEKA,B000TDUOCC,1,1,5.0,Very favorite Natalie tune. This is her best style and her own - she's not bad in R&B though .

A3837D2JE16VV4,B000TDUOCC,1,1,5.0,"The power of this song is in the arrangement. Spirited bass line, with a rousing gospel piano, supporting the most exuberant song about love every written. Natalie's most fun hit."
A2BKQRXWCKY7OG,B000TDUOCC,-1,1,5.0,I'm not quite sure what I am supposed to say. I downloaded the song and it is what it is.
A1NQMFCC5FJCPX,B000TDUP8K,1,1,5.0,"In my opinion, both interpretations of the classic song are essential to any collection. UB40's take on ""The Way You Do the Things You Do"" combines electronic synths and bright horns that counter the subdued vocal harmonies. A reggae/pop classic."
AGHWHC4XOQUMM,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5.0,"I ordered this version of the song Barbara Ann by the Beach Boys because it does not include all the extra ""sound effects"" that are in the original version. This version sounds cleaner to me, with the vocals more pronounced. I like it!"
A2E0RW04ZJVR0A,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5.0,One of the most recognizable songs that dominated the airwaves in the late 60's.  Played in millions of homes over the years.

AARNOU1XYBFXT,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5.0,"It's one of the lost love songs, slow dancing, stuff that made being in love what it was and was meant to be. --- It wasn't the ""tennis shoes in the dryer"" music that is the base of most of the music now. --- It's a phrase I made up to describe the current music to my children.....""thump thump ---- thump thump...."""
A3C1L3IUFBEYBP,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5.0,Great for my luau party!

A1RWK72VF89I3R,B000TDUV6G,1,1,5.0,"This is a terrific song to remind you of back in the early 1960's when they had so many hit songs. It's a great song song to dance to, and listening to it, it sounds like they are having a wonderful fun time time singing it."
A2AOYPE2OK5TJH,B000TDURA6,1,1,5.0,You can only love him once you hear his voice.  He has a great voice and great love for the Lord.
A1W4JJPULTADRA,B000TDURA6,1,1,5.0,In this day and time I think we Christians are weak in our faith. We need to listen to more songs like this to help us stay strong!

A1LEYLI0BCE0YR,B000TDWS8A,1,1,5.0,This song is an anthem of the 60's. It has been covered by a number of groups but none come across like the Beach Boys because they lived the song. You gotta like it no matter how old you are.
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000TDUVKM,1,1,5.0,"I double dog DARE you!
The wonderful Gorillaz has produced a listenable, singable, danceable single with this song, which has a very catchy beat.  It doesn't matter if you can't make out all the lyrics; you will still enjoy it.  Nicely crafted by the oddball band put together by people from various other bands."
A3L0YM35AU0X7R,B000TDURL0,1,1,5.0,"Billy Idol was one of the artists that defined 80's rock. In the decade that spawned MTV, Idol created an image much like David Bowie, that took advantage of the dance club scene that began using big screens showing DJ rock videos to the dance crowds. With a hypnotic dance beat and great lyrics this song and Rebel Yell define Billy Idol."

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000TDWOAM,-1,-1,1.0,"Never cared so much for the original, but, Billy Idol's late eighties remake is about as pleasant as smelling a wet fart. How did this song become so popular?? hmm...Leave it to these robotic, zombie like, program directors/puppets working for the large radio- owning conglomerates. anyway, enough of my ranting, this song is horrible and has dated horribly."
A2F3CWVP7PZ4SH,B000TDWOAM,1,1,5.0,"I did not realize that this was the originally recorded by Billy Idol! I really like this version over the version by the Bee Gees! This is one of the songs I downloaded from Amazon and play in my car. Thanks Amazon for introducing me to new ""old"" music. This is why I shop Amazon!"
A2F3CWVP7PZ4SH,B000TDWOAM,1,1,5.0,"I did not know that Billy Idol made the first recording of this tune. I had only heard the version done by The Bee Gees. Wow, I believe this version is much better! If not for Amazon's great selection I would have never heard the original. Thanks Amazon. Not only do I now buy all my music, but Amazon has expanded my knowledge of music."

A3CMBEN7YJ7JKQ,B000TDWOAM,1,1,5.0,"This is one of my favorite songs, thanks to my daughter, who was a teenager in the 1980's, who introduced me to Billy Idol's music. Another one of my daughter's, who I think was about ten-years old at the time, also liked the song ""Mony Mony,"" by Billy Idol."

Heard this and it brought my chin up just enough to crawl out of the pit.  My favorite line?  ""When Life turns its back on you, just hang in and do that sweet thing you do... Roll with it, Baby...!""

Thanks, Stevie!"

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TDYITM,1,1,5.0,Roll With It by Steve Winwood is an upbeat song that to me symbolizes making the best of life regardless of how things turn out.  This Roll With It by Steve Winwood ties with Eye of The Tiger by Survivor in helping to remind me to stay resilient and self-confident about making the best out of my life whenever I hear the song.  Roll With It is a great song for those who like classic 80s songs that are emotional boosting/motivational type songs.
A1M5UZBCC91V7U,B000TDYITM,1,1,5.0,I don't know who wrote the word's to this song but..it is my absolute favorite as it is life as it is on the planet for sure!  And I like Steve Winwood also..amii

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000TDUXNM,1,1,5.0,"I remember when Gangsta Rap came out. I am not really a fan of it, most I can't stand; but this song is so cool. Boyz-In The-Hood was so popular everyone regardless of your music preference loved it. A song that talks about the tough side of life, if you want to heard the Mp3 sample you will not be disappointed."
AAI72UP8V9PD3,B000TDYITM,1,1,5.0,how can you sit down and listen to this song without moving !!  glad to find it and have it.

AYVS2J8LM4DYH,B000TDYITM,1,1,5.0,LOVED THE 80'S MUSIC AND HE IS ONE THAT NEVER GETS OLD TO LISTEN TOO.  WISHED HE WOULD PUT OUT AN ALBUM NOW.
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000TDYITM,1,1,5.0,Steve Winwood's voice has been rocking since the days he was with the Spencer Davis group.  This was one of the best songs to come out of the 80s with a nice mix of 80s pop with some soul mixed in.
A7USDU17NQCG5,B000TDYITM,1,1,5.0,You'll want to purchase this...one of his original songs from back in the day...  Take a short trip back to the good ol' days.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it!

A1Q5BEVD3IF62H,B000TDWO5C,1,1,5.0,"We, worshippers, care, are generous in giving, joyful in our God. We also like hearing the reasoning behind the music. The reason for this song, made me want it. Jeremy Camp, the writer, had just became a widower, his wife a victim of cancer. This is his outcry of pain. Real pain creates dramatic dependence on this God who cares more than any other. Now people understand. When trauma strikes- we still believe!"
A1FMPP00DHO0A3,B000TDWO5C,-1,1,4.0,"I do not listen to this music a buy these as gifts for friends, never listen to the music I buy"

A356X26TH0GS9X,B000TDYOZ0,1,1,5.0,"A hypnotic string melody.  I thought I'd burn out on the repetition, but even after these many years I still haven't.  The Verve definitely did deserve more credit than they received for this song."
A2SUH08PALZPZU,B000TDYOZ0,-1,1,4.0,"I just like the tune and always have. Twelve more words.  Word word I I I I I I I I.  I do not like the demand of a certain number of owrds being required to rate what I buy! this is why I do not rate on Amazon as much as other sites.  I have arthritis, and it is a pain to be required to do this!"
A30UAA4DRGLBA7,B000TDYOZ0,1,1,5.0,"Very basic, very simple song, but it flows right and the powerful chords give you energy to keep on truckin'."
A2SSNJ4I77NNGI,B000TDYOZ0,1,1,5.0,Bittersweet symphony.... excellent bit of music.. melodic.. welcome to the bitter.. and the sweet... somewhat like a U2 track...but with way more symphony tracking...
A22UEGDX65VTZZ,B000TDYOZ0,1,1,5.0,I really liked this song and had to add it to my collection after hearing it at a friends house.
A3URRZ02P8KLWM,B000TDYPBS,1,1,5.0,"This music was before most all the music I came to enjoy,but the king of this era very much made some wonderful songs. I can understand why many became huge fans.""Witchcraft"" is one of my all time favorites from Frank Sinatra."
A2HOBWOY53SO5P,B000TDYPBS,1,1,5.0,I bought this song as it is a part of the Cristian Grey books.  It makes the reading that much better to relate the songs that they are talking about in the book.
A39FOO2PPLK50G,B000TDYRQQ,1,1,5.0,I would recommend this to everyone. It is an easy listening love song. It could also be played at a wedding if so desired.

A2LITQGCLXMZ7L,B000TDYRQQ,1,1,5.0,love the beach boys.
A2CVWH39T8CTSV,B000TDYRQQ,1,1,5.0,No angle could ever sing more beautifully than Carl Wilson and nobody could ever compose a better song than Brian Wilson.  This is simply the most beautiful thing ever recorded!
AHB899WWYV0RK,B000TDYRQQ,1,1,5.0,"As I get older, pieces of favorite music from my past become new and greater from a few moments in the movies. This song was beautifully used in the final credits of ""Love Actually"" as photos taken in the reception area of Heathrow airport are shown, ordinary people greeting loved ones and long lost friends. As we watch these interactions, The Beach Boys sing, ""God only knows what I'd be without you . . .""  These people's happiness and tears, I think, become ours as we watch and remember."
A2QLPXZ9CNMMVQ,B000TDWRHM,1,1,5.0,By far a classic.
A23L9JDJ0IUL4G,B000TDWRHM,1,1,5.0,"I had been looking for this song for some time now. Now, that I have finally find it; I can't stop listening to it. Bring back the later 90s, early 2000s."

A2KQT4D0OZR569,B000TDYSOC,1,1,5.0,I have identified with this song ever since it came out.  It's a feel-good song for me cause I'm definitely square and enjoy feeling hip and trendy while listening to it.
A1F9MULI7NCZYQ,B000TDYSOC,1,1,5.0,Reminds me of the fun times my wife and I had when newly married. Hard to believe so much time has gone by.

AYMHDYEA0N2CD,B000TDWQEQ,1,1,5.0,"What can you say, it is a wonderful song.  Keith Urban plays the guitar at the end of this song for about 3 min and it is very entertaining.  One of the best out there."
AR65NXO4GIA9H,B000TDWQEQ,1,1,5.0,This is probably my favorite song Keith Urban has ever done. It's one of his slower songs but it really suits the lyrics and meaning. The song itself is gorgeous but sad and you can really hear the emotion coming through. I highly recommend this song if you like any of Keith Urban's other songs because it's well worth the price.
A1X9TGR96Z1I7F,B000TDYS9C,1,1,5.0,"The Gorillaz is one of the strangest bands I have ever heard.  Somehow, though, they managed to make this awesome song."

A1RGJA7LQ3B5H7,B000TDYS9C,1,1,5.0,Another great song from the Gorillaz and definitely worth a listen.
ATULSPPAU8X15,B000TDYRCK,1,1,5.0,I purchased for nostalgic reasons & have listened to several times since. A classic folsky 60's hit. Can't go wrong with the Amazon DRM free downloads. Great price and great flexibility. I love it!
A3CMIEYL0TJLC2,B000TDYS9C,1,1,5.0,Feel Good Inc is one of my favorite songs. My sis got me into listening to them when 8 was in high school.  She was right this song is hella good

A3R5OE1RE8ZLAN,B000TDWOI4,1,1,5.0,"I love the harmony in this song and I love the message. I sound like a broken record (see other reviews), but these girls simply know how to deliver a song. I love it."

A1CTC1Y3HZWJCQ,B000TDYRCK,1,1,5.0,"As with many classics, I just had to buy The Weight by The Band after hearing it in a movie. There is something timeless about this song and I feel transported to a simpler age whenever I listen to it."
AFJZ0YVB4XMCE,B000TDYRCK,1,1,5.0,"Great tune in the 70s, making a comeback as a TV advertisement. People may think it is called ""Nazereth."" First line is ""I pulled into Nazereth, was feeling about half past dead."" Listen to a sample and you'll recognize it."
A2S8LZSFR0SB88,B000TDYRCK,1,1,5.0,"Here's my boilerplate positive review for an MP3 download: No problems, just what I was expecting. The ease of ordering MP3s from Amazon will keep me coming back. The cloud player and automatic download are great."
A5UTBXSLXQLQ6,B000TDUTOK,1,1,5.0,I love this song! This is going on my heavy metal / hard rock play list on my mp3 player. A must have! His star rose and fell so fast. I was hoping for more from him!
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000TDUTOK,1,1,4.0,"I call him Mr. Singles because a few of his albums that I have are mainly good for that: the singles.

Fly Away is a good example off of the album, ""5"".

It has Lenny longing to ""fly away"" and ""get away"" from this world, off to see something different like the ""milky way"".

I appreciate Lenny mainly because of the singles that are released, being more catchy, radio-friendly type tunes and because he writes his own lyrics a lot (all?) of the time.

Fly Away is a fun experience which will send you high with the simple, yet rockin' guitar and the production. The lyrics aren't too bad either.

4.25 stars.

end note: This track came out in '98 originally but is featured on this greatest hits album produced in '00."

A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000TDZ666,1,1,5.0,"Like I said in another analysis of a song, if you can listen to this song without moving, you are either dead, in a coma, deaf, or on drugs (I added  an extra item).  It's short, intense, and catchy."

AXLKY5DO95QYG,B000TE0O7G,1,1,5.0,"Classic out of the box, Lenny.  Top of the line!  He takes a one-in-a-million song and renews it with passion."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000TE0O7G,1,1,4.0,"Honestly, it has been a very long while since Lenny Kravitz came out with a really good song. The 90's showed he had a really good tune with knowing how to craft good songs like Fly Away and Thinking Of You for his mother Roxie whom died of cancer in 1995. But he also showed that he was able to do well with cover songs as well. That was the case with his cover of The Guess Who's American Woman, which was featured on a expanded version of his 5 album. The song feels just as driven today as when Lenny recorded it over a decade ago. While he hasn't reclaimed his 90's glory, Lenny still is making music out there. Hopefully, when his next work comes out, he can do another cover song like this one.

Song: B"

A3B9DHWCMYQFD,B000TE0O7G,1,1,5.0,"...I will probably get negged right out of the top two thousand for admitting this...But...I like Kravitz's version of the song,  American woman, better than the older version. NOW HOLD ON BEFORE YOU OLDER FOLKS NEGG ME OUT! I loved the original. I always cranked it up when it came on the radio. I loved it! But BEFORE you judge me, find a good stereo...plug in this version of American Woman by Kravitz's and CRANK IT UP....Go on. I'll wait....Okay? Are ya done? Well!? Heh!!? The song was killer! Am I right!? Kravitz's slowed the tempo a bit. He played guitar with flawless, bone crushing chords with awesome force. And the dude can sing! The whole remake by Lenny Kravitz is superior in every way (except maybe the old solo...it was really cool and Kenny didn't quite get that ""whine"" out of his axe, but hey, this song is a great song for my ever EXPANDING digital library. Lenny, you the man!"

This is another example of why ""country"" music is so horrible today.  It is no longer ""country"" music, it is just pop with slide guitars.

Johny Cash is rolling over in his grave, Willie Nelson is smoking more and more to drown out this junk, and Hank Williams is yodeling louder and louder to not have to hear this."

A17UXXQRJUD0I4,B000TE1BE6,1,1,5.0,"I was troubled by the subtle or overt sexual theme music my school age grandchildren listen to which is performed by today's Pop, Hip-Hop, Rock, and R&B artists blasted on their parents favorite car radio stations.  Therefore, I decided to compile a CD to introduce my school age grandchildren to a variety of wholesome music from various genres.  This classic song is performed by Bobby McFerrin, and  is a 'must have' to include on a playlist which is suitable for older school-age children.  The message is timeless, and best of all, this is a fun song, which is  family friendly, and a  favorite which I'm sure my grandchildren will enjoy.

A2ANEHT4K0IR2A,B000TE1FA6,1,1,5.0,"LOVE this song, especially this version with Gwyneth Paltrow. I would definitely buy it again.  One of my favorites.  If you like Huey Lewis, you will LOVE this one.  It is definitely worth the price."
A3DPPZCPCLWWQH,B000TE1FA6,1,1,5.0,"Just a great bluesy song. Only Huey could bust it out with his pipes.  This is the one with Gwyneth Paltrow, she does a very good job also."
A9CDS78S3J71G,B000TE1EVQ,1,1,5.0,"As I wrote before, the oldie version of this song just sounds better.  But you can sample the music at amazon's market and make up your own mind.  Sometimes a newly remastered version is better and sometimes it isn't."
A1GLYYFZG2W6P7,B000TE1EVQ,1,1,5.0,The Beach Boys are famous for fun summer time tunes and cruisin' in your Chevy....but this one I put on when I'm packing to visit the islands!
A9CDS78S3J71G,B000TE1EVQ,1,1,4.0,I bought the remastered version of the song and frankly did not like it.  I wanted to hear the song as I heard it for the first time.  Now some might say there is no difference but I surely detect some differences and this older version sounds to me much better.  But as I advise those interested to take advantage of the song snippets you can get on Amazon and make up your own mind.
A27FP0S5QH7GNE,B000TE1EVQ,1,1,5.0,I have always enjoyed this song and had the original on cassette tape.  Wanted it on CD and voila downloaded it quickly with no problems from Amazon.
A3D5XPK9QN1XG3,B000TE1FA6,1,1,5.0,"It's cheesy, but I like it."
A1I3A6BSTH96ST,B000TE1FA6,-1,-1,1.0,"The last 1:20 of the song is cut off. This is one of my favorite songs from 2001 and I cannot get a clean copy of it from my favorite resource. This is terrible shame, I should have known something was wrong when I couldn't find the Duets soundtrack."
A25QOJSQ3LEJ6I,B000TE1FA6,1,1,5.0,"have to listen to this song.....huey lewis and gwyneth paltrow make the best combonation as a duet.......love this version, it is great."
A3BIMAUO4JKCRJ,B000TE1FA6,1,-1,3.0,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
A2MXASFSJXHA43,B000TE2NSY,1,1,5.0,"I love music, downloads great, nice song and have a lot of  other songs by this artist, am a music lover."
A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000TE2NSY,1,1,5.0,"""You're No Good"" is a classic rock song with a good clear female voice that is somewhat repetitive but quite catchy in the song.  She earnestly, with feeling, belts out this song likes she means it.  I've probably heard it a couple hundred times in the last twenty years, and I never tire of it."
A1S8QS7GUNIZ7W,B000TE1JN4,1,1,5.0,I absolutely love this song! Who wouldn't/couldn't? Every time I find myself feeling down I listen to this song and instantly I my spirit is lifted upon high. I AM FREE!
A14T4AL9QQCAJE,B000TE1JN4,1,1,5.0,"This song, ""I Am Free"" is very catchy & uplifting.
You can't go wrong with upbeat songs by The Newsboys.

Great mix of vocals and instrumentals."
A2WHKSL7KVSZZN,B000TE1JN4,1,1,5.0,"The Newsboys ROCK and this song will definitely lift your spirits and brighten up your day!  Glad to be able to purchase just this song and not the whole album, too - makes my favorite music affordable!"
A10RGW04GM7E7T,B000TE1C4A,-1,-1,2.0,"Was looking for the version from Belly soundtrack...not it, but my mom likes it."
A2GEURP6P1FIHR,B000TE1C4A,1,1,5.0,Good song
A2N2XVMC29HJED,B000TE37QG,-1,1,5.0,k
ARMT7L6NYJ0XR,B000TE37QG,1,-1,3.0,It's a good CD
A42DFGDTY4DBB,B000TE10G0,1,1,4.0,"love this silly song, or is it silly?"
A3MPAF8QJ3ZLB,B000TE10G0,1,1,5.0,"Always been a favorite from ""Life of Brian""."
A32JDWEPA9XTOC,B000TE10G0,1,1,5.0,How can anyone NOT like Monty Python?
A38S8B85C5WGAY,B000TE10G0,1,1,5.0,"Always loved this song, when I hear it I always picture all those people being crucified and singing and doing chorus line kicks.  Its my ringtone and my daughter carries it around in her mp3."
A3PZDCOCZ8P3C3,B000TE10G0,-1,-1,1.0,not the version I thought it was I can understand all the lyrics in this version but way to slow
AKUMRHVDLD47I,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,"Originally written for and released by Elvis Presley this is a great remake of the song. According to Wikipedia over 60 versions of the song have been recorded by different artists. This is probably the most successful.

With a different enough beat and production from the original to be a stand alone hit. Very distinctive sound of the band including Ali Campbell (I think) vocals and the simplified but sophisticated horn backed Reggae sound that UB40 specialized in makes this a classic.

If you don't have it download now. 3 quality minutes for $0.99 what a deal."
A26L99MGEV891D,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,"The reason this song deserves 5 stars? Sinple one of the few songs of the era to still sounds so fresh to hear. It also succeeds on covering many genres In the one song yet never aspired to be anything other than a cover song. People that don't really know Elvis music might even say It's their favorite. So the song Itself Is also why It gets 5 stars.
Should remain a radio staple for years on oldies stations."
AR7QOCLIRJ9X0,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,Great album I would highly recommend it.
A2H1Y7ZBZ5T5RK,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,"Luv it,  sexy and mellow...."
A28FR8TX6DFJQ3,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,Great song from a great group
A1KX30LMWH6QX5,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,ok
A218A7MPSZDNCY,B000TE3P72,-1,1,5.0,Forgotten band
AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,"This is another great hit from UB40, there other being Red, Red, Wine. If you like reggae this song is definitely for you, if you like pop this should catch your ears. The reason why I like this song is because I liked Red, Red, Wine. This is has a familiar ring to it, I am not into reggae that much but I do like those two songs from UB40; and Wild World from Maxi Priest. So if you know any of those song you should like this one, for those new to UB40 check out the MP3 sample. I grew up on 70's, 80's, New Wave, but I like Ub40, you might too.
THX,
Kris L. CocKayne"
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,I cant help falling in love with you by ub40 touches on a man coming to terms with the strong emotions that he has for someone else. The song makes it clear that he is unable to stop the amorous feelings and is maybe thinking that he was meant to feel that emotion as part of spiritual kismet a.k.a destiny with the lyrics somethings are meant to be.
A3C1L3IUFBEYBP,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,Great for my luau party!
A2BYLLOQVUJCSS,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,Love them.
A2E3XC22VZJ517,B000TE3P72,1,1,5.0,This is a song I find myself singing over and over again. I love the video and watch it several times in a row. The horns in the band really set the song's mood.
A1U14MNTD5VRUX,B000TE4TYA,1,1,4.0,I like it.

A2W4L40QJVO3QE,B000TE4TYA,1,1,5.0,Reminds me of growing up with my grandma when I used to listen to singers that actually knew how to sing.  Good times.
A3N5752095L7GD,B000TE4TYA,1,1,5.0,"One of my mom's old favorites. She adored Crystal Gayle.  Thus, I get nostalgic every time I hear this song."

ALKBO0791XOU9,B000TE0TVC,1,1,5.0,I heard this on the Cadillac commercial and found out what the song was since I thought it was so catchy.  I knew I had heard it years ago but had no idea what it was.  I still like it and have loaded it on my mp3 player.
A2EQZRRQYD5IAP,B000TE3GDK,1,1,5.0,I don't know anyone who does not jam to this song. Awesome.
A2Z7LPEYZHQ68O,B000TE3GDK,1,1,5.0,"George Clinton and his team (Funkadelics, Parliaments, The Brides of Funkenstien) ALWAYS deliver the funk that's need in your life! This is what was once called a Disco version; very long so you could just keep dancin'. I admit at 61 I am still a ""funk junkie""!"
A225D4O3MFF3II,B000TE3GDK,1,1,5.0,"This Is An Original Old School Song From Back In The Day, A Must Have For Anyone Who Is Making A Collection Of The Old School Dance Music."

Grew up listening to this song and it remains a classic to this day. Ms. Carnes has a somewhat husky voice which is rich and sound beautifully."
A1296VZUHO5Z7C,B000TE3HFC,1,1,5.0,This remix is an awesome dance song and pays tribute to Selena at the same time. We lost her too early. The beat is amazing. People will have a great time dancing with this song.
A3GP6K6OLMVJ6V,B000TE38VA,1,1,5.0,"One of Kenny Roger's best.  A snappy tune that tells a tale worthy of either a gambler or life itself.  I guarantee your feet will keep pace and singer or not, you'll sing along."
A7W24PTC0W7QC,B000TE38VA,1,1,4.0,"One of Kenny's fine old songs...  I used to listen a number of his songs years ago, and recently began to listen again.  I did not listen this particular song often preciously, but found it pretty good this time."

A1B5L9AG1GB2MT,B000TE38VA,-1,1,5.0,"This song was written by a West Virginian.  If you grew up here or spent any time here you can really understant the timelessness of The Gamblers advice.  May you, too, break even."
A19WIPESS552TG,B000TE3752,1,1,5.0,Classic. Don't leave home without it.

A1XRXJJIHHI04J,B000TE37X4,1,1,5.0,"God bless the disc jockey who played this song on the radio one time. It was the only time I heard the full worded version of the song, and all it took was once for me to fall in love with it. This MP3 is the real McCoy, sung by Andy Griffith himself. I finally added it to my iPod last week where I shuffle a variety of songs from the last 80 or 90 years. When The Fishin' Hole song played, I smiled the whole way through. Not only is the song a snappy, upbeat song in its own right, listening to it will fill you with all the happy memories of Andy's life in Mayberry."

close to $100 worth of music never received!!"
AU9TV06LZ8T0U,B000TE3FBS,1,1,5.0,"I am not sure why Amazon insists that I review every purchase, but I do love this song. We play it at church and on The Joy FM, our local Christian radio station all the time."

A2F60KMJ4DGJA1,B000TE71FE,-1,1,5.0,I needed the songs from this album to resurrect a compilation album fro the 80's.. called rock 80. An album put out by K-Tel records.
A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000TE71FE,-1,1,5.0,"The guitar work makes this song; it's the kind of song you want to jump up and dance to, but if you hear it too many times, it loses its appeal (so play it sparingly is my philosophy).  One of the things that makes this song really great is the use of brief interludes of no song (the beat?).  Anyway, this is one song that if I play it too much, I lose interest in it (kind of like a strong spice, a little goes a long way)."
A11LWLNC0HRJ1E,B000TE71FE,1,1,5.0,All around great song.

A1N96MRPYMGBIV,B000TE6ZSI,1,1,5.0,Frankie Beverly and Maze will always be one of my favorite groups. They have a timeless sound that will never grow old.
AD98NPLBDRXWN,B000TE6ZSI,1,1,5.0,"""Before I let Go"" was one of many hits that Maze ft Frankie Beverly put out. I saw them live in New Orleans and they turned the place out. I love the silky sound of Frankie Beverly and the solid sound Maze brings this harmony together seemlessly. True R&B fan can't have a collection with Maze somewhere in it. Can't go wrong with this one."

A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B000TE54Q2,1,1,5.0,"I sang this to audition for a part in Mayflower Community Theater's production of The Music Man a few years after the release of No Rain. Shannon Hoon, the singer of Blind Melon, died of a drug overdose after I had given up drama as a crazy activity that made me more hyper than anything on stage when characters were running around in madcap disorder. This song was what Bob McNamara lacked as Secretary of Defense when draftees were being sent to Vietnam and the courts thought we had political powers to control what the powers that be do instead of courts and a Constitution. Hey, Bob, would you listen to this?"
A3H5VVDA5XCGRF,B000TE54Q2,1,1,5.0,"I know that Blind Melon had some big personal issues and this song is ""famous"" but it is one of my favorites"

A3SR2FSNU40ZSD,B000TE3FCC,1,1,4.0,"With a groove that is at once laid back and then flows rhythmically well, ""Before I Let Go"", is Frankie Beverly and the guys doing what they do best.

Though Beverly was born in Philadelphia, the band became transplanted San Francisco Bay Area residents and adopted that area's sounds of raw soul, elegant soul and message supplanted soul. Marvin Gaye also helped define their ""What's Going On"" to  ""I Want You"" soul which would also give them a Motown 70s pedigree, when the label successfully graduated from the #1 singles label, from an indie no less, to a great album label."
AMAC2XRPTF2HW,B000TE3FCC,1,1,5.0,Great album

A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,B000TE7LUY,1,1,5.0,"Richard Marx is one of my favorite singer/songwriters ever. In an era where most things felt over-produced, dramatic, or downright cheesy, the music of Richard Marx felt like a breath of fresh air. One of his most famous songs is a post relationship classic ""Should've Known Better."" Richard Marx voice allows the listener to believe that he has truly expierianced the heartbreak of which he sings. Something that is def. lacking in today's mostly soulless popular music scene. There's something universal in the loss of love that Richard Marx manages to capture though without delivering a four minute funeral procession in the process."

Till this day I still bump this and other Soul2Soul joints in my ride, in the house, on my iPod or MP3 player.  It really takes me back."

A179EHWXB6NSIQ,B000TE9IR8,1,1,5.0,"In my opinion, this is Bing Crosby's best Christmas Classic: ""Do You Hear What I Hear?""  It has survived the test of time, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its release this year.  It is also one of a dozen of Bing's first STEREO Christmas songs, and it sounds great.  I enjoy Bing's version of this song better than any other artist, and this song even more than his signature song, ""White Christmas"".  Bing was one of the first two artists to present this song to the public, and he left a great lasting impression of ""Do You Hear What I Hear"".  A couple of other not as popular Bing Crosby Christmas songs to look-up are: ""I Sing Noel"", ""The Littlest Angel"", ""And the Bells Rang"", ""Round and Round the Christmas Tree"" and a duet with Frank Sinatra called ""We Wish You the Merriest"". Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.  May this season bring us peace, goodness, light and life."

AMG98U278WPGH,B000TEB3VC,1,1,5.0,"Whats to say? It's a great song. It's a song that has a ""nostalgic"". The vocal melody melody tends to haunt the mind. Slower tempo with a rock solid acoustic guitar backing and heartfelt lead guitar lines played at the right times. Some might consider this piece to be lyrically.....sparse, vague, ambiguous? But to me the overall relaxing vibe, the sum of all the individual parts make the whole thing worth the listen."

A309IF65QXZU3O,B000TEAYVW,1,1,5.0,"I don't know if Lionel Richie counted on this song spanning the ages and becoming a classic love song that would be played at weddings and dedications when it was written and performed with Diana Ross for the original movie Endless Love, but that's where this song has landed and helped him to branch out from The Commodores into his successful solo career."
A2SGIASZCASS6B,B000TEAYVW,1,1,5.0,"Sounds good, I like to listen to it sometimes when I'm falling asleep at night. I like to listen to walking in the park sometimes too."
AD609PVD2C7UQ,B000TEC91A,1,1,5.0,Sounds like the original version.  I just love the song.
A18PHRALHBLMF4,B000TEC91A,1,1,5.0,since buying cds are out of style and iTunes is always expensive I prefer to use amazon for music song is great and the preview is long enough for you to get an idea of the song

AEF42RE14M3CD,B000TEAYVW,1,1,5.0,Gosh this song was always one of my all time favorites. I'm so happy to have found it. It's perfect copy too.
AVP1NL6GYMVR,B000TEAYVW,1,1,4.0,This is a classic love song that hasn't become old over time.  Diana Ross is one of the best female vocalists ever (in my humble opinion) and could make singing the dictionary sound good.
A1A7XZ82HWIPT4,B000TEAYVW,1,1,5.0,I Love Lionel Riche Music and enjoy being able to  get the music without buying the Dvds. Thankyou so much Amazon!
A1NADGMAR6GQW1,B000TEAYVW,1,1,5.0,At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.  So if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a CD of your chosing that expresses your love for her.
A3BTXEZVYYEEKJ,B000TEBJZC,1,1,5.0,It sounds nice. I like the rhyme and lyric. For the money it sells it's a perfect piece of music.

He took a mega hit and turned it into another megahit you just can't beat.  Sounds as fresh today as it did 20 years ago.  The video is still on point, too.  Hammer was right:  you CAN""T touch this!"
A3NCZFGM3NBDM0,B000TECDFM,1,1,5.0,"I got this fly tune for my son's birthday party soundtrack. Always nice to listen and dance to. Wanted to let everyone know ""You can't touch this"". My son is ass that and more. YEP!"

A1ZNUOJK5V0N8V,B000TECDFM,-1,-1,1.0,Bad download!!!
A4L1CPRG8CC03,B000TECDFM,1,1,5.0,"As a kid in the 90's this was one of the few jams that got everyone moving. Even now I play it with my kids and they just hop up and dance with me. I recommend this to anyone just looking for a silly song to dance with your family and lose some calories in the process, ( your going to sweat, believe me)."
A17Z9QGYK16B0I,B000TECDFM,1,1,5.0,"I was looking for this track long time ago and wasn't available. I found it under my preferences and really like it so I bought it. Great quality and the delivery speed was amazing. Is a great track of the 90's, this is the famous Hammer's album."
A2MJTPNO8HIOUF,B000TECDFM,1,1,5.0,i was a young adult when this song first came out i luved it then and still do its a must have for any collection
A1MHVREPQ5CQJS,B000TECDFM,1,1,5.0,"This song reminds me of the time I took, a then, little brother of 12 to see an MC Hammer concert. I love little things that remind me of good times.  Its a great catchy song with a great memory attached to it."

A9P4Q7KX35RS2,B000TECDFM,1,-1,3.0,"Bought this for a friend when he wanted to have this for his MP3 player. He like this song, but it's ok to me. Has good sound quality."
AAEA4STR27PN2,B000TECDFM,-1,1,5.0,This is one of my all-time favorite songs! This was when rap/hip-hop was fun! There was gangsta rap for those who liked it and the pop side. These days I may like the beat of a rap & hate the lyrics! Seems like the one's who make the most money these days are profane and disrespectful to women and others! I wish music relied more on creativity instead of mediocrity!
A1QD4R1C4MV3JS,B000TECGLS,1,1,5.0,Love Leon Russell!

A1SDM1LYAW856V,B000TEBI8A,1,1,5.0,"Just the song I wanted!  It was my first ever download and I was surprised at how easy it was.  It took a few minutes, then I located the file in my  Windows Media player and copied it to my MP3 player with easy.  Time to dance!"

A1KC6PZI4TGZ9W,B000TEBI8A,1,1,5.0,"I love this song.  In 1991 when I bought the cassette I used to get dressed up and walk around playing it on my Sony Walkman, It was cool. Brings back good memories."

A1QJSM2A4LZGXL,B000TEBI8A,-1,-1,2.0,Vanilla Ice came to the forefront of rap with a great song. Too bad he didn't stay there with later offerings not up to par with this.
A1QW7EP30UAWKF,B000TEBI8A,1,1,5.0,"this is a great song. For some reason the song won't upload to my iPod but I think its a technical issue on my end, not on the download's end."

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000TEC7BW,1,1,4.0,"I came across some lyrics about a month ago and wondered where have I heard this song before. I forgot all about it, but I will never forget the music video with Erik Estrada. The reason why I like this song is because of the great beat. It's not like a lot of the 90's music with the screaming, shouting and just poor music. This song has definitely got it in all the right places :).

-Kris L. CocKayne-"
AXPAIEE0732A9,B000TEC7BW,1,1,4.0,"Here is the thing.  I love the sounds at the beginning of the song and the instruments and all that, I don't love the lyrics that much.  The lyrics are catchy but kind of juvenile, makes me feel dumb when I listen to it.  Whatever, its a groovy song, you have probably heard it, and its worth buying.  I bought it after hearing it in the Chasing Mavericks movie that recently came out, I was like oh yeah and bought it."

A1R9ZJDZKIUQQ,B000TEC7BW,1,1,5.0,"I feel like it's pretty silly to write a review on music since it's completely subjective.  Either you like it or you don't.  I like this song.  It is good.  Wapner is on in 5 minutes.  Duh.  If you buy a song, wouldn't that say you like it?  At least $1.29 worth of like?  Maybe a review that it's a fake song or something.  Like I got this song and it wasn't the original artist or something.  You know?"

A3QW2FEVNWI9VS,B000TEEJM2,1,1,5.0,"Even though this song is quite the classic, I downloaded it after hearing it on the NBC series Chuck (Season 3 - Chuck vs. the Other Guy).  Now it's in my regular rotation... a great song!"
A2BIFGERNRDLBB,B000TEEJM2,1,-1,3.0,"Very good version of this song.  Plays out very similar to the radio version with a little live flavor thrown in.  If you love this style of music, this is for you."
A2X2J1FS9JD5IE,B000TEEJM2,1,1,5.0,"I fell in love with this song the first time I saw Pretty in Pink....and I've seen it many more times since.  What do I like about this song?  Pretty much everything.  The melody is stirring, rising to a crescendo (thank goodness for spell check!) at the end, the lyrics are beautifully heartbreaking, and most anyone over 14 can relate to, and you can dance to it to boot.  Check, check and check."

A2BH945DHGH5J7,B000TEEJM2,1,1,5.0,"O.M.D. was one of those bands who put an unusual almost psychadelic spin on the music of the 1980s.
I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for Classic Music from the 1980s!!!."
A1CHLJQMZN8LHG,B000TEEJM2,-1,-1,1.0,"I bought this track because every minute I'd hear it in the 80's.  There's that ever present whimsical sound, I don't know what instrument produces that particular sound.  This tune commands finding out the name of the group, OMD!"
A1H0HI1DFYEUMW,B000TEB42A,1,1,5.0,Such an amazing song! I love her voice and how the acoustic guitar compliments it. So glad to have found this song through Amazon. Com!
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000TEB42A,1,1,5.0,"This one has soundtrack written all over it and was indeed used on an episode of House on FOX.  But it's great listening any time, anywhere.  Mazzy Star is two people:  a female singer with a haunting voice and a musician who matches her talent equally.  Give it a listen and then track down more of their songs."
A3QW2FEVNWI9VS,B000TED2CK,1,1,5.0,"Even though this is a bit of a recent classic, I downloaded it after hearing it on the show Chuck (NBC).  Now it's one of my favorites!  Great song :)"

A2YTX0ILS4UTY0,B000TED2CK,1,1,5.0,"I remember this song from when I was young but was reminded of it from watching Bridesmaids, love this song!"
A2TBEUZBSUZQKT,B000TED2CK,-1,1,5.0,It seems sort of silly to write a review about a song you bought. I should think most people buy a song because they like it. This gets it off my review list anyway.
A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000TED2CK,-1,-1,2.0,"Yeah, daddy's girls could sing but the late eighties/early nineties sterile overproduction mars the track significantly. Although they had a hit with it, it hasn't aged well, like a lot of the music from that era (you know the era, back when people walked around looking like arsenio hall or will smith in the fresh prince) They migth've really produced a timeless track if Brian Wilson had produced. Never got the lyrics for the song either. Something about a change and breakin free from the change."
A3HSWCMRM8JI5U,B000TED2CK,1,1,4.0,Great song and quality. One of the classics and hard to find. Have had no issues playing this or moving it into Itunes.
AXPAIEE0732A9,B000TEGI8K,1,1,4.0,"This is a good track from my teen years.  It always makes me happy when I rediscover a song from my childhood.

I have not heard any of their other music, but this is a good track to get ;)"
A1LUGVFDKPE7N7,B000TEGI8K,1,1,5.0,"I heard this song the other day on xm radio while driving. I was able to see the artists/band name on the radio display and knew I wanted to buy this song quick as possible. It is a great driving song,and just cool overall."
A3ARWXNPHVQP1B,B000TEGI8K,1,1,5.0,The radio stopped playing it and years later it was forgotten. Then I started to listen to Pandora and this song played often. I remembered it and remembered that I love it so I bought it. It really is a lost hit of the 90's.
A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B000TEGI8K,1,1,4.0,"The opening riff from that toy trumpet is unmistakable, an instant hook, unique to this song--smart production--its tone and timbre highly reminiscent of the traditional death march, even ovoking a little bit of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-James-Infirmary/dp/B00009KO4D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. James Infirmary</a>.  It harkens well back to the 1932 original from which this tune is built.

Then that chugging, mid-pace beat comes in, with a subtly clubby keyboard riff, and it's somewhere highly accessible between the Cure and hip hop. And then you get that thin, old-timey vocal pushed througha Victrola speaker, faux mono, and I'm hearing echoes of Murray Head's ""One Night in Bangkok,"" even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aqualung-s/dp/B00000GAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aqualung's</a>&nbsp;title track.

Ah, but to my listening the words are deeper than this AM pop veneer would lead you to believe.  Pay attention and it's not just boy v. girl, failed relationships, doubt and inadequacy, but the very nature of gender identification, gender roles, and the interplay between government and the governed.

Or, you could just dance to it."
A1RRWUZFNC09WY,B000TEGI8K,1,-1,3.0,ok
A2HZGMFXIEYF12,B000TEGI8K,1,1,5.0,Great song!
A3JCL23H9L9EP7,B000TEGV64,1,1,5.0,This is a great cd if you love the oldies - all the songs are favorites. Thanks for the music.
A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000TEGV64,-1,1,5.0,"This song was probably written by a writer who had just recovered  from a broken relationship only to see his ex again.  Others have written about it as well but not as poignantly as he (in my opinion).  Although sad, the song is pleasant to listen to."
AP0NLKGV34CEL,B000TEJ1SO,1,1,5.0,Awesome
A12JRNM9BI1P5I,B000TEJ1SO,1,1,5.0,Who doesn't remember Delta Dawn and that young girl who sang it like a woman. Great song.

A4VXT3AU0026V,B000TEGI5S,1,1,5.0,Another hit from the 80's that is a must have for remembering those high school dances.  Nothing wrong with getting a digital download of those classics from the 80's.
ASP8ZHQ41Y33P,B000TEGI5S,1,1,5.0,"This is a fun and jumpy song that's aged well! Amazon requires a least 20 characters for this and I really don't have anything else to say about it. Buy it, if you like it."
A3LG4DFM8VJ3QS,B000TEF07U,1,1,5.0,Shirley Bassey's growling and resonant voice punctuated with the soaring Bond style brass makes this the best ever Bond theme by far.
AZ4FKZXXNULDR,B000TEF07U,1,1,5.0,"I don't believe that there was a song ever made, or a singer ever born, that makes me feel the way that I do when I hear SHIRLEY BASSEY sing GOLDFINGER.
I JUST LOVE IT."

A2CEUUD4H3JV8D,B000TEF07U,1,1,5.0,"This is the Standard in which ALL other 007 title tracks have to measure up to.  This track grabs you from the first notes of the trumpets, the cascading of the strings, and finally on to that captivating voice of Ms. Shirley Bassey.  It will leave you spellbound.  That's what this track does to me.  AWESOME..."
A211HBLYBE92BI,B000TEF07U,1,1,5.0,"Wow, the golden voice of Shirley Bassey - she makes this song thrill and excite. I can listen to it over and over again."

AOKIM55CWOUAY,B000TEL0BK,1,1,5.0,This music and the lyrics really are enough to encourage you along the way.  But the vocal are simply amazing and makes it seem so easy.  Not everyone can do this.

AZMS2N8DUWWAR,B000TEL0BK,1,1,5.0,Beautiful song.  We should all encourage ourselves and pray for ourselves.  Not wait on somebody else to pray for us.  It is song with great conviction.  I play it over and over.
A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,B000TEKRPK,1,1,5.0,"The Spice Girls ""Wannabe"" holds a special place in the hearts of those who grew up in the 1990's. While some people dismiss it as light and pithy pop that appeals to the teenaged crowd, there can be an alternative meaning attached because so many girls have viewed it as something of a girl power/independence anthem because it stood out as something different in a rough sea of boy band pop that perhaps treats girls as though girls are puppy dogs looking to be lead into one night stands or something."
AUMUG4SR9DEF,B000TEKRPK,1,-1,3.0,"I always liked this song when I was little. Then, when I bought this, I realized what ""zigga-zig-ah"" means, which was somewhat shocking to me. It's still great for dancing though,"

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000TEMF7S,1,1,5.0,"Let's admit it, sometimes it's not the high school cheerleader, nor the hot movie actress, nor the girl in Playboy, nope, sometimes you have a crush on the mom. As wrong as that may sound, some moms are just hot, like it or not. You might even dream about having that mom, to show her off to your buddies. But this song is about that feeling. And kudos to FoW for having the balls to write a song like this, put it out on the radio, and making the music video the way that they did.

This is an underrated rock classic, and certainly a classic song for the 2000's. You've never heard one like this before."

When the Beatles formed, John Lennon disliked the song and Paul gave it to Peter who recorded it with his friend Gordon Waller.  The song went straight to number one and became a part of the British Invasion, launching the career of Peter & Gordon.

The duo would go on to fame with several more McCartney-penned songs, some of which he gave the duo under a pen name just to see if the songs were good or people were buying just because of the McCartney name.

What he sings always seems to have a ""meaning"" which is special in an of it's self.  If his name is on it, it's special .  He brings back so many memories in people's life. HE is a classic!!"
A2RDN20FKZZVLT,B000TEPHD2,1,1,5.0,He sang with some great ladies of country music. his songs are beautiful. I fully recommend this album.

A28FNKCGFS03VL,B000TETN96,1,1,4.0,"A young soul crooner influenced by some of the old-school masters, Javier's 2003 self-titled debut is a pleasing if not earth-shattering album that nods more to the likes of Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway than to many of the minimally talented competitors that Javier was up against at the time. Not to call him a male version of Jill Scott or anything like that; there are plenty of albums that sound like this, but Javier's pleasing charm, romantic sentiment, and minimal attempts to be hip-hoppish certainly make him and this album worth checking out."
A17814AD8EWTN4,B000TETN96,-1,-1,3.0,"See i will never deny Javier of his talent. But i will deny him on this album because he really does not show it to the best of his abilitys on this album. He has a great voice, and he has a nag for writing really good songs. Not to mention he can play the guitar really well, which is very rare amongest most R&B singers these days. But even despite all of his positives this album lands right on the mediocre line. Its not a bad album, but he could have done alot better. The problem i had with this album is that it all sounds the same. I mean there are a few big shining spots like the single ""Crazy"" and the mid tempo track ""Biggest Mistake"" which tell the tale of how Javier lost his woman. But other than those two standout spots and a few select other tracks this album is boring. He stuck with the accoustic guitar to much on this album. All the songs sound like they were made by low end producers and none of the songs really have a groove to them. He is lacking that song that makes you wanna get up and dance. There is none of that here. Its all that neo soul accoustic guitar type of music, which by the way i love, but not when it all sounds the same. To sum it up real short, Javier has the potential to make phenominal music, he could be amongest the Ushers and R. Kellys with a little help and ALOT more promotion. This album debuted at number 86 on the top 200 albums. Thats horrible for a R&B artist on a big name recorod label (Capitol Records). Overall its an ok debut, but i hope the next one is better.

Grade:
C"
AAEA4STR27PN2,B000TETN96,1,1,5.0,Javier has a lush voice.  It is what's missing in today's r&b!  Too many people rely on the studio and not talent.  Not only does Javier have a great voice but he also plays the guitar.  Buy yourself a treat!  Get this cd today!!
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000TETN96,1,1,5.0,"I've had this CD for about 4 years now and I must say that I wasn't thoroughly impressed until today (May 18, 2011). A bunch of the songs did stand out as good or great, but not everyone impressed me like they now do. I had a review up here previously that was pretty harsh on the songs that didn't tickle my fancy upon repeated listening. However, my whole outlook on this CD has changed and the only throwaway thing about this disc isn't even really a track (see interlude #1)!

Anyway, my favorite songs in order are BIGGEST MISTAKE, OCTOBER SKY, SHE'LL NEVER KNOW, CAN'T HAVE MY HEART and IN YOUR HANDS. The other tracks are just fine but they don't score between a 4.5 and a 5.

Excellent debut by a perfectly gifted singer-songwriter. There is enough depth and umph here to satisfy the average R&B enthusiast.

4.5 stars (or a 9/10).

RECOMMENDED:
""Biggest Mistake""
""October Sky""
""She'll Never Know""
""Can't Have My Heart"" &
""In Your Hands"""
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B000TETN96,1,1,4.0,"Javier - Javier (Capitol, 2003)
When Javier first released ""Crazy"" last year, I wasn't too, uh, crazy about it because lyrically, he wasn't saying anything new. If you're looking for more original songwriting on this album, you won't find it but you will find some wonderfully sung tracks like ""Song for Your Tears"" and ""Hey Little Sister"". Javier also does a good rendition of the jazz standard, ""October Sky"". Vocally, he is a cross between Eric Benet and Slim from 112. He has a good chance of staying long in the business if he is promoted right. Actually, this album came out last August, I only saw one video from him (""Crazy""), and I'm sure this album isn't platinum yet, so the future doesn't look too good. Pick this album up to support Javier, and for more underrated artists on Capitol Records, also get the new Van Hunt. -EJR"
A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B000TETN96,1,1,4.0,"Javier's self-titled debut CD is a smoothly executed and immaculately produced old-school R&B gem that is obviously influenced by Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway with a little Brian McKnight thrown in. Although I really love this release and it has received very positive reviews here, I am writing mine to further support Javier as I just read a couple reviews from well known reviewers that not only slammed Javier for sounding like Brian McKnight lite, but also took the opportunity to slam Brian McKnight. Cheap shot on both counts.
In my opinion, this is one of 2003s very best releases from a confident new talent who is following his muse and not jumping on the much too crowded neo-soul bandwagon or relying on hip-hop and collaborations with rappers to sell CDs. Keep in mind that I have no issue with any of the aforementioned genres, but cant a young black man be allowed (and even commended) for sticking to his guns as he is the real thing not the creation of some producer. Some critics may not know that Javier not only did his time in a jam R & B band, is also a multi-instrument virtuoso, and served as co-writer on all the songs on his album, a rarity in the world of contemporary R&B.
What about the record you ask? Some of you may have heard the first single title Crazy, which in my mind is also one of 2003s best. Its got a Stevie Wonder vibe, a chorus from heaven, and some hooks that make it. ""Song For Your Tears"" is one of my favorites combining wah-wah guitars and classical piano with Philly soul orchestration and some Stevie Ray Vaughn blues to produce a lush masterpiece. Here Javier sounds like a seasoned pro.  Hey Little Sister has a contagious Roots-crafter percussion which makes the song move and seasons Javiers infectious Falsetto and song runs. Although Biggest Mistake has a boy-band ballad feel to it, its still a great song that makes it an instant classic.
Authentic Latin flourish spices tracks like ""Can't Have My Heart"" and ""She Spoke To Me,"" are peppered with Latin influences, which is not surprising as Javier's father owned a Spanish-language radio station  and Latin music was a constant presence in Javier's family household growing up. The former sounds a little too much like Brian McKnights Back At One, but its still great. The latter is pure Javier which to me sounds a little like a contemporary Stevie. Not a parody or an imitation, just the voice and song selection is definitively more Stevie than Nas or 50 Cent. I love the guitar work and the sexy images that the song evokes. Think of a midnight dance under a full moon in a tropical island and youll get an idea of how great She Spoke To Me is and why its another of my favorites. In Your Hands showcases Javiers voice and songwriting strength. Shell Never Know also hits the spot with his pleading beat and sense of romantic loss.
The most magical song on the CD is saved for last. October Sky takes an entirely new direction with a jazzy late night feel that  has Javier sounding like a troubadour from the 1930s (with a detour at Stevie Wonders house) who somehow wound up in a modern day bar. I hope that this song is a window of things to come. Dont turn off your CD after the song ends as it picks up again in an organic feel that could also be the basis for what lies ahead for Javier.

All in all this is an outstanding debut that is solidly based on old school R&B, but spiced by jazz, rock, funk, and Latin grooves. There are only a couple of songs (Beautiful U R, Slow Motion) that are not as strong as the rest and sound a little too much like other crooners who specialize in mid-tempo songs. Even those songs are head and shoulders above the rest of what passes for R & B these days. While at first listen I can see why some may see Javiers debut as a poor mans Brian McKight, if you really listen to the music, there is no doubt that Javier is his own man and easily earns the 4 stars that I am giving it. It would have been 5 stars if the aforementioned mid tempo songs had been replaced by songs in the vein of ""October Sky"""
A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000TETN96,1,1,4.0,"I remember hearing ""Crazy"" on the radio all the time, and it was another one of those cases where I hear a great song and then I ask people who that is singing it -- and nobody seems to know. I went to pick up Javier's album to see if there were any more songs like that on there. And the answer is yes.
Javier appears to be caught in the group of overlooked singers, as his self-titled debut is a great album full of light soul songs, with a little bit of blues thrown in here and there. If you want to enjoy some other snap-your-fingers style jams like ""Crazy"", try throwing on ""She Spoke To Me"" or ""Slow Motion"" (the latter kind of reminds me of ""Don't You Forget It"" by Glenn Lewis [another overlooked singer]). Slow songs are also good, as evidenced by my favorite track, ""Biggest Mistake"", which is what you'll do if you don't play this song.
The songwriting is a highlight as well. Never before have I heard such well-crafted stories like the bluesy ""October Sky"" and, although slighty sappy, ""If I Never Get To Heaven"". The former talks about how his girl suddenly changed her ways, while the latter explains what his woman's love means to him. The fact that Javier had written or co-written all the songs himself especially makes these tracks stand out.
Some of the lyrics in ""Beautful U R"" come off a little trite, and ""She'll Never Know"" is kind of confusing, but those aspects can't ruin a great album like this. This album won't be leaving my stereo anytime soon.

A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B000TETN96,1,-1,3.0,"I anticipated buying this cd after seeing Javier's video ""Crazy"" all summer and was not disappointed.  It is very refreshing to hear great MUSIC along with a great voice - the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is because although Javier is a new artist, his voice sounds almost exactly like Eric Benet and I found myself comparing their voices as I listened but overall, this is a great addition to my collection.
My favorite songs are: Crazy, Beautiful U R, Song For Your Tears, Biggest Mistake, If I Never Get To Heaven, She Spoke To Me, In Your Hands & October Sky."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B000TETN96,1,-1,2.0,"I like His Guitar Playing&His Versatility.but the songs themselves are pretty much there&Vocally He reminds me of Brian Mcknight,Babyface,etc.. with the Acoustic Guitar. Been there down that&better in most instances. He is Talented but I don't hear a Knock out song as much as I Hear tight Music.when He gets Words&Music as One then He will escape being labeled in a box with others. He is a Talented Cat though&the Future Looks Promising but a Song like ""Crazy"" is cool for now but with Artistic Growth he pass that by Leaps&Bounds over time."
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW,B000TETN96,1,1,5.0,"Javier is a new artist that is being slept on right now. His first single might sound a lil typical but trust me when I say it does nto represent the whole album. On this he has hip-hop, R+B, Jazz, Old school, Neo soul and a lil Salsa/Hip-hop to make a good mix. He really shows how versatile he is on this with the mix of songs on the cd. Now to the cd...whats good?
*Crazy
*Beautiful you are
*Hey Little sister
*Slow motion
*Cant have my heart
*She spoke to me
*In your hands
*October Sky
Overall these songs right here are the cream of the crop but you have to check this out. Im sure most who haven't heard of him will be suprised at the quality of the cd. Strong singing mixed with good songs always makes for good music in my book
Get it!"
A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,B000TE5MJ6,1,1,5.0,"Richard Marx has this unique ability with his voice and his songwriting to capture these really beautiful human emotions, which certainly wasn't the standard of the rather plastic and superficial music scene of the 1980's. Marx strikes again with ""Endless Summer Nights."" It tells the very intimate story of a summer love that for whatever reason is not going on anymore. We've all had these summer loves that stamp our lives in some way. There's this very real feeling--question really of where did it go? You wake up one morning and its' gone. There's a very proud tradition in this arena, but with cool mournful lyrics and vocal tones, Endless Summer Nights stands away from the others."

AB87F7XIIOF3F,B000THG29C,1,1,5.0,"What is so haunting about this song?  Is it that it can instantly take me back to Memphis, Tenn.
Everytime I hear this I just stop and reflect about my life in a southern town on the Mississippi, living in
an apartment over looking the city.  At that time a local radio show at
night would play your requests, and have dial in contests for everything from cds, free meals, entrance to
the much coveted roof parties at The Peabody.  FM100's Jeremy ""Danger Boy"" would at times dedicate this
song to me if I managed to win one of the contests.  It was such a delight to hear my name on the radio and
have this song go out to me, played  over the city.
Selena does such a beautiful job on this song, and for many reasons I still find it touching."

ARYVQL4N737A1,B000THHRKA,1,1,5.0,"This is another great song that gets played a lot on the oldies stations. I would rate this song, as well as the Stampeders ""Sweet City Woman,"" as having a more unique sound than most of the other popular songs from '70s radio. A great sing-along song, a timeless classic!"
A2UNAFWQOWM87B,B000THHRKA,1,1,5.0,I just had to get this song - it reminds me of my Dad (who has been gone for many years now).  But this song is kind of a description of how my Dad was & I just love it.  Brings back memories for me along with some tears when I listen to it.
A2PWS2A7QL0EAK,B000THHRKA,1,1,5.0,A Feel-Good song.  I heard it in the market not long ago and it brought back a flood of memories from when I first listened to it.  Just had to have it again.

A2Z0JW8EQ2EBIZ,B000THHRKA,1,1,5.0,I have enjoyed this song since I first heard it after it was first released by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band years ago.  My sister enjoy a it so much that she has yet to return my CD  with that song on it!  It is a tribute to an entertainer and I like songs of that kind as long as I can hear the lyrics without getting my ears so bombarded by rock music that I have have temporarily list my hearing.  I have immensely enjoyed this and other songs by this band.  This should be liked by other fans of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and those who lime either country or country-rock music.
A3093X1KMWI5MI,B000THGDY6,1,1,5.0,This is the great music for the c'set le vie and it is the most song I requested in the world
A20DZX38KRBIT8,9721717150,-1,-1,2.0,"Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need....well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring."
A1WCU50D5BH98B,9721717150,1,1,4.0,"I have no real complaints here, other than there's a few tracks I could go without.  I'm not a huge fan of the Bon Scott era songs, BUT the ones I DO like ARE on here: ""TNT"", ""Dirty Deeds"", and ""Highway to Hell"".  A really good mix here.

I really DO like this CD set...although I see no reason for the two discs...just cut a few songs off and make it one CD.

BUY IT!!!!!"
A1RX5ERL0QIZ3U,9721717150,1,1,5.0,"I have had the DVD for some time now and even burned my own CD's of this show to listen to, simply excellent. I am a big fan of Bon Scott and bet if he saw this he would have approved. Check out the DVD of this one as well. You might just see and hear that over this CD only set. Anyway, if your a hardcore fan or just a fan of Rock n Roll, you'll love this one. This one does NOT disappoint.
Drop by my website at ""JudeMac Forever"" & see what I have been up too sometime."
A2PJBX24OT9534,9721717150,1,1,5.0,"It is amazing that 20 years ago, when AC/DC released their last live record, they were considered pretty much a spent force when it came to studio albums. I remember reading a review of ""live"" in Kerrang or Metal Hammer, in which the reviewer who gave ""Live"" 5 out of 5, stated that this was the only time now in AC/DC's career, that he could for see giving the band top marks.
How times have changed, with ""Ball Breaker"", ""Stiff upper lip"" & ""Black Ice"" (admittedly this album is a little hit & miss, but it will do), AC/DC's credibility has gone through the roof, being named checked by everybody as a major influence.
Which is why ""River Plate"" is much more than just a nostalgia concert, which is what you would get if it was The Stones or The Who releasing a new live record.
The new songs slot in well with the classic tracks(although no songs from ""Ball Breaker"", or ""Stiff upper.."", which is a shame) & the crowd are on fire, even doing harmonics, which I've never heard before at an AC/DC gig. The band still gives an energetic performance considering their ripe old age.
Live albums always work better, when there recorded from one venue, instead of a whole tour, constantly fading in & out after each song, losing momentum.  But ""River Plate"" feels like a one off special event, which always makes a live more appearing to listen to. It is interesting that back in the 70's & 80's, rock bands would regularly release a live album every 3-4-studio albums, but ""AC/DC Live"" was one of the last big selling live albums (Thanks Kirk Cobain).
Nowadays it only really Iron Maiden that do live albums, so it a little difficult to judge ""River Plate"" by contemporary standards, but then again AC/DC have never concerned themselves with shifting musical fashions.
The only nit-pick I have, is that it's a shame AC/DC didn't record the gig in a small club, like The Stones have been doing in 2012, perhaps that could be the band  next live venture."
A2XBPJ4V623SW,9721717150,1,1,5.0,love ac/dc live

A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ,9721717150,1,1,5.0,"Review no. 58. So glad that I finally got around to purchasing a copy of this must-have live AC/DC 'Live At River Plate' 2-CD. As I got lucky and saw AC/DC twice during their most memorable 'Black Ice' 2009-2010 World Tour. Both times had a two-song difference in the set lists - so Angus Young and crew definitely does ~not~ play the same songs at every single gig they do. Didn't bother with the DVD - maybe later. Four tunes off the acclaimed 'Black Ice' CD - the frantic opener ""Rock 'N Roll Train"", ""Big Jack"", title track ""Black Ice"" and ""War Machine"". Can't get enough of those Bon Scott gems - that you might not hear every day - like ""Shot Down In Flames"" and the ass-kicking ""Dog Eat Dog"". Plus all the AC/DC live staples we have come to know [and love] ""Back In Black"", ""Shoot To Thrill"", ""Whole Lotta Rose"" (complete with giant inflatable blow-up woman), one of my all-time favorites ""Let There Be Rock"" and the grand finale ""For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)"". Comes with a handy CD booklet with full color photos. Essential."
A1GY1HIA0XKF2G,9721717150,1,1,5.0,"Fantastic live album, one of the best ever. Angus does a fantastic job and plays exactly like the studio. Brian has lost a bit in his voice but does a great job. ""Gracias! That's all the Spanish we know."""
A2NEMGBFLAFR7I,9721717150,1,1,5.0,"This is AC/DC's better album collections, it provides the earlier music along with the most modern/current releases. I love this album and I will never get tired of listening to it."
A10613AZVJSR1F,9721717150,1,1,5.0,Very good live CD by AC / DC. Would recommend any AC / DC fan to buy. Will enjoy listening.

A3SPLKSOFHQBF7,9721717150,1,-1,1.0,"AC/DC fans will love to rock out with the Masters of Rock. The recordings are great, the hits keep coming song after song."
A1K0DL0KWRCQTJ,9721717150,1,1,5.0,"Not necessarily a fan of live CDs/albums but for fans of the band AC/DC this is a must have !  Some bands are recording artists, pure and simple. This CD proves that AC/DC have been and always will be, live rock legends !
Rock on, Skip Wieland"
ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,9721717150,1,1,4.0,"I'll start right off the bat and say AC/DC Live Special Edition released in 1991 is my all time favorite AC/DC album, live or recorded, so of coarse this one here was not going to stand a chance of being the perfect 5 star album from AC/DC, but I still give it a 4 star rating. Like many AC/DC fans who collect bootlegs from the band, or have rare live tracks in our collections, it's going to be hard for AC/DC to top a lot of the #1 fav live versions between 1974 and present. But this album is still great for us collectors, even those who have heard these same set-lists a million times before, with a few of the new songs thrown in the mix, but this album has a lively crowed that may not speak English too well, but they do know how to scream and humm along to the tunes, making them unique crowed interaction versions of AC/DC's classics preformed at River Plate in 2009/10?

I won't bore you and compare things like ""TNT"" just doesn't sound as good as the live version from 198somethign that was eventually included on ""Backtracks"" etc.. but I will say AC/DC have still got what it takes to rock your socks off as much as they did a 100 years ago. Kicking off with a great live recording of the new track ""Rock N Roll Train"" and into a classic blazing version of ""Hell aint a bad place to be"" and then onto what is possibly there biggest hit to date, ""Back In Black"" and so forth.

Some reviewers here said if you have heard AC/DC's previous set lists before, then you have heard it all and they are boring. Well, you will miss out on great new live tracks such as ""Rock N Roll Train"", ""Big Jack"", ""War Machine"" and ""Black Ice"", even tho most of us fans really wished they had preformed other tracks from the Black Ice album like 'spoilin' for a fight' and ""she likes rock n roll""... and then there is the typical songs of coarse... but what those guys saying it's all been the same, it surprises me AC/DC didn't take the chance to finally get an official live album version of ""Rock N Roll aint Noise Pollution"" down. What really would have been nice would have been a bonus track of ""High Voltage"" included that AC/DC subbed in during the Australian and New Zealand tour by popular demand. Just like they included ""Hell aint a bad place to be"" only on the Japan special edition of Live (1991). Oh well, what can you do?

Something else that makes this album different to other ones is that this whole tour, AC/DC tuned the guitars downwards a step, giving the songs a new spark of life in a same old song, but with a slightly different sound to what you have always heard. It also seems like Brian Johnson speaks his words more clearly, not sure what, maybe he was schooled on it or the effect of living in American now has rubbed off, but you can clearly understand every word he says and is singing, and there is no question by anyone like ""WTF is he saying?"" not that I ever had trouble understanding him. A few songs spark a little new life to by the way Johnsons sings them, it seems he speaks the words clear and propperlly, and doesn't sing them in a slang term cutting off the g from 'ing' words etc.. I dunno if you care about this or not, but I found it pretty interesting to compare what Brian is doing with the songs now compared to 20-30 years ago. Never diss the man, he is the silent rock n roll god at the top that some people slam as not being Bon Scott, but get over it guys, Bon is gone, and Brian has done a great job keeping AC/DC at #1 for all these years... compare him to Bon if you want, but Brian had been in the band longer, has not disgraced himself, kept Bons memory alive, and despite what you say, he's a rock n roll god who even on those so called ""bad ac/dc albums"" (not that I think they're bad at all) those songs are still better than most other groups greatest hits, so lay off Brian, understand he is the singer now, and STOP comparing him to Bon Scott. Bon was great, sure, Brian is different, but he is too great in other ways and deserves more respect then people always showing up on AC/DC's latest releases and saying ""Bon this, Bon that, Bon would've""... don't you think Bon is looking down on Brian and smiling at what a fantastic job Brian has done since Bon passed away? If there is an afterlife, both Bon and Brian will remain with the band, because I am convinced Bon would not say ""thanks for takin over, but i'll take it from here"" no, you would have two legends in the drivers seats!

Keep on rockin' \../,"

A9WFV9DEWY4S0,B000TPHAJA,1,1,4.0,"I was always sneaking into the older Teen parties just because I wanted to hear what music they liked.  Growing up in SLC there were not any soul stations so 45 records were all we had.  I had a best friend who had all the latest music all the time so I was privy to all of the best music.

Eugene Wilde's Gotta Get You Home Tonight was in every young person's mind when it came time to getting home before your curfew..  It was easy to dance to and me and my friends made many dance routines from the rhythms of this music.  You did not always have a boy who was willing to dance because they were too shy so me and my girl friends just took to the dance floor and partied without them.  Great memory."
A1AJ1L51PLRUMJ,B000TPHAJA,1,1,5.0,This is one of my favorite old time oldies.  I think if it was released today it would be a hit all over again.
A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000TPHM5C,1,1,5.0,There are certain pieces of music that touch my soul and this was one of them.  I used to get depressed at times very severely depressed.  I found that listening to music I like at calming times of the day prevents my depression.  This is a very upbeat song about a man's reaction to a very fine lady.  This woman must be awesome because if you listen to his story this woman has his nose wide open to use slang popular in my day.  Simply Irresistible has awesome lyrics that tell an interestingly funny story to an upbeat solid beat.  For a mere $.99 the payoff in joy made this a prenium investment better than any anti-deoression medicine known to man.
A218THF45IKWKH,B000TPHM5C,1,1,5.0,"I'm not a huge 80's fan or anything, but I do think the 80's was probably the last decade to have a lot of good music. This song is great in it's own right, but I think it also is a pretty good representation of 80's music in general (sure, there were exceptions, but it wasn't the standard). It has a catchy beat with good lyrics that convey a message you can relate to and doesn't have to stoop to vulgarity like so much of today's pop music. You could appreciate a woman's beauty without over sexualizing it. Be warned, if you listen to it you are likely to have it stuck in your head for awhile!"
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TPHM5C,1,1,5.0,"""Simply Irresistible"" is a great feel good type of musical track that is my overall favorite by Robert Palmer. In ""Simply Irresistible"" Robert sings a great tune on how a woman that use to just look good to him has gotten even more beautiful and appealing to him over the years. I love it when he sings the lyrics ""she is anything but typical"", and the lyrics ""she's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force"". I personally have learned ways to increase my self-love, and listening to this song is one of the ways I love to do this. I say this because listening to this song helps serve as a fun reminder on why it is important to see the beauty inside of yourself regardless of what is reflected in the outside world. Hearing this song serves as a playful reminder to always work on feeling good from within. ""Simply Irresistible"" is a great song that is like fine wine that gets better with time (just like his other track ""Addicted to Love""). You are going to love listening to this song if you enjoy Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" musical track and/or classic rock and 80's music."

A32TGHD77OX43A,B000TPJLTC,1,1,5.0,Tina Turner is the best!!!
A192NXERQ6IPOL,B000TPJLTC,1,1,5.0,Love her music and this song was one of her greatest hits.
AOJGM8A8TGIVS,B000TPJLTC,1,1,5.0,This is a very good song. It is a very descriptive new wave storytelling theme song. I would recommend this song to 80's music fans.
AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B000TPFPAG,1,1,5.0,"I'm not surprised this group still manages to support themselves touring with a handful of successful songs.  This is the only one I really like but I think the remaster is the best version.  You should find them on the internet to determine which version is for you before purchasing.

And how amazing is it that they thought to write a song about justifying infidelity.  I had no idea for decades until recently - something so hurtful is delivered so prettily and then the comeback by the female counterpart.  It's a song that give so much pleasure in a soothing, relaxing sweet way and the message of two-sided infidelity and self-excusing is something lethal that probably flies right over most people's heads hence its success.

I mean this is a song to make babies gurgle with pleasure and tweens beam after all.

I paid seventy cents more to get the itunes video.  It's stunning.  keke"
A1ZUQG0G6550I3,B000TPFPAG,1,1,5.0,This is one of the songs I loved when I was growing up.  I loved it and still do.  Thank goodness I found it.
A2OMDT29QMLAWQ,B000TPFPAG,1,1,4.0,"I always liked this song, & if you grew up in the 80's as I did chances are you like it too, but with the passing of years you almost forget how fun songs from the 80's were & still are

I happened to be watching a popular TV ad one evening & the ad was playing this song & as soon as I heard it a bunch of old memory's came flooding back & I started to hum a few bars & then realized that I had to download this song, lol it's a blast from the past, but still awesome & fun.

I'm only human."
A21O4GPQWC3ST0,B000TPFPAG,1,1,4.0,The lyrics to the songs make you think as well as make you move. It takes me back to the late 80's and 90's which was a great time in my life!
A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000TPJ5FM,1,1,5.0,"Bobby Lewis's ""Tossin' and Turnin'"" has to be one of the greatest early sixties classics.  An essential addition to anyone's oldies' collection, the song is addictive for its throbbing interplay of guitar and bass and Lewis's spirited vocals which are infectiously backed up by formidable female singers.  While many understandably vote for Chubby Checker's ""The Twist,"" ""Tossin' and Turnin'"" gets my vote for ""Twistin' the Night Away""."
AKC8TAN4F4GOH,B000TPDYTK,1,1,5.0,"I've always loved this song and am glad I ran across it at Amazon. With oldies like this, I never know if I want the whole CD or just the song, so it's nice to sample others but be able to only buy the one. We lost that option during the years of cassette tapes and CD's, but have it back now thanks to the Internet."
AMW1OYXWOGZGJ,B000TPDYTK,1,1,5.0,"I'm in the process of getting MP3s for all of the music I grew up with.  I've worn out the albums, cassettes and CD's.  Now it's time to just get everything in MP3 format.  One down 15,000 to go!!!"
A1URCB58DDIZTQ,B000TPDYTK,-1,1,5.0,"I prefer buying music on Amazon, than on I-tunes. A lot of the selections are cheaper, and the download is easy."
A3TX76J7GR8VR0,B000TPDYTK,1,1,5.0,Great song & good sound quality.  I highly recommend purchasing this song from this source if you like this song enough to purchase it.
A1LW0G97AIJ0PV,B000TPDYTK,1,1,5.0,Love turning this up on the radio while riding in the car.

AC6H5O5PPZ9FG,B000TPDYTK,1,1,5.0,I wanted to hear the original version of the song from Tom Cochrane and not Rascal Flatts version.

ADOO2BZJYUUJF,B000TPDYTK,1,1,5.0,Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have purchased it...

AFAJTPU988FU8,B000TPDYTK,1,1,5.0,"I have loved this song ever since I first heard it.  It's just catchy, infectious and fun and I wholly recommend buying it."
AQ96O5JCCH1KR,B000TPDYTK,-1,-1,3.0,"Bought this for a work function, not for me. I am sorry that I could not give a more in-depth review."
A1IKAOG9VF3J3D,B000TPDYTK,1,1,4.0,I downloaded this one song - I've always liked it but I couldn't remember the singers name. Thank goodness for Shazaam.
AEZNE7TR0CHFI,B000TPHJJ6,1,1,5.0,"I just had the pleasure of seeing Eric perform. This was his encore song. It's always been his most noticed piece of work, but the way it flows is stunning. He shows off his classical roots with a touch of jazz, rock and his own genre that I won't even attempt to name. Amazing!"
A3THSGE4JMQRJC,B000TPHJJ6,1,1,5.0,"This is, I suppose, a guitarist's guitar track. Certainly, I was introduced to it by my guitar teacher a number of years ago. I would say however that this instrumental is very accessible and features guitar heroics that everyone should appreciate.  Used very effectively to promote PBS a few years ago."
A3KZ7OH4VRL048,B000TPHJJ6,-1,1,4.0,"Recently featured in ""Guitar Hero III,"" Eric Johnson's ""Cliffs of Dover"" has finally started getting the recognition it deserves. An instrumental work, this is four minutes and ten seconds of pure guitar nirvana. Rock fans of all stripes will appreciate this track.

That being said, the actual Amazon MP3 download isn't clipped well; it has a fraction of a second from the previous song at the beginning so that you hear an out-of-place guitar at the 0:00 mark. I had to listen to the track several times to make sure it wasn't just me, it goes so quickly. Any rudimentary audio editing program can clip this out, but it's still enough to knock off a star."
ADUR2GU90NB98,B000TPHJJ6,1,1,5.0,If you like guitar music then this is the song for you. One of my favorites.
A6EJKOIWXTVYN,B000TPVJ6A,1,1,4.0,"I grewup listening to Barbara Mason and I enjoy her music.  So if you're a 70's person or grewup in this decade, you can certainly appreciate her music. The music today is good and has expanded into so many genres than before. My personal opinion the 70's is the BEST era in music.  It was a time of change for everyone.  Barbara Mason is just one of my favorite artist."
A3B2F2086QK67Q,B000TPVJ6A,-1,-1,2.0,"I have not bought this cd but just from the sample songs i can tell they are not the original recordings. I'm from Philly i remember her 1st song Girls have feelings too (1964) followed by Are you ready her number #1 smash hit later on Sad sad girl etc....... These songs on this anthology c.d. have been rearranged and they SUCK!
  The  original songs could have been remastered through digital technology to enhance the vocal quality  (the back up crew especially the guys  singers were thorwing down accapella).  These remasterd back up singers are young inexperiend singers  who just ain't kicking it.
 Amazon does offer  the  original  ""Are you ready Barbara Mason"" colletion  .....but it's going for $199.00 and no m3p or ipod downlads are  availible"
A2KUKP4L8JQUUH,B000TPVJ6A,1,1,5.0,very good

A2LR1I5WZV3RAT,B000TRTFEQ,1,1,5.0,Once upon a time this was one of those songs that stuck in your head all summer long.  It was high time to add it to the Kindle.
A158LSOWXW6NIO,B000TRTFEQ,-1,1,5.0,I am child of 80's music so I downloaded this selection to add to my 80's collection on my ipod.
AH9H5JS7HDFGA,B000TRVDLE,-1,1,5.0,"It makes me think of a pain in the ass little cousin that I had and couldn't abide for any reason. There were so many times I just wanted her to go AWAY, and I wasn't allowed to tell her.  THIS song makes up for it, because the singer is going through the same thing."
A33QL7Y8Y9SQSI,B000TRVDLE,1,1,5.0,this was a song that i liked from the first time i heard it back in the 70's . nice add on to my player.
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000TRQ52Q,1,1,5.0,"This was a great song with a great classic rock song vibe to it.  Eric Carmen singing lead, the great sound of the lead guitar playing--it's just a great song to listen to."
A29HTPTAH1VKXL,B000TRQ52Q,1,1,5.0,"Like the title states, a classic song from a timeless band. Brings back lots of memories. Eric Carmen's voice was perfect on this song."
A1P9PG7KCYX50S,B000TRQ52Q,1,1,5.0,"There is a large underground following of this POP ROCK GROUP from Thirty some years back. I heard they did a small reunion tour a couple years back and were well recieved again. This group did some great music that has stood the test of time. The song ""Go all the Way"" is one of many that reveal the magic this band had."
A1UOR1E7G4EV6D,B000TRQ52Q,1,1,5.0,Great classic
A16WOGOY3FI1Q3,B000TRQ52Q,1,1,4.0,I like it.

A17KVY5ZWRWQ3R,B000TRVDQY,1,1,4.0,"This is one of Sweet's better songs. Also, local bands in my area covered it at local bar shows."
A19YNFIAO5KHGP,B000TRVDQY,-1,1,4.0,I rate the stars on the originality of the recording. Many times it is not the original release of the record.
AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000TRVDQY,1,1,4.0,"A group I never heard of until I heard this song; and what a great song it is. I liked this song because it's not the tpical 70's song, this has more of an 80's beat to it. It's fast and it's explicit in a way, it kinda tells a story of a fast girl, but in a different way. I love the way it can get you to start sing the lyrics; and yes I have caught myself doing it. If you like those classic songs this is for you and for anyone who is willing to listen to anything differnt.

A18758S1PUYIDT,B000TRVDQY,1,1,5.0,"I have been going through a nostalgic phase lately, particularly in regard to the music of the 1970s.  And would you believe that I heard this song for the first time in many years in a hotel in Laughlin, where the median age of the travelers is 75 and it's not even their kind of music?  Hilarious, I know.

This took me back all right, back to the days of goofy synthesizers, very few lyrics or incomprehensible ones at best, and an undeniably catchy beat.

I would love to play this song at a party and see how many of my peers remember it."
AVMYQ88R6ESPW,B000TRVDQY,1,1,5.0,Great product
A3SY40YETOFALL,B000TRVDQY,1,1,4.0,I have the vinyl version of this classic song.  It is a good tune.

A27Z22Q5A74O53,B000TRVDQY,-1,1,5.0,"Grew up with the song out of the 1970s. It has a progressive sound, only heard with such bands as KISS, Cheap Trick and the like."

A283HYRKHPCZT5,B000TRTMNU,1,1,5.0,brings back memories of hot summer days and long lazy evenings over a backdrop of the space race and Roy Orbison et. al serenading us over the AM radio. This is a must have for your reoord colletion. Just stay away from the Tallahatchie Bridge while listening...
A346Z5D3988CD9,B000TRTMNU,1,1,5.0,Just a beautiful song from the 60's. It's not quite country or folk and not hippie but there's something about it that was just interesting.

A11F8B8GQURI84,B000TRTMNU,1,1,5.0,"This song tells a story about Billie Joe McAllister jumping of the Tallahatchie Bridge and how the town of Choctaw reacted to that suicide. I honestly do not know if this is a True story, but Bobbie Gentry makes it sound as if it is a True story. This is the only hit by her that I know of and I still like it. The story is sad, though, and I have no idea what she and  Billie Joe McAllister threw off the Tallahatchie Bridge or why Billie Joe jumped. Maybe I missed part of the story.

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000TRVDNC,1,1,5.0,Ballroom Blitz by The Sweet is a diverting classic rock song that appears to obviously capture the moment of a group of people in a setting just having a carefree good time. The guitar beats to this song are impressively timed with when the lyrics are sung during The Ballroom Blitz.
A2BD0R1C2776XY,B000TRVDNC,1,1,5.0,A Great Recording And At A Good Price!

ARYVQL4N737A1,B000TRVI5U,1,1,5.0,"I have a live version of this studio version on my '60s mix CD, along with The Box Tops' ""The Letter,"" Friends of Distinction's ""Grazing In The Grass,"" The Viscounts' ""Harlem Nocturne"" and songs like that on it. Their songs were around two and a half minutes long or so back then, so I have 23 songs on one CD. I just decided at the last minute to add the studio version to my collection, since this is such a great, classic song."
A2DARHKCF0ZT4O,B000TRVDNC,1,1,5.0,Good Music!
A3B9DHWCMYQFD,B000TRVDNC,1,1,5.0,"It's it's, a ballroom blitz! This song was crazy when it first came out in the very early seventies. The Beatles were hot. But this song was (dare I say) one of the first hard rock songs ever! I was very young. And I had this on a little 45 record and I bet I played it a thousand times! I knew every word by heart and I would jump around the room as I screeched right along with song....yup. I was born to rock. We owe a great deal to Sweet because they really got things moving."
A31ADK6SNYI63H,B000TRVDNC,1,1,5.0,"Es gibt viele andere Blitz, OOPS slipped in to my German!  Why not Blitz the Ballroom, as only The Sweet can?  Friends, Romans, (?) Counrtymen!  Lend me your Speakers!!"

I close my eyes as the song plays and can almost feel the wind pick up and the first drops of rain hitting my skin.
A2TQD6R721TBOJ,B000TRVI6E,1,1,5.0,"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*."

ABVYGB2TKBO8F,B000U8N072,1,1,5.0,"As I often do I listen to old hits on the radio. When I hear something I'd like to own I go searching for that exact cut. Sometimes it is hard to find the original. Too often new versions, remixed, or otherwise ""updated"" copies get in the way of finding the original cuts.

This copy of I'll Take You There is exactly the original. It's just what I wanted."

I got sucked in like everyone else who saw and heard the Target ads that featured this tune. It's great. The only thing is this isn't quite remixed like the ad with all the digital layering and play, but it's still fun to dance to."

The one song/video of any redeeming value to come out of this group is ""She'e a Beauty!""  After bouncing around in my head for over thirty years, I finally added it to my media collection."
A1SB5A77COEA1L,B000UFTQQY,1,1,5.0,"I love the album for the simple joy of reminding me of high school. Did I just date myself? :-) I am reminded of algebra talking about the 'She's the Beauty"" video on MTV. Great song, great band and a little bit of nastalgia"

A1JMR6MVOIC38K,B000UH5VNO,1,1,5.0,"As I write this review, I am listening to a CD-R I had made of my album, which I've owned since the late 1970s.  It sounds great. I bought this album for 99 cents at a Korvettes store.

This is one of Cher's signature albums as an artist, as opposed to entertainer.  Believe me, I make no hierarchal distinctions between artist and entertainer -- both are needed in society.  Cher, the entertainer, has brought me so much pleasure since I was a kid.  Cher, the artist, when singing a song like ""These Days,"" or ""Love Hurts,"" bares her soul.

What I find curious, still, is that even after Cher returned to Warner Brothers in the late '90s for the biggest album of her career, that her four Warner Brothers albums from the 1970s (including ""Two The Hard Way"" with Gregg Allman) remained unavailable.  In my ""man on the street"" opinion, these albums would have sold quite well if released after ""Believe"" became a blockbuster.  Also, let's not forget the two songs Cher recorded with Phil Spector after her split with Sonny, and her duet with Nilsson, released on Spector/WB Records.

""Please don't confront me with my failures, I've not forgotten them..."""
A1HBI9BBQIG1NH,B000UH5VNO,1,1,4.0,"Cher is a celebrated actress,singer etc.
Back in the 70's she was trying to expell her character gypsy songs-and forage a serious career. She was in somewhat of a dilemma considering her loss of a private life-a public life paired with a clothes horse reputation. It was a long shot to imagine musical crtics to come to her side.
This 1975 lp showcases her voice with Jimmy Webbs' lush orchestrations.
The best song here is the wailing ""Just this one time"",an under-rated gem,
that shows Cher at her most expressive. The last sentence in the song soars to a heighth never heard from the vocalist previously. ""Love Enough"" comes in 2nd with it's similar fully sung treatment.
The lp has several rockers,covers of the rock roster of the day-Clapton,Jackson Brown,Neil Young.
.Cher is best on the unfamilliar songs.
But like all her 70's warner cuts this lp is lost to those without a record player. It's an interesting and curious effort from the pop icon of her generation. She is one shot away from a home run.""Stars"" is a bit short on being completely an artistic statement.
Cher is a wiser singer today,and would probably sing this material even better 30 years later! Cher has a unique voice, and all her lps have some merit,(though Prisoner and Cherished have very little credibility)this one more than most because of her emotional commitment to the music."
A1RUU0TEW8JRDC,B000UH5VNO,1,1,5.0,"""STARS ""  album  by CHER was released in 1975 her first release for Warner Brothers is here as a CD. I think the problem why this CD
was not successful was because Cher was coming off her TV show and her MCA recordings. For this CD  Cher sings 9 songs  penned by 9
male songwriter's and 1 by  female songwriter Janis Ian ( Stars)  the  album was  produced by Jimmy Webb. This album is  recorded, produced,
and sung by Cher  just  beautifully. Her version of ""These  Days"" by Jackson Browne is amazing. Every song on this CD fits perfectly.
This is Cher as a mature, serious singer with  the ability to do these songs as they should be. ""Just this one time"" is the best thing
Cher has ever recorded the range of her singing this song is down right perfection.  We all  know  Cher  is a great actress and i think
 this comes out in her singing this songs with such emotion and feeling. If you read the reviews you will see all Cher's fans love this
CD. We need Cher to do a complete album with songs recorded where great song  writer's give her the chance to sing the songs
her way.  The  dance able  releases by Cher were great for it's time but now Cher let's get back to a great rock, ballad release.  ."
A14Y48GBNSJK1V,B000ULAU40,-1,-1,3.0,"OK version of this song, not the best quality sound I've ever heard.  But, I haven't found a better sound anywhere else.  Perhaps there was never a ""re-mastered"" version of this that was an improvement of the sound."

A14FP7F9Q4Z6XV,B000ULCSAY,1,1,5.0,"One of the best rock songs ever written.  The beginning is monumental.  The body of the song is extremely moving.  The end of the song leaves you wanting more, which is exactly what I want from a great song.  The final chords of the song pound out a rhythm that leaves you breathlessly waiting for more.  So you hit repeat and do it all again.  Got to love it."

A3B9DHWCMYQFD,B000ULCSAY,1,1,5.0,The song 'Lunatic fringe'  is another one of those songs from way back that has survived the test of time. With Amazon Cloud Drive and MP3 you can pick and choose. This was a really good song back in the day.

A2W9I628I6SE1U,B000UO7XRY,1,-1,3.0,"I bought IaaGB for my nine-year-old daughter who loves this catchy tune. I find it rather annoying, but I can understand the attraction. She's at an age where these timely songs make an impression and stick with them. For me, it would have been a tune like Ghostbusters or Rock me Amadeus. I get the appeal, even if I don't appreciate it so much. I won't begrudge her enjoyment of it. But I can call it like I see it, and I'm pretty sure it will be forgotten in short order. It is danceable though, so until then, enjoy!

A2KOL0YA4W9275,B000UPX2LE,1,1,5.0,"Obviously this is another song I downloaded for my bunny!! It's kind of a sexier version of the song, but still a little peppy. It's funny because every time I give my bunny a bath, I always sing it to her, and she has a rubber duckies that makes that sound. It was so great to see it on the list of free songs Amazon was offering, and I played the sample, got nod of approval, downloaded, and STOMP! I got the ""Where is my tubby""? look, and the rest, as they say, is history. I think Mosie (my bunny), is one of the few small pets who loves a tubby, as it's always a fight to get her out. She used to just sit in tub watching TV, and I would sing while washing her. Now, I play this and have to have duck ready to squeeze along with song, and it was fascinating to watch her make the connection between words & sounds in song, and her tubby and duck! Yes, I do catch myself singing it around the house, but it is really for Mosie, and it's amazing how much she connects to certain songs, and the different versions. Definitely glad I got this!!!"

A39XHOUZYNZTP2,B000UQYT5Q,1,1,5.0,"This piece is truly INSPIRED, and yet fits right into the Chris Rice style so perfectly. The lyrics are so beautiful, and great music to match!"
A3C0847WXDRWC5,B000UQYT5Q,1,1,5.0,"This song brings me comfort, hope, and joy. Was great comfort after the death of my father...there's a better day coming.."
AJ5V9EBLVBHAW,B000URYSW4,-1,1,5.0,"When ""Mothermania"" was released there were already several compilation albums of The Mothers Of Invention floating around. Except for ""Mothermania"", none were compiled or approved by Frank Zappa. On FZ's only approved ""best of The Mothers"" collection, we get four unique mixes of four songs, which makes this release essential for the Zappa fan who needs EVERYTHING! ""Mother People"" has the verse that was censored out of ""We're Only In It For The Money"" (which includes the wonderful lyric: ""Shut your f-----g mouth about the length of my hair"". ""The Idiot Bastard Son"" features a short intro that was trimmed for ""We're Only In It For The Money"", and it also omits the mid-song dialog that ruined the flow of the song. ""Call Any Vegetable"", which consists of three parts and runs about 8 minutes on ""Absolutely Free"" is trimmed to a more digestible 4:23, by omitting most of part 2 (""Invocation & Ritual Dance Of The Young Pumpkin""). Finally, we get the alternate edit of ""It Can't Happen Here"", which has the piano ballet interlude removed, and adds an extra line of FZ's dialog with Suzy Creamcheese. For me, as a Zappa fanatic, ""Mothermania"" on CD is a long awaited, essential collection."
ANA5ORZ4QLTYO,B000URYSW4,1,1,4.0,Finally the family trust saw fit to release this. It's only a big deal to us feteshists but it does have some interesting mixes
A1CQTU9YHFMBZ9,B000URYSW4,1,1,5.0,"AWESOME! The first Mother's album I ever bought, many, many years ago, and still relevant today. A couple of the cuts appear to have either been revised or modified, but that could just be my aging mind."
A3DPACNQCR3720,B000URYSW4,1,1,5.0,"Drove the old man crazy riding in the van in the early 70's.  I'm partial to Zappa's' early work with the MOI.  This collects all the best of the Verve output at the time.  Freak Out, We're only in it for the money and Absolutely Free, each a journey unto themselves.  Frank had to do a bit of tweaking to make this flow.  Before this came out, I 'made' a copy from the said 3 CD's for a friend of mine who only had it on vinyl and doesn't have a vinyl disc player.  Some parts were rocky, but it sufficed.
So, if you're new to FZ or just want a primer to his early work, get this, then you'll wind up buying  the 3 above mentioned CD's....you're welcome!"
A1DDRX0OKKN5TK,B000UWR1AU,1,1,5.0,I learned this song in school and it was the go to song during rainstorms.  It was often on the radio and quite cheerful.  Recommend to those who let the rain bring them down (this will give you a different perspective) and to those who want a cheerful song.
A1X93ES4DITTWK,B000091NES,-1,1,5.0,I love the orignal version of the song as well as the New Jack Swing Remix. I don't care about the other remixes. We need more one hit wonders like Jane Child instead of these so-called artists who want to stay around for years and years and put out [...]. Hoolllaaa!
A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000091NES,-1,1,5.0,"This groove wore out the turntable when I first got it.  Not only was the single version one of the best songs of the late 80's, the New Jack Swing remixes took the song to a higher level."
A29YK82GBM9QRB,B000V2A5IE,1,1,4.0,O' Bryan put a new spend on this Popular titled song. This young artists sizzles in the R&B genre...as song to be enjoyed by all!

AQL13WF76ZQQJ,B000V2GWJK,1,1,5.0,"Its Christmas time once again and all the Christmas music is playing on the radio, in the stores and at home. The tradional Christmas music is fun, heart warming. A couple of weeks ago I heard the song A Baby Changes Everything by Faith Hill, introduced by a friend. That song put a whole sense of feeling about life. Though it is about baby Jesus, but it touched my life about a baby that was born 23 years ago to me. The baby changed everything in my life. When I first heard it I was crying. Tonight Jamie who sings at the Hard Rock Lobby Bar in Tampa sang a song called  Grown -up Christmas List- I honestly have never heard this song before and I simply started crying, tears were flowing. Though it has been recorded by such very talented artist as Amy Grant, Kelly Clarkson, Natalie Cole- David Foster, Clay Aiken and Michael Buble. I have always had people in my life, a friend, my family, people who I meet. As I was crying the shock of reality came over me when I realized their are people in this world who do not have family, a friend, neighbor to talk to.

These are the people who are HOMELESS. I am a person who loves to give than  recieve, but when its time to see Santa you bet that I will wish for a new friend for Christmas and it will be on the top of my list.

This world is scary these days with everyone fighting, struggling during these hard times, jobless, finacial difficulty and no peace in the world.

To all of you: May you have a wonderful Holiday
Love, Roberta"

A1OZTG654RUIQW,B000V2GWJK,1,1,5.0,"With some many old favorie Christmas songs already inspring us during the Christmas season, this is a newer one that has become on old favorite very quickly.  Amy's voice & delivery are lovely and the lyrics touch my heart every time I hear it."
A1MH8L9TVKMYDN,B000V616JC,-1,1,5.0,"I greatly appreciate having an actual ""hit"" song available for two bits (.25). It's about
time someone actually cared about the consumer & made available songs this cheap. My only
wish would be to have more songs available for this price on an regular basis. iTunes is
unable (or incapable) of providing songs to download at this price point."
A1MCQLJGZ2ODCK,B000V616JC,1,-1,3.0,I could not pass up the $.25 price tag on this song. I probably would not have bought it otherwise. it may come in handy.
A39LJ3P2XJC8ZP,B000V61610,1,1,5.0,"Really - what's NOT to like about this song?  Jamming tune that, when added to your workout mix, will make you hit the replay button EVERY time!"
A1JLFNLQ1XE1MH,B000V61610,1,1,5.0,Use this for warm up and also helping students to understand that it is their life and should be lived the way they want to ... (within reason of course) ... and make sure they are not doing something that their parents want them to do ... and are doing it because their parents want them to and not because they want to ...

A1L1RL7U7UYJ3Q,B000V61610,1,1,5.0,This song is a wonderful song. No Doubt performed this song perfectly.  You can clearly hear Gwen Stefani's vocals above the various instruments of the group.

I bought this MP3 a while ago but it needed to be reviewed because it is still that cool."

I am still amazed at the small cost to hear something we love so easily. Thanks again to making it so affordable and easy for someone like me.  SaraBeth
AUWU2GNZON784,B000V61688,1,1,4.0,Great song poking fun at celebirty. Mac Davis pokes fun at the dangers of celebrity and how it can quickly go to one's head. Luckily he stayed grounded enough to write this great and entertaining satire. Had me laughing the whole way thru.
A6WSPBL9IY5CB,B000V61688,1,1,5.0,"I liked the song and that's all I can say about it as, I didn't buy the whole CD just the one song. Funny song it always gives me a laugh when I listen to it."
A11P8ZZN2NRL27,B000V61688,1,1,4.0,"I was reminded of this song by someone who said it reminded them of me. I'm not saying it's a compliment, but I'm not saying it's that far off the mark some days either, lol. This is just a fun song, easy to sing along to and it puts you in a good mood."

A3JRW716H3AX14,B000V6162O,1,1,5.0,"This has a hard-driving, pumping beat that makes you want to get up and dance. It has a nice major interlude in the middle of the song that makes a nice contrast with the essentially minor tonalities of the song."
A1WHB4NGVJGFES,B000V6162O,1,1,5.0,I did not realize this was No Doubt and not Gwen Stefani on her own.  This song has some awesome beats.
A3BIV1X1K9R796,B000V61700,-1,-1,3.0,"I bought it because it was from Melissa Etheridge, but this song just didn't seem up to her usual standards when compared to other pieces she's done over the years; I don't necessarily regret buying it, but I find I don't listen to it very much compared to her other stuff."
A9SS08LPHP2GN,B000V61700,1,1,5.0,Her initial big hit album demonstrates her writing abilities and strong lyrics. Dynamic instrumentals rock you right along through the entire cd.

A2C79WG5VG0CPN,B000V61700,1,1,5.0,One of the best songs of the 90s in my opinion. Tt's a must have! Sounds great. Melissa at her best.
A3923W0OJNGUHN,B000V617LO,1,1,5.0,"With the range of his voice, and the songs he sings. He is a keeper.
I hope to find more on here. I will download them as time permits."
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000V617LO,1,1,4.0,"And very country.

I'm a fan of simple songs but there is not a country song by a male singer that I recall liking.

I guess this is the first. I'm not sure.

Not that it matters much, but I'm sure he's a Christian, speaking of ""Me and God"". Many country singers tend to be.

It's very simple and he even rhymes, ""Two peas in a pod"" with ""Me and God"", which could be considered a huge misstep.

But it was his reluctance to back down; a strong refusal to call God just a good friend, but his BEST. None other could get between the two, the sincerity he displayed in his words was what got me to stay and listen.

If my mom wasn't sleeping she might have looked at me a bit funny. But this song commanded my attention.

Let's just say that if someone told me to put this on my next mp3 player, I wouldn't hesitate just because it's that close to being a great song.

3.8 stars."
A1H10L6S9KZB2C,B000V617LO,1,1,5.0,"Josh Turner is one of my favorite singers--he reminds me a lot of Randy Travis, another favorite singer.  This is a wonderful song and having the older gentleman sing with him is really great!!!!.  I love this song!"

This particular version I am happy to say sounds even better than the one that I have on my old old cassette.

If you are a Stevie Wonder fan, this is one of his best songs and I highly recommend it. For me, when I play this peppy and happy song, I feel great and very grateful for my many blessings! What an uplifting song!

Highly recommend this song!"

That's the day with the shortest period of sunlight (in the northern hemisphere anyway).  So a bunch of yoga students get together and do all these active poses, right?  Well, you need to have a soundtrack.  What songs do you include in your playlist?  Well, what better tune for the darkest day of the year than Stevie Wonder's ""You Are the Sunshine of my Life"" ?

Play on, Stevie!"

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000V61B4M,1,1,5.0,"There is honestly a difference between a singer, and being a product. Unfortunately for divas these days like Rihanna and Beyonce', they have chosen to overexpose themselves and choose to be products, not people, and sadly the songs have became so overplayed, their voices have slowly passed away. For other divas, like Vanessa Williams, whom has been very sophisticated at the soul, and very True to her own heart, and strong at the voice, her songs have remained so timeless. Nearly 30 years after Vanessa Williams broke from scandal and heartbreak, after the Miss America Pageant, she found her own voice again through music and acting, and made herself a  worldwide staple as a diva that has never gone out of style. One of my favorite songs, her staple Saved The Best For Last, is actually one of those songs that has sincerely gotten much better with age, and the soulful melody aligned. I adore this song each time I hear it, and if you have never heard a Vanessa Williams song before, than I recommend you download this beauty.

Song: A"

A2WDGG3FIC9BKA,B000V62TQG,1,1,5.0,Fancy is one of my favorite songs ever.  It makes most of my playlists even though most of them are full of rock and blues songs.  I am not a big country fan anymore but I do have some at home still and her cds are next to the player always.
A2QD5PFT9WQUVV,B000V62TQG,1,1,5.0,Reba did a great job.  I think her version sounds better than the original.  She has a great voice and she shows it here. She made this song when MTV still showed videos on their channel and she did a great job in the video as well.

The many years have passed, all those ""hard core"" bands AND my peers that were so quick to judge, well, EVERYTHING, are now a bunch of has been's or losers. Now, every time I hear the song I like it a little bit more. Especially accompanying the Young Guns movies. The songs were just SO made for those vids. Now I have them on my MP3 mix. Bon Jovi has stood the test of time."

A26GW9GHWZJ0UY,B000V62YT8,1,1,5.0,A ballad of a lonely man seeking redemption from his past mistakes through the love he has for the woman on the other end of a payphone (back in the day there weren't cellphones; we had payphones on every street corner).  How can someone not relate to one or the other?  His band has a great sound and he sings well with a pleasant voice.

AZD8SMNGQI98O,B000V616DS,1,1,5.0,"Free Bird is for listening...like when you have an ice cold beer in your hand and your feet in a cool stream on a very hot day. It's also nice on a nippy evening when it's just a bit to chilly, but you sit on the porch anyhow...because Skynard is plying you with alternating rhythms and sweeping chords, managing to make a twang sound sweet. That hypnotic sound holds you in place...and you really didn't want to move anyhow, so it's a win-win situation.

High Double Thumbs UP for an oldie but still a danged good goodie.

Highly Recommended"

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button."

Sorry, I just couldn't help putting that in there. But seriously, we do get up every morning, face the sun (where ever it is at that moment) and we place our hands over our hearts and thank Lynyard Skynyard for giving us the Kentucky National Anthem. Seriously though, it's on my music device, and the device is set on shuffle, but somehow out of 300 plus, songs, Free Bird manages to play sometime every day. And when we gather around the table, we all grasp each other's hands and we are thankful for America. We are thankful for, Mom, Baseball, Football, NASCAR,and Apple pie. And we are thankful that ""That Bird Will Never Change.

For those of the band that perished in a plane crash: RIP..."

A1L1VZ854S2FB2,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5.0,"While basking with the success of the duet classic Jazz Samba, Stan Getz
  scored another blockbuster hit with this duet masterpiece which he made with
  Joao Gilberto in 1963 that became one of Bossa Nova's greatest moments as
  well as Getz' crowning achievement.  Hailed as one of the biggest-selling jazz
  albums of all time, Getz/Gilberto had bought two of the Bossa Nova's greatest
  innovators: guitarist- vocalist Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim, to New
  York City for the making of the wonderful recording as the album resulted with
  pure magic.  Starting with the international hit single The Girl From Impanema,
  the lyrical track set features solid hits, including Corcavado, So Danco Samba,
  O Grande Amore, a new version of Desfinado and Vivo Sonhando, which they
  performed with such unassailable beauty.  Astrud Gilberto, who had made her
  cameo appearance on the session, said that her husband Joao informed Getz
  that she ""could sing on the recording"", while producer Creed Taylor recall that
  it took Getz' wife Monica to bring both Astrud and Joao Gilberto into recording
  studio (Mrs. Getz had the sense that Astrud could make a hit while he himself
  insisted on Astrud's presence).  Highlighted by plenty of uncanny material it is
  no wonder that the album was a colossal success, as the musicians performs
  with effortless grace and honour, which even gave this crowning achievement
  it's universal immortality as Getz and Jobim pulled off the harmonic perfection
  in a relaxed charm of it's own.  As the part of the Verve Master Edition Series,
  Getz/Gilberto will certainly ring out even more brighter as a timeless landmark
  from jazz history in greater form."
A3N8Q1PMJZJUI6,B000V619US,1,1,5.0,"No words can fully describe the power this song possesses. One of Skynyrd's greatest rockers the classic Cale song goes to another level in Skynyrd's version. Billy's piano solo, Ronnie's vocals and the blazing guitars soar over Leon and Bob's rhythmic, thumping, y roll. Some band's songs never grow old, this is one of those."

A1Z2HOY56LNIQA,B000V619US,1,1,5.0,"""Call Me The Breeze"" is more than a great rock song from one of Rocks great bands, Lynyrd Skynyrd. Good song to add to my list of music on my Kindle 7' HD. Sound is first rate always and this sound great."
A2TC5QDBYCJITD,B000V63C4Y,1,1,4.0,"Classic album.  If you love it then you'll definitely want to pick it up if you have SACD capability - excellent sound.  I don't love everything on the album, it's OK if you're in the mood but I do adore The Girl From Ipanema.  If you love the song then actually this is could be worth checking out if you can get it cheap.  Its never sounded better - awesome.  Album & 45 version!  Have fun!"
A3KUC5K5VSJNU9,B000V62TO8,1,1,5.0,"What the title says.  Also, a great love song according to the ladies at Glamour magazine online, great instrumentation, vocal and 10 cents off and 37 seconds longer than the LP version.  What's not to like?  Go ladies!"

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5.0,"This 1963 album is one of the best examples of flawless bossa nova music to date. Stan Getz playing the saxophone, Joao Gilberto on guitar and Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano blend simultaneously into a uniquely talented trio of musicians as their hearts and minds create one exquisite song after another.

As another reviewer correctly notes, most of the songs on this CD were written by Antonio Carlos Jobim. He remains one of the most gifted musicians and composers to this day. I also especially liked Astrud Gilberto's singing in ""The Girl From Ipanema"" and ""Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars)."" Yes, Astrud sometimes sang flat; but it is no matter here. It works beautifully to have her singing along with the music.

Another plus about this CD is the addition of two tracks that were not available on the original LP release: the 45 rpm issues of ""The Girl From Ipanema"" and ""Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars.)"" I really liked comparing the shorter 45 rpm versions to the original, longer versions of both songs.

The sound quality was very good but not quite perfect. There is a slight hissing in the background especially when I hear the saxophone being played solo by Getz. I looked in the liner notes and they do mention that there was some ""tape delamination"" on track five (""Corcovado"") and that ""some of the master takes have been faded longer or later than they were on the original LP issue."" I wonder if this had anything to do with what I heard. In addition, the liner notes also offer a great essay by Doug Ramsey as well as the original liner notes for the LP. There are beautiful photos of Getz, Gilberto and Astrud.

This is a wonderful album to relax with or to play while you entertain company for dinner. The experience is sophisticated stylishness! The fact that most of the lyrics are in Portuguese is not a concern for those who do not understand the language; the music is so beautiful and the lyrics are so poetic anyway that the overall listening experience is memorable. Not only is this music timeless, it is so well performed with each and every subtle nuance that it possesses a universal appeal decades after its' release.

Highly recommended for bossa nova fans, fans of great Latin music and people who crave international music."
A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B000V63C4Y,1,1,4.0,"This mini-lp sleeve version of this Jazz classic is the best version that's out there at the moment.  The remastering job is quite good and so the sound quality is decent.  We also get both the English and Japanese lyrics thrown in as an insert.  The cardboard packaging which is a replica of the original vinyl sleeve is also a work of art.  While the strength of ""Girl From Ipanema"" alone would carry this album, we also get ""So Danco Samba"" and a version of ""Desafinado"" here which is good but not as great as the brilliant version with that unforgetable Getz solo on the ""Jazz Samba"" album which although not as commercially successful as this album, is still overall the stronger album.  Still, there is no denying the great impact this album has had on jazz and on bringing the whole samba genre onto the world map that this is still essential listening for fans of jazz and indeed for any fan of music in general.  Recommended."
A8IFUOL8S9BZC,B000V63C4Y,1,1,4.0,"This essential bossa nova  masterwork everyone agrees on in a historical context does miss perfection. Despite the commanding songwriting and singing, this newfound vocabulary of sexy chord changes does slightly replay itself throughout the short disc making for parallel melodies throughout, along with the sumptuous, at times slightly awkward vocal phrasings. This is not to negate the fact that this album is a complete triumph of aesthetics, overpowering any specific gripes with it's liquid smooth tranquility."
A1J4612EOYDEKQ,B000V62XV2,1,1,5.0,"Steely Dan.....One of my all time favorites!  Great music, great listening...that's all there is to it!"

A2TQIY0R7FBMQP,B000V64KJU,1,1,5.0,"One of their best!  It was first introduced to me on ""Northern Exposure"", and since then, I have waited to hear it on my oldies stations, and bought the CD.  When I was able to download just the song for my Kindle, I was so happy!!  I listen to it often, and it always brings back great memories!!"
A2VOVZMI83Y7L6,B000V64KJU,1,1,4.0,"A good song from the LS songbook.  Like the subject matter and the tongue in cheek lyric line.  Guys, we can all relate to this situation."
A19YNFIAO5KHGP,B000V64KJU,-1,1,4.0,I rate the stars on the originality of the recording. Many times it is not the original release of the record.
A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5.0,"I'm sorry, friends, after twenty years of listening, buying hundreds of CD's and an improved stereo I now know CD's don't have enough bits. They don't capture all the sound that was in the original vinyl recordings. 44k and 2 to the 14th power was NOT enough samples (bits). Like looking at an old newspaper picture made out of large dots, it's not like a photo. Like a primitive digital print without enough pixels. Poor resolution.

With 4 times as many time slices (increments) in the x direction and 2 to the 8th power, 256 more bits (increments) in the Y direction, this SACD is the only format which really captures the sound of the original LP or master tape. You cannot hear the difference between this and the LP. It's the real thing.

If you thought CD's sound harsh, or bass-thin, not like a concert, well, you were right!

Beyond that, this album is the second best selling Jazz album of all time, behind Miles Davis ""Kind of Blue"". A timeless classic of the early sixties. ""The Girl From Ipanema"" was in the top ten songs on the Rock, Pop and Jazz Billboard charts for over a year in the '63-'64 time frame.

Yeah it's really that good!

 Hear Stan the Man effortlessly pour out his soul in the bridge of ""Corcovado"", for example. As a personal note, this was the first Jazz LP I ever bought, as a clarinet and sax player myself, I couldn't believe how good Stan Getz tone was. And I still love it."
ASU3NPI7FLQBA,B000V64KJU,1,1,5.0,"I love this song, and I especially love this band. I will be listening to this song quite a bit!"

ALOM851LIP51M,B000V62XV2,-1,1,5.0,Sure do miss the music of the 70's and 80's. No static at all. A+ song
A1DRPQLK11GSAH,B000V62XV2,1,1,5.0,Awesome
A2BH945DHGH5J7,B000V62XV2,1,1,5.0,In my opinion this is one of those songs that really gives a definitive name to the entire time period between 1970 and 1990 when just about everybody had either a transistor radio or a portable stereo.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for music from the 1970s/1980s!!!.
A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5.0,"The 1964 winner for Best Album was this mellow but spright cool jazz album that pushed Latin bossa nova and samba rhythms on the map.  With a lineup that included Joao Gilberto on guitar and vocals, Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano, Tommy Williams on bass, Milton Banana on drums, and on the two most memorable songs, Joao's wife Astrud.  However, the driving force behind this was tenor saxophonist Stan Getz, and his straight-tone, controlled-vibrato sound.
The album starts appropriately enough with the Grammy winner for best song, ""The Girl From Ipanema"".  This is the full 5:22 version that begins with Joao Gilberto singing in Portuguese.  Then comes that soft voice and those familiar lyrics:  ""Tall and tan and young and lonely/The girl from Ipanema goes walking/And when she passes/Each one she passes goes haaa.""  Well, the thing that makes me go ""haaa"" here is Astrud Gilberto's voice.  Getz's sax solo and Jobim's piano in the middle serves as a bridge between the two refrains.  There is a 45 rpm version of this classic, the 2:46 single edit of just Astrud singing, included later.  I must confess that I first heard a parody of this song, Bob River's ""The Girl With Emphysema"", and then sought hard to find out the original version, which led me to this album.
""Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)"" is the other song featuring Astrud Gilberto.  In the full 4:14 version, we have Joao doing Portuguese lyrics, as he did in the full version of ""Ipanema.""  There is a dreamy quality about this song, particularly when Astrud sings ""Quiet nights and quiet dreams/Quiet walks by quiet streams/And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea how lovely.""  And Getz's sax really enhances that exoticness as does Jobim's piano.  BTW, Corcovado is the name of a mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro.  There is a 2:21 45 rpm issue included here as well.
As for the rest of the songs, Getz's rich saxophone provides the rich qualities that make this a winner, particularly his solo on ""So Danso Samba"" with its ""vai vai vai vai vai"" refrain by Joao Gilberto.  The song title means ""I Only Dance Samba"", as opposed to calypso, the twist, and the cha-cha that were sweeping the country's dance floors in the 1960's.  And Joao Gilberto's soft vocals complement the soft qualities of the other instrumentalists.  Only complaint:  Astrud should've been featured on more songs."
A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5.0,"These songs knocked everyone off their feet when they debuted at what seemed to be the end of the Bossa Nova craze --in the cool-post-Beatnik 60's cocktail era. But actually, in Brazil, the Bossa Nova fever never did quite cool off and in '72, when I was visiting family there, this album was still trotted out proudly at every gathering.
Not only is this album a great party CD for ""retro"" parties, relaxed evenings or just sitting at home and relaxing, but it introduces you to the greats of Brazilian music. Oh, there is a whole lot more great Brazilian music than just this, but this album is surely the place to start.  (By the way, if you have insomnia, this can be quite soothing. Lie back on that imaginary beach in Rio and float away on Gilberto's soft voice. Mmmmmmm....)"
A2BO41VARYGTAC,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5.0,"What else can I add about such a wonderful album? I have never before heard such relaxing, gorgeous music. Nothing is forced, everything just flows along so naturally. This was my first introduction to Bossa Nova and Brazilian music in general. And I adore it. Joao's voice is to die for, and the wonderfully controlled, relaxed playing of Stan Getz is terrific. Add to that the rythmn section of Jobim on piano, Milton Banana on drums and Tommy Williams on bass, and you have an album that will go down in history, and will never wear thin. And of course I mustn't forget to mention the pretty voice of Astrud. I wish and hope that everyone will have the chance to listen to this album at least once in their life, but of course, once you have you will want to hear it always. A must have!!"
A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B000V63C4Y,1,1,5.0,"My all-time favorite jazz recording. 10 stars!! The best introduction to jazz, Cool Jazz, Samba, and Bossa Nova. Stan Getz makes each note sound beautiful, and three-dimensional, as if it were sculpted in blue velvet fog. Stan sounds less as if he was playing the sax than breathing the notes out from his soul. His contemporaries called him ""The Sound"".
Joao Gilberto sings and wife Astrud sings with a rather small voice. Intimate and romantic. For more Stan and less singing, ""Jazz Samba"" is similar but all instrumental.
Technical note: The recorded this record at 30ips tape speed when the industry standard was 15ips. Spectacularly well recorded, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday, not 35 years ago, on the new VERVE 20 bit version ONLY. Try listening on a Single Ended Triode Amp for the ultimate!"

A3FQ9WYUHG9CD,B000V64SZG,1,1,5.0,"Here's rock 'n' roll for you. An Irish band formed in Dublin and fronted by an Irish black man in
shiny leather pants. The members of the band also spanned the Irish Catholic and Protestant
communities. Quite something for 1969.

The song ""Jailbreak"", was an international hit, along with ""The Boys Are Back In Town"". These
songs are rotated regularly on hard rock and classic radio stations today and for good reason.

""Jailbreak"", features, like a lot of other of Thin Lizzy's songs, twin lead guitars. Superb guitar
work from both guitarists and a signature of the band giving Thin Lizzy a distinctive edge over
other bands. ""Jailbreak"" was on the album by the same name, and was their sixth release.

""Jailbreak"" lyrics speak for themselves. Working class sentimentality and total brazenness is
how this song will speak to you. This was another element of the the band's personality. There
is no doubt that when you hear that opening chord and subsequent riff you are hearing some
cool rockin' and rollin'.  The lyric riff is rather staccato and helps provide an immediate tension
within the song.

The release comes from the repetitive refrain, ""The boys are back in town"", as it is more fluid
and harmonic. There is a nice back and forth motion between the lyrics and the refrain each
time. The guitar fills and single leads are done perfectly as they accent each set of lyrics and
help transition from the refrain back to the lyric. This is a nicely written song.

Listening to this song always makes me want to learn it. It is also the kind of song that inspires
people to pick up the guitar or at the least play air guitar. Sustain. Great tone. Twin leads.
Cool lyrics. All make for a classic song that belongs on your turntable, or CD player, or whatever.

Put ""Jailbreak"" into your rotation and take a listen. Go ahead, break out now..."
A2PHD302P9URL7,B000V64SZG,1,1,5.0,A classic from back in the day. It's got a good beat and you can to it. I give it a 99.

A1VE933MFXTG18,B000V64UXQ,1,1,5.0,I just love listening to all these older songs. They really do bring back so many memories. Memory lane as they say. Some songs really bring you back to certain times of your life. Sometimes I remember things that I had forgotten. It is just great to listen and relax and enjoy. I love that I have my music on Amazon so I have them every where I go that I can excess my Amazon. I listen often often on my laptop when I travel and stay in hotel. I love that I can never lose them or scratch them. Will have them for ever when you buy mp3 from Amazon.

This is not a live version, it is a studio recording most commonly heard. I have never had a problem with sound quality when buying from Amazon. I bought this MP3 a while ago but it needed to be reviewed because it is that cool."

A1E9VR36A4EWBF,B000V64V6W,-1,1,5.0,"I don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.

But youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.

I guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs."
A6WSPBL9IY5CB,B000V64V6W,1,1,5.0,"I liked the song and that's all I can say about it as, I didn't buy the whole CD just the one song."
A3ARWXNPHVQP1B,B000V64V6W,1,1,5.0,I had a friend who played this song as her last song at the wedding. It was actually perfect. The song is also just fun to listen to on a regular basis too.

I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own."

A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000V63C7G,1,1,5.0,"The posthumous DECCA label LP, PATSY CLINE 12 GREATEST HITS was the #1 best-selling country music album until the 1990s.

All tracks are AAD stereo dubs, including ""Walkin' After Midnight,"" a remake of her 1957 hit. The six panel insert provides a bio, editorial, chronology, Cline MCA album catalog and complete session personnel for all tracks.

Patsy not only was the first woman to ever ""close"" various artist concerts and Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, she was also one of the earliest country stars to cross over into mainstream pop. With classy touches of strings, echo and backing vocals by the Jordanaires (and others), these dozen Owen Bradley produced sides stand the test of time. The music of Pasty Cline will simply never go out of style! Highest recommendation.

AQ4B80F0JSBNI,B000V63C7G,1,-1,3.0,"Well, yes. And I don't apologize. Don't get me wrong, I love Patsy Cline as much as anyone among the many 4- and 5-star reviewers so far, and I really regret breaking the string of assessments. But the fact is, there are many, many more superior compilations available now than this MCA release from 1988 which re-issues an earlier vinyl LP produced by Owen Bradley.

For a few dollars more you can pick up one which has all 19 of her Country hit singles registered between 1957 and 1982, the last ten posthumously following her death in that March 1963 plane crash.

Also, like far too many of the early compilations, they chose NOT to give us the original version of her first hit for Decca in 1957, Walkin' After Midnight. That version went for 2:30 and reached # 2 Country/# 12 Billboard Pop Top 100 in May. What they give you here was a re-recording done in August 1961, shorter by almost 30 seconds and performed at a slightly faster tempo.

The rest are all originals although, technically, tracks 7, 10, and 11 were not among her ""12 greatest hits"" which is, after all, the title of this album. Back In Baby's Arms was the uncharted B-side of Sweet Dreams (Of You), Why Can't He Be You? was the uncharted flip of Heartaches which, not included here, made it to # 73 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in 1962 (but failed to make the Country charts - go figure), and You're Stronger Than Me was the uncharted flip of So Wrong in 1962.

In addition to Heartaches, legitimate hits left off this volume were the B-side to Walkin' After Midnight - A Poor Man's Roses, Or A Rich Man's Gold [# 14 Country] - the double-sided 1962 hit When I Get Thru (You'll Love Me Too)/Imagine That which reached # 10 Country/# 53 Hot 100 and # 21 Country/# 90 Hot 100 respectively, When You Need A Laugh [# 47 Country in 1964], and He Called Me Baby [# 23 Country in December 1964 and her first immediate posthumous hit].

In 1969 her rendition of the old Eddy Arnold hit, Anytime, reached # 73 Country, followed nine years later by Life's Railway To Heaven which topped out at # 98. Two years after that, in 1980, a release of her cut of the old standard Always went all the way to # 18, followed in December by a re-mix of I Fall To Pieces [# 61]. In late 1981 her duet with Jim Reeves on Have You Ever Been Lonely (Have You Ever Been Blue?] soared all the way to # 5, and in 1982 yet another version of I Fall To Pieces, this time dubbing her voice with that of Jim Reeves, was a # 54.

With the insert you do get two pages of background notes written by Jay Orr and Don Roy, a chronology of Patsy's all-too-brief life, and a list of session personnel involved on each of the 12 tracks. But while these features and the AAD sound reproduction makes this a nice, inexpensive, sampling of Patsy, MCA can easily turn it into a 5-star offering by simply following the lead of others who re-released earlier 10- and 12-track CDs [Elvis, Donovan, Sarah Vaughan as examples] with bonus tracks."
A1DH42FV47N8L,B000V63C7G,1,1,5.0,"I was first intoduced to Ms. Cline by an old girlfriend, Karen.  She used to love to sing ""Crazy.""

  Although she could do it serious justice, when I heard Patsy embrace that song, I was blown away!

  That's why I bought this CD...I needed more.

  ""Walking After Midnight"" is a classic.  You feel like you are there with her as she croons desperately about her guy.  ""I Fall To Pieces"", ""She's Got You"", ""Back In Baby's Arms""... Heck this entire collection is a must have.

  Country fan or not, this CD belongs in any music lover's collection.

  Karen died a few years ago of a brain tumor, but I can believe she's up in heaven singing ""Crazy"" with Patsy."
AYOO12C9Y2T95,B000V63C7G,1,-1,3.0,"I won't quibble with what's here songwise....it's a pretty good set of Patsy's music. All but 2 of her Top 10 country hits are here (no ""When I Get Through with You"" or the pasted together duet ""Have You Ever Been Lonely?"" with Jim Reeves.) In all, 7 of these are top 10 hits from the country charts.

Soundwise, I'm sure it was fine at the time of release. However, since then, advances in CD technology have made it possible both to fit more songs on a disc (up to 80 minutes) and remastering improvements have made the sound quality you can achieve, even on ""vintage"" recordings, much better.

BOTTOM LINE:
For these reasons, I'd argue that your best choice if you want only ONE disc of Patsy's music is THE DEFININITVE PATSY CLINE (ASIN B000002X0P). But if you know you can't spend much money, the used price can't be beat."
A2PT2TLABB7BG1,B000V64Y5K,1,1,5.0,"I really enjoyed this song, one of the three best songs on the album ""Slippery When Wet""."

A2MVZS39F3XKH3,B000V63C7G,1,1,5.0,"If you want the basics as it concerns Patsy Cline, the big hits are all here in glorious sound in songs for the most part written by prolific country writers, sung with heart and emotion and orchestrated in a way that thrills.  I remember the day Patsy died in that crash (country great Jim Reeves met the same fate the following year).  There has always been a sense of loss but she laid down some great tracks before she died. The best of them are right here for your purchase and pleasure.  You can take that to the bank. For a lengthier selection, try ""Definitive Collection""."
AADJXNY9HSKJF,B000V63C7G,1,1,5.0,"I remember being a little kid *granted this wasn't too long ago* and my parents having a Patsy Cline tape they used to listen to in the car. I fell in love with Patsy's voice and her gorgeous songs. Now, I've never been a country fan, but Patsy is the one big exception. There is no genre to her voice. It's practically perfection. I rank her right up there with powerhouses such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. This CD offers some of her best material. Of course, most notably ""Crazy."" Everyone knows it. Also, ""I Fall To Pieces"" *my personal favorite*, ""Sweet Dreams of You"", and ""Strange."" Another stand-out has to be ""She's Got You."" It's a gorgeous ballad and perhaps one of Patsy's most memorable songs. This is a must buy for any music fan. Patsy Cline is truly timeless."
AHUT55E980RDR,B000V63C7G,1,1,5.0,"Twenty six reviews, all five stars!  And I'll make it Twenty seven!  Patsy Cline is one of the all time greats, with the ability to express a voice that came from deep within, from her heart, from her soul.  She still lives today through the legacy of her recordings and also through her influence on so many country ladies including Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire, LeeAnne Womack, k.d. lang, Mandy Barnett, and Sara Evans.
But don't forget the others on these performances who contributed so much.  There are the Jordonaires (who called her a female Elvis?...well, she did have the vocal group backing her who backed many of Elvis' greatest hits) on all of the cuts; Harold Bradley's electric bass also on all of these performances; Floyd Cramer's piano on ""Walkin' After Midnight"", ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Crazy"", ""So Wrong"", ""Strange"", ""She's Got You"", and ""Faded Love""; Walter Haines' steel guitar on ""Walkin' After Midnight"", ""Crazy"", ""Strange"", ""She's Got You"", and ""You're Stronger Than Me"".  And then there are the writers of the songs that she breathed life and emotion into:  Hank Cochran's ""I Fall to Pieces"", ""She's Got You"", ""Why Can't He Be You"", and ""You're Stronger Than Me,""; Don Gibson's ""Sweet Dreams""; Willie Nelson's ""Crazy""; Carl Perkins' ""So Wrong""; Mel Tillis' ""Strange""; Bob Wills' ""Faded Love.""
All these talents together, backing a great voice of our times, have contributed one of music's greatest treasures to us, and we should be grateful to all those I mentioned and those I haven't."
A1906RZITWT2K2,B000V63C7G,1,1,5.0,"This may be the best Greatest Hits/Best Of compilation ever. Cline knew how to sing a tune, and she knew how to make singles that grab you by your collar and don't let you get away.
These are songs you hear off a juke box in a diner at 2 a.m. and you suddenly understand. A cigarette, a cup of coffee, maybe some fries with brown gravy, and ""She's Got You."" It's something you can't recreate.
And what a voice. I've heard, in recent years, people calling Wynonna Judd ""the female Elvis."" Wynonna does have a magnificent voice, but talk about having no memory--Patsy Cline was as close as there's ever been to a female Elvis. She was masterful."
A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B000V63C7G,1,1,5.0,"This essential country music album is a triumph for all who participated in its success:  producer Owen Bradley (whose lush, tasteful written strings pour sorrow on ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Why Can't He Be  You"") pianist Floyd Cramer and a first-class Nashville session band  (whose piano introductions to ""Crazy,"" ""She's Got You,""  and ""I Fall To Pieces"" are among the most treasured in music),  and, of course, Patsy Cline herself.
Many have attempted to copy Patsy  Cline's vocal range or stylistic ticks; Reba McEntire, k.d. lang and Mandy  Barnett being only among the more successful. But something about ballads  brought out the pain and emotional desolation in Cline's voice that few  C&W singers then or now could match. Listen to her sing the rather  trite line ""I've been so wrong for so long,"" and hear the sorrow,  anger and regret scribbled into her delivery. Hear her line, ""You  don't love me, it's plain,"" and tears nearly well up as if you're  hearing this with her for the first time. Compare her reading of the line,  ""I've got your memory, or has it got me?"" with Jimmy Buffett's  sloppy, careless version on ""Fruitcakes,"" and you'll see who is  the better musical caretaker.
Nearly every song on the LP fits that  model, as Cline and her stellar support keep the spirit, if not letter, of  what country music is and should be to its fans. Everyone who enjoys  country music or female singers in general should own a copy of this album."
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000V64LIA,-1,1,4.0,"Let me start by saying that this is a great song, and I actually like what Timbaland did with the it, and actually prefer this version to the original. However, why did Timbaland give OneRepublic (the band that made the song), a ""featured"" spot. The guy just remixed the song, and added his voice to the background. Is that deserving of taking credit for you making the song? No. I mean, I'm not the biggest Timbaland fan mind you, I like ""The Way I Are,"" but really, this is an undue cheapshot. But, if he hadn't done this, then OneRepublic probably would have taken forever to put out their stunning debut, so in a way, it's actually a good thing. Still bad, but good came out of it.

Overall, the song is still pretty great, and it deserved to be #1. But support OneRepublic and go buy their album, ""Dreaming Out Loud."" It's a great CD that has this song, and the original, and enough other stuff to please most everybody."

ACPPRYMDKYFSH,B000V64LIA,1,1,5.0,"This is a fairly laid back song which focuses less on talent with an instrument, though Ryan Tedder plays the piano quite well, and more on showcasing the vocal talents of Tedder himself. As to Timbaland's role, he helped this song gain popularity by remixing the original OneRepublic song with a fantastic beat and providing some background vocal support. Timbaland also added his own notoriety to help push OneRepublic's song into the limelight be re-releasing the song as a remix on his own album."

A2DJYERRIH5C8T,B000V6577O,1,-1,3.0,"This was Sugarland's first cd.  When they were a trio.  There first single Baby Girl.  I wan't too crazy about.  But their second  Something More which kicks off the cd.  Was the reason why I went ahead and bought this cd.  A good uptempo song.  With lyrics that I think everyone can relate to at one time or another in their lives.  Just Might, and Down In Mississippi were also hits.  From the first time you listen to this cd.  You knew they were going to be big.  And losing a member didn't slow them down at all.  Hello, Fly Away, Small Town Jericho and Speed Of Life are all done very well.  After this I haven't bought all of Sugarland's cds.  I have a couple of others.  They are all good.  And I don't know if they are ever going to get back together.  I'ved heard there was some talk about it.  And I don't know if they could just pick up where they left off if they did.  But I am really surprised after all their success.  That there hasn't been a Greatest Hits released."

A39O0G68QQZ126,B000V6577O,1,1,5.0,One more time Sugarland has done it again. I am a late comer to their music and I recommend all of their albums with this one at the top.
A1O7Q969VFF8QA,B000V6577O,1,1,5.0,"First off, I don't really like Kristen Hall. But Jennifer and Kristian i love yet! This cd is full of talent and awesome songwriting. I dont't really like Jen's vocals but the songs are amazing. I have to admit, when I first heard this album, I didn't really like it. I wasn't sure what to expect. But that's what has happened with all of their albums. I love ""Fly Away."" It's my favorite! The ratings are below:
1. Something More- 4/5 Great song, True lyrics. What more can I say?
2. Baby Girl- 5/5 Great lyrics, amazing song.
3. Hello- 5/5 Love this one.
4. Tennessee- 5/5 This one is great to.
5. Just Might (Make Me Believe)- 5/5 Great lyrics, beautiful song.
6. Down in Mississippi (Up to no good)- 3/5 Not really my type, but ok.
7. Fly Away- 5/5 My favorite one!
8. Speed Of Life- 5/5 Love this one
9. Small Town Jericho- 5/5 this one has great lyrics and a great tune.
10. Time, time, time- 4/5 Pretty good, its also very True.
11. Stand Back Up- 4/5 good song with positive lyrics.

Like I said, it's a great cd."
A3PEZQQ3I0B036,B000V66IVS,1,1,5.0,I bought this with the idea of getting a distorted sound. I was shocked to hear the quality digital perfection. Quality Sound!!!
A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000V6577O,1,1,5.0,"Usually, I don't listen to Country music, but I made the exception when I saw these guys on the Grammy's.  They are fantastic and I not only love Jennifer Nettles voice, but the music is so catchy and fun and great.

Fly Away, Something More, Just Might (Make Me Believe) and Stand Back Up are my favourites, but then they are all good songs and I'm surprised about how much I love this since I'm really mainly into R&B and Hip Hop.  These guys are talented and write such great songs.  They also performed on Las Vegas and look like they are having fun on stage.  They sound fresh and I have really taken to this group and this cd.  I hope they keep releasing music like this.  They might just convert me yet.  I love it.  Even if you aren't a Country fan, you too might surprise yourself.  Give this a try."
A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO,B000V6577O,1,1,5.0,"Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful, & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, & all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific."

A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000V6577O,1,1,4.0,"Jennifer Nettles, Kristen Hall, and Kristian Bush are ""Sugarland,"" and this debut album by the trio is a solid beginning to their career as such.  However, all three of them have had careers long before this.  Nettles fronted her own band.  Hall gained respect for her writing skills and Bush was part of Billy Pilgrim.  As of this writing, Hall has already departed from the trio.  Who knows what that will lead to in the future.

As for this disc, Sugarland knows how to craft music that is rather appealing to a mass audience.  They meld traditional country, folk rock and pop to make a sound that fits comfortably somewhere between Kenny Chesney's fluff and Allison Krause's commercial bluegrass.  The first three singles from this album, ""Baby Girl,"" ""Something More,"" and ""Just Might(Make Me Believe)"" ring True of contemporary pop country, but songs like the title track and ""Small Town Jericho"" show that this group does have a little more weight to them than most johnny-come-lately's.

The only song that I have a problem with is ""Down In Mississippi.""  It's an attempt at a barn-burner that wants to sound like Southern rock but fails to satisfy.  Nettles' voice comes across as forced, and the song just feels out of place from the rest of the album.  If this trio has any shortcomings, it's that their sound is too tight to sound tough.

Give this album a chance if you enjoy female vocalists or tight harmonies in the Diamond Rio vein.  Also, if you're a fan of commercially cranked out country like Rascal Flatts, this album has plenty of that too."

A18IK6YI6T3RK2,B000V6577O,1,1,4.0,"Wow, can Jennifer Nettles voice soar!  I'm really not a fan of the country music genre, but this c.d. is amazing.  I like the passion Ms. Nettles brings to the music.  I knew nothing about Sugarland until I saw them perform ""Something More"" on an awards show and they brought the house down.  Jennifer Nettles has such strong stage presence and she can really work a crowd.  I then listened to the c.d. and was surprised at how strong it was from start to finish, really a complete c.d.  I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates really good music, even if you, like me, are not normally into this type of music, give it a try, I'll bet you'll like it."

AIYB8FUXTF365,B000V6577O,1,1,5.0,"This is an excellent CD that is sticking in my CD player. They have good vocals and every song is well done. ""Baby Girl"" is one of my favorites and is going up the chart. All the rest are worth a listen, especially Something More & Twice the Speed of Life. I hope they continue to have success."
A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000V6577O,-1,-1,3.0,"The Top 10 single, ""Baby Girl,"" is really super-catchy, but if you listen to the whole album, which is mercilessly packed full of tightly-crafted rock-tinged pop hooks, you might find their sound gets kind of monotonous and exhausting after a while.  In particular, Jennifer Nettle's phony, exaggerated twang gets pretty irritating after about four or five songs... But as a singles-based band aiming at radio airplay, these folks'll do just fine."
ASJI0CJJYJN38,B000V66LEC,1,1,5.0,"My husband loves the oldies. He just got an MP3 player and wanted to use it.  His nick-name is Old-School, so that should tell you something. Good music is timeless."

A1DOQF1JL48V4X,B000V66LEC,1,1,5.0,"Fantastic protest song!  Marvin sings about the Vietnam War, picket lines and  police brutality. It amazes me that people think this is a romantic song, that's beyond me."

A1GR2QPCD08COG,B000V64PJK,1,-1,1.0,"I bought this to compare to Fergie's ""London Bridge"". According to my husband, this song has been around for ever (I just never heard it--I must have been living under a rock). I like gwen stefani, I find that she has an interesting vocal range that a lot of her contemporaries do not (ie Fergie, Pink). She has a distinct voice and I really like that. But this song is so high school football that it makes me shudder."

A1JMAIIZG6G4CC,B000V66K3Y,1,1,5.0,"If you are thinking about buying anything from Les, then you sure don't need my review. Les sings about liking his wine and taking matters into his own hands with an aluminum baseball bat. Completely San Francisco craziness. I saw Primus open for RHCP at the Boarding House many years ago... I had a hard time determining if they had started the show yet. I love these guys. Completely out of the box band."
A22ZTTVSPON259,B000V66K3Y,1,1,5.0,I like this song as well as the video made by Primus in the 90's. I like the grungy sound & backwoods type mentality to the song and video. Very creative and humorus if you ask me. A little creepy too.. LOL.:)
A3PRJ4B5BBCNNN,B000V66S6I,1,1,5.0,Excellent product

A3837D2JE16VV4,B000V66RF0,1,1,5.0,"Great song. Great instrumentals. Everyone latches onto the inspiring lyric, ""Gonna keep on trying, 'til I reach the higher ground."" But the rest of the lyrics are just as deep and will keep you reaching for its meaning every time you play it."
A3PF3AVPWB4LHP,B000V66RF0,1,1,5.0,It's awesome!  It's great to listen to when you are walking and excercing.  Stevie Wonder is one of my favorite singers.

A3LOOSHZEW2HIL,B000V66HBO,1,1,5.0,This is a classic No Doubt song and you can't help but love it! It makes you want to rock out and scream that your just a girl.
ARIFBHZ4F4MKJ,B000V66HBO,1,1,4.0,"Love this song because it reminds me of how sometimes men view women as ""just a girl"" and not as the talent they are."
AWQ0342H9RASL,B000V66MM8,1,1,5.0,This song has a strange addiction to it. In one of the worst career changes I have ever made this song really stuck with me. It was in the summer I fell in love with this song and as to why is beyond me. I really don't care much for Gwen Stefani or even this sound but there is a really cool vibe to it. It's .99 and worth more to me. Just check it out.
A3R4794K2RVU1S,B000V66MM8,1,1,5.0,"Back with the good old days! Nostalgic, bittersweet, and uplifting all at the same time. It resonates deeply with me because of a relationship I once had and I'm fortunate to say that that friend is still one of my good friends. I would bet many others could say the same.

Rejoice my friends, friendships don't always work out. But the ones that do, they're keepers and should be much appreciated."

A39H5ZCKFUMO2K,B000V66LII,1,1,5.0,"Marvin Gaye right before the eyes of his millions of fans and as a Mo Town icon transmogrified between originally gospel to Rhythm and Blues to a crusader for political and environmental of causes, wearing a knitted beret. He was a marvelous vocalist and today in the 21 century greatly and fervently admired for his vast body of musical excellence in his work. I buy his MP3's today right here on Amazon, his display as a recording artist is my buying motivation.

A2E9WEUSA7G470,B000V66URU,1,1,4.0,"Some songs just never get old and Bon Jovi's ""Livin' on a Prayer"" is one of them. Certainly this may not be Bon Jovi's greatest hit, but he still performs at a high level in this song. For the casual rock fan or the Bon Jovi fan, this is a must add song to the collection. As the song is fading out, I rarely let it go out completely before hitting repeat. The sample that is on Amazon doesn't quite do the song justice, but it is worth the purchase."

It's such a Great High Energy Bon Jovi song. It's really good for getting you pumped up to do cardio or weight lifting. It's hard to be in a bad mood when it's on! It just makes me want to get stuff done! One of my favorites from them!!!

Always a plus!"
A3HXWRUUMFDTQT,B000V66Z3Y,1,1,5.0,I have always loved Bon Jovi and this song is one of their first hits. Runaway reminds me of my best friends and the wonderful times we had together singing it. I love this song!

This particular song is one that crawls into hour heart and soul and you'll never forget it if you haven't heard it.

In Bon Jovi's defense...there are plenty of these noise makers whom someone gave a guitar, taught 'em two chords  and they become a public nuisence! This song is the exception!!!"

A11F8B8GQURI84,B000V66URU,1,1,5.0,"Livin' On A Prayer is one of three songs by Bon Jovi that I heard back in the 1980's and still like today. I am not a big fan of heavy metal music, but I do like this song. There are no screaming guitars in this song nor are there any heavy drum beats. This is an upbeat song that is still easy on my ears.

No one else can do their songs like they can. When someone watches they perform they look like they enjoy what they are doing, not like they're just on stage to get the job done & then split. These guys are real pros."

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000V66YS0,1,-1,3.0,"This is another song I like from Steely Dan, it isn't as good a Do It Again; but it holds it own.  It is still a good song but if your expecting something along the lines like Do It Again you will be disappointed. It is more of a pop song, a little mello, so if you are only into rock it might not be for you. I like it; but I also like pop, rock, rap, some Country. So I would recommend you listen to the sample on Amazon first. It might be a song you like, but I always say test the waters before you take the plunge.

A30KL8L2ILYTU0,B000V672Y0,1,1,5.0,yes sir
AR2T18R3NNUT9,B000V672Y0,1,1,5.0,"Flash backs! This is Roberts great work of funky, blues with R&B."
A3U3PA6J2XOVFK,B000V672Y0,1,1,5.0,"Yes, oh yes, this was a great album of songs; funky and soulful, gritty and bluesy, and also quite poppy and tuneful in parts. Some definite candidates for Top 40 hits, and some groove-laden tracks where Robert and his musician buddies (if you don't know the names by now, look 'em up; it's an all-star cast) stretch out and get down with it. How much fun? A lot! Hard to believe that this was the same guy who later got slick for MTV and his chorus line of models. But this album, and a few more that came after it, show what a fine singer and interpreter of songs that he was."
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000V672Y0,1,1,5.0,"During the mid to late 70's Robert Palmer was far from the household name he became during the mid 80's. At the same time at this point in the 70's one of the more fasionable things for a lot of white rock musicians was to record in the Crescent City with many of the local musicians from Dr. John,Allen Toussaint,Little Feat and The Meters. None of these projects were bad at all but strangly enough many of them were one or two off genre excersises that the said artist(s) never again returned to. This was not one of those efforts. Throughout even the 80's the core of Robert Palmers music was always soul and funk so it was only fitting he would make his first solo album in New Orleans with of course all the best people in town on board. Two of the most remarkable things about this are related to Palmer himself. He wrote or co-wrote almost all the music on this album and had a very keen understanding of how to create great funk music,from the honeyed nuances (as opposed to loud bellowing) of his vocal style. Now he does a great job for sure in interpreting Big Easy styled funk here from the rolling clavinets on Allen Toussaint's title track and ""From A Whisper To A Scream"" which Palmer also delivers with his great soulful understatement. There's more of an obvious Mardi Gras-style hump to the grooves of Lowell George's ""Sailin' Shoes"" and ""Blackmail"" but some of the most impressive songs on the album are the ones Palmer wrote himself. ""Hey Julia"" is an excellent song-a great rhythm box percussion led have jive/funk sort of groove with a really deep Carribean rhythm under the service;not so obvious it's emmediately detectable but it's there if you recognize it. ""Get Close"" and ""How Much Fun"" both illustrate an understanding of the elegance of funk and elegance is a quality that Palmer himself always possessed very strong. Of course for a SERIOUS represenation of that there's the twelve minute closer ""Through It All There's You"" where Palmer really works a hardcore jam to death with his wonderfully jazzily phrased licks and how the song builds up and down from a full band sound back to it's lower key tones from the beginning. It was only fitting that his 70's sound was built very strongly on the type of music presented on this album and it's a credit to his integrity that maintained a strong connection to this particular element of his sound throughout his career as opposed to totally disgarding them when they were no longer trendy in mass culture."
A2HWD9PTM7RBXN,B000V672Y0,-1,-1,3.0,"I have very mixed feelings about this CD.  The musical support provided by Lowell George, other membrs of Little Feat and the Meters are simply stunning.  The keyboard parts stand out very much and the drumming is very funky.  The best song by far is the title track.  What a cool groove.

Outside is another strong track.  Whereas I like Sailing Shoes, it just does not compare to the Little Feat version.  It all starts with the vocals.  Robert Palmer just can not compare to Lowell George on this track.

AS a matter of fact, Robert Palmers vocals are erratic on this CD.  He's very good on the title track, Outside and decent on a couple of others.  However, that last song, Throught It All With You, Mr. Palmer just sounds like he is grunting and does not rise above the solid backing unit.

Also many of the songs do not have solid hooks.  Robert Palmer would go on to record more solid hook driven songs later in his career.  On this CD, it is very hit and miss.

Basically the style is good but the substance is not there full time yet."
A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B000V672Y0,1,1,5.0,"This is the debut album from Robert Palmer and its brilliant. His successful 80's albums are not a touch on this. Don't get me wrong I like Riptide, but this is in a different league.

With members of The Meters and Little Feat backing him, this album is really tight. It would have been quite something to see these guys live. The material is a mixture of originals and two classics by the great New Orleans musician and producer Allen Toussaint. These are the title track and ""From a Whisper to a Scream"". Palmers vocals are as smooth as you would expect and unlike much material from the early 70's this doesn't date.

This album and Pressure Drop (Palmers 2nd I believe) are both well worth getting. Robert Palmer changed styles throughout his career but never matched these two early classics."
A2D33J1A643JO3,B000V66PDE,1,1,5.0,50 you hot!  Great SONG..Great to listen to before you go for night of dancing or just dancing at home for that matter...Hey party like it's your birthday!

A1GKR5QUCDUPWP,B000V66PDE,-1,1,5.0,"I remember when this song was ""hot"". I bought the album, and I loved listening to it. I like to think that my musical tastes are a bit more sophisticated, but once in a while, I like the ""bubblegum rap"". Whatcha gonna do?"
A1RUU0TEW8JRDC,B000V672Y0,1,1,5.0,"Robert Palmer known mostly for ""Addicted to Love"", but this CD is a whole different sound. The first three songs ""Sailin Shoes"",
""Hey Julia"", and ""Sneakin Sally through the Alley"" all run
together without a pause and each song compliments the other.
This CD has a bluesy feel to it and the background vocals are
very soulful. I also like the rest of the CD. I think it is
awesome"

This one is an exception, not only does it have a great beat, it catches your attention for the length of the song. It will make you want to sing along, it is far from boring I will tell you that. A great song not only for the clubs, but you will have to add this one to your MP3 collection. I don't care what type of music you are into, this one catches anyone type of genre.

AFIX0GHKWKRAJ,B000V68LJ0,1,1,5.0,"I heard this song as one of snippets available on my mobile app for Guitar Hero. It's the guitar rifts and rock ballad that I loved about ""Simple Man"" and then I actually listened to the lyrics and they spoke to me. This is a quintessential song about coming of age young male adulthood. Relishing the past, looking towards the future, and deciding what one wants to be (and making their mama proud). This isn't necessarily my brand of music, but I know what's good when I hear it. It's unfortunate that this is consider a classic rock. This must've been ground breaking when it was first released. Stamp of Approval."

A208QEPAI30Z4G,B000V68LJ0,1,1,5.0,"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

While a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE / CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?

A3B9DHWCMYQFD,B000V68LJ0,1,1,5.0,"...I do not mean any disrespect AT ALL. This is NOT sarcasm: People that are in one of the greatest bands ever, should NOT get near a plane! Seeing them in the sky is as close as you should get...ever. This song sums up Lynyrd Skynyrd. The older VanZandt brother and a couple of other band members and crew died in a crash. It seems very odd to me that so many great musicians lost their lives jetting around. These guys lived they're lives just like the moral of this song. They did not play for fame and fortune. They never let themselves be changed one bit when all the other bands were going ""hair band."" They were good ol' boys from Alabama that played songs that had a certain timeless and profound pride in being just that: good folks. Skynyrd touched so many of us (now middle aged) people when WE were the future. It was our turn to run the world, and being humble, respectful, and doing the right thing was important. Now that we've retired, the world is way too small, and common courtesy seems but a distant memory. Everything they put out went platinum. Their first song, to the last, was straight up American. The whole Rock Music world mourned when that plane went down. That was it. The other members went back home and would have never played again. BUT! Those guys knew that the older brother, Johnny, I believe (God forgive me if I've got the two mixed up) would want them to try to show the world what was being lost and try to get people to just slow down, realise what is truly important in life; forget greed, be kind and respectful, and just live, simple. Because, ""if you do, you will be satisfied."" Fans of all different kind of music came to see a band that was not really a band any more. All these people came to listen and give their respects. Skynyrd toured one more time. The younger VanZandt brother finally put his grief away for long enough to tour one more time. The whole venue was packed. We went and seen them at Starwood Amphitheatre in Nashville. The younger brother wore a flat brimmed hat just like his older brother used to. He stepped up to the mic and did something he swore not to do...it just hurt too bad: He sang his brothers songs. They played, I swear it was like Jonny was there. Freebird was last song of course....

And that's all I have to say about that."

A33M07VZBYRMPY,B000V6759W,1,1,5.0,"Burnin' is the album that promotes the Bob Marley & the Wailers into international fame, despite that they were already achieving commercial success especially in the Western Hemisphere. Although it is not the debut for the ban, many would considered Burnin' to be the debut album on an international level of fame."
A2162NFEC5ZSDQ,B000V6759W,1,1,5.0,"This is a wonderful album and absolute perfection from beginning to end and the extra tracks are a nice addition as well.  The original Wailers were such an influential band and one of the precious few who while changing the music scene also managed to change culture as a whole.  I've always thought Mr. Marley was the Truest poet in music due to the fact that he lived every song he ever wrote as did his primary co-songwriters, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  Their music and lyrical content stired up revolution both in their country, in music and in the hearts and minds of people around the globe.  This is one band that still generates a tremendous buzz today years after the release of this fantastic album.

They weren't the first to write, produce & perform reggae (Music of the Islands) but they did bring a cohesiveness to their genre and showed that, by this time, it had matured into a force just like the other top genre's of the day.  The Wailers also were able to seemlessly blend aspects from R&B, Jazz, Gospel and Blues bringing a different and unique flavor.  The Wailers, along with Jimmy Cliff, were truly the 1st to make us stand up and pay attention to Reggae and what it would soon mean on a world wide scale!  I recenly ran across an online poll that asked a simply yet profound question. ""Who was more influential: Bob Marley or John Lennon?""  There were a variety of opinons one way or the other, as you would expect, and the debate got somewhat heated.  However, the final response given by a participant on the forum was one of the most profound I've heard on the subject and I think sums everything up in a nutshell.

He stated about the two artists in question: ""One wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, ended a war single handedly, and is looked at to some in Africa as the second coming.""  ""The other wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, Enough Said!""  I couldn't have said it any better myself and that is the difference between The Wailers and every other band of any influence, their songs touched people on a level that made them want to get up, stand up and fight for their rights, not just sing, dance, go to parties, etc.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with the latter, however, it's the former that truly makes a difference in the direction of a people and nation.

Listening to this CD really took me back to that first moment when I heard this album.  Putting needle to wax and hearing ""Get Up, Stand Up, Stand Up for your rights!"" come shouting through my speakers absolutely sent chills down my spine.  Understand the time frame, this was 1973 and the Civil Rights/Black Power movements were still raging in the U.S., to hear a band sing a song like that was so mind boggling to my young ears.  Radio stations weren't prone to play such revolutionary themes at the time and especially from a genre that was just making a name for itself on a worldwide scale.  Then you had the sweet and angelic sounds of Bunny Wailer's ""Hallelujah Time"" with it's wonderful bass guitar and clavinet intro.  This song is so powerful in that it reminds you of the beauty of the simple things in life in the midst of such gross oppression.

Then you have the ultimate song of rebellion and revolution, a song that would become an anthem of both Reggae & Revolutions around the globe, Bob Marley's masterpiece ""I Shot The Sheriff.""  What can be said about this song that has not already been stated millions of times over.  It has so many layers and displays Marley's incredible mastery of writing and storytelling using allegories and metaphors.  At the same time it's a song about an individual and a nation of people defending their right to live in peace according to their beliefs & fighting against genocide of a ""seed"" planted.

There's a wonderful interplay of songs as Reggae is music of what I call equal opposites.  This is displayed constantly in the writings of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  From songs like ""Burnin' and Lootin'"" to ""Put It On"" and ""Duppy Conqueror"" to ""Reincarnated Souls.""  All 3 men were able to, at the same time, be revolutionary and spiritual, fighers and lovers, Rastafarians and Rebels as they saw one as the other and all inclusive.  The songs they wrote were both complex yet simple, deep with practial meanings and applications for everyday life for everyday people.

Just like there's a postive for a negative and an up for a down a left for a right, Reggae music deals with the entire spectrum of life.  This music is so very deep and personal, it truly gives you a glimpse as to what it was like in Jamaica back in the time The Wailers first formed and the strife and struggles they had to go through and not just there but in all the Island nations and anywhere were those of African descent were living around the world.  This was the music that changed generational perspectives and was, then and now, adored by millions and millions of people around the world.

When you have fans as varied as the Freedom Fighers from both South Africa & Zimbabwe, The Hopi & Havasupai Indians of the Southwest U.S.A, The Maoris of New Zealand & even the United Nations, there's really not much to argue about concerning how broad and vast your influence has become. In India, there are many tributes to Bob Marley to this day including restaurants, hotels, and cultural festivals. There has never been anything like Bob Marley & The Wailers and we won't ever see their likes again."

A34Y1FT0MTD7C9,B000V6759W,1,1,5.0,"Bob Marley & The Wailers-Burnin' *****

Released in 1973, the same year as the bands debut Catch A Fire was released, and while many consider one significantly greater then the other, which varies who you ask, I must say they both go hand in hand. Catch A Fire and this, Burnin' are sort of like a ying, and yang thing, not to sound too cliche. Catch A Fire seems to be more about peace and togetherness while Burnin' is the opposite spectrum, more empowering, and more about overcoming and getting yours. Marley was always an activist through his lyrics, you could say he was to reggae what Johnny Cash was to country as far as civil justice and spirituality is concerned.

Containing two of the groups biggest hits, the great opener 'Get Up, Stand Up' and the immortal 'I Shot The Sheriff' which is far better then the Clapton cover, and also shows the vicious side of Marleys lyrics. But it's 'Rasta Man Chant' 'Small Axe' 'Pass It On' and the vehement 'Burnin And Lootin' that make this album a classic.

The new release of the album contains three bonus tracks. 'Reincarnated Souls' being the best, and one that would have perfectly complimented the original album. The other two being less impressive but still great, 'No Symphony' and the chilling 'The Oppressed Song.'

After Burin' Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh would both leave to form solo projects, Tosh being the most successful of the two. His album Legalize It is another classic. The departure of those two members would forever change the sound of the band. They would aim for a more commercial appeal while that isn't a bad thing it did seem to loose something. Though I did enjoy the later background vocals they were not as good as the first two albums, and neither was the musicianship which is something Burnin' has an amazing amount of. Burnin' is an album which I would recommend to anyone who is interested in more then Bob Marley & The Wailers hits."
A26NLSTT75FMJM,B000V6759W,1,1,5.0,"In my mind, Bob Marley has great songs, but generally inconsistant albums. This is the exception to the rule. Bob's angry at the state of the human race here, and he wants you to know. And people tend to make good music while angry. This is no exception. Pretty much every song is classic: Get Up, Stand Up (which got even better virtually ever time he played it live); I Shot the Sheriff; and Burnin' are the best-known, and best. Also check out the politically-charged, pro-revolutionary Small Axe; Duppy Conqueror, with great harominies; Pass It On; and the call for unity One Foundation. I'd call Hallelujah Time the weakest of the bunch. But as for the rest? It's all good. BUY IT! (For the record, Natty Dread and Rastaman Vibration are pretty good too, Live! and Legend, greatest hits comp or not, are indespensible)."

I don't care if something is popular or not, if I like it I'll listen to it.  I think the fact that it was associated with Barbie, which I wasn't into anymore, and that I didn't like a lot of 90s pop, just made me feel alienated from the song.  But many years later, I like it.  It's catchy and gets stuck in my head.  Maybe it's because I've been into collecting Barbie again.  Or because I don't hear 90s pop a whole lot anymore, and I can just listen to it now and then when I feel like it."

I highly recommend this for any Stevie Wonder fan and people who appreciate timeless love ballads would do well to download this song--they will enjoy it over and over again!

AT9RF77HMGZDS,B000V68TXI,1,1,5.0,"You hear a song on the radio and you Shazam it using your phone app. It immediately takes you to the song on Amazon.com and you buy it using one-click after which it is downloaded to your mobile device right away.

I love Steely Dan and this is a song I have listened to and enjoyed for years. Amazon.com allowed me to not only download and listen it on my phone, it is now transferred to my car's hard drive where I can listen to it to my heart's content. Great song; excellent quality; love it!

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000V68RZI,1,1,5.0,"There is honestly a difference between a singer, and being a product. Unfortunately for divas these days like Rihanna and Beyonce', they have chosen to overexpose themselves and choose to be products, not people, and sadly the songs have became so overplayed, their voices have slowly passed away. For other divas, like Vanessa Williams, whom has been very sophisticated at the soul, and very True to her own heart, and strong at the voice, her songs have remained so timeless. Nearly 30 years after Vanessa Williams broke from scandal and heartbreak, after the Miss America Pageant, she found her own voice again through music and acting, and made herself a  worldwide staple as a diva that has never gone out of style. One of my favorite songs, her staple Saved The Best For Last, is actually one of those songs that has sincerely gotten much better with age, and the soulful melody aligned. I adore this song each time I hear it, and if you have never heard a Vanessa Williams song before, than I recommend you download this beauty.

Song: A"

A32T2H8150OJLU,B000V691C6,1,1,5.0,"This song together with ""The Logical Song"" and ""Goodbye Stranger"" are IMO iconic Supertramp tracks.  I was pleased to be able to pick this one up recently, and it appears regularly on my favorite playlists.

Supertramp's album ""Breakfast in America"" was released in 1979, and its tracks appeared climbed the charts over the months that followed.  They also have enough staying power that they still show up somewhat regularly on oldies pop and rock radio stations.

5 stars."

A146R8D7UBEFKQ,B000V68TXI,1,1,5.0,Typical Steely Dan Masterpiece. Why is that their productions in the 1970's sound so much more crystal clear than all the high tech equipment musicians are using in studios these days? Anyone have an answer to that? Love to hear a good answer.
A2KTG5IPC5N9EJ,B000V693C4,1,1,5.0,"I downloaded for a friend, but I feel she would give it five stars, cause she plays it alot and put it as her voice mail message."

This sets the pace with a more slow, mellow tone mostly paying homage to the unique voice of Axl Rose. Slow song, fast song or ballad, they can do it. Go ahead and buy this song. I love it!"

A252UVOWRR2KPW,B000V68TJM,1,1,4.0,...from the 90s.  Brought back memories of when I was an advisor to the Pennsylvania National Guard.  The Inspector General's office was right next door and they were on the road most of the time.  This was kind of their theme song when they'd come back home and be in the office for a few days...
A3AFI1CSZKWSG1,B000V68TJM,1,1,5.0,"This song is awsome because it has some great quality and is the full song. It was used in the first ""EXPENDABLES"" movie."

A15Z2947ZA5TJF,B000V68TJM,1,1,5.0,Great song. This is how initially I found Thin Lizzy. Check out the rest of the discography if you get the chance to do so. It's magnificent.

AIGH2GH9V4IQ6,B000V68TJM,1,1,5.0,"I really used to like Thin Lizzy and then something reminded me of them this year (2014).
So I picked my three favorites and got them on Amazon in MP3 form. You'd like this if you're
a rocker, I'm thinking."
A3FQ9WYUHG9CD,B000V68TJM,1,1,5.0,"There is definitely something rockin' here. The song made #12 on the American charts and #8 on the
British charts. Rolling Stone Magazine, in 2004, put this song at #499 in the top  500 greatest songs
of all time. In 2005, Q magazine place it at #38 on its list of 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. Yes, it should
be.

The reason? Great almost-poetic lyrics by Phil Lynott, hitting his peak, and dynamite intertwined guitar
leads, all done with a working man's sensibility. The twin guitar leads were essentially a trademark of
Thin Lizzy, after 1975, and helped the band stand apart from the rest of the rock 'n' roll pack. The lead
and rhythm guitar  playing uses very sharp crisp chords that pulsate and propel the song. Wait for the
sparse twin guitar lead as the rest of the band lays back; then the singer comes back in as the twin
leads repeat their riff underscoring the lyrics and subsequently the Boys bravado.

The song was released in 1976 and featured a black Irish lead singer/bass player and a mixed band of
Protestant and Catholic musicians. Talk about cross cultural influences, this band was it. Amazingly
the song was used at the 2012 Republican Convention to introduce the Vice-Presidential candidate to
the stage. Again, the Republicans used a song unauthorized (Reagan and ""Born In The USA"") and was
criticized for its use. This was objected to by the Lynott family citing that Lynott would have objected
to the anti-gay policies of the party and never let them use it for political purposes.

Nonetheless, this song sounds immediate no matter how many times it is played. This is why it has been
used in countless movies, television commercials and sporting events. The energy on this song, displayed
by the band, keeps you glued to your air guitar and keeps you wondering if the song will have a different
ending each time you play it. To me it always seems fresh and exciting; in one word, timeless, and that,
to me, is what a great rock 'n' roll song is all about."
A254MDH9GJ1HQD,B000V68TJM,1,1,5.0,"classic rock, along with jailbreak, these are still great thin lizzy songs to listen to and add to the classic rock collection."

AZHBFHZAEYNIF,B000V68YAG,1,1,5.0,When my love Ybis told me she was moving to Los Angeles to pursue employment opportunities.  I purchased this mp3 to tell her how much I would miss her.  Now when ever I find myself blue and unable to move in a direction.  I play this song to remind me of the love I had for her.
A1QUQJX1P2X2UO,B000V68YAG,1,1,5.0,Anything by Stevie is great......This song just reminds me of my childhood and all the  great music during my era...

A280KHZO2L7GKA,B000V69784,1,1,5.0,"Back in 1990, this was THE R&B band.  Along with groups like Mint Condition, they were the last of a dying breed of real musicians who incorporated hip hop beats and real musicianship.  Unfortunately, R&B has had a decline.  This album contains songs about love, life, and relationships.  They don't make R&B like that anymore. I sure do miss those days."
A3R75H3IPPC2UX,B000V69784,1,1,5.0,"I love this group and I love this Cd. These guys are great. Every song whether fast or slow is hot. My favorites are Feels good, The Blues, It never rains, Whatever you want, Don't talk about me, I care, & Those were the days. There are many other great songs but I just wanted to  name a few. I am happy that I purchased this Cd! It was a great buy! Pick up a copy asap!"
A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000V69784,1,1,4.0,"TTT's sophomore album was the stuff of which legends were made: innovative, funky, soulful, and reflective. Like other reviewers have stated, their later work was better, but this earlier release stands as one of the strongest ""second helpings"" in R & B history."
A3M88RCAR2T804,B000V69784,1,1,4.0,"What a great song on a pretty darn good cd.  This is TTT's best cd, anniversary is their best song, but this is by far their best cd!"
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B000V69784,1,-1,3.0,"This is a Pretty Good. I dug Feels Good,Oakland Stroke with Vanessa Williams a cool tribute to Tower Of Power&Sly&THE FAMILY Stone. The Blues is tight. It Never Rain In Southern California is a Classic  slow-jam. WHatever you want.the Grooves&Slow Jams are Pretty Good but  their Material gets Better on Later Albums."
A4EKX22OU5L8K,B000V66LAQ,1,1,5.0,"Steely Dan in all their glory. One of the best songs to come out of the mid '80's. It has that familiar Jazz feel to it that Steely Dan is famous for. We don't have to call them Deacon Blue, because they definitely did not loose with this one."
A2BH945DHGH5J7,B000V66LAQ,1,1,5.0,"This is one of those songs that is just perfect to have a cup of Coffee or Hot Chocolate with OR just to start the day with.

AM7U9MNYQ8LD4,B000V68V4A,1,1,4.0,great song
A2DCS39GFBJV24,B000V68V4A,1,1,5.0,"I confess that I haven't heard the original Vicki Lawrence version of this song -- indeed, I didn't even know this song was a remake until I looked it up out of curiosity.  So I have no idea how Reba McEntire's version compares to Lawrence's.  Normally I prefer the original version of a song over a remake (unless it's a Weird Al ""remake""), and I suppose one of these days I should look up the Lawrence version as a comparison/contrast to McEntire's.

But as of now, this version of ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"" is one of my favorite songs of all time.  It's a dark ballad with a complex but compelling storyline, and a surprisingly shocking ending.

The song is played in an eerie, almost menacing key, quite befitting the building dread of the story as a man tries to track down his unfaithful wife's lover and gets far more trouble than he bargained for in the process.  The piano and electric guitar track mesh well, and the drum track is appropriately intense without overpowering the song.  And Reba's vocals carry the song well -- she doesn't scream or holler, but lets the lyrics convey the song's emotions on their own.  This song could easily have played out as melodramatic in the hands of another singer, but Reba doesn't overdo it, and so the song hits the right balance.

By now I'm sure the song's twist ending is well-known, but it can still be shocking to first-time listeners.  I won't spoil it further.

One of Reba's best songs, and one of the best country songs I've heard.  If you don't mind your music dark and with a complex storyline, give this a listen."
AZX7GXLU4FLAI,B000V68VJA,1,1,5.0,Reba's songs are ALL good.  This is one of my particular favorites.  Reba's voice is so strong and lyrical.  Get it and enjoy!

A36EN1PL31Y8TU,B000V6A3AA,1,1,5.0,A blues guitar that rates high excellent.  A voice he lifter from an 80 year old black man Johnny Lang will blues you into submission.  If you like blues check him out.  You'll be damn glad you did.
A1F7YU6O5RU432,B000V6A3AA,1,1,5.0,"Typically I like two kinds of music, very old blues and very loud new rock. I stumbled across this song for the first time a few months ago and just loved it. While it's not old blues, it has some serious heart in it, like many of the the old blues do. Johnny Lang sings is with a ton of soul. A song about a guy who knows a relationship isn't working out, she's moving on, but he isn't ready to let go. He wants to stay together, closing his eyes to what's going on right behind his back, and not yet accept the inevitable. Great song with some deep meaning."
A1H10L6S9KZB2C,B000V68VJA,1,1,5.0,Gave five stars because it's Reba!!! Love this song with Linda Evans!! They do such a great job with this song.
A1VZDPPHLYZ0KB,B000V68VJA,1,1,5.0,"No one does music like Reba.  This duet sung by Reba and Linda Davis, is one of my favorites. It speaks of 2 women in love with the same man, his wife and his mistress.  Sad and haunting."

AGLP82TL0UAYC,B000V68VJA,1,1,5.0,"I love almost anything by Reba that isn't one of her ""catchy"" songs, the ones that played the radio over and over. I like the lesser known songs off her albums, especially the sad songs. I sit and listen for hours to samples and buy, not by name, but by what appeals to my ""heart"", as it were. Same with several other artists."
A1B57G1D9KLJLH,B000V68VJA,1,1,5.0,I already posted a review about her. its the same as the other ones. shes sounds great and has great lyrics.
A2OYT6UXIH4WSS,B000V6980Q,1,1,4.0,"I MUCH prefer Dream Street because the music was more lively and a bit more flirtier than this one. The songs on this are mostly fluffy love songs. I guess she was singing songs that would be appropriate for a 16 year old. I think the best/standout tracks would be The Magic is Working, Come Give Your Love To Me, Young Love, and Don't Mess Up This Good Thing. Love and My Best Friend reminds me of Michael's Ben. It's mushy at best but compliments Janet's sweet/soft tone that gives it more of a pleasure, worthwhile listen for hardcore Janet fans like myself."
A967PDAQ425EF,B000V6980Q,1,1,5.0,"So here we have the elusive album by Janet Jackson that i have been trying to convince retailers actually exists ! Those of you in the know,know what i'm talking about.....trying to explain that Janet did have two albums prior to Control. For some reason people [among them Janet] have been trying to avoid this album's existence and i for the life of me don't know why,sure it doesn't have all the ""attitude"" of a Control or a Rhythm Nation but this was 1982 four years before Control and music was different then. To compare this to Control or ""rhythm"" is unfair,first off as i stated before music WAS different then,secondly,even tho the ""Minneapolis Sound"" was in full swing,it was done by grown folks like Prince,The Time,Vanity 6 among others,Janet was a 16 year old girl still living under the jackson's Compound and it was not until 1984's Dream Street that she started showing signs of rebel. I'm giving this album five stars because the music is good on here and Janet was in her purest form, just an r&b/pop teen singer doing her thing. For those of you who care...there's a longer version of ""say you do"" on this album and it's better than the one that appeared on the original release, in my opinion also i have a new found fondness for the song ""forever yours"" and i always loved ""young love' that was my jam ! Anyway,buy this album before it ""disappear"" again."
A256JOUD8X0J7R,B000V6980Q,1,1,4.0,"I loved the Control and Rhythm Nation albums in the 80s.  I didn't know that she had two previous albums out.  The radio and MTV didn't play the older songs anymore at that time, and I never noticed them in stores.  I heard Say You Do a few years ago while watching an episode of Soul Train that Janet was on.  I bought this cd before it went out of print.

While this and her sophomore record aren't as memorable as Control, there are still some pretty good songs on it.  My favorites are Say You Do, You'll Never Find a Love Like Mine, and Come Give Your Love to Me.  The ballads aren't so great.  The upbeat tracks are better.  Very early 80s R&B, disco, Jacksons, Off the Wall sounds.  Come Give Your Love to Me is more rock/new wave, kind of a hint at the sound of her next album, which I think is better than this one.  Both are worth buying if you like 80s music."
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000V6980Q,1,1,4.0,"I'm sure there are many people out there who still believe<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Control/dp/B000002GFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Control</a>&nbsp;is Janet Jackson's first album. That was not in fact the case-she had two False starts beforehand and this was her first. At the time of this release Janet was the one member of her family not really considering a career in music. Acting seemed to be her call to ""fame"" (no pun intended) and she was doing very well in that field lending her charming,coy personality to TV shows such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Times/dp/B001DSNELU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Times</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diff-rent-Strokes/dp/B0002JZT5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diff'rent Strokes</a>&nbsp;and later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fame/dp/B002BYYAKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fame</a>. In the latter two series her appearances often including her singing in some capacity. So at this point being only 16 years old and very much ""doing what her father said"" she recorded this debut album. Even at this point her voice possesses the same coy charm as her attitude. It's definately not soul shouting of course but she has a pretty good range and,in a lot of ways has the sound of a female version of her brother Michael. The music was another matter however. With Leon Sylvers handling the production on this album (with his sister Pat contributing some keyboard parts) there is something of the flavor of both early 80's Solar R&B and some of the period Jackson family sound which,as most will remember share certain similarities anyhow. ""Say You Do"" is a great open,an extended dance-funk jam that builds from a beat to a BAAAD bassline with some great echo on it and,of course it isn't all that unlike something Michael and/or his brothers might've come up with at that time. (""You'll Never Find) A Love Like Mine"" has the same effect through the guys of a bubbling disco-pop tune and both tunes showcase her maturing voice very well. On these songs it would seem there was an effort to turn Janet into something of a lower key version of Stacy Lattisaw but when the funk gets percolating on ""Don't Mess Up This Good Thing"" the electronic textures of the song demand Janet belt out the song more and she does to great affect. The ballads ""Love And My Best Friend"" and her version of ""Forever Yours"" are not only just a tad over arranged but somehow don't quite seem like suitable material of the teenage singer. However the than very forceful disco freeze out the out and out four-on-the-floor disco-soul production of ""Young Love"" best explemlifies where Janet was coming from at this point and fits well with her persona at this point in time. It was on 'Diff'rent Strokes' that Janet first premired her song ""The Magic Is Working"" and this is a great and very Shalamar-like ""The Magic Is Working"" and again it fits well with who she was at the time. The album closer ""Come Give Your Love To Me"" puts her into a new-wave rock style and although the track slams again with a mean bassline leading the way Janet's voice is just not quite into rockier material at this point. Nevertheless the song itself will grow on one with the passage of time. This is not by any means her definative early album. I'd say that would be her very,very underrated second outing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Street/dp/B00000DNA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Street</a>. However this did serve the common function of what a debut album does for most artists: give them a loose musical concept and allows them to develop appropriatly in a variety of settings."
A28FNKCGFS03VL,B000V6980Q,1,1,4.0,"Released when she was just 16, this is the underrated debut album from the now-legendary Janet Jackson, and while it doesn't bear the signature Jam & Lewis sound that would make undeniable classics out of her Control and Rhythm Nation albums, it's a great album if you like perky, innocent (and somewhat disco-ish) dance pop, and the producers on hand, including Rene Moore and Angela Winbush (aka the soul duo Rene & Angela), give Janet some bouncy, vigorous landscapes to work with, and they seem to be a good match here, especially on ""You'll Never Find (A Love Like Mine)."" Foster Sylvers also serves her well with the infectious grooves of ""Don't Mess Up This Good Thing"" and ""Come Give Your Love To Me."" Jerry Weaver also works a little magic on the outstanding ""The Magic Is Working,"" and check out ""Love And My Best Friend,"" a tender, impassioned ballad that may be Janet's best sheer vocal performance."
AHBG3YDT36KKJ,B000V6980Q,1,1,4.0,"This CD was better than I thought it'd be. I luv ""Young Love"" and ""Say You Do."" My jams! This is a rare and great addition to my collection."
A1KNYQPZ1JQD62,B000V6980Q,1,-1,3.0,"I have always been a huge Janet Jackson fan and this was the first album I ever purchased by her. I was a fan of the song ""Come & Give Your Love To Me"", after purchasing the album, I later found the 45rpm as well. But this album was Janet's first and did not sell to well. It has sold approx. 400,000 copies in the U.S. and about 600,000 worldwide. The album peaked at #63 on the Pop Charts and #6 on the R&B charts. They do have a few standout tracks, such as ""Young Love"" and ""Come & Give Your Love To Me"". Those were the first two singles but barley cracking the charts. Another good track is, ""The Magic Is Working"". Of course, this album does not compare to her masterpiece ""Control"" or anything after that. But I would still recommend this to any Janet fan!"
AK10XZKJ160B9,B000V6A77Y,1,1,4.0,Heard it on NCIS.  Very nice job.  Passed her music off to a friend in Germany.  Friend was greatly pleased with Patty Griffin.
A2SMAPK3VZFSU6,B000V6A77Y,1,1,5.0,First heard the song at the ending of an NCIS tv show and it was beautiful.  Never heard of Patty Griffin before and didn't know what we were missing.  So glad we were able to do a quick search on Amazon music by guessing at the title and find it.
AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B000V6980Q,1,-1,3.0,"I remember this very well from high school. It came out several months before a certain brother of hers (no, not Tito) blew the world away with the biggest selling album of all time.

For the most part, this is synth-pop filler all too typical of the early 80s on the verge of the dark ages of Black music. But some nice tunes really stand out. ""Love and My Best Friend"" sounds a lot like the certain brother's ""Ben,"" but is really nice in it's own right. ""Forever Yours"" is a nice ballad which gave some indication of what was to come, but I really liked (and still have a fondness for) ""Young Love,"" especially where she does the really sweet scat singing at the end.

Overall, some good stuff that makes it interesting for more than just historical reasons. Buy used."
A252HNVAZENVNE,B000V6980Q,-1,-1,3.0,"Janet was 16 years old when she made her debut album and it sounds like songs writtenby and/or for a 16 year old. Glossy
teenybopper dance music is dominant on ""(You'll Never Find) A Love Like Mine"",""Young Love"" and ""The Magic Is Working"".But on
the Thriller-like opener ""Say You Do"",the sassy electro-funk of
""Don't Mess Up This Good Thing"" and the tough rocking ""Come Give
Your Love To Me"" producer Leon Sylvers elevates a mediocre album
into a promising begining for this particular talent. But better
download those cuts or something because the ALBUM is pretty
so-so elsewhere."
A2VRL7KYHJQWPE,B000V69180,1,1,5.0,"As they say on American Bandstand, its ""a good beat and easy to dance to"".  I give it a 96."

I like this Album better than Her ""Dream Street"" AlbumThe ""All 4 U"" Album. Janet wasn't too bad on Here Vocally it was passable....."
A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000V6980Q,1,1,4.0,"While her voice hasn't actually changed much since the release of her debut recording, Jackson's choice of producers has. Thus, the formation of the Jackson/Harris/Lewis triumvirate has developed the novice singer on this album into the powerhouse superstar that she is today. This recording shows a star ""in training"".
And, before I get bombarded from others, for implying that Miss Janet is not a good singer, I think that she is one of the most entertaining performers in history, although a little ""weak"" in the vocal delivery department."
A1FML9FCUPV6TI,B000V6980Q,1,1,4.0,"Janet recorded this album at the age of 16 years old. It's nothing that special, but the hardcore Janet fans will want this for their collection, to see where it all started. Released in 1982, this album shows us where she started in her music career. The music isn't that bad, the production is classic Jackson production, there's actually some really funky stuff here. ""Say You Do"" and ""You'll Never Find (A Love Like Mine)"" are classic 80's pop/R&B. ""Young Love"" is pretty funky too. There's some ballads, ""Love and My Best Friend"", ""Forever Yours"", etc. Other good tracks include ""Don't Mess Up This Good Thing"", ""The Magic Is Working"" and ""Come Give Your Love To Me"". Overall its not her strongest, far from it, but its worthwhile to have. It's a fun album essentially."
A16ZS3AK509CVQ,B000V6A77Y,1,1,5.0,Love the sounds this lady brings to the folk arena. Had to have the track to study and play the guitar accompaniment in her style of playing this one. Great song!!
A3RC3AK8UN89I9,B000V6980Q,1,-1,3.0,"This is where it began, the career of Janet Jackson, she was 16 at the time of its release, and who knew that she would acheive so much in her career. While this certainly isn't her best work, and it didn't receive much attention, its still a fun album to listen to. The songs are infectuous. The album is very Jackson sounding, with songs like Say You Do, Youll Never Find (A Love Like Mine) and Young Love, and theres also some ballads here like Love And My Best Friend, and Forever Yours. Her voice isn't that strong here but its still nice, I mean this is her debut album and she didn't hit it big until Control in 1986, but this is still worth checking out."

Therefore, I decided to compile a CD to introduce my school age grandchildren to a variety of wholesome music from various genres.  This classic song is performed by Sammy Davis, Jr.  is a 'must have' to include on a playlist for kids of all ages.  The upbeat music and fun lyrics is appropriate for younger school-age children.  Best of all, this is a fun song, which is  family friendly, and a  favorite which I'm sure my grandchildren will  and their parents will enjoy.

It has such kaleidoscopic scope, container of vibrant themes and hovered by contagious flair that, once you listen you will hardly be able to do without about it.

Since the Latin beginning ""Broadband"" , passing through the marvelous and suggestive ballad ""Angle of repose"", the original song of African roots ""Timbuktu"" , the magnificent theme ""Night Jessamine"" with funk accents, to the most experimental and dynamically moving ""Scylla"" in which harmonizes expression and introspection, until the last track ""Never alone"" Brecker always exposed with his inimitable style and touch of class tracks like ""Brexterity"", the captivating ""Evening faces"" and the fabulous ""Modus operandi"" makes me think about an innermost musical journey .

This album has not waste. You must acquire as soon as you can. It's far from being just a fashionable album. It's precisely the contrary: a timeless item for connoisseurs.

A treat!"
A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000V6AEI6,1,1,5.0,"My dumb behind didn't know what a quindectet was before I bought this album. I'd never even heard the word used before. It wasn't in any of my dictionaries and my computer refused to recognise it as a proper word. Maybe Michael Brecker made the word up? Ah, whatever. I guess you live and you learn.

I love the idea though. Brecker basically does big band and playing with his fourteen cohorts here gives him the opportunity to paint a canvas of very complex textures upon which to play his beautiful tenor sax solos. The whole ensemble works well but, apart from the bandleader of course, I have a personal fondness on here for Alex Sasha Sipiagin on trumpet, Adam Rogers on guitar and the drummer, Antonio Sanchez (now of The Pat Metheny Group). My favourite songs include ""Broadband"" (which is the opener on my CD and not ""Loxodrome"" as mentioned in the product overview soundclips), ""Night Jasmine"", ""Scylla"" and ""Never Alone"". Gil Goldstein does a great job co-arranging with Brecker and doing the overall orchestration.

I'll always wonder though, if I'd have liked the album more if Vince Mendoza had done it?

Still. Great stuff. Anyone who likes this will probably also like some of the big band stuff Bob Mintzer (the horn man with Yellowjackets) did back in the 90s. So I respectfully suggest you check him out too."
ADFXJSLJGN6EN,B000V6AEI6,1,1,5.0,"Whoa. I was used to hearing Brecker in your average funk-fusion (a bit smoother than I like sometimes), and straight-ahead blowing sessions, so this one really took me by surprise. Here he assembled a unique combination of instruments - among them strings, guitar and a somewhat unique (including French horn and Baritone) brass section - which gives the music a kind of heft and richness that is just a joy to hear. The arrangements are great - interesting horn/string lines underneath Brecker's usual masterful and fiery soloing. My faves are ""Night Jessamine"", and ""Modus Operandi"" which are two of the grooviest and funkinest jazz songs I've heard in quite a while. The only tiny complaint I have is that Brecker is virtually the only soloist. He gives bassist Pattituci a few spots, as well as a couple for the guitarist and trumpeter, but most of the time it is him wailing on and on. Mind you, he is an awesome soloist, I love his playing, but sometimes you need to break it up a bit and let the other guys shine for a while, too - that is what Jazz is about, individual expression, while still serving the collective. Not even the great Coltrane had a problem letting Eric Dolphy, Don Cherry, or his own McCoy Tyner shine for a while. But, aside from that, this is a superb effort from one of the most important saxophonists since Coltrane. Keep it up, Mike."
A3H4OB7H2NQTM6,B000V6AEI6,-1,-1,3.0,"A good but not great jazz album.  As the reviewer below comments, there is a lot of orchestration in this album.  So what you have most of the time is Brecker or one of the other players soloing over the orchestration.  I don't find this to be as musically interesting as albums where there is more interplay among members of the ensemble."
A27ULPK1RGCNU6,B000V68V68,1,1,5.0,great upbeat song for working out or just putting you in a good mood. heard it on the radio and could never figure out what the name of the song was and now I have it!
A2ESUL8QBRVY8M,B000V68V68,1,1,5.0,I Wish!!
A25MQXI9DDL2ZT,B000V68V68,1,1,5.0,Love this man's music.  Uplifting...a way to forget about your worries.  Listen to Stevie.
A188CFA5QF9N0P,B000V68V68,1,1,5.0,Great track that is another True story for many Afro American's lifestyle @ the Xmas Holidays!  Stevie is still a Genius of bringing out our real background in song format... I love this because it's reality for my own childhood Xmas memories of sharing that same kind of upbringing! I give all Stevie's creations a 5 star!!
A1JCR8TU4L4O5X,B000V6ADNW,-1,1,5.0,classic!
A1O90V9J864L7N,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"It's True. I can't think of another album that has a huge impact on rap/hip hop and the topped charts since then. It's been 14 years and way so many people still bob their heads and know the words to ""what up gangsta"" (which wasn't even a single!), ""in da club,"" ""wanksta,"" ""21 questions,"" ""many men,"" ""patiently waiting,"" etc. THIS is what makes a classic. Everything has to fall into place. It's not just, ""is every song good?"" It's more than that. It's the right artist at the right time with the right circumstances and attitude. 10 years down the line will people hear the songs And sing all the words?. People have been throwing around the term ""classic"" nowadays practically right when the album comes out. Nah man. Kendrick hasn't dropped a classic. Wayne never dropped one either. Nobody has put out anything like 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Trying. His story was crazy, his time dropping mix tapes as if they were albums was crazy. He was jacking beats like it was nothing and making dope songs. His confidence and sense of humor got people. Then, Eminem and Dre signed him and got right to work making this. Everything was just perfect looking back on it. Say what you want about him now lol but 50 dropped a certified banger and a classic that we'll always remember him by."

A21QD3LJIKOZO0,B000V6ADNW,-1,1,5.0,"Since everybody knows how big this album was and how much drama that surrounded it, I'll give a brief review of the album,

On ""Intro"" there is no rapping or talking, all we hear is a coin drop, following that we go into the next track produced by Rob ""Reef"" Tewlow, ""What Up Gangsta"" and the beat is sick especially when it first comes on, The good doctor gave fif a hit with ""In da Club"", you couldn't go anywhere without hearing the song or somebody just rapping the lyrics ""Go shorty, it's your birthday/ We gonna party like it's your birthday!"" The other singles were ""21 Questions"" (featuring Nate Dogg), its one of those would you be down for if I didn't have this type of song. ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" is the best song on here. On ""Back Down"", he also throws more shots on ""Heat"" the Dr. Dre's beat is simple, it has a constant guncok sound. Em shows up twice, on ""Patiently Waiting"" where he easily outshines Curtis and ""Don't Push Me"", also featuring Lloyd Banks. On the latter Em is rapping about the same stuff as 50 but he doesn't get called out for it? Double standard? But on another note it was a dope track. There are some missteps on here though ""Blood Hound"" (featuring Young Buck) was just too boring for me, the pimping anthem ""P.I.M.P."" cant even be saved by his catchy hook. His braggadocios raps brings the down the album as well, at least switch it up sometimes! We know you got 9 times, we know you went from noting to something tell us something we don't know. As for the bonus tracks ""Wanksta"" took him to another level, it appeared on the G-Unit mixtape then the 8Mile sdtk, ""U Not Like Me"" and ""Life's on the Line"" were out before he was even signed. Overall I think 50 dropped a classic album and lets not try to rewrite history, this was biggest album of 2003. If you do buy it I suggest getting a used one for 5 dollars or less. I heard all 50s album and trust me this is the one worth checking out besides Power Of The Dollar."
A299AG3O394X32,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"Talk about an explosive Major debut, then here it is with 50 showing what many have already known...the man delivers words with a message and the beats supplied from Dre to keep the party going."
A344ITZYE55Q68,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"I have the original, but I sometimes DJ parties where explicit lyrics aren't appropriate. I saw this album, including the non-explicit version on sale for $3.00 on Amazon (MP3 Download), and I couldn't resist getting it in the non-explicit version. Thanks Amazon."
A1KLIE6N3X38PC,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"okay i love wu tang (all of of em u-god, ins, masta) most of the wu tang affliets (killarmy, gravediggaz,cappadona, sunz of man and killah presit) and honestly this album is great now i understand this is very comerical not just the lyrics but the phat beats by dre but it is an undienable classic listen to massacare and curtis and tell me if that bull**** even comes close so this is pretty much 50's only classic lp so far. in the coments tell me the songs you don't like and why you don't like them and maybe i will change my rating so it stays at 3 12 stars"
A20DZX38KRBIT8,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"That is exactally what every album by this no talent hack sounds like but I
Sure iron mike could write better lyrics."
A8SCX6VUTE05H,B000V6ADNW,-1,1,4.0,"Yeah it's True that this was the most overrated release of 2003. But it's also True that this was the best album that he has ever made(next to Guess Who's Back). Every wack album after this proves it. In Da Club was a huge record for him and Many Men, Wanksta, What Up Gangsta pretty much kept this album afloat. Eminem makes two dominating appearances on here(Patiently Waiting and Dont Push Me). Eminem floored 50 on Patiently Waiting and Both Em and Lloyd Banks leave 50 in the dust in Dont Push Me. Back Down while overrated was a good diss record towards Ja Rule and Murda Inc but they could have kept Alex Thomas fruit basket a** off of the record though. Gotta Make It Heaven is tight as well as the three bonus tracks: Wanksta, U Not Like Me and Life's On The Line. Contrary to popular belief this album is not a classic. Blood Hound feat Young Buck is weak. Like My Style feat Tony Yayo is straight garbage and Poor Lil Rich, P.I.M.P., and 21 Question feat Nate Dogg have filler written all over them. By the way, the bonus DVD is not worth mentioning. Other than that, this album was good but way overhyped. Even though GRODT is overrated in comparison to what came after it, GRODT is one of the few G-unit releases worth mentioning. Standouts: WHAT UP GANGSTA, PATIENTLY WAITING, MANY MEN(WISH DEATH), IN DA CLUB, HEAT, IF I CANT, BACK DOWN, DONT PUSH ME, GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN, U NOT LIKE ME and LIFE'S ON THE LINE."
A1X6WS9PPQC3GI,B000V6ADNW,-1,1,4.0,We all know the truth about 50 cents. But he at peace wit dat. Ya see?
AU2UEKZ20WF0X,B000V6AB3E,1,1,5.0,"Another great Nirvana song! I recommend this to anyone who's a fan that may not have it yet. I've always loved this band, yet didn't have many of their songs...oddly. But I found it here and it's great!"
A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,3.0,"Just about everything bad and good has been said about this album. 50 Cent's major debut was a decent album in 2003 that was highly blown out of proportion on how good it was (sort of like Nelly's ""Country Grammar"") but there are some good parts to it and some bad parts to it. 50 Cent's gangsta attitude would be shown all over the album, mostly about guns, sex, drugs, and money. The 2003 rap song of the year ""In Da Club"" was overrated to me, but it was a decent track at best. The second single ""21 ?'s"" I hated because of it's pop style and lack luster beat that it carries. The third single ""Many Men"" was one of my favorite tracks that was dedicated to more violence. The fourth single ""P.I.M.P."" was a medicore song about pimping on the origonal version, although the remix that features Snoop Dogg and G-Unit that doesn't appear on here is better. The rest of the tracks range from decent to good that will make your head nod, some I enjoyed and some that I hated. ""Patiently Waiting"" featuring Eminem is possibly one of the best songs on the album, as both of them have above average verses. The track ""If I Can't"" has a fast paced piano beat, that makes the song gangsta and listenable. ""What Up Gangsta"" will have little kids thinking they're hardcore repeating that song, because of it's catchy hook. 50 Cent's slurred vocals could get a liitle annoying at some parts of the CD, because he was shot in the jaw when he took those nine bullets.

Production is done by Dr. Dre, Eminem, and more.
It sold about 9 million copies, so I'm pretty sure that most rap and alternative listener has at least taken a listen.

AKW5WFJ24WMW4,B000V6AB3E,-1,1,5.0,There's something so sad about someone with so much talent leaving what looked to be a fruitful life. RIP Kurt.
A3KBZVXTHO9GWI,B000V6AB3E,1,1,5.0,"Classic, Nicely premastered"
A3PGSA1WVYIQJN,B000V6AB3E,1,1,5.0,A classic; what's not to love about this one?
A1CAV2K99G0MX4,B000V6AB3E,1,1,5.0, I'm so happy cuz today I found the song that I like. Play it loudly every day cuz it is good. Yeaaaaaah 
AZTFNQH1AJD9R,B000V6AB3E,1,1,5.0,When people ask me what style of music I like I always say grunge or post-grunge and these guys started it all.
A1JIW8GOSSGUQR,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"When 50 First came on the scene, I was a little skeptic of what he was all about. I thought since he was working with Dr. Dre that maybe Dre had picked up on someone that had some talent and could give us a solid hip-hop artist. I was dead wrong. WHen this CD was first released, I didn't think it was terrible, but the more it got overplayed, and the more nosense I heard about 50, the less appealing the CD became to me. It is apparent that 50 was a creation of some money hungry record label that probely got ahold of Dre (thank Interscope Records) and asked him if he could sign on with him and be part of his Aftermath label. What a joke, not only is 50 probely the least think from a ganster, he is a total sell out. I love how he hangs in Beverly Hills Spa's and Star Magazine parties. Sure he is a ganasta alright. Does anyone really believe that this guy was shot 9 times. I bet you his real name is Erkel and he proebely grew up some posh suburban community and got stuffed into lockers in high-school. Shame on you Dre for putting this dope on your record label, and shame on Interscope for pressuring you into signing him. DO I have proof that this happened? NO, but I am more then 99.9% sure that this is how it went down. Everyone do 50 and favor and boycott his next CD, then maybe his can Get Poor and Die Penniless."
AHZQIQYWO1BPW,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"I love 50 Cent!  This is definitely my favorite CD of his.  He's serious, a little melodramatic, funny... it's all there.  He's at the top of his game."
A3G10NPD661EQD,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4.0,"This album doesn't really contain interesting lyrics (although some of the songs are pretty funny), but it's still great for the dancefloor. Every track has a great hook to it which is great for the clubs, but musically it's pretty lacking. The beats are great, of course, but there's nothing new here (standard fare). It's basically just I-make-more-money-and-do-more-ladies-than-you-so-I'm-cool gangsta club rap. The reason I give this 4.5 stars is that ALL 19 songs are great club tracks (that is indeed a bargain and contributes greatly to its mass appeal)! A must-have album for clubs and parties, but it doesn't really hold any other significant longterm value. Highly recommended for clubheads. (a funny sidenote: it was actually my white 60 year-old US History teach who recommended this album, if that tells you anything. He loved how fun it was)

Highlights include:
the whole album!"
A3U6W30C8NV11Y,B000V6AC9W,1,1,5.0,THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.
A26NLSTT75FMJM,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"This whole ""gangsta rap"" craze is a major disgrace. As much as I hate Eminem, at least his lyrics sometimes mean something. 50's don't mean nothin'. Okay, you're gangsta, we understand, we've had this whole ""I'm a Gangsta"" thing shoved down our throats for the past decade, and frankly, it's CRAP. Gangsta rap is worthless - I wouldn't touch it."
AFTN9ZLB22PSZ,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4.0,"On ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" 50 was a new fledgling rapper with a new major label, and he had something to prove. He showed everybody who he was, a tough rapper from Queens, and he actually had something to say. His only beef here was with Ja Rule, and that was actually pretty entertaining, especially since now 50 makes a beef with every rapper he lays eyes on. He gets some good production and guest appearances from Eminem, Nate Dogg, and the G Unit family. I hope 50 can be remembered for this album rather than for the Massacre, which is terrible, and whatever else he makes from this point on.

Pretty much all the tracks here are good to listen to. He really sounds tough here, not all worried about women and his star status like he would be later. ""What Up Gangsta"" is good, good chants at the end and all. ""Patiently Waiting"" with Eminem is memorable, crazy production, good lyrics by both parties. ""Many Men"" was a hit, 50 telling all about his gunshots, why he's here, the whole bit. Everybody's heard ""In Da Club"", not much I can say there. ""Blood Hound"" is the infamous Ja Rule diss, pretty funny, but he went crazy dissing everybody later. ""21 Questions"" was the love song with Nate Dogg, pretty good, but there would be way too much of this on the Massacre. The bonus tracks are all good too, ""Wanksta"" being the original single, spawning a new term to the masses, ""Gotta Make it to Heaven"", ""Don't Push Me"" and ""Nobody Likes Me"", a funny song.

This actually was a really good album, and I liked it a lot when it first came out. If it sounds like I have a hard time saying it, it's True, because I can't stand what he's done to the hip hop world since its release. Now he's concerned only with women, the pop star lifestyle, and beefing with every rapper he can find, which makes me pretty mad, especially because Nas, Fat Joe, and Jada are all tougher and better than him and have been around longer. He's got nothing left to prove now. 50 did a good job here and would not be able to duplicate it ever again."
A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"No Wonder 2 Quarter has been shot nine times.  He sucks.  Period.  He can (c)rap all he wants about being in the club and money.  Its all hype, soon he'll be just as relevant as M.C. Hammer and doing commercials for insurance.  His plans are clearly obvious, look at the title!  Get Rich or Die Tryin', thus meaning, trying all the easy shots at getting fame and money.  Act tough, look tough, become the biggest hype, rap idiotically cause its something that they'll play at the clubs or raves because everybody will like it cause they are tripped out on PCP or something, and then they'll start using 50 Cent as a code word for drugs, because in time that's all anybody will remember him or at least the slogan for.  No body will care about the ""music"", only about this cool little code word that will pop up in time.  I may be wrong, but don't be surprised if it comes True.....or maybe its already in affect right now.... *gasps*

You got to hand it to 2 Quarter, his wildest dreams came True.  He got rich at the expense of the masses.  His reign of annoyance is almost at its end as apparently, his new CD flat out sucks even more.  Well, now its time of his career to die.  Don't be surprised if he puts out a CD titled ""Stay Rich or Die Tryin'"", when he runs out of ideas to avoid doing commercials with M.C. Hammer by his side.

P.S. Check out my review for the massacre as well.  If you liked this, then you'll enjoy that too."
A3STFVPM8NHJ7B,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"Alright Ill admit 50 cent can rap; But he's with Eminem! If 50 choose to go a different route then sign with a white boy who is more stale then a box of crackers open for a week. This guy couldn't get a contract or was it about the money? Em cant think of anything so he acts all cool and gobbles up all this bad ass talent, tames them, then the public eats them up and Em makes money off black men. When will someone actully realize what im saying?"
AHMAQXXYIR6DK,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4.0,"I liked 50 Cent's debut.  Warning, listen to it at your own caution despite the explicit lyrics.  This album is raw, his raps blend well with the different musics and beats and producers and he is just dynamite on the Dr. Dre-produced songs (even ""In Da Club""). The ones that Eminem produced are just as solid too.  And his song ""21 Questions"" shows his softer side and pleasant compliments to the girl he's talking about on the song.  Better than hearing the heavy gun themes that dominate the album.  But his being from the streets justifies his stand in his songs' lyrics.  One of the best albums I heard during 2003."
A1143SNKOV0ZIT,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,Total garbage.  I've never heard such trash.
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"The 2004 Grammy's voters proved what I have always thought....50 Cents is not talented!! For the first time (in a long time), the Grammy voters did the right by not giving an imposter an award. This cd sold hot, but it is not respected. 50 Cents even lost ""Best New Artist"" and had the nerve to get on stage to ""protest"". He only made himself look bad because no one saw his point (even his fellow rappers thought it was in bad taste). The worst offense to rap music this year is 50 Cents's ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin"" which is painfully dated. Gangsta rap died when 2Pac and Biggie died. Plus, this cd is not even ""gangsta"". Its corporate mindless rap, meant only to make money. I hope 50 realizes that his time is almost up."
A3LEVOCJ6J45LU,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,5 stars for punking that lil girl Ja-Rule.  cd is great too.
A461VTLW9G9YB,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,His rapping is so corny! Don't believe the hype on 50.. get a good album from Biggy instead.
A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4.0,"THIS WAS THE BREAKTHROUGH ALBUM FOR 50 CENT. AFTER  SURVIVING 9 BULLETS AND AFTER SPENDING 4 YEARS ON THE UNDERGROUND CIRCUIT, 50 FINALLY GETS HIS CHANCE TO SHINE WITH THIS ALBUM. ''MANY MEN'', ''DON'T PUSH ME'', ''P.I.M.P.'', ''GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN'', AND ''IF I CAN'T'' ARE MUST-HEAR SONGS. THOUGH THIS ALBUM IS A FAR CRY FROM 50'S MIXTAPE SONGS, THIS IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE BEST RAP ALBUMS OF THE YEAR. I DON'T CARE WHAT ANY RAP FAN MIGHT THINK, BUT THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN JA RULE'S NEWEST CD. I'D SAY THIS IS WORTH $14.00 THIS CD CONTAINS 3 BONUS TRACKS, INCLUDING ''WANKSTA''."
A2DMJA6ZHXUO2,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,ok i like every kind of music but come on 50 cent cd is only worth 50 cent may i say anymore will not cuz this cd really sucks its so stupid theres only 1 good song in that song ''in da club '' sucks big time plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz don't buy this cd ant worth the money
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW,B000V6ADNW,1,-1,3.0,"I think when people approach this cd they should do it without thinking of all the hype surrounding him. Now honestly the beats to me hands down were all hot like many cds today. As for the lyrics though only half the songs were good. I really rate this a 3.5 but if he talked about more things than just the typical I would have given it more stars. I cant hate on 50 cents even though I see a lot of other reviews doing just that. These things are his life experience (which just happens to be the same experience of many others) and like other artists he just put it into his music. Now whats good here?:
*In da Club
*What up Gangsta
*Patiently Waiting
*Many Men
*If I cant
*P.I.M.P
*Poor Lil Rich -- One of the tightest beats on the cd
*21 Questions
Overall 50 gave you himself as best as he could on this without pretending to be anything else but 50. It is not the best cd ever made like the media has hyped it to be but it is a good cd and anyone who likes hip-hop/rap over hot beats will like this. Lyrically its not the best but at least half the songs he shows you how to put both lyrics and beats together."
A36489F4G8T4E7,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"This cd is not even worth 50 cents because its just like every other trendy and commercial garbage out today. The beats are too simple and the lyrics are full of the same old gangster nonsense. This guy is so over rated and talentless that I cant even begin to descibe. Many of the mindless mtv sheep will be buying this,but if your original and like good music you will skip this trash. DO NOT BUY THIS CD."
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"People are TRYING to make 50 Cents to be the next 2Pac or Biggie. But in my opinion, he can only be compared to JaRule. People are in love with the fact that he has been shot # of times, but if people really pay attention to the music....they will realize that his music is nothing to crow about. There are only 4 songs that sound decent and they are:
 PIMP
 Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem)
 In Da Club
 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg)
That's it. But its not enough to make you buy the entire cd. As I stated before, got change?"
AYCOHV27P91NM,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"it seems like every day has been ""shorties"" birthday ever since the song ""in da club"" was released. i hate 50 cent. i hate rap music. People these days will like anything that is on the joke now known as MTV. i could go on mtv with a bandana on my head and an apple in my hand and rap about the food chain, and my albums would sell millions of copies. do not by this garbage."
A2K150EBPF8LT7,B000V6ADNW,1,-1,2.0,"Honestly, I like 50 Cent as a rapper; he has a certain honesty to him that is lacking in most rappers today. When I heard that he was signing with Dr. Dre and Eminem, I was happy for him; it was certainly the best career choice he ever made, since this has sold 4 million plus albums. But one provision though, the only reason he is in mainstream culture is beause he is associated with Eminem, which will guarantee platinum status(think D12). As far as the music goes' it gets stale and repetetive after awhile. Wanksta is a great song; not for the lyrics, but for his approach towards the fakes and phonies of the rap world. But I love 50 anyway, and God bless him in future projects."
A3BQCZNB97XUNY,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"Another generic illiterate rapper lisping over headache-inducing ""beeeeeeeeetz"", for the brainless, trendy, superficial teenagers nationwide. Whoopee. When will people realize this by NO means even remotely qualifies for music? When will people stop buying this and spew like it and pick up albums that actually take time, talent, and effort?

ADFXJSLJGN6EN,B000V6ADNW,-1,-1,1.0,"Yawwwwwwwwwwwwwn. What's the difference between this guy, Ja Rule and Puffy? Well, this guy has been shot more times, that's about it. In terms of what you get when you press play, they are xerox copies of each other. Hey, let's go ahead and do a couple of tribute albums to this guy!! He deserves it just as much as eminem, which received his first tribute cd when he had been releasing cd's for about as long as this guy has, which is about 1 year. Once again, I did try to endure going through this stuff. I just couldn't. Did anybody notice this guy barely moves his jaw and lips when he raps? That's why he gets such a boring, monotonous, mumbling kind of undecipherable vibe. Reminds me of super musical genius Ja Rule. Remember mr. J had to lyp-sync on the Mtv VMA's as he is unable to reproduce rapping live, which is not anymore difficult than normal conversational speech!! Amazing. If these are the idols of today's youth, we are doomed. People who think this is music have no idea whatsoever about what music is. None at all. Zero. Nada. Actually, less than zero. But, ignorance is bliss.  Hitting the ""no"" icon beneath this review because you are 50 fan and you THINK I am wrong is a stamp of approval - admitting that everything I have said are absolute truths. Go ahead, show us your ignorance. Those who vote in favor are rare glimmers of hope left in this world of musical ignorance. The facts speak for themselves, but only to those who have at least a basic level of musical knowledge. Now, excuse me. I have to get back to my Death Metal, Jazz, Blues, Funk, and Afro-Cuban CD's...REAL MUSIC."
AGAMDS21PJZPK,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"When I originally heard ""How To Rob"" from the ""In Too Deep"" soundtrack, I liked the song and the clever wordplay involved, but I wondered if 50 Cent had enough to carry a whole album.  Rappers like Jay Z, Ghostface Killah, Sticky Fingaz from Onyx and others weren't too pleased with what 50 had to say and they came out with their own things to say about the song.  Just as 50 was about to record his 1st single from ""Power Of The Dollar"", ""Thug Love"" w/Destiny's Child, 50 was shot multiple times.  After he recovered, 50 called his label and they acted as if 50 had never even existed.  To reestablish himelf, 50 hit the mixtape circuit and would appear on various mixtapes freestyling or with songs that were supposed to appear on ""Power Of The Dollar"".  In early 2002, Full Clip Records released ""Guess Who's Back"" which included underground songs and freestyles that included 50, G Unit, Nas, Nature, The Bravehearts and Bun B of UGK on different tracks.  Shortly after that, 50 Cent & G Unit released several mixed Cds and the buzz definitely had been recreated.  Eminem heard ""Guess Who's Back"" after he completed ""The Eminem Show"" and that was the beginning of 50 Cent being signed to Eminem's Shady Records.  50 Cent's popular mix tape track, ""Wanksta"" appeared on Eminem's ""8 Mile"" soundtrack, as well as,  ""Places To Go"" and ""Love Me"" which was  a collaboration with Eminem, 50 Cent and Obie Trice.  These songs and the mixed CDs were enough to keep 50 out in the streets until his highly anticipated CD, ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"", was released.  When ""In Da Club"" was released to radio and started appearing on MTV and BET, 50's CD was definitely going to be in demand.  Dr. Dre's club banger had everyone sayig ""Go, go, go, go, go.."".  The song would propel ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" with over 800,000 units sold in the first four days of its release.  The CD gets off a nice start with ""What's Up Gangsta"".  Fans of 50's street releases will definitely like this track.  Next up is ""Patiently Waiting"" as Eminem and 50 collaborate on the Eminem produced track.  50 and Eminem rip the track to shreds.  On ""Many Men (Wish Death)"", 50 speaks about how after being shot multiple times, how he reflects on things and how your enemies and people that are jealous of you are always plotting behind your back.  This is one of ""Get Rich Or Die Trying's"" best tracks.  Dr. Dre shows up again to produce the passion filled ""Heat"".  50 is back in street mode once again and has an anthem for anyone that wants to come at him and his G Unit crew.  ""If I Can't"" is more of a radio friendly Dre song but you will forget the commercial appeal of the song once you hear 50 rhyming to the track.  ""Back Down"" has 50 speaking on his long term beef with Ja Rule.  This is the CD's best track, in my opinion, as 50 says, ""You're a pop tart, sweetheart, you're soft in the middle..."".  Since then there have been several back and forth disses with the latest being ""Hail Mary 2003"" with Eminem, 50 Cent & Busta Rhymes.  The 2nd single, ""21 Questions"" with Nate Dogg is an ode for the ladies that will definitely continue to keep ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" on the charts for awhile.  ""Don't Push Me"" w/Lloyd Banks of G Unit and Eminem, has 50 Cent rapping a little too much like 2 Pac for some people.  I like the song as the rappers flow lovely to the Eminem's beat.  ""Poor Lil Rich"" is a Sha Money XL track that plans keep 50 in heavy club rotation along with the aforementioned ""In Da Club"" and ""P.I.M.P"".  The only song that you will have to fast forward, in my opinion, is ""Blood Hound"" with Young Buck as it sounds like DMX is barking throughout the whole song. ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" also includes ""Wanksta"", ""U Not Like Me"", and ""Life's On The Line"" as bonus tracks, but loyal 50 fans have heard these tracks already.  50 recently released a DVD, ""The New Breed"" that included a bonus CD with 3 tracks:  ""True Loyalty"" with G Unit, ""8 Mile Road"" (G Unit Remix)with G Unit, and the Dr. Dre produced ""In Da Hood"" with Brooklyn.  To anyone who doesn't know G Unit is 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Bang 'Em Smurf and a cast of other characters.  G Unit recently signed with Interscope Records, so a G Unit CD and a Lloyd Banks solo CD should be out by the end of the year and expect a new 50 Cent CD by February 2004.  For 50 Cent the sky is the limit.  If you judge ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" by just ""In Da Club"" and ""21 Questions"" then you will be saddenly mistakened.  This CD has more than club friendly songs on it.  Fans of 50's street anthems will enjoy this CD as well.  I wonder how Columbia feels now that 50 Cent has sold more than 4 million records in 10 weeks?  I would advise you to get ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" and ""Guess Who's Back"" to start your 50 library.  FREE YAYO!!!!

A3W0POMI33YQXQ,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"How can you not know who 50 Cent is?  50 Cent has done something that hasn't been done in a while.  A COMPLETE DEEBO of the Industry.  Strategy or fate?  A little of both.  His controversial How To Rob garnered much attention.  Then consequently he was shot multiple times and survived through it all. (there's your street cred).  By this time, the bootleg of his supposes debut 'Power Of The Dollar' was hot on the streets and the internet.  Quickly following that, 50 gets dropped from a deal.  Later on he releases Guess Who's Back and again has the streets talking.  By this time his beef with Ja Rule & Murder Inc. is in full effect.  Somehow Eminem gets tapes of 50 Cent and they begin chitter chatter.  Then in an almost assassin like fashion 50 releases THREE mixtapes to the street featuring his crew G-Unit (50 Cent Is The Future, No Mercy No Fear, God's Plan).  Uh oh...now he has the streets on lock...only one more step.  50 Cent signs to Shady Records, features on the biggest hip hop movie soundtrack at the time (8 Mile) and releases his first single entitled ""Wanksta"" and grabs the media by the throat.  By the time everyones singing on Wanksta, Dr. Dre produces the hit ""IN Tha Club"", an instant club anthem, and has everybody EAGERLY anticipating the album.  The album soon follows and sells nearly 900, 000 copies the first week...topping Snoop Dogg's debut album record for most copies sold in the first week.  Hook, Line, sinker.
Now about a month after the initial hype I have come to see this album as a modern classic.  It doesn't hold a candle to universal hip hop classics such as Doggystyle, Illmatic, or SouthernPlayalisticCadillacMuzik.  But the reason it's a classic is because 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin has/ will change the game.  And any album that can do that has to be considered a classic.  There are so many standouts on this album....""Back Down"", What Up Gangsta, Many Men, In Da Club, Heat, High All The Time, 21 Questions....the whole album is bumpin.  There's no filler and I can definitely play this joint over and over straight through.  Hotness.  The beats are top notch, the lyrics are tight, the flows are on point (even with the slur; but keep in mind he was shot in the jaw/mouth area), the guests don't bog down the album...Overall just a great album.
Just trust me on this one...this cd is definitely a must have.  50 Cent is something special.  I don't know what it is but whatever it is 50 Cent definitely has it.  If he can stay alive...he will do many great things in hip hop.  Let's just hope his talent and controversial lyrics don't lead to another talent being lost.  5 stars!"
A153RFYGNYJP0T,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4.0,"This is a great debut album. I would't go as far to say 50 is in the ranks of pac and biggie, in fact he's no where near them but don't hate on fiddy for doing what he's doing. this is great album. i'm not going to make the call on a masterpiece i'll wait till his next album to do this. but this is a good album to listen to and jam to. i can only say that you will not be wasting your money when/if you buy this cd. go pick it up, the lyrics are up to par and of couse the beats are the best [dre did them], so if you don't have it by now, you missing out, don't do that to yourself, cop it ASAP."
AA8HFTJIAQA4G,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4.0,"Well we know dude is rich. I mean dude was one of the biggest drug dealers in the NY. He got 1 mil to sign with Eminem. He has already made about 1 1/2 mil from his independent CD ""Guess Who's Back""(he got 5 dollars for every CD sold and he's sold abt 250,000 copies already) and This CD has sold about 1.8 million copies in a week and a half. So yeah dude is rich. Is the bang to hype ratio right should be the proper question. I'd have to say yes. Listening to this CD to me is like the first time is saw ""New Jack City"" or heard the infamous GETO BOYS. It's just unadulterated thugism! Being shot 9 times and havin such a horrible childhood really proves to be a backdrop for this CD. The CD starts with ""What up Gangsta"". A cool lil song settin the tone for the rest of the CD. Track 3 ""Patiently Waiting"" features Eminem.. They go real hard on this one. Great sound effects on this one. One of the better cuts on the CD. Track 4 ""Many Men"" is cool but I was really feelin the lyrics, especially when he talks about dude that shot him. Of course track 5 ""In Da Club"" probably will be the club song of the year. I've never heard a song looped so much in the club. They play this song for 10 minutes straight and the club stays hype! Track 6 ""High All the Time"" is his tribute to the sticky icky! Good cut. Track 7 ""Heat"" is classic Dre production. This song is just raw! A gun cocks in the background on the wholeeeee song. Track 8 is another Dre staple song. Track 9 ""Blood Hound"" is a cool song with a nice little chorus. He sounds alot like Bushwick Bill on this one. Track 10 ""Back down"" is one of the CD highlights. Dude rips Ja Rule apart!!!! Track 11 ""P I M P"" is another banger. Track 12 ""Like My Style"" features his crew G UNIT. My  2nd favorite cut on the CD is track 14 ""21 Questions"". It's a Dre production with Nate Dogg. This song is essentially a song talkin to a girl and askin her questions to see where her mind is at. Great song and Nate Dogg hasn't sounded this good in a longgggg time. The beat is off da hook. Track 15 ""Don't Push Me"" features Eminem again and once again is STRONG. Track 16 ""Gotta make it to Heaven, I'm going thru Hell"" pretty much sums up this CD. Just raw East Coast Gansta Rap! ""Wanksta"" makes an appearance here but really it's just a playful radio cut to me. Overall this CD is great. He puts his foot down and even steps to Nas and Jigga. My favorite tracks are 2-11, 14-16. I personally haven't heard anything this raw in a long long time. The hype for this dude is incredible and fortunately the CD comes about as close as it possibly could to that. After a few earchecks this is a must have for the True hip hop fan.."
A3OLZXHFGUAMWW,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"okay this cd is worth the cashflow but it's nowhere near on the same pages as the chronic, straight outta compton, or enter the wu still a good cd and 50's rhymes are tight and yes he disses ja fool on here and those 2 have some serious beef."
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B000V6ADNW,1,1,4.0,"50 Cent has surprisingly went from ""Most Hated"" to ""Most Anticipated"" to ""Most Celebrated"". You may remember him from 1999's single, ""How to Rob an Industry N"", where he jokingly talked about robbing many famous artists like Mariah Carey (who was on his label, Columbia) while ribbing them at the same time. Not many artists found that funny, the song turned into a gimmick and soon he was dropped from Columbia (maybe it wasn't a good idea to sing about robbing your labelmates???). During his downtime, he made many foes, including Jay-Z (in 1999's ""It's Hot"", Jigga rapped, ""I'm about the dollar/WTF is 50 Cent?""), and I think that he's even been shot more times than 2Pac. But after Eminem picked 50 up and signed him to his Shady Records label, and 50 dropping ""Wanksta"" and a few underground albums with his crew, the ""GGGgggg-uuuUnit!"", the streets embraced him and anticipation was at an all-time high.
Get Rich or Die Tryin' is one of those debut albums that actually lives up to its hype. In fact, if you're in your car playing it to the end, you may just feel like playing the whole album again. While the lyrical content may not break any new ground, 50 Cent, whose flow sounds like a mixture of Jay-Z, 2Pac, and Mase, knows how to deliver it WELL. See ""Gotta Make it to Heaven"" (an otherwise played-out subject matter with gangsta rappers), where he gives the topic an interesting twist, and ""In the Club"", where he takes topics like cars, drinks, and women and make them sound original. Fans may say that song sounds radio-friendly, but he didn't go to mainstream, mainstream went to him.
The production on here is also stellar; not one track sounds similar to another, a problem on most rap albums today. Check out the dark beat on ""Patiently Waiting"" with Eminem and ""21 Questions"" and notice the difference in production. And what would a rap album be without a diss record? (See ""Wanksta"" and the funnier ""Back Down"", both aimed at Ja Rule.)
Even though ""P.I.M.P."" is embarrasingly old-school and lazy on 50's part, Get Rich... is one of those rarities in hip-hop: a highly anticipated album that truly delivers, by a rapper who disregarded gimmicks to let people know why Slim Shady signed him."
A2L3WEVFOCA7OY,B000V6ADNW,1,1,5.0,"50 Cent's 2nd album ""Get Rich or Die Trying"" is worthy of all the hype surronding it. Finally 50 has got the backing (Aftermath/Shady), and the beats needed to make an excellent album. 50 has come a long way since ""How to Rob"", remember first hearing him on ""In Too Deep Soundtrack"" and I knew then he would blow one day. Underground for a long time, nice to see him drop an album commerically, and see that he hasn't sold out on anything. Executive Produced by Dr. Dre and Eminem, with guest appearances coming from Em, G-Unit members- Young Buck, Tony Yayo and Lyoyd Banks, and the king of sick R&B hooks Nate Dogg. Ninteen tracks total including intro and 3 bonus tracks. Standout tracks for me at the moment are: ""Patiently Waiting"" Feat. Eminem, ""Many Men"", lead single ""In Da Club"", ""High All the Time"", ""If I can't"" and the relaxed banging ""21 Questions"" feat. Nate Dogg"" and the adrenaline laced ""Gotta Make it to Heaven"". The 3 bonus tracks ""Wanksta"" (8 Mile soundtrack), ""U Not Like Me"" and ""Life's on the Line"" close off the album well. Full of tight Production, entertaining lyrics and blazing beats ""Get Rich or Die Trying"" is one of those albums people are going be bumping for years to come."

A19GQNQLVEAGH0,B000V6O3CE,-1,1,5.0,"I'm not a huge fan of Maroon 5. I like Moves Like Jagger and Payphone... but most of his other stuff just doesn't click.
This on the other hand, is something else entirely...

It's such a sad song. A song that seems to have such little hope for the protagonist (I'm not sure what they're called in songs). She will Be Loved is about a guy who loves a girl who has some sort of issue. Either she is mentally unstable? Used by other people in wicked ways? Etc. This scenario dooms the protagonist to this longing for a person who he will never get... because she can't respond. Not that she won't. She CAN'T.

It's a very sad song that has little hope.... but that's life. It doesn't always turn out great for us, and this song reflects that. It has a great tune to it that sounds like the protagonist's fate. Adam Levine has a great unique voice that brings home the lyrics. And the story itself (a plot worthy of a book, i should add) is heartbreaking.

Buy it... but don't expect a happy ending, lol"

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000V6M7TA,1,1,4.0,"The most historically successful chart climber of all time, better than the Beatles, better than K. Clarkson, and a surprising #1, this song really deserves it. It has all the elements to make it radio-friendly, from the catchiness, to the dancing, to the aspect that makes me karaoke to this song everytime it comes on. Amazingly, this song also sounds better censored too, the language in the original seems out of place and downright weird, but the 'phhh' in this version actually adds to the song.

Overall, I love any non-rap song that makes it to #1 on the Hot 100, but this is one of the better ones to achieve the feat in recent years, along with Avril. This song is also not better than Maroon 5's classic, ""She Will Be Loved,"" but it's a good song none the less."
A3JH1L2JTX27EX,B000V6NWS0,1,1,5.0,Both I and my mate are bass players.  He plays this kind of music and he loves this bass line in this song.  So he is a happy camper!

AJOO2EH0SD09M,B000V6O3HO,1,1,5.0,I love Maroon 5. The audio and price for this song are great. Wish they had a deal for best of Maroon 5 hits.
A268P9HZD272Q7,B000V6O3HO,1,1,5.0,"I listened to this song because it was part of the soundtrack of the movie Something's gotta give. I enjoyed this song so much from the movie that I bought the mp3.
Sunday Morning has a jazz-pop sound, great rhythms and great harmony. This song also show cases Adam Levine's voice with the lead vocals. I already liked some of Maroon 5's videos and singles. The single Sunday Morning shows this group can be versatile with their choice of music. Great song!"
A6ZKAHCONUHX5,B000V6O3HO,1,1,5.0,"""Sunday Morning"" is probably Maroon 5's best song ever. Listen and you'll know why this album from Maroon 5 was so popular and put Maroon 5 on the map."
A1BX06Z8YC3RLS,B000V6O3HO,1,1,4.0,"As I am a relative new Maroon 5 fan, I purchased this song and really enjoy listening to it. It has a really good feel and vibe to it. It is in my playlist while I am cooking."
AMSG031VEU439,B000V6O3HO,1,1,5.0,"I usually do not have a lot of ""pop"" music in my library, however, since the genre is now so large and includes Maroon 5, MB20 and others - I have so much more.  I really like Adam's voice, the music and his sexy tats! This song reminds me of exactly my view of ""Sunday Morning.""  Excellent!"
A1DO9LRCO23EOM,B000V6O3HO,-1,1,5.0,"Heard this song on The Voice and liked it.  Music tastes are subjective however and differ from person to person, so I would recommend anybody considering buying this song listen to the preview clip first."

A15NPZAX4Y6UVH,B000V6RA5G,1,1,5.0,"I bought this song because I just love it and Bob Marley. My son heard it and now he sings it all the time. He's four and he walks around saying, Don't worry about a thing, cause every little thing is gonna be alright! It cracks me up but also makes me so happy that he's being exposed to such an amazing artist. Bob Marley's music is for every generation. I love this song so much. Perfect to listen to at any time, any age, any where!"
AKB29O6CO1VRM,B000V6RA5G,-1,1,5.0,"I thought the name of the song was ""Every little thing's gonna be alright!"""

A3QK6FQW5Q3TYS,B000V6RA5G,1,1,5.0,This was one of the songs that my son chose before his death to be played at his memorial.  It is such a great classic.  I couldn't find the thumb drive that had the five songs on it so had to purchase them for this year's memorial.  I find $1.29 or less a good price for each song.  It was easy to purchase and easy to download.  p.s.  I have copied the songs to several locations so I don't have to purchase them again :) .

ARBJN3CA3H34Q,B000V6RA5G,1,1,5.0,I had seen folks wearing shirts with a Bob Marley image on them. Could not remember if I had ever heard a Bob Marley song or not.

A1KE19CDYIO2YN,B000V6O39M,1,1,5.0,Written by frontman Levine for their 2002 debut album Songs About Jane.  Reached #18 on Billboard Hot 100 and #13 on UK Singles Chart.

A1BLH6NVH1IH77,B000V6O39M,1,1,5.0,I got a great quality song for free.  The amazon mp3 set up works well.  There weren't any problems with the song and it is nice to be able to download it and put on my phone or iTunes with no problems.

AALCY3O1G5A9T,B000V6PXLE,1,1,5.0,Hayley is about the best classical crossover female artist.  She recorded this at about age 15. Her voice is so beautiful.
A4FBU70Y5BLGH,B000V6PXLE,1,1,5.0,"Amazon offers such great big box deals, I so rarely buy singles anymore, but with Miss Westenra's 'Dark Waltz,' I had to make an exception--the introduction and interlude are wonderfully and quintessentially Celtic, almost Lord of the Rings in tone. Truth be told, I thought Miss W was performing and INSTRUMENTAL, and then she sang! And, oh, I was in love again with the song AND the siren. I was hopelessly and helplessly bewitched by the beauty of this piece.  For your own sanity, don't walk away from the sample. HIGHLY recommended..."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000V6POF4,1,1,4.0,"When it comes to making great pop/rock music, no group has been able to feel as a great guilty pleasure like Maroon 5. Although it has been so long since they've made a great song, they still know what it really takes. Wake Up Call, the secong single from their sophmore album It Won't Be Soon Before Long is a very upbeat driven song that remains as deep of a staple to what Adam and the band had captured to fans alike for the past several years. It really is a great track from the album, while the lyrics showcase a man who is scorned from a cheating so-called significant other. I hope Maroon 5 can make another great single like this.

Song: B 1/2-"

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000V6TO82,-1,1,4.0,"This song, while not great, is a good radio pop song. There's nothing bad to it, but on the other hand, nothing really great to it either. So overall, a standard radio pop song. Nothing more, nothing less. But it is a whole lot better than the stinker that is ""Wake Up Call."""

AVTQB8FI2KW8Q,B000V6TOH8,1,1,4.0,"This hit by the group ""Maroon 5' is very catchy.  No great deep meaning (which I don't really want in popular music), just a real good song to listen to."
AZMVQAY73T2CJ,B000V6TOH8,1,1,4.0,I love Maroon 5 songs. Every song means something to someone. This song is there for you to open up and feel with.
A2JQ2QAZUV71WZ,B000V7C370,1,1,5.0,Ringo really makes the song sound like no one else ever sang this song but him.. It is beautifully rich and well sung  It reminds you that there were 4 Beatles and they all sang on there albums. And it's clear from this song Ringo is more than just the drummer.
A2HGQ2FZNXH1GH,B000V7C370,1,1,5.0,"Ringo had a little bit of success on his own after the Beatles broke up and this song was one of his most popular.  For me, it brings back fond memories of a time when I was young and the world was new.  In those days, I lived with an ear close to the FM radio and this is one of the songs I always loved to hear.  Recording quality leaves a little to be desired but it's still a great old song."
A1RKS0O04U3GY3,B000V7C370,-1,-1,3.0,either you like it or you don't. This gets old after a while. I don't have seven more words for this review.
A135GWMXMTR58Z,B000V7C370,1,1,5.0,. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great
AFYT8BUARSTE7,B000V7C370,1,1,5.0,"I believe some of the best music produced by these fellows was released as solo efforts after the Beatles disbanded. This isn't a put-down of Beatles songs at all, but a very positive comment on the quality of their solo efforts. Photograph is, to me, a fine example of the talent of these individual artists."
A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000V7C370,1,1,5.0,"Hypothethically, if you made an album of The Beatles' best solo songs, it would make sense to gather them from the early years after their infamous split. This paradigm is not new, and its concept was introduced by a columnist whom I cannot recall, so I have to paraphrase it by memory.

Anyway, I would vote for Ringo Starr's ""Photograph,"" arguably the best song of his post Fab Four career.  Contractually, Ringo was given rights to sing one song per Beatles' album, so this one fits the bill.  Can you ""imagine"" (sorry) an album with ""My Sweet Lord,"" ""Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five,"" ""Imagine,"" ""Love,"" ""My Love,"" ""Listen to What the Man Said,"" ""Give Me Love,"" ""What Is Life?"" ""Whatever Gets You Through the Night,"" and, of course, this one?  If George and Ringo didn't feel like they got the support they desired back in the day, they sure make up for it by (characteristically) supporting each other (George allegedly wrote most of the song) and with a ""little help"" from Ringo's many friends.  Gloriously, ""Photograph"" is as grand and corny as they get.  The rewards are twice that."

A20S4M728FWXSE,B000V7HJ2E,1,1,4.0,I remember listening to this song by Ringo Star when I was in my teens.  Just like I remembered it.  Good sound quality.
A366S12KCZ280V,B000V7HJ2E,1,1,5.0,"After the breakup of The Beatles each member would of course go on to form their own solo career. John, Paul and George would certainly go on to have hits songs and chart toppers but it always seemed to me that Ringo was over looked a bit in what he accomplished in the years after going out on his own. Yeah he maybe didn't have as big an impact as his former bandmates on the charts but that doesn't mean he wasn't putting out some great music. He most definitely was. The album ""Photograph: The Very Best Of Ringo"" (a greatest hit compilation) is good proof of that. His music maybe didn't have the depth and social message to it as the other former lads were but Ringo's music I always thought was great good times, party kind of music sure to please and entertain anyone looking for some uplifting music.

My favorite Ringo song of all time one of his earliest hits, ""It Don't Come Easy"". Not necessarily one of his ""party"" songs but with a good beat, strong lyrics and Ringo in fine voice makes for an enjoyable piece of music. If you could only download one song by Ringo from his solo career you wouldn't go wrong adding this to your MP3 player."

AQ75S7221N12Z,B000V7HJ2E,1,1,5.0,"At the time of this release, Beatles have broken up , and John Lennon  (Instant Karma) and Paul McCartney (Another Day) had already released their first hit singles, (also Lennons Plastic Ono Band/Give Peace a Chance) and albums. It was 1971. Naturally at the time people watch the great song writing team. But then Harrison released ""My Sweet Lord"", (late 1970) (big hit) and released ""All Things Must Pass"".  And Ringo Starr released  ""It Don't Come Easy"", (a George Harrison Song) in 1971. There are the original versions of George Harrison doing this song earlier as a ""guide"" for Ringo. .  Being a Beatle Freak, I heard the song on the radio, then George Harrisons guitar break (CLASSIC) and was hooked. Ringo's second single (Beaucoups of Blues being the regrettable first) it was a top 5 hit here in the US. How many groups after splitting up can say all the members had a top 5 hit the following year? The song itself had an all star band, (Klaus Voormann on bass guitar, Stephen Stills on piano, Badfinger members on background vocals), This song is a classic, hard driving , and has a ""spectorish"" production but George Martin the prime influence, at Abbey Road Studios. A great song."

A2UHIQNHUD3XFR,B000V8A95C,1,1,5.0,I should have bought the online CD and not the overpriced on at the theater.  This track was not on any CD available there.  I found it online after a court running said any ripping of CDs counts as piracy.  I like my music in the Cloud and accessible to any device and so I bought the extended edition MP3 album at a fraction of the cost of the CD at the theater.  I highly recommend this soundtrack and enjoy listening to it.
A3R4794K2RVU1S,B000V8CBB2,1,1,5.0,"It's difficult to say if a song is timeless, but ten years later, I could say already. Times have changed, beats, tempos, lyrics have taken the trend of club hits. Enrique now has songs like ""I like it"" and ""Tonight I'm lovin' you."" Mr. Iglesias continues to give us hit after hit.

However, this song is nostalgic already, even just after just ten years.

My thoughts:

- Wonderful pace. The instrumentals, pauses, soft and high notes are perfect and timed well. Many songs are repetitive but you don't sense that from this song. The lyrics and chorus may be similar, but the tone and his voice definitely transforms throughout the song, building with tension, emotion, and heartfelt love.

- Fun to sing out aloud. I sing this song every time I go to a karaoke place. So easy to follow and sing a long. Lots of fun!

- Solid lyrics. Full of metaphors, variety, and rhythm, this song will take you away."

A32LR27V9CW2IA,B000V8C63K,-1,1,4.0,"I just saw Wicked after so long - I had no idea of the impact of this moment in the show, and have been trying to find some way of regenerating that experience.
I guess I'm best off looking to youtube, as the cast recording, while impeccable, can not possibly recreate the audience's experience. In retrospect I wouldn't expect it to, unless it was one of the live performances, eg Les MIz.
The vocals are fantastic, but for me, the context and the shock of what is physically happening to Elphaba is what took my breath away.
So take this for what it is, a studio recreation of a classic Broadway moment. But look to the Youtubes for some of the Widked performances or even concert footage of Idina Menzel performing ""Defying Gravity"" to bring back the emotion experience you remember from the show."
A1XDXAK1L7UCKT,B000V8C63K,1,1,5.0,This is an amazingly beautiful and uplifting song. Wicked is one of the best musicals on Broadway and you can't go wrong with the music from it. This is by far my favorite of the show.

A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000V8CJI2,1,1,5.0,"Dolly Parton made music history when she rerecorded her classic ""I Will Always Love You"" for the soundtrack to her 1982 film ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"". This version went to #1 making Dolly the only artist to ever have the same song go to #1 twice.

 More pop sounding than her 1974 version ""I Will Always Love You"" was produced by her band leader Gregg Perry. Many have said this version is a bit inferior than 1974's, but Dolly's voice here is pure, heartfelt and filled with emotion. Dolly herself was going through a breakdown in her own personal life at the time of this recording in early 1982 as she battled weight problems, family issues, an attempt by people to blackmail her and a personal heartache that she refuses to talk about. This all led to the amazing vocal range on this track.

 Also, the song would only peak at #53 Pop, but would garner Dolly a Grammy nod for Best Country Vocal Performance."
A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000V8CJI2,1,1,5.0,"For anyone wanting to hear the debut of ""I Will Always Love You"" look no further than here. Recorded in June, 1973 at RCA Record's Nashville Sound Studios and released the following year Dolly Parton introduced the world to the greatest song ever written. She had written the tune in honor of her duet partner and mentor Porter Wagoner.

 By 1973 after being the biggest duet team in country music history for 6 years Dolly wanted to go off on her own, conquer the pop music market and star in films. Porter was totally against this as he thought Dolly could never make it in popular music or in motion pictures and he felt Dolly owed him a great deal of gratitude for helping her be so big in the country field. The fighting got worse and the arguing ever worser as Porter refused to reason with Dolly, so Dolly thought to herself, ""You can't talk to this man, so do what you so best: go home and write a song and perhaps he will somehow understand what I need to do"". So, one night in the late spring of 1973 with only her guitar in her music room at her Nashville mansion Dolly wrote ""I Will Always Love You"" in less than an hour. The following day she went to Porter's office, and knowing she was going to go one way or another, told Porter, ""I wrote a song for you"". He sat at his desk and cried all the way through it and told her that was the greatest song she ever wrote.

 When Dolly went into the recording studio to cut ""I Will Always Love You"" a few weeks later she herself cried through the entire song. To this very day it remains one of her greatest recordings.

 ""I Will Always Love You"" came out on Dolly's breathough album ""Jolene"" as the second single, hit #1 and quickly became Dolly's signature song. The following year Linda Ronstadt covered the track on her ""Prisoner in Disguise"" album, although it omitted the last verse.

 Also in 1975 ""I Will Always Love You"" (Dolly's original version) made its first ever appearance on film in Martin Scorsese's ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" when the character of Alice takes a break from singing in the bar she works at and is having a talk with her soon-to-be boyfriend. Unfortunately, Dolly nor the song did not receive screen credit."

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000V9B4YG,1,-1,3.0,"When it comes to great music of the industry, we've really not seen as much from rock music that have really shined. In the case with Bon Jovi, they've tuned down the feeling on their latest record, in regards to a more somber feel, as with regards on their latest single. You Want To Make A Memory, the opening single from Lost Highway is a elequent melloncollie song that reflects on heartbreak and divorce, similar to what Richie Sambora had went through the past couple of years. the song really shines nicely as a down to Earth song that deals with empty and being lonely. Although it doesn't have the edge to bring in new Bon Jovi fans, it works nicely for those die hards who want to make more great memories.

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000V9AUC8,-1,-1,3.0,"Fergie's Best Isn't That Great, March 19, 2008

Last summer had its share of good music as always, and we at least had a little variety on the radio. Enter, Fergie, the seemingly sex-crazed double-entree singer who sung about her humps, and London Bridge, and a myriad of other metaphors. But this time, instead of doing that stuff, it's a breakup song, with acoustic guitar, and only the hint of a beat.

The lyrics aren't too bad, pretty simple, with hints of 'where did that come from?' Such as, ""We'll play jacks and uno cards."" The verses are overall OK, nothing to brag about, and the vocals lack in some parts. However, the chorus comes out strong, and it and the acoustic guitar really make this a good song.

So overall, a good song, not a great one. A great change for Fergie, and definitely her best song by far, Black Eyed Peas or not. But in terms of getting this song, I wouldn't buy it, but I'd get it by other means if you know what I mean."

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000V9AUC8,1,1,4.0,"There is so much you can say about Fergie from her fame as part of The Black Eyed Peas. But, her solo debut The Dutchess has had a few surprise songs. Big Girls Don't Cry, the third single from that album is a very heartfelt, and down to Earth ballad. It is a real departure from her other hit songs which are more upbeat. It has a simplistic feel that matches that is very mellow and elequent. I like the song a whole lot, because it shows a more natural tone to Fergie's soulful voice, and what she does to make it worth while. I really hope Fergie can keep making more songs like this one on her next record, or with The Black Eyed Peas.

A1BX06Z8YC3RLS,B000V9EQN2,1,1,5.0,I think this song is simply beautiful. Hearing a man declare how much he loves his woman with such smoothness is nice.
A3KD7AUYR7XY0L,B000V9EQN2,1,1,5.0,Everything great thanks much
A32HSUK2KKQ0I9,B000V9EQN2,1,1,4.0,This is the only song I like of Thicke. I ordered this for my MP3 player. Enjoy listening to but some of the words are wosssssssssssssssss
A2N98HLXPP8TP4,B000V9EQN2,1,1,5.0,Great love song.  very smooth like jazz.  You can enjoy it in the car or at home with your spouse/partner.
A2X3E1S9BLQOD5,B000V9EQN2,1,1,4.0,I grew up in the age of Actor Alan Thicke and was often interested when I hear he had a son that became a singer. I heard this song playing one day and was blown away. His Falsetto voice and the words that sound like Love. Impressive way to make a name for yourself and not have to stand in your fathers shoes. Well done Robin!
A2LMRQVT4ZWPOF,B000V9EQN2,1,1,5.0,If you like a sexy song this is the one. The guitar playing in the beginning makes you think sex
AP3TLU03FRVBL,B000V9EQN2,-1,1,5.0,I was going through a breakup after 6 years and this song told just how I felt. Lost. It works for me.
A6IP5RDSRW4TM,B000V9EQN2,1,-1,3.0,This man has a way with making you feel sexy the way he sings. His voice is so soothing and makes you really want to express yourself.
A2GQIMT1HONU58,B000V9GA5Y,1,1,5.0,I love this cd
A16JW2PQ3F10OV,B000V9GA5Y,-1,-1,3.0,"First Amy Winehouse music I've ever purchased.  It's not the kind of music I normally listen to, but I wanted something a little different and it fit the bill.  My favorite song is Rehab, ironically.  Too bad so much talent was wasted on drugs and alcohol."
ADXNFRR2AI063,B000V9GA5Y,1,1,5.0,"The late Amy Winehouse made such an important contribution to pop and rock musically internationally. Her influence will never diminish or be forgotten. Ronnie Spector's cover of her song ""Back to Black"" is a fitting tribute from one great legendary lady to another. The CD represents some of Amy's best moments in the studio and will always remain a much sought after classic!!! Amy Winehouse will always be sorely missed by all who knew and loved her and those who enjoyed and listened to her music. Amy was the best and so ahead of her time!!!"
A3KQI694I9KL5L,B000V9GA5Y,1,1,5.0,"I love her, she has a funky, smooth and black style of singing. It comes from her heart and real life experiences and she write them so well on her cd's."
A1MND3QHN446KD,B000V9GA5Y,1,1,5.0,"With Blues and R & B infused and inspired flavor, the late Amy Winehouse
brought forth eleven songs about loss, love, sorrow, pain, alcohol, and
dealing with life.  Must listen.  Almost all the songs are my favorite
except for the remix of You Know I'm No Good (I could have done without
the rapping).  Must listen and must buy!  An talent gone too soon."
A12C4QAMJKTH2M,B000V9GA5Y,1,1,5.0,"This is, without a doubt, the best complete...from song 1 to song 11...the best CD I have heard in decades!!  I have been a fan of Winehouse's sound since ""Rehab,"".  However, sadly, I never dug any deeper into her catalog except for her big hit and ""Valerie""--Oh, what a mistake.  There is NOT a bad cut on this CD and I have listened to it over and over, often hitting the ""back"" button while driving just to hear certain ""riffs"" in a tune over again!!  Winehouse had that superb soulful, blues-driven voice they only few posess...among the ladies, Ella, Etta, Bonnie Raitt,Diana Krall, and the great ""Lady Day"".  Heavens, if only Amy could have made it thru her deamons, we would have been seeing her produce a catalog of music that would have been remembered by millions for decades...and thru the generations.  Great CD, Bargain Price...I only hate I missed years of listening to this great artist..gone far, far too soon...What a great piece of work, Amy...you are missed!!"
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000V9GA5Y,1,1,5.0,"The first time I heard Amy sing was when my daughter gave me her player to listen to Rehab.  This was just after Amy made the cover of Rolling Stone.  I honestly had a hard time believing that a voice like that came from this white girl, but then I caught a VH1 show featuring her in concert, and I loved everything she did on stage during that little bit of time I saw her sing on TV.  It wasn't just her voice that you heard--you saw her personal style, and you could feel everything she put into her music.  This album is a pure classic, and I for one miss her."
A2UN8PV06633AD,B000V9GA5Y,1,1,5.0,I got this for a spectacular price and being a music lover just couldn't pass it up! A great album from an artist gone too soon.....
A17PH3CJW86JL1,B000V9GA5Y,1,1,5.0,"I had never really listened to Amy Winehouse's music before I bought this album. I am very impressed with her vocals. I enjoyed each and every song and the music was fantastic to listen to.. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoyed her music, and anyone who wants to hear how Amy performed. This was a good purchase."

AIAIA2L0HC35S,B000V9HXTQ,1,1,5.0,I thought this guy was going to be the next Steve Tyler because of his mannerisms. I really like this song because I think it deals with the really real topic of unresolved feelings while in another relationship.  Just because you have moved forward doesn't mean you've moved on.
A4ONUBHZCLBL6,B000V9HXTQ,1,1,5.0,"I love the melody and the beat of this song, its easy to understand and Hinder ha alot about feelings in their songs."

A2ZT4LD1PFNZJX,B000VAISKI,1,1,4.0,Excellent Happy Pop Tune. This is a sweet song performed by a sweet girl. Puppy love song for all ages.
A3G3XO6IDVMC7X,B000VAISKI,1,1,4.0,"I have been hearing this on the radio for months and couldn't find out the name of it.  Finally one day I had my cell phone and I wasn't driving, so I used my song ID to find out the name.  I love the lyrics.  This song really paints a picture of her emotions."
A3HISVPHKACNFE,B000VAISKI,1,1,5.0,"Great song. very happy with the download...went very smoothly. Also, very happy with the price. Thank you very very much!"

A1GWGQ6KO00EL6,B000VAISKI,1,1,5.0,"Colbie Caillat has such a pure and sweet voice, but also so fun and different.  I'm loving her new style of music more and more."
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000VAISKI,1,1,4.0,"It's so slow and just makes you wanna go play on the beach or something.

Then the wherever, wherever, wherever you go's come in and you melt.

Colbie has a way of getting u sucked in with a pleasantly-relaxing melody and the strum of her guitar.

4.25 stars.

end note: And I know Colbie is voicing about her first time, or the times that she is ""doing it"", but the song's vibe is so relaxing, you won't care too much!"
ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000VAISKI,1,1,5.0,"Twenty-two year old sensation Colby Caillat found herself a star after hard work and great efforts in self-promotion  on the famous and globally renown networking site, MySpace.  It even lead to a record contract!  ""Bubbly"" is an up-tempo, folksy little song with a simple message--Colby has found herself a man who makes her feel downright effervescent (hence, the title).  This song takes me back to another time.....I feel like I am in a coffee shop thirty years ago, listening to a ""bubbly"" beach blonde girl sing about the joys of young love.  You'll definitely enjoy this song........"
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000VAISKI,1,1,4.0,"There just really haven't been many good songs from newcomers this past year. But for newcomer Colbie Caillat, she has been one of those few surprises that comes elequently. Her debut single, Bubbly from her debut, Coco was a very light and simplistic tune. It shows that she has a relaxing, calming feeling with her songwriting. I was very surprised with this song, because she doesn't sound like she is a prop like Britney Spears has shown as a trainwreck. As for Colbie, she definitely is starting with a nice feel-good song that is well worth listening too. I hope she keeps it up.

Song: B"
AD6I262P3O3KH,B000VA392U,1,1,5.0,ok
A2KMRC9TS9YGCW,B000VA392U,1,1,5.0,"my parents just had their 50th wedding anniversary, so we threw them a party and we had to get this song for the list since it was my mothers favorite."
A1RKS0O04U3GY3,B000VA392U,-1,-1,2.0,"thought I liked it but it gets old quickly. oh, this is an old song. Dah. I have it on my oldies list."
A2HTT1IV6Q4MKL,B000VAMKRA,-1,1,5.0,This is a #1 for Colbie this song has a place in everyone's heart and can be related to at one time or another
A26F0QHBB1NW3H,B000VAMKRA,1,1,5.0,"She has such a beautiful voice and her songs are great and I really love this album, but mostly this song."
A1GWGQ6KO00EL6,B000VAMKRA,1,1,5.0,"I'm really starting to love some of the new style artist out there, and one of them is Coldie Caillat.  A guy at work showed me this song on youtube and I loved it.  So glad it was available to download."
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000VAMKRA,-1,-1,1.0,"This song is supposed to be a summer love song, that's sweet and cute, but let me say, Taylor Swift blows this out of the water, and half-way across Asia. Ironically, the two are doing a duet, which is like Rosie O' Donnell doing a duet with Leona Lewis. Totally mismatched.

All sarcasm aside, the song has more cheese than Wisconsin, more horrid sounds than a Chinese takeout kitchen, and more annoyingness than Rosanne. Really, whenever I'm forced to listen to this song at the gas station, I want to light a match, and drop it.

Boyce Avenue's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for, but it's still a 4-star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history. What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it's sort of catchy. It's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity. So in summarizing, don't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds, because you'll choke, and don't listen while you're depressed, because you'll kill yourself. Like drugs, JUST SAY NO!"
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000VAMKRA,1,1,4.0,"Yes, it was an overplayed song but it's still good. Honestly, I haven't heard it in quite some time (over a month).

The only complaint, while soft, it's chorus is very repetitive. It stands on its own feet up against Bubbly otherwise.

4 stars."
A21E8F3G6F0PVG,B000VBBY6C,-1,1,5.0,"Although the lyrics make little sense whatsoever, you'll be singing along in no time.  The shameless glee and glorification of rock is apparent for all to see.  Not really sure if Starship had any other songs worth mentioning.  Not really sure if that matters."
ASNJJCWIN3C2N,B000VBBY6C,1,1,5.0,I always loved this song. My five year old loves it even more. He loves it because it is in the new Muppet movie. So it's a track we both enjoy.
A338QCYEC4BATW,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,I love this song. It's a great song. It is really one of the best songs that Guns N' Roses have out.
A3MEPPIVOZUD3L,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,I downloaded this song to add to my music list. Im always looking for good music to have and listen to when I want to.
A1R0YOGSE6Z9TE,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,"My husband and I heard the last minute of this song during dinner one night and it took a long time for us to figure out the title and artist. Don't be fooled by the small bit you get to preview the song! This song has 2 distinct ""movements"". The first is slower, but the last minute or so is an awsome guitar solo. So glad to have found it!"

A1MFWFMMPABBSF,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,as always the classics are the best and stand up to it every time
A26EA24DQWPXWI,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,"I have always like bands who come out with these longer songs where there are transitions from quite or slower parts and then culminate with a slow, wailing guitar riff that changes the whole song. Most bands have these songs but only a few really become classics in my mind anyway. Songs like Zeppelins Stairway to Heaven, the Beatles Let It Be, Madam Blue by Styx have those great transition points. Queen also has several that fit this bill. To me, this Guns N' Roses song fits that bill."
ALNQFCZ3JMH7X,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,I really like this song. The sound quality is good. The song starts where it should and ends where it should. Doesn't have an awkward cut off. No complaints.
A5ZELOQA2OY7V,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,"I am not into much of the harder rock of GNR, but this song is really beautiful.  I also like it, because you get to see the softer more beautiful side of Axle Rose.  The melody is incredible and the lyrics are also beautiful.  This song tells a story.  I am still trying to figure out parts of it, but that just adds a little mystery to it which is good.  I love this song.  It is very beautiful song and I wish we could hear more like from Axle Rose."
A1RY08CB4CKVAK,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,Great product at a great price! Fantastic digital download was fast and at a low cost! I would recommend this to anyone.
A16G04KHMDWMP3,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,"Fantastic, cannot get enough of 80's hair bands! You will not regret this purchase. Takes you back to a time where music actually made sense and was worthwhile to listen to."
A38FLUFB11C5YU,B000VBH2R2,1,1,5.0,"Man, just thinking about this song brings back memories. Yeah, the song goes on forever and ever, but if you get in the right mood, it will really make you think. And if you are the right generation, I'm sure you have strong memories attached to it."
A2HH8V0HSEMNHD,B000VC3P5Y,1,1,5.0,"Music is music, and it's a personal taste as to what songs and genre one prefers.  This is just my kind of music that is unavailable in local stores."
A1IJUUNPU7L6LA,B000VC3P5Y,1,1,4.0,Can't say enough good about the smooth melody and instrumentation.  Music from this last decade is pale by comparison.  Artists like Peter Frampton use encouraging words to tell about life-experiences.
A101N4D8PRU6N5,B000VC3P5Y,1,1,5.0,"Brings back good memories of days gone by.  Good product, similar products quality not as good, clear recordings,heard on computer access, or otherwise."

A1U4GOVZWL8ZTL,B000VC8VHG,1,1,4.0,"Frampton did a really good job on this considering it's a live tune. I'm not much of a rocker but there were a lot of good tunes in the 70's, I guess it was mostly  the soft rock decade."

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000VFQ0LM,1,1,4.0,"Murray Head played Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar. This song is one of those that i couldn't wait to hear played on the radio when i was a kid. Flashback 2 1982:There i was, waiting patiently with the record and pause buttons down and a 'mix' cassette on the deck ready to record 1 Night In Bangkok when it played!"

A35XG6755DWOJV,B000VFQ0LM,1,1,5.0,"Malcolm McLaren's music and Murray Head's singing make a great combination. Based on a nonsense or throwaway line ""One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster"" this song became a hit and then a global phenomenon as Chess. It's still great music and great to exercise too."
AK1O1SSMJMUPE,B000VFQ0LM,-1,1,5.0,"If I am forced to a specific number of words in rating songs, I will no longer leave a rating or a response. If I paid money for the song that should suffice that I wanted the song anything beyond that is not for my benefit. After payment that should be the end of my obligation.

AGXZSU3V6LGUQ,B000VH4MAG,1,1,5.0,The is one of those Stevie tracks that combines his impeccable musicianship and arranging skills.  It's one of the few tracks where an artist makes the backup singers the main focus of the song.  That makes this song immortal.

This one will never grow old and the message, what could I ever add to that . . . ."

A2939STI5Q8VF4,B000VIJZQ6,1,1,5.0,"This song was included in my 1995 Mustang GT convertible cassette. Finally traced it down, bought the cassette (new) through Amazon, but all my old cassette players failed.  So I bought all ten o the songs listed in cassette and this is one. Well done + great fidelity and sounds great in my 2014 Mustang convertible!"

A21QD0YBZ71TCC,B000VILQHM,1,1,5.0,Used this for a wedding in which the couple wanted their deceased loved ones to be recognized.  It was a very moving experience and using this song topped off.  Amy's voice is so melodic and she has a quality all her own.  She makes you feel like she is singing for a friend - you!
AAR46YA7RWU61,B000VILQHM,1,1,5.0,"I've always loved the works of Lady Amy Grant and this piece that was done as a tribute of the 9/11 U S attacks that happened. Yes, it was a very sad day and when I heard Lady Amy sing this, it was beautifully done. All soldiers are indeed that are still at war today, Oct. 23, 2013, six years into this war still rages on. My opinion all soldiers should return back home to their families. Enough is enough!~ These soldiers are in my love cup (heart) for they still are keeping all of us safe from harm. They are and always been in my thoughts and prayer's. I still sing to them online. That's the least I can do for them and I feel it's my call of duty. I thank you for Amazon.com for being able to provide such service to be able to hear the many tributes of many musicians for such edacious acts of cruelty."
A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000VJ3BYC,1,1,4.0,"Apparently all live in the studio with a hard rocking, hard treavellin' beat band: don't understand the ""empty"" sound on tunes that jumped outta the speakers on EMI/Capitol.

Here are the titles we've read bout over the years and had to the chance to hear in part on the Anthology installment I.

The stars? Harrison and McCartney. I think George's stuff here could have been freeze-dried for a hearty repast on any number of 1963-64 Beatles l.p.s. ""Crying, Wating, and Hoping"" is beautiful - as usual the guys do an exceptional take on Buddy Holly. Paul's ""Besame Mucho"" (improved by June, 1962; see Anthology I.) has inrrestistible nervous energy on this January, 1962 try.

The big reason I bought this CD are the three Lennon and McCartney compositions, ""Like Dreamers Do"", ""Hello, Little Girl"", and ""Love of the Loved"", which originally arrived via Beatles' friends' discs. ""Dreamers"" might catch the extra attention of Roy Orbison fans, as the title sings out the same phrase from Roy's Classic, ""In Dreams"".

Sound is very good, not great - VG is not up to standards. Hence, 4 big ones, not 5."
APO9LLUJ8MQ8N,B000VJ3BYC,-1,-1,1.0,"Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album."
A2J8WWG4W0OFYQ,B000VJ3BYC,1,-1,3.0,"The truth is, I don't own this particular CD, but several reviewers are mistaken about the facts of this material.  First, it has been available in very high quality form since Joe Pope released it on a series of 45s on his own Deccagone label in approximately 1974.  It then appeared on several LPs, two of which I own, in the 80s.  These were not ""bootlegs"" in the traditional sense.  They were excellent quality and were probably legal recordings at that time.  I don't know if there has ever been a legal release of this material on CD, but there are at least two (probably many  more) really good quality bootleg CDs that contain this material, in True studio quality, with no hiss or surface noise.

Finally, there are 3 original Lennon/McCartney songs: Loved of the Loved, Hello Little Girl and Like Dreamers Do.  While not lost classics by any means, they provide a valuable glimpse into their really early writing style."
A1OOHB5H6DM6Y0,B000VJ3BYC,-1,-1,1.0,"Do not read any other review I,am by many terms the nicest reviewer on items here on Amazon,But this is by far the worst cd I have ever ordered and demanded my money back from Amazon,which they gave me and hope they will remove this seller from there site. This is defiately a bootleg,you only have to google there record company and duh no such company. Save your money and buy something else on Amazon. Its companies like this that give wonderful sites like Amazon a bad name."
A15IJJRE725CQY,B000VJ3BYC,1,1,5.0,"Don't worry about whether you're a Beatles fan or not,  if you want to hear the greatest rock n roll band at the beginning of their careers then you can't miss with this CD.

Sure its raw and whatever else.  Whoopee.  On a decent sound system it sounds quite good as it has a pretty clean sound.  And it also shows that Ringo was the better choice for drummer.  He just had the edge on Pete.  Having said that, Pete Best did a pretty darn good job.

AND YOU GET TO HEAR THREE LENNON/MCCARTNEY PENNED NUMBERS - LIKE DREAMERS DO, HELLO LITTLE GIRL AND LOVE OF THE LOVED."
A1Q8U14KXIMDUL,B000VJWNHI,1,1,5.0,Was getting oldies music to download on to my MP3 player that I received as a gift.  And this was a favorite song of my teen years.

AP52C0DNAAEGT,B000VK5H5C,1,1,4.0,Good song!
A3AWVFZJQ3CN67,B000VK5H5C,1,1,5.0,I love how the voices sound together. We played this song at a loved ones funeral so it touches me in a special way every time I hear it.
AL8PC7LV1RINQ,B000VK5H5C,1,1,4.0,"We used this as music at my father's funeral. It is not something I would want to listen to every day, but it was good for the occasion. I preferred the Statler Brothers ""I've had a good time, had a good life; had a good home, had a good wife"" because it was more like a celebration."
AYMI78YEBTU1P,B000VK5H5C,1,1,5.0,I love the single songs I want instead of buying a album so many times there are only a couple that I really like.
A1BOMF5M0H54S6,B000VK4UXC,1,1,5.0,Love it. I can visualize in my mind the dancers of the 50-60's doing this dance. Don't make em' like this anymore.
A14RCZXAW50QR1,B000VKGA1C,1,1,5.0,I love this Product! Arrived quickly. Will order again! Thx seller!
A1VN92M4BJL3CM,B000VKGA1C,-1,1,5.0,"As King Solomon said in the Bible.  There is a time to die.  A time to cry, etc.  And, that everything has been done under the SUN before.  This is a time of great music that in my opinion.  You just don't hear any more or see.  And, ended somewhere in the 90's.  I guess every generation goes through it.  Like when Rock and Roll came along.  The generation before it.  Did not like it."
AQ4F1Z8KMD3AI,B000VKGA1C,1,1,5.0,I loved this song since I first heard it! It was nice just to add it to my MP3 collection. I gave this song a 5 star rating...enjoy!
ATJSW3MI8ALG5,B000VK1AR6,1,1,5.0,Anybody that likes Kenny Rogers will love this song.

A9LSYOOC41S6O,B000VMYM5Q,1,1,5.0,"Extremely happy with the song. I was worried that the song might be sung by someone else, but it sounded just like it did when it was released decades ago."
A3GJ6CFWN47N0U,B000VMYM5Q,1,1,5.0,"Being from Hawai`i, this song was special especially growing up in the so-called ""Aloha State"" because this artist is from Hawai`i. I love this song because as a young boy I've hear it playing on the radio. Here in Hawai`i, I remember the our state is proud to hear one of our artist re-presenting us. This hold over with Bruno Mars, who is from here. I am writing this because Yvonne Elliman's song is very special for me because 1) I grew up with this song & 2) she is from here. I am proud of this, just like Bruno Mars. Long Live Hawai`i - Hawai`i no ka oi . . . . . ."
AGI34T5QZWBBC,B000VMYM5Q,1,1,5.0,I loved it in the 70's when I first heard it on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack and I still do!
A1PLJII7ROWAFR,B000VMYM5Q,1,1,5.0,"Yvonne Elliman sang this song on a PBS program a while back she still sounds good,I was a young adult when disco was hot,I enjoyed that period in time, she was one of the disco stars of the 70,s,I would recommend it to anyone who likes disco."
AIDFLFUKJ657I,9434682614,1,1,5.0,an excellent greatest hits cd for an excellent band been a fan of these guys since they started on the scene. especially wait and bleed heretics anthem pulse of the maggots. duality and quite a few others. great for people just getting into the metal scene.

A1F5E3W51WNXJF,9434682614,1,-1,3.0,"I'm new to Slipknot. I'm trying to get into this type of modern, heavy music. I grew up on Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, and Judas Priest Etc... The heaviest stuff that I got into was/is Pantera. I like to understand the lyrics being sung e.g. Iron Maidan's Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, Geof Tate etc... Not on this type of music. This guy can sing when he wants to. It is amazing to hear the dual guitars playing as fast and rythmically as they do. I've been on You Tube checking out these guys, and they do what they do well! Some songs do have melody. I give it 3 stars because I'm just getting into it. Im trying to expand my music palate into a more modern era. But, I still like the afore mentioned. I know there are a lot of die hard fans. No offense intended. I'll listen more..."
A1OI92E32SOMBJ,9434682614,1,1,4.0,"I have been a fan of this band for a while, my only problem was I didn't really want to buy all the cd's just to get a few songs that I liked, then all of a sudden this pops up on Amazon and I wait till I got it at a great price and it has all the songs I like on it , and it has a few I never knew the names of the songs but I knew the songs. What a great buy."

A2942D8DAMTQKJ,9434682614,1,-1,3.0,good mix but 9.0 is much better and seems to flow better and rock harder but not bad and worth the buy
A2SS4R4VFD42SX,9434682614,1,1,5.0,"The first CD has Slipknot's best songs from their four studio albums. The second CD songs from their concert, ""Live at Download Festival 2009."""
A3C7P959Q5CVK5,B000VNGSCA,-1,1,5.0,"This Calendar/Kirshner Lp,AKA ""Sugar,Sugar"" as a Reissue in 1970) Was the sophmore Lp by the Cartoon Group The Archies (Jeff Barry,Ellie Greenwich,Andrew Jokchim[Kim] and Toni Wine)..It reached #1 on the wings of ""Sugar,Sugar"",the single that knocked off The Hollies' ""The Air That I Breathe"" out of the #1 spot in the UK in 1969! There's not a bad track here..Everything's Primo stuff here! But,aside from a CD made by RKO/Unique,mislabeled on the covers as ""The Archies"",there has been no TRUE Reissue of the original Lp on CD with its cover..This has changed,however,with this Custom-Made CD-R! It's better than the RKO/Unique CD,especially on ""Sugar""..The tapes on that CD were considerbly slower and on the track I've just mentioned,the tape source was muddied in its sound! EWW! But,here,it's been cleaned up! Also,the Original CD had Spots of Drop-Outs in certain songs,mainly on ""Melody Hill""..It was Super-Annoying! But,here,again,cleaned up! I LOVE THIS!"
A31K5W6NWK68OA,9434682614,1,1,5.0,This is a classic. I got more then I thought I would when buying this item. It has some really awesome stuff from SlipKnot on it.
A1WGUNGPYRR4TI,9434682614,-1,-1,3.0,"They already did something earlier, a greatest hits and live album.  If it's in honor of Mr. Grey then that's one thing, but come on Slipknot, you've done this before, you don't need to repeat this."
A2LT5NXYYZVL8D,B000VNLBSG,1,1,5.0,Great cd.
A94KLRM1BJZRJ,B000VNLBSG,1,1,5.0,"I like this song, and it tells me how far we've come since this song came out because I would probably be consider in the lyrics, ""Long haired freaky people needn't bother apply""."
A14KKPF7KEDEIV,B000VNTGCO,1,1,5.0,There is a simple beauty to this song.  Whatever he was going through it comes through in this song.  It is reflective.
A2IVQEJ6JQ5V93,B000VNTGCO,1,1,5.0,"I chose this song because I love Marvin Winans and just about any song from the Winans- old or new.  This song was on a soundtrack for the movie, ""I can do bad all by myself"".  This song tells quite a story and is a blessing."

definately worth every penny."
AI2WD20YMB1TS,B000VRGYNE,1,1,5.0,Great tune.  Another one of those tunes that reminds me of my misspent youth.  It's a shame that this collaboration only lasted a short time.

A2G2HPUZOAGOL1,B000VRGYNE,1,1,5.0,Highly recommended along with the video when Blind Faith performed in Hyde Park. Takes you back to the atmosphere of that era.
A3PTFHOID3I4MD,B000VRGYNE,1,1,5.0,"Heard this song recently for the first time in decades. Took me back decades to another time and place. Clapton, Winwood, Baker. Progressing from Cream and going to Derek and the Dominos, before their persinal careers took off.  Great music from interesting times. Rock on!"
A9GS6JYESNGSZ,B000VRGYNE,1,1,5.0,This is a classic from Blind Faith.  I've heard this on several movies and it always transports me back to a time when I was in college.  I great hit to add to your collection that is haunting but beautiful in its sound and melody.
A1PAS5FVWNB07R,B000VRGYNE,1,1,5.0,"One of my favorite songs ever, it comes from a super group formed after the demise of Cream. With Steve Winwood of vocals and Eric Clapton on guitar, need more be said. Eric went on to his next super collaboration with Derek and the Dominos"
A3CI38KCX6IQC7,B000VRGYNE,1,1,5.0,"somewhere in  the wrack and debris of what accumulation can make of a home is the original vinyl album, still in the sleeve. considered a flop at the time, this one song had a haunting quality, even when i was young and heavily on the make. a couple dozen women and a lot of whiskey later in the search, it still holds an odd manner of comfort. strange. then, a lot of beautiful things are quite strange."
A2206W97E6C8U2,B000VRGYNE,1,1,5.0,One of my favorite songs from this group so I was glad I could get it again in the MP3 version since my other version is the vinyl one which is not quite as portable.

A8G58X2ZIUBX5,B000VRH00U,1,1,5.0,I have always loved this song! I'm old school and third brings back a lot of memories kicking it in Oakland during the 70's where everybody was always playing some type of sports in the street... doing the soul train at parties relaxing to slow music like this song... Reminiscing is good for the soul!
A3QLVPX1P2ZYNB,B000VRH00U,1,1,5.0,"as soon as i heard this on the radio years ago i loved it . Of all the love train songs, this one i like the best"
A3ERTFI302EXD3,B000VRL9IE,1,1,5.0,This song is well-known because it is so good.  This song helped the troops in Iraq when they were away from their loved ones. This song is destined to be a classic!

A2582KMXLK2P06,B000VRNCBQ,1,1,5.0,"Where Have I Known You Before proves to me once AGAIN exactly how much different (and better) jazz from the 70's was. This is *phenomenal* instrumental playing.

It's not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination. These band members had a unique ability to really make you open your mind and appreciate instrumental chops played tastefully and creatively, and chops that are constantly full of passion and energy.  You feel like you're getting a complete experience when you hear albums like this one.

This is perhaps one of the finest recordings from the mid 70's you will ever hear, right next to the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Visions of the Emerald Beyond.  I seriously mean that.  Yes, I've heard quite a bit of albums around the same time Where Have I Known You Before was released, and despite the fact this album wasn't exactly popular doesn't really MEAN anything when it comes down to it.  What matters is that I've heard the album, and I'm trying my best to convince YOU why you need to hear it.

The fact that instrumental skills of THIS caliber actually exist, and have been laid down on tape for this recording, really proves to me Return to Forever were more than just a talented group of fellows. This is a band that really gave listeners a challenging and lasting experience.

The keyboard playing is a constant feature of the album. Tastefully played, engaging, and always being displayed in a way that proves the keyboard player is giving everything he has and then some. The guitar playing is the same way. More passion than most guitar players would be able to lay down, that's for sure.

Again I have to ask the magic question- THIS is jazz?  The lengthy and intense keyboard and guitar jams that come and go are considered jazzy?  Are you sure this kind of music doesn't belong in the rock camp? Perhaps rock fusion is the appropriate choice of words.

The album cover shows a sun appearing in a hazy red sky. The only thing hazy about these compositions are the images you get in your head. The music is certainly nothing hazy, or unorganized, or played lazily, or ANYTHING like that- this is just a straight up perfect example of jazz that at one point in time wasn't afraid to be as experimental as possible.

Does Where Have I Known You Before leave a lasting impression? You BET it does. A positive one at that. I'm more than happy giving an album with such brilliant instrumental playing a perfect 5 stars. Replay value is important to me as well, and this album most certainly delivers in that respect.

If you're someone just getting into jazz and would like to hear a fantastic piece of music, check out THIS album. You will be blown away by many moments among all the instrumental jams, I guarantee it.  You simply must check out the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jade Warrior, Camel and Santana as well because these bands have their fair share of music focusing on jazzy and tasteful instrumental chops as well."
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000VRNCBQ,1,1,4.0,"RTF follow up their classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hymn-of-the-Seventh-Galaxy/dp/B0000046X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy</a>&nbsp;with this recording. It showcases another tremendous step forward for the band as their famous lineup in clinched with the addition of Al DiMeola on guitar and Chick Corea's first use of the synthesizer,in this case a moog. A little under half these tracks over consist of 1-2 minute varriations on the title track and tracks like White's ""The Shadow Of Lo"" and Chicks own ""Song To The Pharoah Kings"" do run on a bit longer but in terms of virtuoso musicianship know no equal of course,even if they don't make very easy casual listening. Clarke's opener ""Vulcan Worlds"" (a theme he'd return to the same on his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stanley-Clarke/dp/B0000025KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stanley Clarke</a>&nbsp;album) is one of two exciting and emotionally stimulating tunes here-the theme is expressed very loudly on a very prickly sounding moog. On ""Earth Juice"" Clarke focuses more on his bass playing and they even return to musical ideas as expressed on the previous album on ""Return To The Seventh Galaxy"". While many of these songs are slower and often sweeter then the high octane music featured on their last album this recording has just as much going for it overall."
A2LDEDOQZH3VTP,B000VRNDJM,1,1,5.0,Great Music.

The music sonds good,not a remix or uncut."
A230MXOPPE503H,B000VRNDJM,1,1,4.0,I normally prefer R&B songs but this is a GREAT song. Looking for more from this group.  I expect good things to come.
A26Y3WOLEBRDEF,B000VRNDJM,1,1,4.0,My daughter always plays this from her iPod so I decided it was time that I had my own copy for my Kindle.
AO2AQRPPSTABB,B000VRNCBQ,1,1,5.0,"This is one Return to Forever album that somehow passed me by and I am not quite sure how (or why) because it is phenomenally good and ranks right up there as one of my favorite RTF albums.  The style of music on Where Have I Known You Before (1974) is somewhat similar to Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973) although there is a bit more in the way of softer textures, making for a very balanced listening experience.

The lineup at this point included Chick Corea (Fender Rhodes electric piano, acoustic piano, clavinet, Yamaha organ, ARP Odyssey synthesizer, and percussion); bassist extraordinaire Stanley Clarke (Alembic electric bass guitar, Yamaha organ, bell tree, chimes; excellent drummer Lenny White (drums, percussion); and newcomer Al Di Meola (electric and acoustic guitars; acoustic 12 string guitar).  I think it goes without saying that this is a musician's band.  These guys are all unbelievably talented, with Stanley Clarke setting new standards for performance on the bass that would be equaled by few - this guy is mind-blowingly fast.  For his first time playing with RTF (Al was 19 at the time), Al does an incredible job, although his playing is not as dominant in the mix as it would become on later albums.  With this album, Chick had started weaving synthesizers into the RTF sound and he gets some great tone colors out of the ARP Odyssey on this album, which is plastered everywhere.  As a huge fan of progressive rock and electronica, I do not mind the analog synthesizer use at all, although some jazz fans might be turned off.

The eight tracks on the album range in length from 1'02"" to the 14'21"" Song to the Pharoah Kings suite.  In terms of the music, it is an incredible amalgamation of jazz; jazz rock; progressive rock; space rock; funk and even a tiny bit of classical - more like a proggy jazz rock actually.  In fact, as a progger, I really appreciate the dense arrangements and virtuosity.  Speaking of which, just about every odd time signature under the sun is used on Where Have I Known You Before and there is some incredibly complex ensemble work.

Sandwiched in-between the highly electric rave-ups are three of Chick's acoustic piano improvisations including Where Have I Loved You Before; Where Have I Danced With You Before; and Where Have I Known You Before.  This is the closest this album comes to sounding like traditional jazz and showcases Chick's considerable talents on the acoustic piano.  The softer acoustic tracks provide a nice contrast with the highly charged electric tracks.  Earth Juice is the ""funkiest"" piece on the album, although this funk is pretty far removed from Sly and the Family Stone.  Of course, Chick's work on the clavinet here and there on the album really lends to the funkiness.  The suite that closes the album out is a high point for me and opens with a great synthesizer arrangement, which then launches into some extremely complicated ensemble work that sounds very similar to some of the music that was coming out of the English progressive rock scene at the time.  Although there are solos on this lengthy track, they are really very interesting and are seamlessly integrated with the arrangement - in fact, they sound pre-composed.

Although it may not appear to be the case, this Verve release was remastered (albeit a low budget remaster), and the sound quality is very good.  There are a few photos of the band and a lengthy bit of ""cosmic"" verse from Neville Potter.  The imagery of the words is both colorful and evocative.

All in all this is an excellent RTF album (my ""new"" personal favorite) and is very highly recommended along with Romantic Warrior (1976).  Proggers should definitely check this album out."
A252HNVAZENVNE,B000VRNCBQ,-1,-1,3.0,"Aside from Stanley Clarke's brilliant opener ""Vulcan Worlds""
very little on this album even TRIES to rise above the heavy
-handed prog rock-shaped hole RTF have fallen into,and that's
progressive rock of some of it wern't very good! It's not that
the musicians are bad-they're the creme de la' creme and THAT'S
the dissappointing thing;not only do we all know how talented and SUBTLE these guys can be but each song starts out with the maximum of pomise but once your addicted it turns into unlistenable musical bombast for it's own pure sake. If these songs had been given substantial editing this would have been an undisputed classic. Instead it's simply too overdone."
A26FRGMW71X12N,B000VRO9IQ,1,1,4.0,"I call it sentimental soul. This was a repeated hit on the radio during a memorable time in my life, and so has stayed with me over the years.  It's just nice to hear every now and then."

A35S32Y66WOMZT,B000VRSUJ0,1,1,4.0,The bad part about this song is that it sticks in your head all day long and is tough to get out. The good part is that this is an underrated party song. I am surprised they don't play this at more New York sports games. Throw this in a party play list (unless it is a Red Sox party) and you will have everyone singing along. Great beat.

Brian McKnight is just a wonderful singer."

It's got sentimental value, plus it's got great staying power.  In addition, the opening bars are a great example of classic southern rock.  As such it's a welcome addition to my playlists.

5 stars for staying power, great memories, and a good deal."

A3JRW716H3AX14,B000VRSX4M,1,1,5.0,"This song starts with some very enjoyable tenor vocal harmonies. It has a lively, surging rhythm that continues throughout. There are steel drum-like sounds in the chorus with a few guitar notes punctuating the surging, rolling gait. The lyrics are a bit odd as they seem to be about a man who is drowning which, if True, would contradict the overall sunny quality. But no matter, I still like this oddly upbeat tune."

A3NPBG9YE84S63,B000VRTJI6,1,1,5.0,"The punk rock world was in a questionable state by the turn of the millennium.  One group that undoubtedly ruled the '90s scene -- Green Day, in October of 2000, would issue a nearly-all-acoustic record (""Warning""), which, while being okay, seemed to signal a change in direction, that could have been seen as a death-knell for the genre.  Were it not, that is, for a new crop of young bands, all of whom were just pre-teens in 1994 when Green Day released ""Dookie,"" that emerged around this time to save the day and inject some much-needed youthful vitriol to the sound.

Perhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto, Ontario's Sum 41, who began recording their second release and the album being reviewed, ""All Killer, No Filler"", in October of Y2K, just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew.

Wow!  Talk about this record being a return to form for punk!  After a mood-setting intro, on track number two ""Nothing On My Back,"" the listener is introduced to the band's striking, distinctive, and razor-sharp guitar sound, which was equal parts traditional punk-rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude.  It is a guitar tone that is truly raw, inspired, and decidedly ""old school"" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow.  Often imitated, but never duplicated, because no one ever did it again like Sum did.

And yet, on this same opener, it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up, and then some!  From vocalist/co-guitarist Deryck Whibley's ultra-memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone's well-placed and twanging mid-song interlude, these guys prove they're the real deal, and it doesn't let up from there.  This cut segues into the 50-second ""Never Wake Up,"" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I've heard.  The two best songs, though, lie in the disc's second half.  One is ""Summer,"" a rerecording from the group's debut ""Half Hour of Power,"" and boy, is it a masterpiece!  The main driving force in it is a simple, three-chord progression, but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective.  And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days!  No doubt, one of Sum's signature tunes.  Perhaps my all-time favorite, though, is track number ten, ""Crazy Amanda Bunkface.""  This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss, and Deryck's raging guitar solo, which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day's earlier ""Haushinka,"" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria.  Again, a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk.

And there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music, with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found, that will surely have you putting ""All Killer, No Filler"" on repeat.  I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily, and almost exactly 15 years on from its release, it hasn't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you.  I want to add that I'm 41 (incidentally) and have been listening to underground punk rock (Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, the F.U.'s, et al) for decades, and I still think that ""All Killer, No Filler"" is among the best-crafted punk LPs in my collection, with perhaps the highest replay value of them all.  A masterpiece that started a wave of imitators...  If you don't already own this one, well, what are you waiting for?!"
A1OWLRUFEELQ0T,B000VRTJI6,1,1,5.0,Possibly their greatest album. Just buy it already
A32R4W58VNGVAR,B000VRTJI6,1,1,5.0,I've liked Sum 41 for years and I've loved their songs. This album is pretty good with a couple of songs that have seen some good radio and TV time. Gotta say my favorite song on the album is Fat Lip. They are a good band and I suggest anyone who is into pop punk to give them a try
A3G728TJ3FQNUB,B000VRTJI6,-1,1,5.0,"it took me a long time to finally see how great this cd is. while i liked sum 41 for a long time, this cd was always dull in comparison to does this look infected. which was a very dark, angry cd. and this was more or less the opposite. this cd was very fun and fast and upbeat. i must admit, their choices of singles could have been better. i feel like their songs like Summer, Rhythms, Handle This, and Heart Attack were miles ahead of fat lip and motivation. this is a classic pop punk cd and when i heard the band had planned their newest work to sound more like this, i was excited at the time. but of course it fell flat and didn't even come close and thats because this cd is nearly untouchable in the realm of pop punk."
A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B000VRTJI6,1,1,4.0,"It was in 2001, when the punk group Sum-41 finally hit it big with the release of their breakthrough album: ALL KILLER NO FILLER. The band received radio and televised airplay like crazy. Sum-41 also landed soundtrack spots for copilation CD's, the film Spider-man, and the television show Malcom In The Middle. It was clear that the public had finally come around to listening to the punk group's music. The public had good reason. Sum-41 has a great sense of when and how much distortion to use in their very interesting and fast paced rhythm changes. The guitars have a great taste in creating simple but very unique melodies. The bass gives the extra fill in creating the band's harmonies, and the drums keep everything together. The lyrics to ALL KILLER NO FILLER are amusing and can even be considered to be slightly contraversial for the track ""Fat Lip"". The lyricist makes honest and ""in your ears"" remarks about society and its expectations of its citizens. ALL KILLER NO FILLER is a fun piece of work, and one I highly recomend hearing in its entirity.

Stand out tracks include:
""Fat Lip""
""Rhythms""
""Motivation""
""In Too Deep"""
A1HHW8MIX0C3NE,B000VRSXJC,1,1,5.0,"i love this song what it takes
Steven Tyler sings it so well
i would deffinitly recommend this song
thank you amazon..."
A17R7H005QCW8O,B000VRTJI6,-1,1,5.0,"If you don't like this album, you're either a huge snob, or deaf.

Radio-friendly pop-punk, that would be the best and most accurate description of ""all killer no filler"", which took the world by storm mid 2001 with its single ""fat lip"". Chances are, unless you were living under a rock, you've heard that song, and their other radio friendly hit, ""in too deep"". Although sum 41 has shifted their style since the release of ""all killer"", this band never fails to amaze, and getting any album from them is worth your while.

Upside: ""Fat Lip"" is perhaps one of the catchiest and most original pop-punk songs I've ever heard.

Downside: The album is a little short, and fails to live up to it's name with the :49 second filler song ""wake up"".

You'll like ""SUM 41"" if you like: Blink 182 and Green Day."
A2LTPIQG2RWNJW,B000VRSXNI,1,1,5.0,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
A2T5U4REGXDDSR,B000VRSXNI,1,1,5.0,Their are certain songs that I really like.  This is one of them.  Looking forward to some new stuff from them.
AYCOHV27P91NM,B000VRTJI6,-1,-1,1.0,"These guys stink, just like any so called ""punk"" rock today. Don't buy this."
A6375070JH5V9,B000VRTJI6,1,-1,1.0,".....yeah right!....well,you want a review for this album........ok........this is the worst band in the world..is music for 5 years old brats who think they're cool listening to whining sorry lyrics and boring rappings......if you're into punk listen to real punk bands........what about some wizo.....they are young neither.......or bad religion...they're gods.........don't be a sucka my friend and if you bought this album gave it to your little cousins,......but I don't think they're dumb enough to take it........."
A3713PP4MADKED,B000VRTJI6,1,1,4.0,"Sum 41 was unheard of Canadian band(at least as far as America goes), who loved to party and trash hotels. When they released their 2nd LP here in America, instant fame. The usaul don't-[care] lyics and Slayer/Blink 182 (with a touch of melodicness) make this the perfect punk album. You can party to songs (I.E. Blink 182)like ""Fat Lip"", ""In Too Deep"", ""Rhythems"", and ""Motivation"", or embrace Satan in songs (I.E. Slayer, duh) like ""Introduction to Destruction"", if you can even call that a real song. The only problem with this CD? I only like 5 songs. ""Fat Lip"", ""Rhythems"", ""Motivation"", ""In Too Deep"", and ""Summer"". Oh, well. Despite that, this is a really good CD. Go buy it."
AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000VRTJI6,-1,-1,1.0,"If you have had enough of corporate punk acts like Green Day and Blink 182, then Sum 41 is sure to tick you off even more.  If all the nu-metal garbage around now wasn't making me mad allready, this new corporate punk is ticking me off even more.  The same old three cord progression on every song, stupid uninspired lyrics, and packaged for MTV wanna be rebellion is what makes up this drink coaster in the making a complete package.  And what makes me laugh even more is how kids think that Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day are supposed punk bands because they're on MTV, well kids, this ain't real punk.  Real punk is Dead Kennedys, old Misfits, Bad Religion, Suicidal Tendencies, Suicide Machines, Black Flag, and dare I say it, even NoFX.  Then again, there are kids scratching their heads wondering ""who are they, they're not on MTV, they're no good"".  But what do I know?, I'm just some guy who listens to the above bands and other stuff outside the mainstream, so my opinion doesn't matter at all.  Now go listen to your Linkin Park CD."
A3U28HWEQ3JBIB,B000VRSXHE,-1,1,5.0,For some reason I become a choreographer in my head when this plays and I imagine a bunch of people doing the stroll in a modernized version.
AKZEWOSAUVQ7G,B000VRSXHE,1,1,5.0,"Great song, good old rock and roll. The song brings on emotions and makes you feel good. Steven has amazing rang. You can never beat, to borrow phrase, give me that old time rock and roll."
A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B000VRTJI6,-1,-1,1.0,"For the love of god WAKE UP AND SMELL THE AIR YOU SPOILED BRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is exactly what's wrong with America today. Cheap music that I could surpass in artistic and equality in twenty minutes and dumb, childish lyrics are a testament to the continuing decline of American intelligence today. This isn't punk or metal at all. This is a horrible travesty to both genres. Metal is ultraheavy guitar riffs with extremenly loud melody and pounding drums. Punk is real rebelism against trends in society. Sum 41 aren't that either. They are nothing but a bunch if talentless clowns who are cashing in on TRL to make a buck [...].
Don't call me an old fogie who listens to Frank Sinatra or Mozart because I am 19 years old but I have stuck with the moral values that garbage like this encourages youth to dismiss.
I feel ashamed that people in my age group are more worried about being cool by cussing that than being intelligent. Well I hope this will change in the next five years and laugh at bands like Sum 41, Limp Bizkit, and all those dumb poser metal groups."
A4OSXRZR2BMX8,B000VRQPLA,1,1,4.0,"In Paste Magazine's ""Ears We Trust"" column, DJ Bruce Warren described Blue Merle's sound as ""Coldplay + Nickel Creek.""  The Coldplay comparison is apt - singer Luke Reynolds sounds a lot like Coldplay's Chris Martin - but there's not much Nickel Creek in their tunes.  Comparisons aside, I've enjoyed listening to the CD, especially the relatively strong songwriting and skilled arrangements and production.  Best songs: ""Lucky to Know You"" and ""Boxcar Racer."""
A1B5L9AG1GB2MT,B000VRWTY2,1,1,4.0,This song is one of the most important songs of the 20th Century because of it's influence in ushering in the Age of Rock'n'Roll.  This goes into my collection of historic 20th Century music.
A192NXERQ6IPOL,B000VRQRAO,1,1,5.0,Always nice to listen to the soothing voice of Barry White.
A2KJ74RTEJ3RO0,B000VRQRAO,1,1,5.0,"Music from my younger days. Brings back memories.  Barry White is a wonderful singer. Buy it,  Dance with your special person and enjoy the music & memories."
A19BGCY1IFIXQW,B000VRSXMO,1,1,5.0,I was excited by the possibility of retrieving music I once enjoyed years ago. The price was reasonable. The ease of the purchase was satisfying. It was an experience I would recommend to all music connoisseurs. I absolutely loved the entire experience.
A17M1HL6U2GS7M,B000VRQPLA,1,1,5.0,"Blue Merle--file them away in that place in your mind where you put scents long remembered, summer mornings when the roses have been out a little too long and the air is full of their fragrance, lovely and sweet.  This is music to explore, like a boy explores the cliff in the woods outside his house, delighted to find so many things to do and see.  This is music for lakes, and for rivers, and for ice-cream.

Much has been made of the resemblance between Luke's voice and that of the lead singer of Coldplay.  Indeed, his voice is eerily similar; fortunately, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Chris's voice is emotive and anguished, and Luke's is much the same, which suits this lovely music perfectly. Some might persuasively argue that it would better serve Blue Merle to have a vocalist with a voice more uniquely his own.  While a voice less reminiscent of that of Coldplay might be desirable for some, ultimately, no one can deny the power and maturity with which Luke uses his voice.  Did Chris influence him?  Probably.  There is no crime in that.  Could Luke have chosen to sing in a different style?  Perhaps.  But would that have suited the music as well? Probably not.  I think that he was blessed with a voice that performs well in the style in which he has chosen to use it, and we should be grateful.  Maturity and further listening will probably help to separate the two in our minds as the bands grow in different directions.  Musically, the two bands are not that similar, although there is much to admire in Blue Merle for fanatics of Coldplay.

Now, about the music itself?  At the risk of sounding trite, the  guitars really do shimmer, the banjos sparkle in a setting of solid drumming and inventive bass.  The lyrics are excellent, and reveal more on repeated listening, which is a benchmark which I use to decide who gets my 5th star or not.  The entire album is excellent, no weak tracks, and the more I hear it, the more glad I am to listen to it.  Some might consider it a flaw that there is no one ""stand out"" track--no one track that is so instantly memorable or catchy as to be the obvious single.  But this is not music for singles, a treat to be digested quickly and best given with insulin--it is music for sustenance.

For fans of Coldplay, John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows and Jeff Buckley, this is likely a band to watch and an album to love instantly, suitable to for enthusiastic recommendation to friends.  For fans of the well crafted pop song, this album is reason for excitement as well, especially if you like your pop drenched in complicated guitar work and gilded with a newgrass sensibility.  For everyone else, find out what you are missing.  Blue Merle are worth the ride."
A3GKMK6KQH3Y1H,B000VRQPLA,1,-1,3.0,"This is a promising debut, all right, and Luke Reynolds' lead vocals definitely fall into the ""achey-breaky"" school that was practically founded by Chris Martin.  Some of the songs are memorable, especially the title track, ""Boxcar Racer"", and ""Every Ship Must Sail Away"".  And the instrumentation is at times gorgeous, with excellent fiddle and mandolin work; in fact, that's when the band really shines.  Steven Harris' production defintiely leaves some Dave-Matthewisan footprints, and that's fine with me, too.  So what's the problem?  The CD as a whole just doesn't excite me - much of it has a pleasant familiarity and all the excitement of Keane's debut (in other words, capable but not artistically challenging).  I'm still waiting for a new band this year that will knock my socks off, and these guys only gave my socks a gentle tug."
A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000VRQPLA,1,-1,3.0,"Blue Merle's debut CD has some very good things going for it.  The band's sound is kind of mellow folk-country-pop that has an appeal.  Lead singer Luke Reynolds has an expressive moan in his voice that communicates longing, sadness and desire.  The great weakness of the disc is that the tracks blend facelessly into each other without any jumping out as truly memorable.  Their sound is impressionistic with emphasis on atmosphere and mood, a wonderful rainy day disc.  ""Every Ship Must Sail Away"" is a good example of the aching groove in which the band revels, ""Cause years pass & people change; the bluest skies can turn to grey.""  ""Boxcar Racer"" has a nice jazz groove and a distinguishable melody & is one of the better tracks.  ""Either Way It Goes"" also gets a bit of energy, ""I didn't mean to let you down, but sometimes even angels hit the ground.""  Ultimately, Blue Merle show promise and have a nice sound, but now they need to hone their songwriting skills to make tracks that stick in the memory.  Enjoy!"
A1VE933MFXTG18,B000VRQRAO,1,1,5.0,"I really just love listening to these older songs. They really do bring back so many memories. Memory lane as they say. Some of these songs can really bring you back to a certain times of your life. Often times I remember things that I had long forgotten, or so I thought. It is just great to listen and relax and enjoy these great songs. I grow up with so many of them. I love that I have my music on Amazon, this way I have them every where I go that I can excess my Amazon Music. I do often listen on my laptop when I am travel and staying in hotels. Nice to have some thing familiar with me. I love that I will never ever lose them or scratch them ever again. No more finding the wrong CD in the case either! That really was aggravating. Will have them forever if you are buying your music in mp3 form from Amazon."

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000VRWV4U,1,1,5.0,"It's been almost half a century since Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett and Lenny Capizzi wrote ""The Monster Mash;"" but it never seems to go out of date--especially at this time of year when Halloween is fast approaching. The song is fun; it's easy to dance to even in our times; and the lyrics amuse me. Listen for ""The Crypt-Kicker Five"" to sing primarily on backup; they are Gary S. Paxton, Leon Russell, Johnny McCrae, Rickie Page, and Terry Berg.

If you like this song, you may want to download or purchase Bobby's album entitled ""The Original Monster Mash,"" although admittedly the jewel of the album is ""The Monster Mash."" You can also buy the CD and more at Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett's own website. Amazon does not allow me to give out other website addresses, but you can just use Google to find Bobby's website.

Enjoy the music!"

AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000VRTJI6,1,1,4.0,"I myself am not a big fan of the recent pop-punk bands that have been pouring out of the music industry lately. ... But Sum 41 seem to be just a bit different. With a sense of humor (that is actually amusing!) and catchy riffs, Sum 41 have created a standout among their peers. Like everyone else, I was instantly hooked to ""FAT LIP,"" with it's references to mullets, Judas Priest and El Camino's. The rest of the album, however is a little different. Funny most of the times, but occasionally slipping into the typical. But if you have a sense of humor, then you are most likely to enjoy All Killer, No Filler. ..."

A36LXFQDYTFRSQ,B000VRWUDM,1,1,5.0,"It's the song that showed of his immense talent to the world, and it really never gets old either.  Mr. McKnight is such an understated, yet powerful crooner.  In a different life, he would have been the antithesis of Frank Sinatra, yet he's never abrasive to any listener.  His pianist stylists are somewhere between Bill Evans and a quiet dive bar's lonely player.  That type of authenticity is long gone from most musicians, but on Anytime he manages to embrace the multi-layered hopelessness without having to sell it.  You're simply there, in the moment, and stuck without a prayer."

A3I6MAEBKUJKX2,B000VRWVLI,1,1,5.0,"Lost my mom back in 2003 and have never let her leave my heart for one second.  My mom was not perfect.. well to anyone but me and this song makes me think of her and how concerned she always was for me.. maybe she saw the nut job in the making and just tried to me feel better about myself.  Well since the reason I like this song is pretty isolated, it may or may not be a good fit for you but worth buying if you ask me. R.I.P. Donna Lee Vaughn.

P.S.
You know how at every funeral we always say ""Well there in a better place now.."".... I never said that, because to me this was the place by mom wanted to be."

A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,B000VRWT88,1,1,5.0,"I always think of Be Like That as the cautionary tale of excessive dreaming and a commentary on what happens when we constantly compare ourselves to others. I've spent entirely too many years doing this instead of just chasing what I wanted in life. In doing this, I've missed out on so many opportunities to do great things because they weren't the greater things I thought other people were doing. As a person with cerebral palsy since birth, I've fallen into the trap of wanting to be someone else, a lot. Therefore, Be Like That has special meaning for me. Don't live in your dreams or anyone elses, make your own beautiful reality."

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B000VSNSM8,1,1,5.0,"Blowing off enough steam to trounce a dozen Don Juan wanna-be's - Alicia Bridges power punches her way through the classic 'disco dancing' ballad ""I Love The Nightlife""; with no more than an original set of vocals, wildly emotive inflections & intonations (that easily set fire to the 'serious self-stature' themes in the song), a dizzying display of 'unrelenting feminine' provocativeness, and commanding control of her deeply emotional crescendos.

We take in her message to unfaithful boyfriends, how they line up in her perception of romance, and how she deals with their galavanting all over town - thinking she would stay home and stitch their socks. More couples danced way into the night in wild excitement with this one song - than anyone could imagine - from Moscow to Manhattan - from Paris to Omaha. There is so much life, vigor, and honesty in this song with the trumpets blaring their triumphant salute to her 'stand your ground if he messes around' anthem for women throughout the world. A truly remarkable accomplishment for the artists involved. Written by Bridges and Susan Hutcheson; produced by Steve Buckingham.

""Please don't talk about love tonight.
Your sweet talking won't make it right.
Love and lies just bring me down
when you've got women all over town.
You can love them all and when you're through,
maybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you.
I got to go where the people dance.
I want some action ... I want to live!

Action ... I got so much to give.
I want to give it. I want to get some too.

Oh, I ... Ohhh I ... I love the nightlife,
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
Oh, I love the night life,
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea."""

AHB899WWYV0RK,B000VSNSM8,1,1,5.0,"This is a great song from the days of disco, and I feel it is just as good as many of the BeeGee songs.  Alicia Bridges co-wrote this song with another person, and sings it with great soul and feeling.  What I like about the song is that as well as having the disco beat, it also conveys a message of heartbreak, love gone wrong, and escaping the pain by dancing to the beat on the disco dance floor."
A3634ZAZULFPFG,B000VSNSM8,1,1,4.0,"One of the quintessential songs of the era.  I purchased it as part of completing my collection of songs I remember from back in the day.

My children laugh of course.  :)"

A1DL1HLJYQDOB9,B000VSPII0,1,1,5.0,"This is one of those songs that I don't think many people know about.  I say that because I seldom hear anyone speak of it like a lot of other love songs.  But make no mistake about it, this is a beautiful and touching song worthy of all the accolades I don't think it ever received.  It's definitely a song to celebrate love to.  Truly stellar performances by two great artists of a truly gorgeous song."

A1B57G1D9KLJLH,B000VSWCQG,1,1,4.0,wish she was still making music like she used to. I used to listen to her all the time. maybe she will make a comeback
A1CTC1Y3HZWJCQ,B000VSWCQG,1,1,5.0,"Cher's ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" is a heart wrenching song of regret and lost opportunity. Listening to it brings to mind all the times I could have chosen to spend time with friends and family, but didn't; all the chances I had to say or do something nice for someone, but didn't; all the opportunities I had to make a positive difference, but was too busy.

Musically, I think it is one of Cher's best sung songs, and I enjoy listening to it again and again, because it is able to make me feel things in a way that no other song does."

A3D9KO6R1JB845,B000VTW3NC,1,1,5.0,"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas might just be the very best Christmas song there is. Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title. Christmas doesn't have to extravagant but it should be happy,nice,peaceful,comfortable,and enjoyable. If it weren't for Frank Sinatra we wouldn't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging. The original version had somewhat different lyrics. The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung. ""In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow. Until then we'll just have to muddle through somehow."" Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him ""I like your Christmas song"" but that he needed that line ""jollied up"" to include the piece on his Christmas album. Sinatra said ""The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly that line up for me?"" And,of course,as Martin put it ""You don't say no to Frank Sinatra."" The new lyrics in this line became ""Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow. Hang a shining star upon the highest bough."" Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics. Frank Sinatra's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is THE original version of Have Yourself a Merry Christmas and gets 5 out 5 stars hands down. :)"

A2XOAXP9XCGTE6,B000VWG632,1,1,5.0,"This song has got to be my favorites of all time, of all of Elton Jonn's songs. The lyrics are so beautiful as well as meaningful that they can bring tears to your eyes, if you are in the right frame of mind. The music too matches the lyrics, in that, it too is beautiful. It far outstrips Candle in the Wind, for beauty. It is a song about giving God Thanks, for certain people in his life, that have changed the person's life for the better, no matter what happened to the contrary. It is truly a work of art. Elton was definitely inspired when he wrote this. It will be forever on the top of my all time favorite songs of all time list. I would suggest that you buy it. At least, give a good listen. Maybe a second and a third, until you can hear all the words clearly. He sings things like ""I know why roses don't grow in New York"" and other things like that you probably aren't expecting. Just buy the song and let it enrich your life. The words alone could be a poem to people we love; who make a difference in our lives. A complete and utter dedication to them - those loved ones. Who could pass up something like that? I know I can't..."
ACKDSX71VI5HY,B000VWG632,1,1,5.0,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

I had no idea this song was on Elton John's record ""Honky Chateau.""  I knew it was an Elton John song, and that it was featured in Cameron Crowe's movie ""Almost Famous.""  I also knew I loved it.  It is both plaintive and reassuring, talking about the confusion that life can bring about and how it throws a mass of people together in society.  ""Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters"" is one of Elton John's all-time classic songs."

A104MLZZ7X1OTT,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5.0,"""Ah! Leah!"" encapsulates the sound of 80's Rock, strong guitar solo, strong electronics/keyboard, and Iris hit those high notes. The lyrics are good, too - it's a song about a man and woman who can't get along long term but who have no problem with conjugal visits ;) Have a listen, you'll love it."

I later learned that this song was mostly popular around Pittsburgh, where Iris was from.  My favorite Iris tunes are this one and 'Love is Like a Rock'.  Both are great tunes."

AK2R8BR8AY1IE,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5.0,I was in a regular bar in Pittsburgh and Donnie Iris walks in and plays a song or two.  Well you have to respect a performer that remembers his home town.  My good friend even named his daughter Leah because of this song.
A220EANOQ8R2JU,B000VWKVSI,1,1,5.0,I heard this song on the radio and really liked it. He should be played more often. I only know one other song by him.

A1FTTVNQFMR2SX,B000VWKY6C,1,1,4.0,"When I was little, my mom used to play this song over and over.  When she became ill, I wanted to find songs from when she was young to try and cheer her up.  This one of the ones that I chose."

A3B9DHWCMYQFD,B000VWJ70G,1,1,5.0,"This young guy shows up. He plugs in his Stratocaster...AND JUST BLEW EVERYONE AWAY. Eric was a True born master. He could write, he could play anything from early progressive, to the blues. He laid the foundation of Rock n Roll, and built a mountain atop it. A mountain, that ALL those to come would aspire to summit. They stand upon his shoulders..even now... Eric was so creative that he was asked, time and again, to come and play alongside some of the most unforgettable musicians, and the most unforgettable bands of all time.

But tragedy struck. The pain was unbearable. A huge piece of Eric disappeared. I know just exactly how he felt, and how he still feels....

And that's all I'm gonna say about that."

A1PO9VNIADLB6D,B000VWJ70G,1,1,5.0,You can't go wrong with this classic although there is a dramatic difference between Clapton's slow acoustic version and the faster and louder version by the original Derek and the Dominos. Both great.

A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000VWLEC0,-1,-1,3.0,"Elton John's star was beginning to dim when he released A Single Man in 1978.  The album is a decent effort, but doesn't match up to his quintessential early 70's albums.  One big reason is that he severed his writing partnership with Bernie Taupin.  Together they created unforgettable songs, but apart, they've been hit and miss.  A Single Man falls into the hit and miss category.  Songs like ""Shine On Through"", ""Ego"", ""Part-Time Lover"" and the gorgeous and heartfelt ""Song For Guy"" (a tribute to his young messenger who was killed in a motorcycle accident) are quite good while others like ""Big Dipper"", ""Georgia"", ""Madness"" & ""Reverie"" fall short of the mark"
A3QS5UV4968O7C,B000VWLEIO,1,1,5.0,I had forgotten about this song by Elton John. I am a fan of Elton John and this is one of his great ones.
A3P6CNMHR2QHA6,B000VWLEIO,1,1,5.0,Elton John has many great songs and this one is no exception. This man continues to belt them out. Check it out.
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000VWLEIO,1,1,5.0,"There is no question that this year marks Elton John's 45th Anniversary since he & Bernie Taupin met and became one of the most definitive songwriting teams in the world. There have been so many classics that have been so strong for both of them. But of all of them from the 80's, the one that stands out intimately the most is Sacrifice from his 1989 album Sleeping With The Past. It is a very classic piano ballad that sits well, where in a era of songs that were tacky and not as strong from Elton, because of his abuse and marriage ended, it still stands absolutely tall from Elton in voice and harmony. If you're new to Elton John, this is a nice download as well as for die hard Elton John fans, and that is a sacrifice worth taking.

Song: A-"
A1DBDCQASEIMDW,B000VWLEIO,-1,1,5.0,"The teddy bear loving paw of the piano climbs his way into a song of great emotional rift and feeling. Why don't the great self centered meatballs of music production play this song on the radio or the net. They are wackos that don't know a hit from ahola...that's what... Where the Hell is the music award for this song.
  Do you know what I'm doing here I'm bringing this song back from the dead. Do you know why Because I know music and this song never got the respect it deserved. Screw American Idol. Let see them write a song and Play the piano and sing like this Grizzly could. Tell me this song is not underrated, Tell me this song sucks...I dare you too!"
A2HWD9PTM7RBXN,B000VWLEC0,1,-1,3.0,"A Single Man is a big improvement over Blue Moves.  Just the first few tracks proves that.  Love the Big Dipper tune with its jazzy arrangements.  Shine On Through is one beautiful ballad.  And Song For Guy is soothing to the soul. The piano touches are quite special.

Elton explores many styles on this recording as opposed to sticking with a constant arrangment as he has done on previous recordings such as Caribou and Madman Accross The Water.  This is a good thing.  Howeve, the last few songs are pretty unmemorable in the hook department.  Others midway through the record have pleasant arrangments but lack a strong melody.

Therefore, this is a good recording but not on the same level as Elton's prime time era or even The One or Too Low For Zero."
A3GTI1Z7YE49ZS,B000VWLEC0,1,-1,2.0,"""A Single Man"" by Elton John is a hard one to evaluate. On the one hand, the songs are mostly good ones; and the production is super sweet! Very soft and understated. But Elton's vocals are mostly dis-engaged and generally charmless.

""Return to Paradise"" might just be; what with those beautiful Falsetto vocals, ""Georgia"" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up ""Tumbleweed Connection"". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs ""Madness"", ""Reverie"" and ""Song for Guy"", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; ""Madness"" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; ""Reverie"" is brief but effective, and ""Song for Guy"" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.

The other songs aren't bad. ""I don't care"" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun. ""Part-time love"" is the best of the rest, a pumpy little tune with a big production. Not a bad album, Rating **1/4 or 2.25"
A1IVGCF4BUPHWY,B000VWGOS4,1,1,5.0,This is an old time favorite Xmas song from back when I was young had to have it.

I was about to spend the rest of my life laying on the floor when being a highly medicated individual made the world feel like it was spinning around every time I stood up. I get stiff when I sit for a long time. My body loves this song and listening to Eric Clapton play the guitar. All he asks is:

Don't you think you want someone to talk to?"
ABVYGB2TKBO8F,B000VWGZ8S,1,1,5.0,This is a great old tune. It totally grabs my attention in the first few notes. You can't beat Eric Clapton's voice and the guitar is great too. A good tune added to my collection of oldies.
A12NFK3VGMQYVB,B000VWGZ8S,1,1,4.0,I always had a slight fascination with this tune. Just a very simple song by Eric Clapton and almost country like in its execution. Great hit from a talented guitarist.

This song somehow makes me stay positive when I think about him and everything I wish I could say to him and show him (especially his grandson who was born in 2005).  Such a wonderful, inspirational song."

It was released in several versions.  I chose this one because, in my opinion, it really expresses the deep felt emotion of the song. It is my favorite. The MP3 sound quality is quite satisfactory."

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000VWMTHE,1,1,5.0,"Wonderful by Eric Clapton is a heartfelt classic love rock song that covers what it feels like to be with someone who sees the inner and outer beauty of you.  Yes, I understand that the singer is actually singing about his love interest who turns many heads at the party they attend.  However, I think that it can also be  a positive love song about two people who are in a relationship together who also keep on the rose-colored glasses (metaphorically speaking) even after they have been together for a long time."

A3Q0KGIIUZET7G,B000VWMTHE,1,1,5.0,"I must say that Amazon has the best selection for Classic Rock, which will be here for all times. No music will ever compare to the music of that era. I have so far purchased 688 songs from Amazon over the years. Not all Classic Rock, for I do like Christian Hymns very much. But they always have a great selection no matter what genre you are looking for."

A3KLA39CHK9JHV,B000VWMTHE,-1,1,4.0,"There are a lot of various performances of Clapton's version of Wonderful tonight and this is pretty good, but does not quite have the punch that Pegatha Sue's version of the sax solo has. Otherwise OK."

AZ4FKZXXNULDR,B000VWOOVS,1,1,5.0,"This is perhaps EDDIE KENDRICK'S signature solo jam after the TEMPTATIONS.
I call it his express jam, because it is such a jam, when you hear it driving, you tend to want to speed up to the beat! Back in the day, if you were walking, you wanted to speed up a little and walk your cool walk. The extended version is most satifying."

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000VWP7FA,1,1,5.0,"I am not a rap fan that much, but listening to this song was like WOW. The lyrics are strong, the background music ROX, and the background vocals I love. It's a tough song that even those that hate rap will change there mind. To me I really don't consider this a True rap song it's more of a rock/rap if that makes sense. I would recommend this song to anyone, it's truly not your typical Eminem song, if you liked Lose Yourself by him you will love this one. If you haven't heard of this song, try the Amazon MP3 sample you will not be disappointed.

THX,

A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B000VWMT7Y,1,1,5.0,"Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough""; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic.

A1DO9LRCO23EOM,B000VWMT7Y,1,1,5.0,"I remember first hearing this song in the 1960's (originally put out by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell) and have always loved it. Diana Ross did 2 covers of it and I liked them both. 5 stars from me, but listen to the audio clip before you buy it."
AUFJRMYL1K9OZ,B000VWPXT0,1,1,5.0,"Yep another grunger that did not keep it intact. Very sad, this kid had a very cool voice as in this song. I feel in love with it. Yep a utube special. The voice is unique in so many ways. From his living in Washington, as did eddie Vedder. The pronouncing of words that just sounds so cool when they sing.  It is different and u can hear it. And you gotta have a very good voice. I believe if this kid lived and got his crap together he would be singing stuff people would buy today."
A30C4HNZBZYDI2,B000VWPXT0,1,1,5.0,This was a good song off of a really good album.  I'm glad I could get such a great price on it through Amazon and I like having it sync wirelessly to my Kindle Fire.

A3LT90XMQ0ZJM7,B000VWMT7Y,1,1,5.0,had to buy this tune even as a single purchase.  it brings back so many great memories.  so easy to transact and transport these single tunes from Amazon.

A14YTPQDH3PAZU,B000VWOQIY,1,1,5.0,Great.
A2582KMXLK2P06,B000VWOQIY,1,1,5.0,"I'm going to do something that some of you out there reading might consider highly unusual.  I'm going to pick this song apart and explain why each and every part of it is so irresistibly awesome.  ""Reflections"" might just be the greatest song Diana Ross & the Supremes ever released.  This song must have come on the radio a million times throughout the country over the years, and I wouldn't mind listening to it a million times myself.  Here we go!

It starts off on an unusual note for the first few seconds with swirling machinery-type sounds that seems totally out of place at first but now that I've heard the song so many times, I believe these chaotic sounds are supposed to represent the confusion and emotional distraught that Diana Ross feels through her rollercoaster emotional state of mind.

Then Diana Ross begins to sing... and her voice *alone* is brilliant.  It sounds so tender with *just* the right hoarse sound.  Like a young woman who's finally had enough of having someone hold her down, so she's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels.  Like she's on stage and it's her turn to speak, or sing in this case, what's on her mind.  I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger.  I LOVE it!

Then we have the Supremes providing the really somber and suspense-building ""ooooo, oo-oo-oo"" behind Diana's powerful vocals.  Listen to the perfectly executed way the ""oooo"" dreamily soothes and creates tension during the way Diana sings the line ""Through the mirrors of my mind, through these tears I am crying"".  With the Supremes providing back-up, now this song takes on a whole new meaning.  Without the Supremes Diana's vocals would have been great as it is, but WITH the Supremes?  Now it's just insanely good!

What proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line ""I'm all alone now, no love to shield me, trapped in a world of distorted reality"".  Suddenly, during this particular line, the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone.  What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past, they feel cold and angry.  If my words aren't clear, this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is.

It took me a LONG time to notice there's a speedy bass section playing in the background, and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change.  It's brief and easy to not notice unless you're playing REALLY close attention.  And how about the orchestration at the 1:50 mark?  It's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana's emotions all coming to a head and she's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible.  This is ANOTHER really powerful moment.  Granted, my interpretation probably isn't the same as Diana's, but that's okay- we all interpret music differently.

The song finishes on a more optimistic note with dramatically more promising vibes the way Diana Ross demandingly sings ""Reflections of, the way life used to be"" with a pounding rhythm illustrating a brighter future.  The tone of the song right here at this point seems to paint a picture of someone who's learned to move on from a troubled relationship and won't dare repeat the same mistakes again.

And just to throw in some humor, it's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- ""In the UFO!""  No Diana is actually saying ""In the you and I"" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here.  BUT!  If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions (in the beginning and when Diana sings the line ""happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories"" and the line near the end ""I see a dream that's lost from the hurt you have caused"") you could actually be led to believe she's singing about UFO's, haha.

So what is it about ""Reflections"" that is so magnificent?  It's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned.  Sadness, optimism, worry, fear, deserted... these are just some of the feelings I experience.  If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do, you should be able to detect all these emotions and more!  Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3-minute song, and that my friends is downright amazing."

Yes he does need censored sometimes for the younger peeps, but his sense of humor is awesome and I always get a kick out of his songs that are funny."

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000VWPWNW,1,1,4.0,"These days it is much harder to actually find singers that have shown simplicity in song where it is actually worthwhile in heart. That is something today's divas have taken for granted in song. But there are some that haven't been given that credit, past being labeled as a one-hit wonder. Oleta Adams is one of those singers that had made that mark beautifully with one glimmer on the charts with her rendition of the Piano In The Dark Singer, Brenda Russell's song Get Here. The song is definitely one of those that shows strength and beauty with age like a fine wine after years of heart. I still love listening to this song each and every time this comes into heart. If you have never even heard a Oleta Adams song before, this is absolutely the one song to go to. So say you're going to get there to this beauty.

I don't bu very many CD's anymore becuase of the price, and the fact that there are usually only a couple of songs on the CD that I really like to begin with.  Buying a single makes it easy to improve the audio library without spending a lot.  Thanks!"

A19FQKV296JZCT,B000VWU2NC,1,1,5.0,It's one of the most beautiful yet heart-wrenching songs he's ever done. The lyrics are so moving it nearly brings you to tears.
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000VWU2NC,1,1,5.0,"When it has came down to Elton John, musically the 90's definitely brought out the best in Elton's voice, after getting his life back together from vices, and fallout from the media in England, he reemerged brilliantly with his music, and the music from his 1992 album The One definitely showed that in a melodic way. The Last Song definitely still shows that. It is still as beautiful and simple from Elton's talent, singing about A.I.D.S. after losing his friends and loved ones from Freddie Mercury of Queen to Ryan White, he definitely still knows that even after 20 years after this song came out, it still clicks very well and intimately with Elton's voice and sonnet. If you've haven't heard any of Elton John's songs from the 90's, this is absolutely one worth checking out.

Song: A"
A39QC1ZC4DK46Y,B000VWU2NC,1,1,5.0,"This song seems like it was written for me. Like in the song My Father came to see me at the lowest point in my life and I really did misjudge the love between a Father and his son. My Father passed away and I'm 42 years old now and every time I hear this song I can feel the tears welling up in my eyes.
 Elton John puts alot of heart and soul in the songs he creates and nearly every one in my opinion is a classic, this one included."

A3TX3FJH0X4WS6,B000VWU2MS,1,1,5.0,"had to get this one for my husband, he likes most of the Eminem songs. and it's cheaper to buy one song here and there than it is to buy the whole album. thnx amazon."
A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B000VWOOUY,1,1,5.0,"I love this song. Of all the slow songs Elton John has done this one has to be the most unique of the bunch. It has that 80's New York blues feel to it and plays with chord progressions that move in unexpected places; making a melody that is both complex and familiar. Elton's singing is at its best here. The song takes me to places when I hear it. He sings like a smooth and mellow crooner, giving a little edge just where the song needs it. I am baffled this track wasn't included in any of the greatest hits collections. It was a top ten song on the UI.K. and and top 15 in the U.S.

If you love ballads or mellow songs that are a cut different than your standard pop tune that are still catchy and beautiful you must do yourself a favor and check out Blue Eyes."

A1UJGZQJG6BP9K,B000VWS1XK,-1,1,4.0,"Regular somewhat racist, no holds bars Denis Leary. Mainly purchased for the chorus to make fun of people I know. Good fun song if you can handle Leary's unique voice (at times his general tone does bug me)."
A36HVSEHYYPQW,B000VWSIC4,1,1,4.0,"The Fox is one of Elton's least known outputs in his entire catalouge.  It justed missed the top 20 (in the US) upon its release in May, 1981.  It also marked a transitional period in his career, coming off the sometimes successful but ultimately unfocused albums like 21 at 33 to the more straight ahead pop smarts of Too Low for Zero.  Although The Fox leans much more toward the unfocusedness of 21 at 33, due to the mishmash of writing partners and use of outside musicians in places, it is a much more interesting and satisfying experience than anything he had turned out in years.

I find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit, prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory.  As a few reviewers have noted previously, this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas (who would also produce his next 3 albums). Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement.  This ambition shows up in songs like ""Fascist Faces"", the beautiful instrumental trio ""Carla/Etude/Fanfare"" and the more traditional love ballad ""Chloe.""  The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir, a full string orchestra, and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this isn't meant to be a cohesive statement, but meant to try to satisfy trends and make ""the cutting edge"" for 1981.  Most of the time, it acheives this due to Elton's tunefulness and ultra-competent instrumentation.

Highlights of the album are many and scattered throughout.  It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit.  While ""Just Like Belgium"" is fun and lively, it really doesn't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks, and ""Heels of the Wind"" seems unneccessary, almost like an afterthought.  Big departures from his previous work are the tracks ""Heart in the Right Place"" with its forceful, blues-rock tone and ""Fascist Faces"" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir.  Both tracks are propelled by the biting, metalish guitar play of Richie Zito, which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton's canon.

In the end, The Fox is far from a masterpiece along the lines of Honky Chateau or Yellow Brick Road, but it is one of the most interesting in Elton's now 35 + year solo career.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the more arty side of what would become ""I'm Still Standing"" and ""Sad Songs"" just a few years down the road."
A3GTI1Z7YE49ZS,B000VWSIC4,1,1,4.0,"You know what to expect from Elton John, some nice, lush ballads, a few uptempo numbers and a little bit of rock. Nice melodies, mot so much passion, but a lyrics sheet that, no matter how one tried, could not find a single reference to his sexuality, except Big Dipper.

And so 'The Fox' goes, his usual servings of pop, still using self-serving metaphors (But 'The Fox' is a long way to plummet from 'Captain Fantastic' don't ya think?) (And who's fault is this anyway, It's not as if Elton writes the lyrics, or does he?? Did Bernie Taupin really bestowe the crown of 'Captain Fantastic' on Elton, while relegating himself to role of 'Brown dirt cowboy'?)

But The Fox is a surprise. Although it is not an experimental album, fairly straight-forward, it is still a very inspired album. From the sleazy-journo ode 'Heart's in the right p;ace' to classical music 'Carla Etude' and the all-our rocking opener 'Breaking down barriers', the songs on 'The Fox' are very solid and enjoyable. There is also a lot of diversity here too. Rating 3 1/2 or 3 3/4 or something like that, worth rounding up.

But if you are hoping for a return to his country-rock days; you'll be disappointed, you'll have to wait for the last song and even then you won't get any humility: ""And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
'Cause I am the fox, like it or not"".
But who wants humility in their rock music anyway? I DO!! We're a vocal minority but we're growing, yes you'd better be scared!!"
AWPODHOB4GFWL,B000VWSIC4,1,1,5.0,"This collection from 1981 has nearly gone unnoticed, probably due to the lack of input from Bernie Taupin.  It is filled with great uptempo, complex arrangments like, ""Breaking Down Barriers"" and""Fascist Faces"".  ""Just Like Belgium"" is one of Elton's most upbeat romantic songs since the mid-seventies and ""Carla/Etude/Fanfare"" (which runs into) ""Chloe"" is a testament to Elton John's creativity.  However, the best song on the album and the only single, ""Nobody Wins"" beats out the rest for arrangment, lyrics and heartfelt tearjerking.  Amazingly, this single is omitted from all collections.  I wish someone would explain this mystery to me."

ARYVQL4N737A1,B000VXHQI0,1,1,5.0,"This is one of the more memorable songs by the Spinners that I remember from when I was a kid :) I believe that's a sitar at the beginning of this song and it only adds to the appeal of this performance. Great song by one of the all-time great groups from the '60s-'70s. *I've heard this song on a overseas Internet radio station and their version seems to have the same problem that I encountered with my download: there seems to be a weak spot at the beginning of the song, so I'd check it out if I were in charge of the downloading division of the record label. It's the same sound you hear when a cassette tape gets caught up in the rollers. After you untangle the tape and fix it right on the reel, it's still playable but there's one section that got mangled and doesn't quite sound right. I'm guessing that a master tape from the reel to reel recording days probably suffered this same problem :)Other than that slight flaw, it's still a great song :)"

A1QHEYPVDKR5SU,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5.0,"Oh yeah, if you are looking to have your brain slammed back and forth from one ear to the other ear, this is the one! I have heralded only one track/song by the Queens as the ultimate new age piece destined to become the fashion of the new generation in 2013 and beyond (actually it came out on the airwaves years earlier) and it is one of the two and only two (so far) pieces they were able to write and play that I really love and enjoy hearing it over and over again so much that I would buy the album. The superior details of my pick as the new age tune of the coming age are;
first the subject which carries a universal message that everything they tell you or feed to you isn't True. There is a mystical truth that no one knows but you can know if you want to. Simple, right? Nothing earth shattering about that, but I find such deeper nuances and openings to a deeper or higher truth in it every time I hear it.
  Second is the orchestration of the piece, and the organization of my perfect song is wonderful. It begins with string entry on electric guitar, (although I've seen the tall guy banging away on an acoustical guitar in concert) . First thing is a tentative mid range chord swipe followed by a second bold strum using the same chord then blazing away into the chords banged as a rhythm, with varying chords that raise up to the high range and then cut off by a single plucked string that's allowed to fade off for a while a second or two and that leads into the voice singing in a soft tone, suggesting a secret whispered into your ear then raising to a pitch that wails across the table at a bistro you're sitting at with him. As the singer carries on with his performance the harmonizing players join on key notes while the electric guitars jam on at a feverous rate, keeping the same rhythm and beat underneath them swelling when there's a pause in the song, eddying away after he rejoins until without warning  (well, I know where and when by now) it all freezes, stops suddenly and there is only the bass thrum of a string , low and reverberating, steady and carrying the whole band, the world and the secret on it's powerful,confident back. That all too brief sound  is the one I wait for as I fall under its spell and it tells me the secret and the meaning that no one knows. I didn't know what to do about the ending going into a Mexican radio station and the announcer crying ""avey,..avay,..avey,..aiyee..."" but now I do know that the Queens had cradled the entire album around and within leaps into various broadcast stations in order to carry the secret out into the world  and seek a change, I have come to enjoy the brash announcer as another performer doing a job, yet a part of mysteries beyond us. The second song on this album is the Mosquito song, perhaps a dig at music producers and bean counters who would suck the life out of composers and performers? however one that I have come to interpret as music of another creation that is living and composing music in its own way and I avoid judgement on its efforts. For sure the whine of a mosquito gives me chills and snags my interest as I prepare to fend it (her?) away from my flesh, but there's something broadcast-y and remenisent about the sound she makes resembling the whine on a radio being tuned in. As of yet I haven't found a single song I would say I can stand after those two, but the ease,flexibility, quality is above average and excellent."

A1CHLJQMZN8LHG,B000VZFU0O,1,-1,2.0,"I was a little girl when LL was at the top of his game, and yes I had a crush on him.  Can you believe this guy still made hits when I got to high school?  I realize whenever I see this music video, it makes me feel good, and so does this song.  Therefore, I will say it takes me back to the old days and good memories.  The beats and rhythm in the song sound like a merry-go-round would sound if music went with it.  ""Merry-go-round,""  ""Around"" the way..""  anyway, he is rhyming about making passes at girls while walking down the block, most likely in Jamaica, Queens where he grew up.  Flirting with ladies while they do everyday things like sucking on a ""blow pop.""  I bought that brand lollipop all the time where I went to elementary and junior high school in Crown Heights.  The rhythm and harmonies in this song are soft, and not too hard."

A35XG6755DWOJV,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5.0,Queens of the stone age rock intelligent lyrics and strong rock beat. Great song but be aware that at least the version I bought had the explicit lyrics so if you're worried about what your kids hear try the radio edit.

A29HJWVO1SAZED,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5.0,I realized there was another QOTSA song I wanted. I just couldn't remember the name (let alone what album it was on). I then thought about where I was at that point in my life to narrow it down. (Poor memory) Love it! Hard but not thrashy.
A1S15XEZ4A10BQ,B000VZDZK6,1,1,5.0,LOVE this song! I actually first heard it on an old nhl video game. Great beat and awesome song to tap along to.

This is the version from 1968 that reached number 10 on the Pop charts. Amazon did us good as the mp3 is at 256 kpbs. This song was so popular that I remember a DJ in Pittsburgh who called himself ""The Mighty Quinn"" to exploit the popularity of this song. Enjoy."

A2HOBWOY53SO5P,B000VZFYNC,1,1,5.0,I bought this song as it is a part of the Cristian Grey books.  It makes the reading that much better to relate the songs that they are talking about in the book.
A32BM1CZ627MVJ,B000VZFYNC,1,1,5.0,"Dis ""Fifty Shades"" all you want, yet this series had introduced artists to a wider audience, from Trouton in graphic arts to Nelly Furtado in the auditory realm.

The video on YouTube is rather powerful.  I guess that clinched the purchase of this item for me.  Nelly's ethereal voice inspires me to ""try"" -- to try to live my goals, to make the effort to work out the details of my expectations.  Nearly every time I listen to this song, I cry.  Sometimes when I sing along, I say ""cry"" instead of ""try"" but ... methinks... those words are linked beyond rhyme."

I can't really put my finger in it, but she's got this kind of understated quality that's refreshing and unusual because successful comedians couldn't pull it off. Lily's humor doesn't hit you over the head, in fact it's so subtle that you'll frequently ask yourself, ""what was funny about that?"" I had completely forgotten about Lily until I saw her on this year's Oscars award show with Meryl Streep. Now that was a funny bit! Though I did have to ask my mum what was actually supposed to be funny about it. Lily brought me full circle!"

It brings back so mant wonderful memories of me and my teenage son bonding over ""his"" music!

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000VZJS20,1,1,5.0,"I definitely agree as well that this song is an instant classic. This song is basically about someone wanting to have sex with you in a very passionate and aggressive way. Like many others, I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager. I honestly found the music video very eccentric (in a positive way), but creative at the same time, and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more.  I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video. The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it, and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song (there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative:( Through every forest, above the trees Within my stomach, scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive). Obviously, many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means. I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting. Obviously, this is also a good song to add to a collection of makeout session/you know what session songs."

A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B000VZJS84,1,1,5.0,"At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease. On the other hand it's both historic and great music. The historic aspect is this is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come.

Listen to the sound samples on this page and even those short snippets will reveal the magic of this album. I am not going to try to dissect the music or impose my personal taste on you, but if you love swinging and tight quartets with a piano and vibraphone in front you will be more than pleased with this album.

While I promised to not dissect the music I will say that the intensity that Jackson brings to the performances match the backing trio - Peterson and bassist Ray Brown in particular were renown for intensity even on ballads, and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well. So the chemistry among the four is natural and one of the reasons why this album appeals to me.

The album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two sessions (September 15 and 18, 1961.)  Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions, two of which are logged as 'untitled Peterson originals' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue. Regardless, the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile."
A2KXBCCGCHU00U,B000VZJS84,1,1,5.0,Excellent performance and sound quality
A35PPJIGPB61UF,B000VZJS84,1,1,5.0,"There are melodies and movements on this album reminiscent of Miles Davis' masterpiece 'Kind of Blue', but with vibes and without, of course, the trumpets/saxes; so thoroughly unique, but in a similar Jazz vein.

This swings hard, but subtle and is incredibly attractive to the ears, with Oscar Peterson's piano tinkling masterfully.

One of my favorite Jazz albums; highly recommended."

A6FIAB28IS79,B000VZJS84,1,1,4.0,"The reunion of the ""very tall band"" whet my appetite for the first meeting.  Musically, it doesn't disappoint.  From the very first track, ""On Green Dolphin Street,"" Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint, drawing the listener in as on few other recordings (he's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis).  And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes, he's neither intrusive nor overwhelming.  In fact, he's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session.  And Bags is, as usual, the master of bop and blues, a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets (Gary Burton would cut the rotators, add two more mallets, and take the instrument in a different direction).  As recently as 5 years earlier, Milt was still playing with fast-spinning rotators, but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place.  (To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ, if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis, check out ""Bags and Trane."")

One caveat: the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment.  Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of ""stereophonic sound"" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms.  Oscar's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted; Ed Thigpen's drums lack dispersion and upper-register presence. In fact, there's a slightly ""canned"" quality to the overall sound, making you want to take the lid off.  I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording, they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound.  (Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import.  Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money.)"
A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B000VZJS84,1,1,5.0,"This is a Jazz album that everyone should have in their collection. The Oscar Peterson Trio is joined Milt Jackson and what a beautiful album they create together.

Recorded in 1961 the album starts with On Green Dolphin Street. This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson's very restrained and delicate Piano solo. Even when the solo reaches the swing section there aren't the torrents of notes that you might expect. This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent.

Of course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers. In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell. Milt Jackson plays with a fire that, to me, was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ. Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming. He really hits some great accents when you really don't expect them - and they work! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good.

Sadly only Oscar Peterson survives from this marvellous quartet at the time of writing. This disc captures them all at the height of their abilities and is an essential purchase."
A5A2QE6NECFR5,B000VZJS84,1,1,5.0,"When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961, along came the other two members of Oscar's trio, Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD, Brown and Thigpen were great players, and add a lot to the success of this effort. The opener, ""Green Dolphin Street"" is relaxed, but ""Heartstrings"" and ""Work Song"" jump. Then comes the wonderful, almost eight-minute take on ""John Brown's Body"" that soars. The final two cuts, ""A Wonderful Guy"" and ""Reunion Blues"" are also superb. Milt and Oscar, of course, went on to do great work up to the mid-90's, but they were already old pros 41 years ago. If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz, play this for him or her. It's a perfect blend of the four instruments and a great introduction to the category."
A1906RZITWT2K2,B000VZJS84,1,1,5.0,"Just a perfect record.  There is so much swing in this LP, and it comes out of a handful of instruments.
The vibes rule the record, but it is Peterson's piano that holds down the fort from beginning to end.  Tasty bass, economic drums, and a sharp choice of tunes.
The soft intro will fool you.  Two minutes in you will find yourself ready to move with it, and it doesn't let go.
I have gone through 3 copies of this record--2 vinyl and 1 CD--over the past 20 years, and I never get tired of it.
This ranks with the best of Mingus or Miles Davis, in my book."

A300JMW5AMQ4UR,B000VZLMWO,1,1,5.0,Great Song...This song is great and has a great melody. Chorus is powerful and full! Jimmy Eat World is an awesome group!
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000VZLMWO,1,1,5.0,"""The Middle"" by Jimmy Eat World is a positive song about having the self-confidence to see your own beauty and great qualities in yourself regardless of what others may think. This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can, and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life. I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think (also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would). Last, but not least, this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong (thick-skinned), and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine. My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner:

It just takes some time
Little Girl You're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

  ""The Middle"" is a brilliant track that applies to both men and women from all walks of life even with taking the ""little girl"" metaphor into account. I suggest this song (with absolute self-confidence) if you know that events in your life are going to unfold perfectly and in a joyful manner, but you also crave listening to a song that powerfully gives this reminder (in addition to sending the message to always see your personal beauty and unlimited power regardless of how others may treat you)"

A3OO4WIO4SKD55,B000VZMRQE,-1,1,5.0,"This is the real ""Let It go"". On The Album, ""Just Like You"", you get the video edition of the song which removes about 50 percent Of Lil Kim's rap verse, Keyshia's add libbing at the end of Lil Kim's rap and the second chorus. If you have the album, I suggest buying this MP3. If you have the album on the an mp3 player, I suggest buying this MP3 and replacing it for the album track. This is also known as ""Let it go Extended"". As sucky as it was to put the edited video version on the album, I still think buying this mp3 in addition to the album is worth the extra $0.89 Amazon is charging for it."

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000VZO4QU,1,1,5.0,"Apparently Britain knows something us Americans don't... This song is the best thing to come out of dance since 'Canned Heat.' Written by the legendary Elton John, Scissor Sisters single handily bring back the dance scene, if only for a few gay, happy, short minutes. But really folks, you can't get through this song without at least tapping your toes. In fact, Larry Craig probably did his scandalous foot things to this song.

This song is incredibly catchy, and impossible not to love once you get into it. And the dance factor is cranked up to max here. Whether it be in a closet, or an empty room, or a bar, or a club, rest assured, you'll dance at some point. The vocals, the beats, and the music completely fit the song. And in fact, the structure is perfect for creating all those classic dance vibes.

Overall, a pleasurable experience that really brings back the True dance movement. Not those thumping, trance remixes they put out today, but the quality stuff. So check out this song, you probably haven't heard it here, but it was a huge hit in Britain, so see what you're missing, cause this song is just plain fun."

A1RWK72VF89I3R,B000VZOAI2,1,1,5.0,"This was the first song I heard by KISS back many years ago in the 1970's. It's hard to believe they're still going strong although they have changed drummers and guitarists a few times. I think Paul Stanley does a wonderful job singing and its a good song to dance to! Gene Simmons is a funny guy; he likes to be humorous on stage. I used to watch his TV series ""Family Jewels"" every week."
A2TYF5K1AW0O72,B000VZOAI2,1,1,5.0,Good old rock

A34DR583EV8ABR,B000VZPD0G,1,1,5.0,"James Brown has some wonderful music out of the past, I think everyone loved this song, and we love it too, thank you amazon for making it possible to order with no waiting!"
A12TCISHLKHWP0,B000VZPD0G,1,1,5.0,Great Compilation of the Godfather of Funk.  No one comes close to the funkiness of James Brown.  Music that just makes you move.
A3NCZFGM3NBDM0,B000VZKP8G,1,1,5.0,"CALIFORNIA SOUL, an Ashford & Simpson composition, sung by Marlena Shaw is a treat to the ears! I heard this song a few years back, it was playing in the background of a car commercial and everyone in the room wanted to know the name and who sang it. I had to find it and add it to my collection. Since then, I've heard it on 3 more commercials and it was on Lincoln Lawyer soundtrack, and featured in the movie The Italian Job. From the time the music starts playing, you know you're in for a treat and you get it. The music is upbeat and the melody is sweet. Marlena's voice is on point; it's uniquely powerful and full of soul. She has great control of her instrument and you get swept up in the soulful way she delivers each and every note. This song is still going strong and this is a testament to how great of a singer she is. It's no wonder - California Soul has been sampled over and over by rappers (Gang Starr, The Game, etc.), beer manufacturers, Dockers, countless television commercials and a driving game - Driver: San Frisco. I like the album, but I LOVE THIS SONG. You can't listen to it once, you have to play it over and over because it's so good. It's a timeless classic. Great tune and highly recommended."
A6WSPBL9IY5CB,B000VZKP8G,1,1,5.0,Great song is all I have to say about this as I didn't buy the whole CD but just one of the songs on the album.
AB87F7XIIOF3F,B000VZKP8G,1,1,5.0,"First we heard this song in Lincoln Lawyer the movie, then we hear it in all
the Target ads, now it's being used in the bare minerals makeup ads, who's
next?  It's such a great song, I'm glad it's being played as much as it is, so more
people can discover the great Marlena Shaw.
Amazon has a couple of the versions available here, the original, and the new mixes."
A2NX6EEY3LW04X,B000VZKP8G,1,1,5.0,"Music reviews make no sense to me because its a matter of opinion. I wouldn't have purchased this song if i didn't like it, an to top it all of the songs on here have previews. Either way great song"
A2ZB9WQ3MWNWEV,B000VZKP8G,1,1,5.0,Kept hearing it in a Ford Advertisement and wondered who it was.  Asked my daughter and she did a search on Utube.  I did another search on Utube by using the words I heard and found it.  Amazing song.
A19Y23SONFA9UF,B000VZMQ10,1,1,4.0,I straight R&B and not a huge country fan but my mom loved this lady when i was growing up and i remember my mom listening to her music when i was a kid.  I buy country music from time to time to mix into my R&B and Soul.  Loretta lynn is te standard i hold all other country artists too.

A2NM6Z4B6VK4F7,B000VZPIDS,1,1,5.0,"When one thinks of rock bands from the 1970's, Head East isn't one that comes to mind right away.  But they had one of my favorite singles from that time, Never Been Any Reason, and was happy to see this offered in digital format."
A3QOB77NSEHGDB,B000VZPIDS,1,1,4.0,"If you are over 30, you can relate to this song. This is good music, not the loud noise masquerading as the music of today."
A28C6AU4OYR709,B000VZPIDS,1,1,4.0,"If you've ever wanted to express frustration ala song then the lyrics in my title bring this song into candidacy.
It's not the best song in the world and it's not melancholic. The up tempo and melody don't exactly reek of despair but the lyrics can fit if you let them. You still get angst in the tone so as a vehicle to express a frustration through song, you can consider it.
I like it - at around a buck it doesn't hurt to have it on the right playlists ;)"
A33QL7Y8Y9SQSI,B000VZPIDS,1,1,5.0,this was a cool song that i first heard back in the 70's when i was an early adult . a nice add on to my player.

AKNT0SBNN5YM8,B000VZPF2W,-1,1,5.0,Another hit from the hit maker.
A1AMPGEFN9R9CT,B000VZPF2W,1,1,5.0,"I love this song! I love the video too, but I love the song.  I prefer the clean version because, being Caucasian, I don't need to hear the n-word.  I worry I might unconsciously start singing it in the store, and I prefer to go grocery shopping without getting my butt kicked because I'm singing the correct lyrics. :/"
AJF6NFPAW3G3K,B000VZPF2W,-1,1,5.0,Not fond of Kanye but do like this song. The beat is what I like most about it. I purchased the clean version bc I don't like vulgar language in music.
A29FKY007Z9DG0,B000VZPF2W,1,1,5.0,"Love this song, hate West and Foxx. But seriously, they make some great music together. This song is pretty addicting. Def a good party song..."
AK4RZ5IJO2F70,B000VZPF2W,1,1,5.0,Luv  the mix of old and new rap/classic R&B musical  genres. Kanye paying homage to the roots of American music.
A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I,B000VZPF2W,-1,1,5.0,"I heard the Glee version and I decided that I wanted the actual (well, edited) version. It's different and slightly more graphic--hence it says, edited, not ""clean"" version."

AGWD67X4C1ZVK,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5.0,great song. Thank you!!
A86WP180LOBGH,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5.0,"Beautiful ballad by Penridge and KISS. This song, from the Destroyer album in 1976, is still a popular song with the young rockers ...after almost 40 years. Truly the mark of a great band and an awesome song!"
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5.0,"KISS is a rock n roll band. In the 1970-80s era, they embodied an aspect of rock alongside the Who, the Stones and the others. Most of their music is high testosterone, like ""Strutter,"" ""Hard Luck Woman,"" and ""I Was Made for Loving You,"" bordering on self-parody. They were and are fun.

Then there's ""Beth."" It is a quiet song, but is gritty in its message. It isn't a metal ballad, but could have just easily been performed by Bread. There is depth, passion, and love. It is poetic, melodic, and, in my opinion, has earned its spot as one of rock music's greatest songs.

If the rest of KISS' songwriting was on par with ""Beth,"" KISS could've been more than a fun band stuck its era, but had a legacy to last until the end of rock n roll.

It begins:

Beth, I hear you callin'
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playin'
And we just can't find the sound

It ends:
Beth, I know you're lonely
And I hope you'll be alright
'Cause me and the boys will be playin'
All night

Look, if you are reading this review, you already know the song. Nothing here that's new. I suppose my review is for that one guy on the planet who loves KISS but magically, mysteriously missed this song. Is that even possible?

A135GWMXMTR58Z,B000VZO4TW,1,1,5.0,. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great
A3GJ6CFWN47N0U,B000VZPI7Y,1,1,5.0,"I enjoyed this song. I often listened to this song, repeatedly. I am happy to state that it is part of my music library."
A2JY0CRCF9GWCH,B000VZQISW,1,1,5.0,"This song is from early in Trisha Yearwood's career.  I like some of her music, but this song has always captivated me.  Her voice is nice, but the combination of the vocals, the melody, and the words work extremely well together.  You may find yourself singing along and actually reminiscing of some ""back when"" moments of your own.  That is True song magic."
A26GW9GHWZJ0UY,B000VZQISW,1,1,5.0,Just a poignant sweet reminiscing song to cause the listener to think of the one that got away or a fabulous memory with the significant other.  Trisha sings flawlessly in this song.
A2W9LEXD3BAETW,B000VZQISW,1,-1,3.0,"I like this song and wanted to add it to my huge music collection, so I purchased it. Keeping all of that in mind, there are a whole lot of Trisha's albums/tracks that I'd put ahead of this and consider ""essential"" tracks too."

A1QOYWEU4UPUML,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5.0,"One of the best tracks ever produced. I love the music, beat, tone, everything. This is a near perfect song and I wish she would have had more like it in her career. Get it now!"
A1203Q0HWECJXU,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5.0,"Overall, this is a great product due to its high replay value. I would recommend this product to both music aficionados and casual music listeners alike."
AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000VZQHNS,-1,1,5.0,"Nelly Furtado completely remade herself in 2006.  Her earlier work, including hits ""I'm Like a Bird"" and ""Powerless"" were fun and entertaining songs (and Nelly is a very attractive, appealing artist), but they didn't excite the mass audiences.  They had more appeal to the Adult Contemporary chart.

  2006 saw the debut of her song ""Promiscuous"", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take ""Promiscuous"" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This set the tone for the remainder of her album ""Loose"", which showed her new image to be genuine instead of posed."
A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL,B000VZQHNS,1,1,4.0,I saw this as a song choice for a book and once I heard the preview for the song I was hooked. This is a great song to listen to or work out too. I would highly recommend it

AS02LU5CR8VJP,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5.0,This is the same version I heard on the radio when it first came out. This is the studio recording and is not a live or concert version.
A1PBK25WOPM6QA,B000VZQHNS,1,1,5.0,The beat is tight. Lyrics are well on point. Just a fun song to dance to. Nellly Furtado and Timbaland are a great combo.
AN70QAG4P5TIS,B000VZQHNS,1,1,4.0,"I have no idea why I got this song or when, but I do like it. It's fun to clean to! hahaha"
A6DSDTFL9O4HB,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5.0,"I'll be honest... it's an Mp3 download.  It downloaded, I listened to it, end of story.  No problems getting it on my computer or accessing it.  Good times, man, good times."
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5.0,"In this simple song, Lisa Loeb and Nine Stories express the conflicting emotions of people in many relationships, wondering if they should stay with someone who confuses them or drives them crazy.  Nice guitar work in particular, and lovely vocals."
A33EIZD6GMJ1WL,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5.0,My favorite song from the 90's. Still great and I would recommend this song for your library. Great rhythm and beat.

A2VG6FKR3WQ84A,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5.0,her voice is just calming and sweet.  I like originality and Lisa seems to have that down pat.  I like it.
A1YJKLHQJ10GJZ,B000VZSC8G,1,1,5.0,Finally got my hands on this GEM! One of my favorites of all time. This song plays well. I think this was like $.69 cents.
A3B2F2086QK67Q,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5.0,"I just heard this song today i thought the title was ""You got the music in you"" till i tried to download it (My BAD!)........This song reminds me of records from the late 60's early 70's groups like the Young Rascals Tommy James & the Shondells, even The Doobie Brothers to a degree............LOVE IT!"
A3QMW0R63QGZT2,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5.0,"Great song by great band. Love the pick me up every time I hear it. And, it makes me smile."
A8IVYKSKP8QFY,B000VZSBPK,-1,1,5.0,"If you have heard of Jeff Lynne and or ELO (The Electric Light Orchestra), this song from The New Radicals will sound a lot like the 70's version of ELO.

It took me about two weeks to track this tune down, and everyone I explained it too thought I was crazy saying it ""ELO who?""

The ELO song best close to this is

""All Over The World"" (from the Xanadu Soundtrack)

Listen to that and you'll see what I mean...

This song however is a great inspirational song and a great sounding one at that."
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5.0,"The 90s backlash has been ugly, with this not only 90s classic, but music classic being pushed aside since radio chewed it up and spit it back out, 1,000 spins later. It still lives on in the minds of millions of fans who still put this high up on their life's soundtrack.

It's a song that runs on a million trains of thoughts, ranging from karma, to self-appreciation, to celebrity-bashing. It's certainly ground-breakingly awesome, bringing awesomeness to another level not only in the world of pop rock, but music period. Hearkening back to those piano-driven pop ballads of the 70s, this outwardly simple song holds a lot of complexity to it. Just ask U2 guitarist/song-writer ""The Edge."" When asked in Time Magazine back in '06 what songs he would most like to have written, there was ""Wonderwall,"" and ""You Get What You Give."" And even though some would say it's a throwback to years gone by, it keeps itself a modern eye, staying relevant not only in the 90s, but also in the 00s.

Then you gotta love those vocals, using the False, and they're just so perfect for the song. And again, it's a throwback to the 70s. As for the last few verses, although some outlets have cut them, I don't really care about them, and they kind box the song in the 90s a little bit too much. Although the way he sings it is great, it's kind of here nor there, didn't need that.

So looking at best 90s songs, this ranks in the top 10, which is pretty impressive considering the litnia of the decade. Once the brutal 90s backlash is over this song and ones like it will once again receive the credit they deserve, but until then, ""You Get What You Give"" will play on as the soundtrack for a moment in time, forever frozen in splendor."
AEVAPEHXQRIDP,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5.0,Great soumd
A5QN0QWD8Y49P,B000VZSBPK,1,1,5.0,"While training for a Ragnar relay race, I downloaded songs that will motivate, encourage, and push me to do my best. For that to happen, I need clean lyrics with positive and uplifting messages.

Since it was a Ragnar relay race, I was on a team and this song also helped foster that team spirit, something is much needed for a 72 hour, 200 mile adventure across the state.

I can listen to it around kids too because the lyrics are clean. Essentially, Having this song has helped keep me going when I am exhausted and tired from all the running."

A2IKFX7NYHXVOC,B000VZSBPK,-1,1,5.0,"New Radicals is a classic example of a band that showed great promise, but broke up just as I ""discovered"" them.  ""You Get What

A1PQNXFH9Q2KUJ,B000VZRASO,1,1,5.0,These guys can't seem to make a bad song huh?  This is another band that has been around for a very long time and their music should be written in the rock & roll hall of fame.

Remember when your purchasing from iTunes, your only RENTING your music, once you quit iTunes, they yank back all the rights for you to play your music. So whats this mean?... your hundreds of dollars of music, is worthless files if you quit itunes... why? because the awful DRM that your music has been infected by. You don't own your iTunes, you will never own it as long as DRM, the RIAA and Apple have anything to do with it.

Also, listen to Hourglass. That song will make you want to ""take it to the bridge; throw it overboard; see if it can swimmer; back onto the shore...."" You know the song! Either one of these give you answers you can use... *giggle*"

A200D8BOPMR35S,B000VZUJ3M,1,1,4.0,"My boys hear music written by computers, sung by people using computer software to correct the pitch and enhance the sound. It is junk. It will have no future in music history, and it is just junk.

Rewind to a time of great creativity. Of music written by people, sung by people and performed on real instruments - by people, Squeeze the band and Tempted the song will hold up over time. We want to hear music that speaks to us as real people."

A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B000VZV9Y0,1,1,5.0,"For those of you who don't know the name of the band originates in Alaska. You see Eskimos sleep with one dog to stay warm. 2 dogs when there's a storm, and THREE dogs when its a bad storm (blizzard). Shambala and Eli's coming (live version) are the best of a Blizzard Band!"
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000VZV9Y0,-1,1,5.0,"I imagine Shambala to be one of those possibly imaginary places that used to be such popular song fodder in the 60s  and 70s.  This song was also perfectly suited to a couple of episodes of the TV series LOST.

It's one of those ditties that you sing along to even though you fully realize that you may never comprehend the lyrics or the meaning, and it doesn't matter anyway.

There are other Three Dog Night songs that bear listening to and possibly downloading as well.  Give them a listen."

A25QSVB2VE7MSF,B000VZV9Y0,1,1,5.0,This is as close to a True stereo version of this song as I can find. I'm still hoping that someone will find the original source multi-tracks and re-mix this into proper stereo. A great song like this needs to be properly produced.

A1DY8J2M6XA195,B000VZV5Z8,1,1,5.0,"What can you say about the classic Motown sound? The Funk Brothers were one of the tightest bands around then and I love playing drums along with this track. Please take me back to those great AM Radio days when they played the greatest variety of music on the planet.

A3RWQLRQ1OSKGN,B000VZV70Q,1,1,5.0,"If you don't like drive-thru records or TSL, why do you feel you're qualified to rate this record? I swear i'll never understand why people feel the need to trash on something simply becuase they don't like it.

Despite what you'll hear from these retards below me, TSL's ""say it like you mean it"" is legendary, marking one of the last good DTR releases, before they went downhill. Each one of the record's 13 songs are amazing, and no two sound similar in the least. High production value and good mixing only add to this records greatness, and you'll probably have it in your cd for more than a couple weeks before moving on to something else.

Standouts would have to include the infectious ""up and go"", the first single ""best of me"", the punk rocker ""hello houston"" and the somber acoustic ballad ""the drama summer"". Other noteworthy tracks include: ""the leaving song"" and ""left coast envy"". Pretty much any fan of pop-rock in general can find something to appreciate on ""say it"", and because replay value is so high, you find that the songs that just didn't stick before get better and better with time

TSL has since released a load of crap called ""based on a True story"". This record is nothing like ""say it"", and if you're only going to buy one TSL record, make it ""say it like you mean it"". I seriously hope these guys can come out of their slump and put out an amazing third release."
A17R7H005QCW8O,B000VZV70Q,1,1,5.0,"...its so f**king good that it ruined all other music for me. Three months and searching, and I've yet to find an album that can meet and exceed TSL's say it like you mean it. I hate you kenny...

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000VZV6NE,-1,-1,3.0,"I have always been lukewarm as far as liking Petty's music. Yeah, I own the Greatest Hits album and yeah I think it's pretty good. Were there more deserving acts that should've been inducted in the travesty known as the RockNRoll Hall Of Shame?? Yeah, definitely. Anyway, i think this song is so-so. It is obviously about LSD trip ""Learning to fly, cos I aint got wings, comin down is the hardest thing"" Some classic a$$ lysergic lyrics 4 ya."
A2J6K00TXTZWJQ,B000VZV6NE,1,1,5.0,"What can I say about Tom Petty, I love his music! Of course, some I love more than others. This is one of my faves"

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000VZUIAQ,1,1,4.0,"Often, there are times a song can touch you simply from the heart. When it comes to Snow Patrol, they had struggled for years trying to make it happen in the underground scene. But, their breakthrough song, Chasing Cars from their album Eyes Open, was one of the most soulful songs released in 2006. I like this song because it simply comes straight from the heart, and is just a very simple song. I also hope they don't get classified as a one hit wonder either, the guys feel like they actually have something else up their sleeves soon.

Song: B 1/2+"

A3MU6AB420INS8,B000VZUIAQ,1,1,5.0,"This is a favorite song of mine that I was turned on to via one of my favorite shows, Grey's Anatomy. I never really thought about owning it until after Patrick Dempsey left the show and I heard a lot of people (okay, women, lol) say they were so sad whenever they heard Chasing Cars now because it reminded them of ""Derek"". I had a little light bulb moment like, hey, I should hop on Amazon and buy that song! Sometimes I forget how easy it is these days to just own a song you really like. What can I say? I was born in the 70's! We had to buy everything on cassette tape or try to catch the song on the radio and press Record at the right time! Honestly, this is so much easier! And now I have this song and I'm very happy about it, SCORE!!"

A3KWAGK3T5FX0Q,B000VZX98O,1,1,5.0,"Classic 70's soul music that puts the move in your groove.  Heard it while attending my younger brother's 40th year high school reunion class of 1973 Cleveland, Ohio, John Adams (Rebels).  Had to have it.  Great stuff."
ASZYG2JIX156M,B000VZX98O,1,1,5.0,"When you get by the silliness of the electronic voices, you hear a sexy, pleading voice that tells you that she has a band behind her and we want to play!!!  This song was made during the ""bass synthesizer"" era of dance/funk.  With the double bass line , tight and co-ordinated rhythm you find your head gently moving to the multi-layered beat as our songstress ""can tell that you want to boogie!!!"""
A35PBET6ASHY7J,B000VZX98O,1,1,5.0,"I heard this song in mixed formation with one of Rhiannas songs and I just knew I had to have it. Wish I could get my hands on the remixed version I heard a few days ago. I do highly recommend this song if you appreciate good music and like to dance to upbeat music like this.

A3JXARXF2KGBIS,B000VZUIAQ,1,1,5.0,"I think this is a very beautiful piece of music.  I love to buy individual songs that I like.  I have often found that albums have songs I love, songs I like and songs that are not so much.  it is great to buy from amazon and get just exactly what you want."

A33FIU4CC9SH7P,B000VZUIAQ,1,1,5.0,"I always heard this song playing on Muzak or Sirius/XM while out and about.  I finally was able to find the name of the song and the group.  (Country and Christian Music are my favorite types of music so I did not know the name of this group.)

The song is very melodic and catchy."
A2XAJX9EOMX969,B000VZUIAQ,-1,1,4.0,In my opinion this a bare all song. The guy has trouble showing his True feelings; in this case 'i love you' won't cut it but sometimes the real way you feel is in your actions.

Browsing through iTunes, I came across her in the movie CHICAGO. A musical? Her? So I listened to a couple of songs and was amazed.  When I downloaded this song I was totally blown away. Never thought I'd hear a better version than The Mamas & The Pappas, but this one is.

You were used, man.

A highly amusing rock song that will lend itself to a lot of cover band play lists. Be
aware this song has a censored and an explicit version. The lyrics are straight ahead
and without any subtext, as should be a rock song about love's labored lost.

Go ahead, have fun with this one but mind the neighbors..."

A363HKFJUQ1NHF,B000VZWPPM,1,1,5.0,Black Hole Sun is another song I recently purchased from Amazon. This song is sung by another grunge band from the late 80's or 90's named Soundgarden. Their lead singer Chris has a different sounding voice. This song is a good song to listen to if you like band Soundgarden or grunge music. If you want to hear a small part of the song go to Amazon's MP3 store and listen to a small part of it. I liked this song the first time I heard it and I purchased it. Sandra K.

Like a Liz Taylor movie - that one with Paul Newman? Cat On A Hot Tin Roof? OMG - I can almost feel the sweat and the humid, Summer night . . . and a cold beer against hot skin . . . and an itch you just can't scratch . . ."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000VZWPPM,1,1,4.0,"It is absolutely so sad whenever someone young and talented dies early & before their time. With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression. It is just a tragic reminder of how very fragile someone's life can really be from beginning to end. Soundgarden really was more of a underrated band in the realm's of grunge music's legacy. Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul. That is the case with some of Soundgarden's masterpieces, and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to. The song has been a very deep hard rock delight at despair, sorrow and prayer at the soul of the rifts by the guitar. If you have honestly never heard a Soundgarden song before, this should be the first and the last one that you should go back to each time.

Song: B

AVQHN4G06F4Q1,B000VZXFQU,1,1,5.0,"""Dr. Mr. Fantasy"" by Traffic is a quintessential track for any classic rock fan's collection. It is one of the decades signature tunes by one of the era's signature bands. One indication of a song's greatness is the number of cover versions performed and which artists performed them. ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" was covered by the likes of the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I would recommend this song to any fan of the Classic Rock genre."
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000VZYEV0,-1,1,5.0,"I know just about all the words to this song and I love it. It comes off of the fabulous album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Globe-Sessions/dp/B00000JO1Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Globe Sessions</a>.

It's my second or third favorite track on there to be precise. Can't figure out which ('The Difficult Kind' is my fave and 'Riverwide' is about neck and neck with this song).

All of the songs have a different mood on the album, but on your first listen you might feel underwhelmed like I did for the first maybe 6 times I heard this album. Then it all sinks in.

'My Favorite Mistake' in particular, the first track talks about a relationship that is almost just for show and not working out well. Even Sheryl admits it's a ""mistake"".

One for the repeat button.

4.5 stars or a 9/10."

A31PYWT67U3A93,B000VZXFQU,1,1,5.0,"This song is very nice and, in my opinion, one of Traffic's best! I can listen to this every day and not tire of it. I love that this is remastered."
A252UVOWRR2KPW,B000VZV9QS,-1,-1,3.0,"...was used as the theme for one of our proms.  Not crazy about the song, but downloaded it for the memories.  I was a Three Dog Night fan, though..."
AKUEVQHEVKDFQ,B000VZV9QS,1,1,4.0,"I'm not a Three Dog Night fan, but this is the one song of theirs that I really like.  I don't really care for the preachy-ness of the lyrics, but the melody is awesome."

A29GGDC3XT9XBA,B000VZV9QS,1,1,5.0,"Did I really last hear this song in the 70's on Seattle's KJR?  How have I overlooked it for so long?  Penned by Paul Williams (yeah, that bespectacled short guy with the long cornsilk hair you saw here and there in the 70's on tv), this song has a toe-tapping rhythm that makes you want to take a road trip.  I pictured this song in a movie, too, for some reason.  It's a natural.  Where's my tambourine?"
A3HOMAS5ODFCW6,B000VZYFOQ,1,1,5.0,I loved this song for a long while. Now my girlfriend is hooked on this song.

A1QIGFZMTDF1XW,B000VZYYGU,1,1,5.0,"Always a personal favorite, I love Richie Havens' music. The way he covers ""Follow"" is not to be missed. It is heartfelt, well done, and reminiscent of the sixties. I feel fortunate to have it in my collection."

A1FV7VRBMBU1BA,B000VZYU1O,1,1,5.0,i heard this song on the radio and automatically shazammed it on my phone just to figure out who the artist was. I bought it the next day on amazon-- tom petty has really come a long way but what an awesome song--recommend to everyone
AAEHOTZ1GRAUX,B000VZYU1O,1,1,5.0,"You don't hear it very often on the radio, but it's a really good song.  Tom Petty has one of those odd type of voices that is refreshing.  You know he'll sound pretty much the same live as he does after all the mixing and remastering is done which you can't say for others.  This particular song just has a power in the lyrics about a guy in a bad romantic situation that really resonates with anyone who has ever been in love with someone else and not had those feelings returned by that person."
AFEOPL82T0JUY,B000VZY9ZQ,1,1,5.0,I absolutely love this song.

A8320GIQZYPIH,B000VZYZXC,1,1,5.0,Socially conscious classic from a socially conscious rock group.  Set the tone for my childhood. Now in my 40s ... great song to look back and reflect how far we have become.  And how far we still need to go when it comes to racial harmony.
A1MAYA1D2B5HCN,B000W00I4G,1,1,5.0,"Yes, I always liked that vintage song , with it's catchy rift. A new crime series is using it as invite to a show, not debuted as yet. That frequent ad sent me looking for it. There are many renditions, I 'd say this is the original, going on my memory.  Great is never old!"
A1D3P0DD6121R2,B000W00I4G,1,1,5.0,Excellent

A3BHOM951PY42M,B000W00I4G,1,1,5.0,Excellent original done by Soft Cell. The only MP3 file is from that old school site and it went viral before I first played it online! The other site has that song but it turned out to be another 'dud' done a few years later by the same artist...ugh! But I got the authentic original in my iTunes library and been played with it ever since on my iPod! Thank you!!
A3PJAI77KW3WXA,B000W00I4G,1,1,5.0,this song download arrived in a timely manner and were in good condition. Exactly what I wanted and saved me hunting all over locally to find them. I love shopping Amazon! So easy.
A7AO0PBCKSW82,B000W00I4G,1,1,4.0,"Another favorite track of mine from the Brits. Nice beat and clever lyrics, what more do you need? $.69 price? Done."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W00I4G,1,1,4.0,"There is no question about really great songs from the 80's that still stand the test of time, not just because they are infectious, but they still remain more everlasting than many of today's songs in merit and absolute heart. Soft Cell, which has been labeled a one-hit wonder from the 80's, still has not been able to master having another smash song. But still which is a big surprise, their biggest song is actually a cover song from another artist. Tainted Love still sounds great today from the rhythm of the heart, to the mood that many songs don't ignite today. The song which is a cover of a old Gloria Jones song, still is a one of a kind joy to listen to. While it was cheaply sampled by Rihanna for her song S.O.S. in 2006, the song that Soft Cell made years ago, is still more than anything tainted, it is real love.

Song: B+"
A2QQH28V1R1Y53,B000W00I4G,1,1,4.0,This product is as advertised. Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed. Would recommend it to others.
AOIQXY51I12F1,B000W00I4G,1,1,4.0,Catchy and timeless.  Sticks in your head and you hum it all day!  Really enjoy the sliding vocals and simple chord changes.  Good song for driving on a summer's day.
A3FTZ47MNKO1CI,B000W00I4G,1,1,4.0,"I admit, I like this cover of the song better than the original. I always imagine I'm singing to my ex-wife when it comes up on my iPod."
A288N7XQGWLK0K,B000VZWMZ0,-1,-1,2.0,"I bought this CD for the one song ""Blurry"", the only way to describe the meaning behind it is to ""Listen"" and hopefully get the meaning."
A7FXZ507G4D8F,B000VZWMZ0,1,1,5.0,Just a song I have always liked.  Catchy tune and enjoy his style of voice.  Probably their best single released.
A2EDA9OFXBIDYO,B000VZWMZ0,1,1,5.0,I listened to a few of there songs and thought they rock very good group so I ended up buying the CD Come clean excellent buy I think

A3GJ6CFWN47N0U,B000VZZ234,1,1,5.0,"I really like this song. I've heard it on the radio, but I never knew who sang this song. It took this long to find out who sang this song. Now, it's part of my library."
A2UVEQAQVSBOS6,B000VZZ234,1,1,4.0,"I had already heard this song before I downloaded it. Amazon gave me credit for a download, so I chose this song. Once again I do not know what your preferences are, but I am satisfied with this song."
A2LLN2YN8O5PV1,B000VZWMZ0,1,1,4.0,I am not a big Puddle Of Mudd fan but this is a song  I found I can relate to a lot of different things in life and my relationships. Good song.

AC842CUBAW5Z6,B000VZZ234,1,1,5.0,"My husband and I listened to this song when we were dating in 1971. It was our favorite then and it's still one of mine. I no longer have him, but I do still listen to this song. It brings back great memories...."
A3BSTFFIKK5YTW,B000VZZ234,1,1,5.0,Yes great group great song really moves me compared to some of the junk out there today !  A Favorite for sure !
AFJGZ5H8JXIXZ,B000VZZ234,1,1,4.0,I had forgotten about this song until I heard it on The Voice.  The Temptations were my mother's generation but good music doesn't have a time limit.
A2UH8RC6K5R5T5,B000VZZ234,1,1,5.0,Always loved this song. Thank you for having it. This group is outstanding and may buy mote of their songs.
AV0X262ZMA5MM,B000W00IJG,1,1,5.0,Truly a great song with a good message from an outstanding singer. Sherly Crow once again demonstrates that good songs should convey both great music and a great message!
A39U8YINLJFQS3,B000W00IJG,1,1,5.0,I have always loved this song since the first time I heard it.  The sound quality is great and it touches my heart.
A1QYS39H86RB9A,B000W00IJG,1,1,4.0,This woman has proved herself over & over again. First Cut is the Deepest is one of her originals that no one else can copy. It is a song that is part of the American Standards & I really enjoy it.
A39KI73Z82KDX5,B000VZXER0,1,1,5.0,"I rate this band a 5 star because they sound great. Yes, its an older band but still sound just as good listeing to them now as they did back then. A must hear kind of song."
A31J9510MMFH7W,B000VZXER0,-1,1,4.0,I already owned Three Dog Night's Joy To The World Greatest Hits collection -- and this song was not included.  A great single purchase finish the 3DK collection.
A3JRW716H3AX14,B000VZXER0,-1,1,4.0,I bought this tune just as a trip down memory lane and it did send me back to the 70s. It is a somewhat cheesy tune with vocal with lots of affectation which has some comic value. The recording doesn't really hold up and needs to be remastered. But if like me you need a brief escape to the70s this might do the trick.
A9QY8T0FT4BTB,B000VZXER0,1,1,5.0,Great classic song with a good beat.
A1FKZLMLYR7859,B000VZXER0,1,1,5.0,"There are the songs that really made the the 60's and 70's and this is one of them. This is not a one hot wonder band, listen and you will find most of their songs are what your parents and older siblings were listening to. Thats how I first was introduced to these vibes, from my older brothers. Not my generation but it's good for the soul"
A1I0H669U0J60X,B000VZXER0,1,1,4.0,Great band
A1XJHF8BDHNS4L,B000VZXER0,1,1,5.0,here we go again. My band. Man these guys really know how to harmonize.

A3HB1ZLHYC1RBU,B000VZXER0,1,1,5.0,Great song from back in the day.  Lot's of humor in the song and very original. Love to listen to this t ok brighten up my mood.
A226UH234YC357,B000VZXER0,1,1,5.0,Sounds just like it did when it was famous.  Love the group and this song is a favorite. I recommend it.
AE51IBCJ1LQQD,B000VZXER0,1,1,4.0,"Good music: good song good artist. Hope this music flows down to the next generation of artists at some point...I'm a little worried at the direction the music is going, but we always got these classics to listen to"
AFLLDB1E9TFN6,B000VZXER0,1,1,4.0,"While trying for many years to upgrade my music system to include songs that were important to me, I found this song done by Three Dog Night that I enjoyed very much when it first came out. I decided that I should buy this song and include it my system, and am very glad that I did."
AY3PED7KC8W95,B000VZXER0,1,1,5.0,I grew up with classic rock that my Dad introduced me to.  He made sure that I knew what good music was no matter what the genre!
A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B000VZXER0,-1,1,4.0,3 dog night was a staple rock band. The very idea of anyone reviewing songs from the 70's without mentioning them is wrong in every way. Mama Told Me is the center of their rocking.
A3QCJ20HB5LXR9,B000VZZ1DK,1,1,4.0,"A group and a song for the times. I remember this one and when I first heard it--it's one of their better ones. Fixx came out with a number of other tunes, and they all shout, ""80's!"""
AKP9TEMA1T01X,B000VZZ1DK,1,1,5.0,"I was converting an old audio tape to digital when I came across this song recorded off a FM radio, the version on the FM cassette was in surprisingly good shape for a twenty five year recital tape, but  this version is much better and really shows how much the analog tape had faded."
A3GJ6CFWN47N0U,B000VZZ1DK,1,1,5.0,"I love this song. Although I am not a fan of this group, however, I do enjoy this song. It is now apart of my music library."
A1W7268RRFD3DJ,B000W00E2W,1,1,5.0,I just love this song. Great quality of sound. I think it is good as the original too. But Smash Mouth adds a little something modern and extra though.
A3DMV280O0TTTD,B000W00E2W,1,1,5.0,smash hit from smash mouth!!!
A1CB86K53NG0P2,B000W00E2W,1,1,4.0,Love the song since shrek. Had to have. Smash mouth does great job

A1OGZ5BBG9MQI0,B000W00E2W,1,1,5.0,"If you like party songs, you might enjoy this one. The quality of the recording was good and the download was easy and the price was reasonable. Good purchase experience, I'd it again."
A25VQORE9NAF4Y,B000W00E2W,1,1,5.0,"Really liked Smash Mouth when the came out, even before Shrek.  They had some good hits and hope they come out with more."
AVL5UOMC6OFR5,B000W00E2W,1,1,5.0,This song along with the entire album is well worth the download and minimum cost to own. Would suggest this to all listeners
AIEILJSYAWK09,B000W00E2W,1,1,5.0,Great remake of a great song.  I always loved The Monkeys so I can't help but love this song.  I recommend it.
A30MN2DECWSR37,B000VZZBTY,1,1,5.0,"I have seen Shrek 2 so many times and didn't pay attention to this song. This song was used in a video montage of one of my favorite Shows (Boy Meets World, 90s baby) and I loved it. Its a great song with great lyrics. Great purchase"
A12KC4IDE1EWA0,B000VZZBTY,1,1,5.0,we love this song and the counting crows rock! thank you to amazon for having this it is loved by the family
A2QSAZ30ZHPV0Q,B000W010X4,1,1,5.0,"I love this ""older"" country song. Iheard it recently and had beeb wanting to download it. I'm glad I did. Thanks Tracy and the songwriter."
AKK5VZYUN32O3,B000W01XDG,1,1,5.0,"Not sure that this has aged all that particularly well... but, for me, it remains important.  I am not a huge Supertramp fan, but I think the theme and musical content of this song hit the mark.  It is meant to be epic and over the top and it works."
A1PBFW73YXL7OT,B000W01XDG,1,1,5.0,"ROGER HUDGSON IS MY FAVORITE  COMPOSER HIS MUSIC AND LYRICS ARE BEAUTIFUL , I RECOMEND HIS MUSIC TO EVERYBODY !"
A3URRZ02P8KLWM,B000W01XDG,1,1,5.0,"Words cannot express the musical brilliance of this song. The eerie ""lowdown"" sound of Mr. Hodgson's dealing with the devil in everyday life in his every crisis..much like what we all deal with and try to overcome. The song is fun to sing along with as well,and sounds altogether as good as the best of anything his band,Supertramp made. This beauty was unfortunately much overlooked at the time of its release. I'll always be looking forward to new music from Supertramp as well as Roger's solo work."
A2XBMGETQRI2SG,B000W020TW,1,1,5.0,It's a great song. :) I've been wanting to get for a long time. :)
A14MVG2I9PS6NZ,B000W020TW,1,1,5.0,"I love this song.  FYI: If you're looking for the version of ""Send Me on My Way"" that you heard in the movie ""Ice Age"", this is it.  The version on the ""Cruel Sun"" album is different (I didn't like it as much)."

A3KYDUPIOMNDFT,B000W020TW,1,1,5.0,"Bought this song because it's just an absolute feel good song.  Every time I've ever heard the opening notes on the radio, I just feel so happy - I truly love this song.  I never hear it on classic radio anymore, so I figured it was time to buy!"
A7SV98BQ4X543,B000W020TW,1,1,5.0,I love this band. They have such a neat style of music really all their own. I learned this song on my guitar I just love picking the first part of the song. Just a sweet sound.
A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000W020TW,-1,-1,1.0,"When you call Enterprise now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight! i have nothing against Rusted Root but, this is a prime example of how overplaying a song can totally ruin it for you! I guess the guys in Rusted Root had to wedge their bets and use the money they're making off of this for their kids' college funds. Who can blame em?"
AIQJ371GYW10F,B000W020TW,1,1,5.0,This is a fun song and brings back Ice Age movie memories! It's fun to listen to or just relax and enjoy!
A3HUP7XOHR382Z,B000W020TW,1,1,5.0,There's no reason not to love this purchase. It's a great song with great quality and I'm super excited to add it to my collection. Totally worth the little bit of change it costs!
AHNOOY55NIRE4,B000W020TW,1,1,5.0,"One of those classic songs that really stick with you.  Personally I find it upbeat and positive, with very smooth sounds.  Very catchy.  I believe it's a little bit older, 80's maybe?  Not sure, but I highly recommend this song!  enjoy!"
A7C3ON6SX53MU,B000W00K2Q,-1,1,4.0,"The song is beautiful. Some songs are louder and some softer, this one is softer. Would like it if there be a consistency with the music."
A3K4E1M3EH3EEZ,B000W00K2Q,1,1,5.0,Great songs. The music stirs one's soul.
A3IRAA9JD6HBO1,B000W00K2Q,1,1,5.0,Very powerful and moving song about child abuse.
AXG287OY16WWL,B000W00K2Q,1,1,5.0,I have always loved her music and have been enjoying this.  I still cry when I listen to Luca.  Child abuse is never ok.
A3CI38KCX6IQC7,B000W01YWQ,1,1,5.0,"Okay, the fact that I dug this song out of the Amazon avalanche of available tunes, says it was a five at the outset. I first heard it years ago on local FM, after hearing Black Hole Sun many times (too sludgy for my tastes--and now the erstwhile ""grunge""
afficianados will be shooting arrows wrapped in burning flannel soaked in Starbucks at my house--that opinion permanently
reversed  by hearing Burden In My Hand for the first time). Long sentence. I apologize. How do I describer this?
I'm told, or heard, that the audience, on hearing Beethoven's Fifth for the first time was stunned to silence--a what
the h--- was that? moment. Beethoven's fifth this tune ain't, but after a lot of years, it still surprises, and surprise invokes memory and what is memorable is what makes music last. Don't know about the future of this tune, but it popped back into my head the other day, so I bought it. Up close, no airwaves between us, it still moves. Cornell's (sic?) voice, working like an engine way over its red line sits on top of some really fine musicianship. Which is, first, what brings any band or singer into my
range of attention, the skill of the people involved at the craft they've chosen. And it ain't easy, folks. Good job, from a geezer
who grew up with the way overvalued music of the sixties."
A3IGA729Q3AB5V,B000W01YWQ,1,-1,2.0,"Dont get me wrong its hard to get or hear a bad performance of Soundgarden, but I was displeased with this live version. But I guess bands cant be perfect all the time. Still love Soundgarden though."
A1DX3FSZXUGF8I,B000W0112Y,1,1,5.0,I've loved this song ever since I first heard it many years ago. The quality of the MP3 is great.
A2AXGC87SOG0Q5,B000W0112Y,1,1,5.0,"I think Jacob Dylan has made a name for himself, beyond the shadow of his iconic father Bob Dylan. One Headlight is just one of his many hits. I recommend this song to anyone who like great music!!!"
A1UE39XHO7TFBM,B000W0112Y,1,1,5.0,"Great song! My sister and I heard it on the radio, but couldn't remember the name of it, so I went on amazon.com and found it. Now I can listen to it on my phone."

AU373JJVPGRD7,B000W0112Y,1,1,4.0,Good song from a period in time where there were a lot of one hit wonders.  This song clearly stands out among them.
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000W0112Y,1,1,5.0,"I honestly can't remember hearing any more from the Wallflowers, but when this song came out I was pleasantly surprised and loved it.  It was nice to hear that Jacob Dylan and his band have their own style apart from Jacob's father.  Hopefully, unless I've missed it, we'll hear more from them."
A1ALKVD17JX3E5,B000W0112Y,1,1,5.0,as far as i know this is the only real big hit for the wallflowers. i really like this old classic

ANZ364G88TKSA,B000W0112Y,1,1,5.0,One headlight by the wallflowers is an awsome song in my opinion. You should by this song its only a buck
A2KFYEV2YSZ2PK,B000VZYZQE,1,1,5.0,Rock the way it was meant to be. Don't even make music like this anymore. This tune can be found on the best of CD if your wanting the most for your money. Reminds me of a much simpler time before the Reagan era.

A4XVNR4BRD0KG,B000W0227C,1,1,5.0,"This song is interesting, even though it comes from the 80's; the tune cool. One part of the song, it sounds like lasers are being shot off. Then later there is some screaming, which sounds cool."
A18758S1PUYIDT,B000W014O4,1,1,5.0,"The Killers depart a bit here from some of their angrier work on an earlier album and venture into more upbeat territory with ""When You Were Young.""  Someone plays a great keyboard on this single, while lead singer Brandon Flowers sings his heart out and the other musicians collaborate to make it even stronger.  Like Foo Fighters' ""The Pretender,"" this song makes a brief detour into a softer segment around the middle, then speeds up again as it reaches the end.  Compelling and easy to remember."

A2G2HPUZOAGOL1,B000W022JA,1,1,5.0,Another kick butt song. Very well done. The album with this song is surprisingly good too. The video of the live performance is depressing - the years have not been kind to the band.
AY1PQIT8STNIU,B000W022JA,1,1,4.0,This is just good southern rock. Blends good storytelling around a theme that most everyone knows about down south with a fun beat.

A2KFDJHB3PT4N8,B000W022JA,1,1,5.0,"Not your typical country & western offering.  Steve Earle is a bit of an outlaw in the C&W field, and it's refreshing to hear a truly unique song with an atypical theme.  Musicianship is superb on this song well done!  Also it's become a very popular line-dance tune and that's good news for Steve Earle, b/c a whole group of people who never heard his music before, are now being exposed to the magic of Mr. Earle."
AU13B11E0MO9C,B000W022JA,1,1,5.0,Lyrics and melody are catchy and fun to sing along with. I highly recommend this song for those who like song which tells a fun story.

A1PWANJ4V0TXCO,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,"This will always remind me of my dad, a huge Temptations fan. Around my house growing up and well into my adult Yeats, it wasn't Christmas until my dad put this song on as sung by The Temptations.
Its very sentimental, it's smooth, it's a timeless classic. When you're putting up the tree, cooking sweet potato pies or enjoying family..,.it's not Christmas until The Temptations are on singing this. Worth the buy, you will never regret the purchase."

ADN5YE0HOKE6O,B000W00IGY,-1,1,5.0,"""All Star"" By Smash Mouth is a fun, sporty tune that will make lots of people feel good. Here are the reviews on each seperate part of the song.

  Verse 1: I like the use of the simile, ""Ain't the sharpest tool in the shed"".

  Verse 2: I forgot a little part of it, but it's still pretty fun to listen to.

  Bridge: The beginning of this part kinda sounds like dribbling basketballs. And don't forget kids, ""Go for the moon!

  Verse 3: I'm confused at a little part. In the middle, are they saying, ""Gent's room,"" or, ""Gas. Well,""? why don't you comment and tell me.

  Chorus: I have 8 words for you. I smile every time I hear this part!"
AMC6N4JIJ5UXY,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,First bought this as a bootleg copy.  Now I 've got it officially.  Listen to this every Christmas since I bought it.
A1VI10E2Z6APT9,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,Fantastic.  This is an old song.  But it has always been a favorite of mine.  AND no one can sing it like the Temptations.
AI3ZL8GDSX3G8,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,"Love this version of ""Silent Night."" They sing it from the heart, and you can't help but be genuinely touched."
A2HIVGT8GRZAL,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,I love the cranberries! This song is nice because it has a really calming sound to it and makes for good car ride or just relaxing music. I actually downloaded this to use in a presentation to teach teenagers about healthy relationships. The lyrics prompted some interesting discussion. They aren't like out of this world lyrics by any means. It's just a simple cute message with a nice sounding beat.
A3BZRIM7SDJJ1L,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,"Love the music of The Cranberries and ""Dreams"" is one of the top five songs from them on my list.  Great melody and harmonies."
AKJMEQHNKTGNX,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,"I love  all the songs.  I highly recommend this purchase, you will not be disappointed.  This is truly a classic."

AVYO0TDE30RHH,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,"My late grandmother, Alma, used to just love this song. She fell in love with it the first time that she heard it. Since she is now gone, I love the song just that much more because It makes me think of the smile that the song used to put on her face."
AA62NQO5MWFR1,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,It's definitely a song I could listen to 24/7 without ever being tired. You can tell they put a lot of work into this song.
AA62NQO5MWFR1,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,"Ever since I was a kid this has always been my favorite Christmas song. I especially love the line when he said ""If I had one wish in this world I wish that all men could be free"" Get's me everytime."

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,"With the recent passing of Dolores O'Riordan, the lead singer for the Cranberries, I've found myself revisiting this song.  I remember hearing it and loving it in my childhood and teens, and even as an adult it captivated me.  Now, after Dolores' death, it's taken on a melancholy and haunting air, but it nonetheless remains one of my favorite songs.  It marries upbeat instrumentation with wistful lyrics and vocals, somehow weaving a music experience that's at once haunting and lively.

Always a classic, this song is now a bittersweet listening experience, and well worth purchasing and downloading."
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,"The shock is still wearing off about Dolores O'Riordan's passing.  My daughter was devastated when I told her the news--she always wanted to see the band live.  And this song--it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.  If you've never heard a Cranberries record--this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound."
A2NBM3HP2T5FV5,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,Loved the song when it first came out and still love it now I bought it to remember the late singer she had a wonderful voice.

A1QDO3WDLEYXC8,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,Silent Night puts me into the Christmas spirit. The song highlights the different voice ranges of the Temptations. The Temptations take a classic to a new level.

A3JZDKK5EM175G,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,"The sound of christmas is in the air with this all time hit of silent night by the temptations. Theres nothing about it that you wouldn't like. I recommend this to you, and you recommend this to your friends, even you boss. It just might get you the raise you been waiting for...lol"

A1NBLRJQINQWJ1,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,"This song never gets old, and this version is my favorite,way to go temptations, great song remade by a fantastic group!"
A3OIYXEEIKSSMZ,B000VZYYWY,1,1,5.0,I have always loved this song. This is my favorite Christmas song. I highly recommend this to all that knows the True meaning of Christmas!
A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,"The themes that are expressed musically in this song with fine female vocal Irish intensity helped me understand how Nietzsche thought that without music, life would be a mistake. There might have been two videos for this song because anyone hearing the music thought it deserved to have more than whatever mood pictures could create. Imagine a totally amazing mind, so understanding and so kind and real to me."
APLZ8WFX69OZN,B000W02O2K,-1,-1,1.0,Can't put in my Galaxy S6 library. Can only hear on cloud. Amazon can't help!
A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,"Dreams by The Cranberries is a powerful 90s rock song that is both stirring and healing to the soul.  Fighting the Urge to Look Up The Meaning to the Song, Dreams is about coming to terms with multiple changes happening in someones life while appreciating a person who occupies a large place in your heart (metaphorically).  I recently enjoyed hearing Dreams by The Cranberries on iheartradio because it is not played as often on the radio where I currently live  I completely understand that this song could mean something completely different from what Im guessing it is but for me the song reminds me of my husband in a benevolent way.  This is because he has helped me add even more brighter colors (metaphorically speaking) to my life and has helped me appreciate life even more just by his example of how he sees the positive benefits in certain things that would test even the strongest of souls.  Hence, when the lead singer of Cranberries sings you're a dream to me it reminds me of how I have told this to my husband before (just in slightly different words). Overall, Dreams by Cranberry is both an elevating and novelty type of rock song."
A2C2S4EC6QRAGB,B000W02O2K,-1,1,5.0,5 stars
AS5PMNWIXGM6O,B000W02O2K,1,1,4.0,How can you go wrong with nostalgic
A1QNLP1DQLVY92,B000W00IGY,1,1,5.0,another favorite and trip down memory lane.  It was a song my athletic daughter listened to while  practicing her sport
A286A7A224F0JU,B000W00IGY,1,1,5.0,"I first heard this on the movie Rat Race and liked it, so was pleased to get the mp3 version for my kindle and mp3 player.  The kids like it too."
A25VQORE9NAF4Y,B000W00IGY,1,1,5.0,This song is always a lot of fun and I would recommend it to you for your collection.  They had a few hits and hopefully they will come out with another album someday.
A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B000W00IGY,1,1,4.0,"This song popped up on the radio, a couple of movies, and here and there on TV. Smash Mouth must have made a mint with it. Still listenable. That much play and still popular. Thats saying something."
A1V1S0PGI9Y1UK,B000W00IGY,1,1,5.0,Nice beat and just a fun song to listen to. Thank you to Shrek for making this one popular! Woohoo!

A3PYQ6EULBFXOL,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,Dolores O'Riordan has a hauntingly beautiful voice.
A2G2HPUZOAGOL1,B000W02O2K,1,1,4.0,Awesome harmoney. A bit bubblegumish but still enjoyable if you're in the mood. The same person appears to sing both parts of the harmoney so it would probably be disappointing live.
AWUWDX29AYLQN,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,this song is one of the best from the cranberries I'll keep looking and I know I'll find more such as Linger.
A5ZELOQA2OY7V,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,"This song is a definite 5 out of 5.  It has a magical feel about it, and is uplifting and beautiful.  If you need a song to lift your spirits, try The Cranberries  ""Dreams"".  I don't know what else to say about a song when it just hits you in such a good way so that you want to listen to it over and over, but this is one of those songs."
A3HEZUNJXUSHK1,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,I like a few songs these guys do. This MP3 is good quality and I always get a good quality song when I purchase from Amazon
A6ZKAHCONUHX5,B000W02O2K,1,1,4.0,"Every time I hear this song, I think of the first ""Mission Impossible"" movie. This song is one of the best from The Cranberries (next to ""Zombie"" and ""Linger""). Check it out!"
A1FVMR93NS5RN2,B000W02O2K,1,1,4.0,"Definitely a must have for anyone who likes music from before 2000; a great way to reminisce about music when it was still epic, unlike half the stuff now."
A3BIV1X1K9R796,B000W02O2K,1,1,5.0,"What a performance! Wonderful harmonizing! A song that really ""grabs"" you & carries you away - one you can tap your feet to & you'll never get tired of listening to...!!"
A6UMJST9VMY8M,B000W015MA,1,1,5.0,"Great song, but lyric kinda  sticks in your head. Not a bad thing."
A1TI2L994OYRZU,B000W015MA,1,1,4.0,Another good song off of this recording. Granted the entire album (to me) is not all gems but there are a few good nuggets in there and this is one of them.
A212QP91BJJ04U,B000W015MA,1,1,5.0,great album
A3TEU7G2FCRKI8,B000W015MA,1,1,5.0,I got this for my MP3 player & loved it. Great sound & enjoy it very much. I will download more
ASDPTCEGEINUZ,B000W015MA,1,1,5.0,I loved this song back in the day.  Then I discovered it again as part a car commercial a couple of years ago.  Go figure where you find and rediscover old favorites!  The Fixx has so many catchy tunes.
A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000W015MA,1,1,5.0,"I just like the guitar work in the music; it is somewhat redundant (if you don't like the first thirty seconds, forget it), but if you do, it is great.  It's kind of like CCR's Susie Q; you either like it at the beginning, or you turn it off as the song just sort of keeps repeating itself.  The words are not brilliant, thoughtful, or overly well done, but as I have already said, it's the guitar that makes the song."
A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,B000W015MA,-1,1,4.0,"Although the song is somewhat repetitious in the background beat, that's what makes it special; if you like the beat (and I really do), you can listen and enjoy the words with no problem.  On the other hand, if I listened to this song more than a couple of times in the same day, I probably would turn it off as it does get a little monotonous. There's no heavy message, and it is a passable dance song."
A2EQUA659UKXO4,B000W03ITI,1,1,5.0,"This song by Fall out boy really hinted in the relationships ended, but the memories created can be either good ot bad, typically the bad ones are the most hurtful, but overall this song rocks."
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000W03ITI,-1,1,4.0,"Over the years, we've had our share of rock/pop, pop, and who can forget power-pop, but Fall Out Boy brings back, if it was ever gone, Power-Rock. In this case, FOB goes for a breakup song, which most creative in the song title, is written in TXT MSS. Thankfully, the song is not sung in that. In style, this song resembles 'Arms Race' a little to closely, but differs in minor, but better, changes in the verses and chorus. Also, the song sounds a little better when Patrick Stump sings solo.

So overall, while it's not a bad song, it's not a great one either. But it is a great power-rock song."
A29XSAYDEXOLK6,B000W03JEM,1,1,5.0,This song is sexy and meaningful. It can make an older woman not ony feel young but loved much as well.
A2ZU18U7GQFDWL,B000W03ITI,1,1,5.0,like it
A3T5JIV2U0LJ7M,B000W03ITI,1,1,5.0,Excellent!
A2DCTT45GFQALO,B000W03ITI,1,1,5.0,"Ive seen a lot of people use this song on Wizard101 videos and other things on Youtube, I never paid much attention to it till I heard it on Pandora. I was rocking out to the song and then it hit me. "" wow this song is awesome! I should download this! "" so I go back on Pandora and look at the name. "" hey, ive heard this before of Youtube!"" So then I went and bought it and listened to it to the point where I know all the lyrics and can sing along. I showed my dad and hes like "" its okaaayy "" . <(3)> hes more into classic rock like led zeppelin.  Pfffttt. Who cares XD . I listen to stuff like this. CUZ ITS AWZOME!!!!"
A1ASYIJZE8TX65,B000W03ITI,1,1,5.0,"""one night and one more time thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great he!"" "" great song !"
A1OHEAMWM8PKAE,B000W03ITI,1,1,5.0,"I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.
See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you paid the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you paid for it, its all legal , and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:"
AAIBETZLM3DO5,B000W03ITI,1,1,5.0,Fall Out Boy is amazing. This is one of there awesome songs. I really like how it gets stuck in your head and u sing it all day in class or at work or with a friend.
AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000W03JEM,-1,1,4.0,"I'm the first to say, that I am not a Country music fan at all; but there are exceptions. Some of Conway Twitty's songs are good, this on reminds me of my father, and his obsession with Country. I will tell you to listen to the sample before buying the song; but if you like T.G. Sheppard or Johnny Cash get it. At the time it was only .69 cents my how Country music has evolved."
A1KE19CDYIO2YN,B000W03JEM,1,1,4.0,Brings back happy memories of simpler times.

A482F1K5S4QS5,B000W03JEM,1,1,5.0,love his music and I will be purchasing more in the near future as long as my wife lets me order
A1LFIPE9VYQ9PO,B000W03JEM,1,1,5.0,This song hits my emotions because he is so honest with his wife throughout their life.  He seems to love her so.
A3A59S0U11I2L9,B000W03JEM,-1,1,4.0,Either your gonna like or not. If like hip-hop or rap then probably not. If like country then maybe. If you love classic country then this song is more up your alley.
A3IIQKJSZLTJLG,B000W03JEM,1,1,5.0,I am a Conway Twitty fan and this is one of his best.  He had a certain style and voice that set him apart.  I would recommend this song to others.
A1R9LXA9NEQRHZ,B000W03JEM,1,1,5.0,"It tales you back when Conway was popular.  Those were the good years, We lived in that time frame when music had meaning."
A3BDJEW165ZXT6,B000W03JEM,1,1,5.0,"Clever, catchy lyrics. A delightful melody that brings a smile to your face. Deeper meaning that shows what real love is. I've rarely heard better."
A1HT0PU4VGIV9G,B000W03JEM,1,1,5.0,"One of my favorite songs from my high school era.  Was reading a book recently and Conway Twitty's name came up, which reminded me to come look for some digital music."
A1YWQEMFGJRV7,B000W03JEM,1,1,5.0,Wonderful song. Purchased it to play in my daughters wedding and it was the perfect song! They really loved it.
A1ASYIJZE8TX65,B000W03IQ6,1,1,5.0,reminds me of being in school singing this in class and others playing it out loud on there portable speakers!
A1D2KSBEPOSJSW,B000W03IQ6,1,1,5.0,Fall Out Boy has earned their place as proven powerchorders among the Hosts of Rock'n'Roll Heaven as well as within the ranks of the non-thermonuclear arms dealers worldwide!
A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000W03IQ6,-1,-1,3.0,"In the follow up to 'Cork Tree,' Fall Out Boy had to capitalize on their success to engrain themselves. Their first single here, comes off less as a single, and more as an arena-anthem. As a single, I thought it was good when in first came out, catchy, unique, good build-up. However, this song has worn on me, and not by radio mind you, but just the song itself. The song could be described as an angry power-rock (rather than power-pop) anthem, and because of the style that goes along with a song like this, it just doesn't hold any staying power. Maybe for a month or two, but then it's history.

So overall, if you've never heard the song, try it, you might like it. Beware though, it's not very long before it'll get sentenced to the shelf."
A33Y9VYO68ZK3B,B000W03LA4,1,1,4.0,yes
A2FOPNPBMXEL0A,B000W03LA4,-1,1,5.0,A classic!

AXG287OY16WWL,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,I love Cat Stevens

A1P1Y27488LQ3I,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,This song has become a cult favorite and is often used in weddings.  It is a beautiful song and one that stays with you.
A3V1DUGH634VUW,B000W03HRG,1,1,4.0,many years ago they became a special couple they are great togeather they sing songs you understand and has a story behind it thanks Robert Hewett
AV4JG3M796IXO,B000W03HRG,1,1,5.0,This song just cracks me up. It's great. I couldn't believe this was a real song when I first found it. Even my mom thinks its funny.
A2QS1G616D85LR,B000W03HRG,1,1,5.0,I'm not much into the country scene. This is one of the 20 or so of this genre music that I enjoy. Don't forget to play it loud for your other half!
A38M4WA40CSPWY,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,Many artists have covered this song which is possibly over a thousand years old. It originally came through the church to Europe and had been sung by clerics and monks for many years. His version is by far the best of this song and he is probably most remembered for it.
A1S7V8B3RDNLQK,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,This one of my all-time favorite songs.  I've always thought of it as a hymn:  words of a prayer describing the beauty of Nature that God made for us; his gift of love for mankind.
A1YM90PT8Z1CWC,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,I learned the words to this simply to use it as a morning prayer.  Then I bought the mp3 and began a collection of morning prayers for my pre-breakfast walk with the dogs.  Simple and beautiful.
A3U5HFB7TIDG5W,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,"I ran across Cat Stevens on YouTube singing this song from 1976, which he did very well. It turns out his name is now Yusuf, shortened from Yusuf Islam. Recording of music is good in that it leaves a legacy of performer. Amazon is good too in helping to make it easy to select and download beautiful music for a wide variety of artists."
A3LGIFP5LEQPOY,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,"Morning has Broken is a religious hymn predating Cat/Yusefs conversion to Islam.  Written by author Eleanor Farjeon and set to a traditional Gaelic tune Bunessan.  The song has been covered as wide a variety of singers as Art Garfunkel (a Jew) and Steven Curtis Chapman (a Christian Musician)  but by far the best is Cat Stevens (now known by his Islamic name Yusef).  His mastery of the guitar and the beauty of his voice make the song what it is.  Cat's version originally off the Album Teaser and th Firecat.

If you love folk rock and you don't have this one, the time to add it to your collection is now.  i"
AHGJA3C7R97E,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,"I'm a big fan of Cat Steven's.  I wish he'd write and sing more songs. My fondness of him has NOTHING to do with politics.  I simply love his music.  I am not quite clear what his status is with the U.S. is currently, but I do miss his music.  He's someone I'd like to see in concert."
A3I8GC0R44ON1L,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,This is a favorite song of mine and I really like most versions. But I LOVE Cat Stevens version. He does it justice for sure.
A171B3B9Y3SZ3E,B000W03LA4,1,1,5.0,I absolutely love this song. It is so touching and wonderful. They sometimes play it at my church. I got this song for free from amazon after a CD purchase. It was a good deal.
A1RXDSG1KL0XNM,B000W02Q1Y,1,1,4.0,"The Fixx demonstrated a tremendous talent with Reach the Beach. It contains the hits One Thing Leads to Another and Saved By Zero. The album itself was a commercial success, containing a lineup of songs that were appealing and fun to listen to. I would recommend this album to anyone as an introduction to a great band that I feel is under sung."
A3TEU7G2FCRKI8,B000W02Q1Y,1,1,5.0,I got this for my MP3 player & loved it. Great sound & enjoy it very much. I will download more
A2VSNUK7YLRKRE,B000W02Q1Y,1,1,4.0,I got this for my mp3 player as it was a constant song on the radio and MTV in the 80's.  Nostalgia is cool.
ASDPTCEGEINUZ,B000W02Q1Y,1,1,5.0,The Fixx has some many great songs.  This is a popular one on the radio still.  I wanted to add this to my MP3 library.  Amazon has a great selection of digital sounds to built your own person radio station.
A15YZWK4JZZQ6S,B000W02Q1Y,1,1,5.0,"Great beat, great message, this song will get you on your feet.  I was very pleased to add this to my collection; I'll enjoy it often."

A1TI2L994OYRZU,B000W02Q1Y,1,1,5.0,"Back when this group was popular, they were everywhere. I was neutral to their offerings...Didn't hate them, didn't love them. Now that I've gone back and given them a hard listen through a good stereo system, it is shocking how well produced this song is and how musically talented these individuals are. Just a great band that I get to newly enjoy with a fresh ear and opened mind!

Hope this was helpful."
AER2CRRW2U50Q,B000W02Q1Y,1,1,5.0,Gotta love that beat!

A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000W02Q1Y,1,1,5.0,"This record was so cool!  I honestly can't remember any other songs from the band, but this record was great.  A nice mix of funk and rock---great band."

A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B000W04NM4,1,1,5.0,"The thought content of this song, hyping disabilities, matches the way a culture of denial has doctors who pry into the way patients with social problems have become self-inflicted. Losing our hands or eyes to stop crying about how much we do or see fits a religion of letting go and letting God carry the burden. In All Too Much for Me, the Incredible String Band shift to:

Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there: leave it there."

A1CHLJQMZN8LHG,B000W05FSU,-1,-1,2.0,"I think CeCe Peniston's material represents the 90's decade well.  I like that black turtle neck outfit she wears in ""Finally.""  I guess ""Keep on Walking"" is funky as far as rhythm, instruments, and beats go, culminating into a well put together song from the 90's.  ""I thought that what we had would never end..""  is obviously a song about a romantic relationship.  Beyonce's ""De Ja Vu"" and Teena Marie's ""Square Biz"" are similar to this song's style."
A7FAAD1IA84WJ,B000W05FSU,1,1,4.0,"What else could I say about it?  I purchased it because I really like the artist.  I've been throughly satified with all of my MP3 purchases from Amazon, to date."

Everyone thought it was fantastic. Recently when assembling a video slide show of some very old photos taken by my late uncle, I knew this (and their album Reference Point) would be perfect background music. I hadn't heard it in over 20 years so it was great to listen to this collection again. Excellent mix of nylon and steel string guitars."

A2JD3AFEUWWB1Q,B000W0633G,1,1,5.0,With its relentless beat and provocative lyrics Zombie has to rate with the best protest songs of all time. One of the contestants on The Voice sang it. I had to hear the original on YouTube. Then I had to buy this fabulous alternative rock song by the Irish group The Cranberries.
A28XPN759HNNFL,B000W0633G,1,1,4.0,Just something to workout to in the gym when I'm training. Just a cool track to listen to when I'm not working out.
A28V3U0MTBETSE,B000W0633G,1,1,5.0,"I've listened to this song for awhile now, it speaks volumes to me. I've heard some of the cranberries work when I was in high school and this particular song stuck out the most to me. I know it's not one of those songs you share with your friends, but it's one of those songs that tells a story about a time in your life. If you understand where I'm coming from, you might want to invest in this song."
A17JEVSB2MW0GL,B000W0633G,1,1,4.0,"This one is my favorite song of the Cranberries. I'm glad I downloaded it! They do have several good ones, but this one is my favorite."

ARYVQL4N737A1,B000W08GMW,1,1,5.0,"Besides ""Wild World,"" this is my favorite song by Cat Stevens. The time period this song was produced in has to be one of the greatest times to be a singer-songwriter, who concentrated more on writing and performing songs on the acoustic-electric guitar than the electric guitar :) Besides Cat Stevens, performers like James Taylor, Jim Croce, Gordon Lightfoot and groups like America singing ""A Horse With No Name"" ruled the airwaves back then :) A great, timeless song!"
AOMBISTIW8NT8,B000W07FYC,1,1,4.0,"I like this group just wish that they produced more music, this was a good album though. It would be nice to hear from them again hopefully in the near future they will put out some new music."
A2024JF3VOLJ6X,B000W07FYC,-1,-1,1.0,i don't listen to music at all. i rather be in a quiet room than listen to music at all.
AUGIP6NWVR2PS,B000W07FYC,1,1,5.0,"Blackstreet does this with such an infectious beat and lyrical genius that despite the young woman's profession of proclivity towards not making a move unless the check has been deposited(heck with being in the mail:)), you find yourself cheering her on....she is the ultimate entrepreneur who by all lyrical accounts has the confidence of all of the head of state throughout the world combined to use whenever need be....there's no shame in her game......gotta love it"
A2UUEV4MYOJY66,B000W08GMW,-1,1,5.0,"At first when I heard this on the radio, I thought the lyrics were B string. No so, another fine song by Cat Stevens. Enjoy listening to this one and many others he has made."
A3Z9QN0RCOHEY,B000W08GMW,1,1,5.0,I love this song and being able to buy the single so cheap was a boon. Loved being transported back to my favorite music era. Try It!
A226UH234YC357,B000W08GMW,1,1,5.0,"One of the major 3 TV broadcasters had it playing in the background of their coverage of the last troops coming home from Viet Nam, when President Nixon got th em out of there.  It seared  in my brain of their rescue by our government."
A3FSMMWJR8FNDD,B000W08GMW,1,1,5.0,"I really love this song. Not only does it have great music, but its message is one of peace and love, something our world needed when it was first written and now, years later."
A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B000W08GMW,1,1,4.0,An artist who left us way to soon. I'm glad he found peace in his life and we didn't lose him the way we've lost so many. Thank you Mr. Stevens for what you gave us.
A2DMCDV67J1GGE,B000W08GMW,1,1,5.0,"This was a gift for my wife, and just to see her face light up when she heard it it was delight enough for me to love it, then i got to hear it and loved it"
A3LGIFP5LEQPOY,B000W08GMW,1,1,5.0,"Cat Stevens (now Yusef Islam) is one of the best Folk singer/songwriters of his generation.  Though he now goes by Yusef  Islam and frankly looks like a member of a terror cell, his music still touches you.  Teaser and Firecat, the album from which Peace Train,  Moonshadow and Morning Has Broken come is still one of the all time greatest ."
A14I0X9ZNK9D83,B000W08L5Y,-1,-1,3.0,"""It's Only Make Believe"" is the only song on the CD that I wanted - the rest was forgettable. Conway Twitty went on to have a big career in Country Music, but this is one of those songs that was big on the Rock 'n Roll charts, and is one of those iconic songs that evokes memories for those of us who were teens in the late '50s/early '60s."
A3TLIA64FX0O1G,B000W07IEY,-1,1,5.0,"Broken-hearted lovers everywhere have cherished this song because it perfectly characterizes the emotions that accompany those on-again, off-again relationships we have all experienced.  ""You think you're gonna breakup, then she says she wants to make-up.""

What has always set this recording apart from many of its peers was the textured layer of background vocals, overdubbed repeatedly, to create a doo-wop four-part harmony that would have made even the Beatles jealous.

It was a brilliant pop masterpiece, unique in its day and still unequaled.  ""And after all it's just a compromise for the things we do for love."""
A1Q8PMUXW8D1DI,B000W08GNQ,1,1,5.0,"Luckily, I didn't have this type of relationship with my sons. It is a song with a lot of feeling, very well done."
AP9EU0CF0BBK3,B000W08GNQ,1,1,5.0,needed to update my music catalog for my MPS player and can't do without this one.  Highly recommend this to anyone who likes this genre.

A3Z9QN0RCOHEY,B000W08GNQ,1,1,5.0,I always loved this song and actually forgot about it until trying to purchase some songs from the 70s. This one brings back so many good and sad memories. Do a preview. Worth buying for $1.29
A2IWPPAA1DU8K4,B000W061F6,1,1,5.0,"Like everything The Temptations did this is an under rated masterpiece.  I had seen them perform this song live and to watch the group not only sing but the choreography was incredible.  The Temptations were always a top notch singing group and although ""Lady Soul"" never did as well as many of their early hits, to me it's a fine example of how a singing group can change with the times and still have the ambience they always had."
AW9DBZ8CX8637,B000W061F6,1,1,5.0,This is one of my favorite songs by the Temptations. I love how they sing their love to the women they love.

A9RVUPWTOTVDS,B000W08K0U,1,1,4.0,"This song is an example of the music composed by Babyface.  It's a fine song, though the lyrics are difficult to understand.  My older sister wanted me to order this song for her for personal reasons."

A1AG8DPPTFRTQ4,B000W08K0U,1,1,5.0,I have to say that this is one of the saddest songs for me. But it helps me in so many ways. Losing my mom two years ago meant that I would listen to certain songs and sit and reflect. This would be one of those songs. Boyz II Men takes you there and it doesnt hurt to shed a few tears. Perfect harmonies and a wonderful tribute song for mama.

A10Q1RJCPTRAM5,B000W05EGI,1,1,5.0,I couldn't wait to listen to this song again after many years.  It takes me back to a much simpler time (my youth) and makes me nostalgic.  Love it!
AWAFSYBKPTZI4,B000W0AHYW,1,1,5.0,This song has a lot of meaning. If you really listen there is a message for all. I highly recommend this one.
A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B000W0AHYW,-1,1,5.0,This is serious. Parents you must introduce Cat to your children. The very idea that a generation could pass without being introduced with some of the best the 70's has to offer is sad.
A1SHXWWTG1DKG3,B000W0AHYW,1,1,5.0,"This song takes me away, not just back to when I would hear it on the radio every day, but that's part of it.

A15T3Y3BL2AJ9V,B000W05EGI,-1,-1,3.0,Some psychedelic sound. At the time I kinda liked it. Now I'm not sure. The MP3 sound is a bit 'not so good'.

A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B000W05EGI,1,1,5.0,After watching Guardians of the Galaxy several times this song turned into an ear-worm so I bought the song. It has a moody borderline creepy feel that for some reason I like.

A107OPFJV11RKO,B000W05EGI,1,1,5.0,"I was watching a movie a couple of weeks ago and this song was part of it's Soundtrack. This was a song that I used to listen to quite a bit as a young man and it was a  song that was forgotten about when I switched to listening to CD's. I had the Album but never bought the CD. This is a great love song that relies heavily on Electronic Synthesizers. Being a hopeless romantic I related to the lyrics, I always felt I was in love but didn't want to show it. ( It was really lust and most women knew it). I'm glad I have  this  song back in my library."

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000W05EGI,-1,1,5.0,"The ethereal sound was created by laboriously building up multiple overdubs of the voices of Stewart, Graham Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing a single note in unison. This multi-track was then mixed and dubbed down onto 16-track tape. This process was repeated across all 16 tracks to create a lush 256-voice ""virtual"" choir that could ""sing"" chromatic chords.[2] A number of these prepared multi-tracks were then cut into several endless loops, each of which contained the basic notes of the main chords used in the song. The chorus loops could then be played by using the mixing desk rather like a keyboardeach chord could be sounded by bringing up the fader for that loop. The instrumental break featured the repeated spoken phrase, ""Big boys don't cry..."", spoken by Kathy Warren, the receptionist of their own Strawberry Studios where the band recorded the track. These whispered lyrics would later serve as the inspiration for Brit  group, The Cure, who had an album and song called Boys Don't Cry. Axl Rose has also stated that this is one of his favorites which inspired him to get into music."

A2NADXRZGP014J,B000W0AGGG,1,1,5.0,"I originally purchased this collection as a cassette back in 1985.  When I played it for others they always were impressed with the songs.  No wonder!  This was George Howard's first highly recognized album of his career, making the #1 spot in 1985 in Top Jazz Albums.  And check out Billy Childs on the keyboards!  This was truly the beginning of George Howard's celebration of music and song."

A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000W0CPME,1,1,4.0,"""Obession"" was L.A.'s Animotion's biggest hit, peaking at number six in early 1985.  The song makes liberal use of a killer synth riff that gives the song an appropriately edgy and eerie feel.  The vocal interplay between singers Bill Wadhams and Astrid Plane nails the tension in the lyrics perfectly."

A3JRW716H3AX14,B000W0V2XW,1,1,5.0,This is one of those rare performances that is actually better than the original. Don't get me wrong I love the original by Joni Mitchell but this version has a lot of energy and for some reason makes me smile every time I hear it. Of course this gives some dissonance to the lyrics which only makes it a more powerful rendition.

A2VRL7KYHJQWPE,B000W0V2XW,1,1,5.0,"I like this version of ""big yellow taxi"" better than the other version, which I don't remember who sang that, but this version, by Counting Crows, rocks."
A2VPW35GSE96J1,B000W0V2XW,1,1,5.0,As an educator I use a variety of music to diversify lessons plans in a variety of areas of study.  This song was complimentary in our unit on the environment.
A3GP6K6OLMVJ6V,B000W0V2XW,1,1,5.0,"back in the early 70s, this tune was recorded more on the country/folk sound and i found it to be a great song to hum anywhere. the counting crows managed to make it even sound bigger, better than i remember.  the beat is up-dated and so is my utmost like for this type tune.  this doesn't always happen but when it does, the tunes of another day come alive with a sound that pleases and opens another generation to what turned and tuned us in with the originals.  great job guys. you and this song rocks."
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI,B000W0TIRE,1,1,4.0,"I was so surprised to see how good Foxy Brown's new album,
""Broken Silence"" was. It much more emotional,smart,funky,and
street than both her previous album. From ""Fallin'"" to the grimy
""BK Anthem"" to the funky Neptunes produced ""Gangsta Boogie""
,Foxy wins on almost all of the tracks(I didn't care for ""Hood Scriptures"").Her breathless delivery and confident rhymes are all very tight!"
A2OJNP4NOWGX01,B000W0TIRE,1,1,5.0,"Foxy has made a incredible come back. Broken Silence is hot. It makes her last album Chyna Doll sound like non sense. She mentioned at the end of the booklet that she sometimes found the album too difficult to complete, I can see why. The album kicks especially the sound ""Hood Scriptures"" which is actually the most incredible song ever written. Believe it, rap and latino music blend together nicely. Other hot songs are ""Fallin"", ""730"" amongst hot joints with Baby Cham and Ron Isley. The album is hot. ""I don't care"" is another classic is which she says "" to all the haters that be looking to fade us, we not concerned with what you put in the papers"". Lil Kim said in her album, that people had the gall to be re-writting her rhymes and Foxy says that people can do the thing she does. The lines are probably sent for one rapper to the other. Foxy also said in her song Fallin ""I shed tears when Biggie and Pac got killed, there's only one other broad who really got skill, she's alright, but she's not real"". Is this for Lil Kim, maybe. The women of rap better watch out. Foxy is back and hotter than acid. It will take a whole lot a... for Trina and Lil Kim to catch up to Foxy's new speed."
A3RC3AK8UN89I9,B000W0TIRE,1,1,5.0,"A little more than two years after she released her sophomore album, Foxy Brown returns with a world of experiences to talk about on BROKEN SILENCE. This album is a testament to the life the hip-hop femme fatale has lived, and it's her most truthful work to date. From the vagaries of love to life's struggles to the business of music, Brown completely opens up, detailing every last secret that has haunted her career.
On ""A Letter,"" she dedicates a verse to her mother and each of her brothers, apologizing for her mistakes. Then on ""730,"" a bouncy track produced by Loafey, Foxy speaks directly to another woman who's trying to rain on her parade. But that doesn't mean that the entire album is about heartache, as reggae-influenced songs like ""Tables Will Turn,"" featuring Baby Cham, and ""Oh Yeah,"" featuring Spragga Benz, introduce a new wrinkle to Brown's rapping style. She also honors her roots by paying homage to her hometown Brooklyn on ""BK Anthem."""
A3OLZXHFGUAMWW,B000W0TIRE,1,-1,3.0,"we all knew foxy would diss rap's favorite queen b, and lash out at natina reed, thought she was a player honey get over kurupt, still this cd is worth a listen.if you love foxy ,then this is 4 you."
A3RV0VQKIM2HSW,B000W0TIRE,1,1,4.0,"This new one from foxy puts her back where she left off on Ill na na(her first cd) but in a whole new way. A lot of people thought she would fall off or come back weak on this but she came from left field with some of these tracks. This time she brought a lot of reggae, dancehall, some soca and even indian music to the plate. Some of the tightest tracks on this is where she raps with dancehall beats. Hearing foxy chant in jamacian puts her on a whole different level now and no other female mc right now can do it better. The way that she flows from rap to reggae makes it look a lot easier than it is. There is one song call ""so Hot"" where she shows her trini roots with a calypso style beat that sounds different to anything out now. Bk Anthem has one of the hardest and tightest beats that you can play on the set. On songs the leter she apologizes to her family and different people she hurt. On broken silence she lets you knwo what she has been goign through all this time. Fallin and 730 pust some rumors to an end liek jay-z writing some of her rhymes. She admits it saying ""Yeah I did, but I blew um up the same"". ""Tables will turn"" is anotehr tight song that I think is on of the tightest on the cd...produced by regage producer Dave kelly. In regage dave kelly is the equivalent of timbaland in hip-hop so she couldn't get any better with him. The songs I like the most are: Oh Yeah, Bk Anthem, The letter, 730, tables will turn, hood scriptures, run dem, na na be like, so hot, and teh saddest day. Overall I think foxy came strong for her third time around. I like this one better than chyna doll overall as a album. There is a lot of singles I can see droping from this.
Dont sleep on this..get it!"
A1TC5EBGPW13UJ,B000W0TIRE,1,1,5.0,"This is a hot cd from start to the end. Foxy has come with the rawness. This is a breath of fresh air to rap especially with weak female albums; Lil KIm's ""Notorius Kim"", Da Brat's ""Unrestricted"", Trina's ""The Baddest"", Angie Martinez's album and especially Amil's and Queen Pen's garbage albums.  This album establishes the fact that the more a REAL MCee raps, the better the lyric becomes and when you add emotion and confidence you will become unstoppable. This is the best Cd that has ever come from her. The first single ""Bk Anthem"" jumped it off but in actuality it jumped off with that ""Bang, Bang"" flow. In which Lil kim was put in her place. Then she drops ""Oh Yeah"" with Spragga Benz which is a hype track. It just keeps flowing on and on with this album from ""730"" to ""Hood Scriptures"" (which has the most creative sound I have heard in a while) to Table will turn and so on. So all you [...] Lil kim fans you heard the answers to kim's weak flow on  notorious kim. Now realize this cd is so close to a classic that it is sick. This is one of the best of the year so far. Much success to Foxy and def Jam. She joins the list with Remi,Rah and Eve as being the best female Mcees out now, with much respect to Jean Grey and Apani B. This Cd is tight. One."
AA3EEURDFTWZD,B000W0VJ8U,1,1,5.0,"there is something about this song that puts it at the top of my list!  It's sounds so ""real"" and ""honest""...not sure if that makes sense. There is just a lot of emotion behind this song that I love"
A1O1D3OU5BP96X,B000W0VJ8U,1,1,5.0,"I love the lyrics and music of the Counting Crows' song A Long December, as well as the voice of Adam Duritz.  It sounds sweet and melancholy, perfect for the holidays."
AVP1NL6GYMVR,B000W0VONA,-1,-1,3.0,"This song is okay... but, it does get old with time.  If a person just wants to hear something ""different"" now and then... Blue can offer that fix.  For it's time, it was super fresh and original because of the artist's use of electronics.  Today's artists have raised the bar though and so Eiffel 65's originality has been a little bit lost in the crowd."

The tempo was perfect for my pace. I even had it repeat twice because I felt an extra bounce in my step when this song came on. I've always thoughts this song was fun, I'm glad I found and added it to my collection."
AAC67P4KTM968,B000W0VONA,1,1,5.0,"I always liked this song, but never knew the song.  I was searching for another song when I came across this one.  I had finally found it, and am glad to have found it.  Despite being ""blue"", this song always makes me feel happy."

A1UMMVIAC891PQ,B000W0B5DY,1,1,5.0,"This is an excellent must have song for any dance music dj who likes to incorporate a little R&B influence into their dance music.  It has kind of a house-vibe to it.  It always gets people on the floor to ""burn some chankla""."
A3J84HFTKHHJYT,B000W0B5DY,1,1,5.0,"I had forgotten this song until I rewatched ""Prisilla (?) Queen of the Desert""  so very glad I was able to find it"
A1CHLJQMZN8LHG,B000W0B5DY,1,-1,3.0,"I really loved this song when it first debuted, hearing it on the radio, it must be on the same album as ""keep on walking.""  People probably love ""keep on walking"" as much as ""Finally.""  ""Finally"" is trademarked by those mumblings, ""dun dun yee ya ya ee o[...]""  It sounds like trance at the beginning, the beat, this song.  That's when other trance or electronica like ""Rhthym is a dancer"" and ""This is the rhythm of the night""  and way later the group The Real McCoy with ""Runaway.""  I guess trance really started hitting the radio in the late 90's with songs like ""As the Rush comes,"" ""Will I"" and way later 4 Strings ""Turn it around."""

A39BQSR4JK3HPG,B000W0YVX0,1,1,5.0,"I admit when Amazon sent me the e-mail saying that I can get this for free, I was worried, because usually anything 'free' usually isn't that good.  However, I was surprised at how good Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings are.  She, being the lead singer, has a pleasant voice, very melodic with an bit of poetic spin in it.  The song to me was sort of something between jazz and R&B, but resulting in the best of both worlds, since R&B originated from jazz in the first place.

After this song, I'm going to try out the other songs on the Album (after I take care of my holiday shopping), and if I like them, I'll try out anything else Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings has done since they were formed."
A2ULPKC236IC0I,B000W0YVX0,1,1,4.0,This is a very good song that I really enjoy to listen to occasionally. It was totally worth the download.
A3PI6O5RQF35OA,B000W0YVX0,1,1,4.0,"I can't believe this song was available for free, because it's so good! When I first heard it, I thought that Sharon had to be a rediscovered band from the 60's whose tracks had been re-released. She has a powerful voice that demands your attention. She is here to prove that, yes, Virginia, there is a life after 50, and it can be a groovin' one if you want it to be. I think I might buy the whole album. My only complaint about this song is that I don't like the way it slows down at the end, but the musical technique fits the lyrics, so I can't complain too much."
AJ4N1F0LLV4F3,B000W0YVX0,1,1,4.0,"Enjoyable, soulful, R&B band reminiscent of the 60's.
Thank you Amazon for this free song."
A2NX6MFZP8TM6S,B000W0YVX0,1,-1,3.0,"Not a bad song. But the only reason I ""bought"" it was because it was free. At this point, I don't think it'll inspire me to purchase the rest of the album. But I do like this song. Nice retro sound."

Will get the rest later.  Don't just like whole albums of any singer, I like certain singles that I like to listen to.  I don't like to listen to all songs of a group, only my favorites.

Would recommend these songs thru Amazon, as you can purchase a whole album or a single.  Love this!"

A2ATZD6LMZZV92,B000W0YZ9U,1,1,4.0,"Anyone who has any interest in music from this great era (doo-wop), would be seriously missing-out without this excellent ""Platters"" track."
A1QIGFZMTDF1XW,B000W0YPL8,1,1,5.0,"This is a wonderful song that has is special to me because it's so dang human and truthful and real. If you don't know the song, please give it a listen."
AJWUB8DIEM22G,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,i love the song.  i would recommend it to my friends and family.  i listen to this song all the time.
A1JBOYG4CHS8B0,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,I love music so much. I really like this song.  I am glad that it is so easy to buy and download the music.
A1QIGFZMTDF1XW,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,The Counting Crows do a great job with this song. I recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of music. (Or maybe you should just shake up your boundaries and spend 99 cents to see if you like this sound.)  :)
A203ECX3R69YU2,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,"""Mr. Jones by The Counting Crows rocks.  Love the lyrics and actually heard the artists explanation of them.  Don't look for hidden meanings.  They are not there.
Love it."
A3KUC5K5VSJNU9,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,"A classic rock ballad song with a great story that ponders the statement from young men who want to be famous, ""When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely""."
A3UVYL7NZHDVMF,B000W0YPMW,1,1,4.0,Used to listen to this song in night clubs. Always like it a lot. Fantastic Music from Counting Crows.
A2BOB5PWSGP775,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,great song.
A3BIV1X1K9R796,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,"Odd song, but a great beat - a real toe-tapper! First song I've heard from these guys. Amazingly enough, the lead singer's voice is extremely reminiscent of old-time rocker Van Morrison (""Brown-Eyed Girl""). When I first heard this song on the radio on the way to work one day, I thought ""Wow, a new Van Morrison song - sounds great!"" - not knowing anything about ""Counting Crows"". Great tune & great beat!"
A1INGJ6OX6TMT9,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,High quality version of a great song! You can hear all the notes and different instruments. Really a pleasure to listen to!
A3H2QEDKUC6WHS,B000W0YPMW,1,1,5.0,"Amazon's MP3's are stellar in quality. If you are looking for one song from an ""album"" or the entire catalog this is the way to go. Love this song!"
A3JRW716H3AX14,B000W0YOUA,1,1,5.0,"This song starts with some very melancholy piano soon joined by a plaintive, but completely complimentary vocal. The lyrics are mysterious but appropriate for the mood of the piece. It is a very minimal tune with some flute and strings joining in at around 2 minutes. Very non-intrusive bells join in at 2 minutes 15 seconds. This is a simple but powerfully moody and evocative song that I loved the first time I heard it."
A3R8X6V63TRK54,B000W0YOUA,1,1,4.0,This song is one of the better ones from Counting Crows in my opinion.  The music is relaxing and has a beautiful tone to it.
ARYKNMYUIQ7H2,B000W10GXI,1,1,4.0,"I first heard this song on the movie ""Big Fat Liar"". While I don't fully understand the premise of the song, I like it because it is catchy and funny, in relation to the movie."
AVP1NL6GYMVR,B000W10GXI,-1,-1,3.0,"This song is okay... but, it does get old with time. If a person just wants to hear something ""different"" now and then... Blue can offer that fix. For it's time, it was super fresh and original because of the artist's use of electronics. Today's artists have raised the bar though and so Eiffel 65's originality has been a little bit lost in the crowd."
A3HZEP21BZWFA1,B000W10GXI,-1,-1,1.0,It is a really anointing repetitive song that says the same thing over and over again  the beat is terrible

A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000W11J20,1,1,5.0,"I have listened to the two versions of this same sone Steppin' Out by Joe Jackson and this is the better quality version.  In this version it is louder but also the words are more clear.  The sound is not so muddy as is the case with the first version on offer.  The other version is passable in quality but this version is much superior in overall quality.  I really enjoy ""Steppin' Out"" as a favorite song so I listen intently as it plays and this is just the better sounding version even if the other version has all the reviews."

A1LYM4PTMWA2KP,B000W11J20,1,1,4.0,It's Joe Jackson! I lost most of my music collection so I went looking to replace my favorite genres and artists first. This song...high on the very long and expansive list!

AZERS3MWNPUV0,B000W11J20,1,1,5.0,I loved this song growing up in the 80s.  Still love it just as much today.  What can I say?
A5S9BIBJTBFUB,B000W11J20,1,1,5.0,"I found a live version of this song on Joe's tour album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joe-Jackson-Live-1980-1986/dp/B000WT88SK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joe Jackson Live 1980 - 1986</a>&nbsp;and it was decidedly unique. That version is also worth a listen, if not an addition to your infinite play list. After finding it, I started hearing the radio version of this song and bought the MP3 through Amazon. Compare the two versions and you will get to see the brilliance of this artist's work."

A1OHEAMWM8PKAE,B000W1039K,1,1,5.0,"I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.
See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you paid the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you paid for it, its all legal , and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D
In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:"

Which absolutely works for me! I'm always looking for better prices and deals. Amazon provides this.

The download is clear, and has a good volume. Unlike some other downloads that sound really muffled this doesn't have that problem.

Over all I'm very happy with this purchase."

ACSM2P5VE6KD7,B000W11KD8,1,1,5.0,This was the best and still is in the 90's Heavy was great and the boys sad that he is gone now but will always be missed.
A2J7YDXQ6B1SMO,B000W11KD8,1,1,4.0,Whats' not to like about Heavy D.  He is charismatic and a male with a story to tell.  I love this song when it first cam out and I still love it today
A2U5AO02NUNRJQ,B000W11KD8,1,1,5.0,"I have loved this song since it first came out.  The great beat, his rap, the lyrics, a bit whimsical, but they work for me.  This song is my favorite ""rap"" song of all time.  It is reminiscent of the Run DMC and Fat Boys songs of the 80s, but even better in some ways.  Heavy D also did the theme song for ""In Living Color"" and that is a good song too.  THe world definitely lost a talent when he passed on.

Anyway, if you want a song to lighten your heart and get your feet tapping, this is the song."
A2YGBVYHILOREF,B000W11KD8,1,1,5.0,"that Heavy is gone but I'm glad we have his music to remember him. I grew up during the time he came out and often felt that we both were looking for the same thing. Little did I know, at the time of his passing, that he found his. I just quit looking... Rest in Peace Heavy...... a diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly D!"

A1O16J4RN90W3H,B000W11NDU,1,1,5.0,"Some terrific, older music by Johnny Gill. It is a gem and I highly recommend it!"
A246D56KFO5CG,B000W11NDU,1,1,5.0,Love them all keep them all coming a have a happy and wonderful but safe new year.
AOACE7JUG7JB0,B000W11NDU,1,-1,3.0,Good album from Johnny. Once again he brings it as only he can. With soulful ballads and funky tracks. This album is one of my favs from him.
A39MYWEXQ4ZRAA,B000W11NDU,1,1,5.0,The best CD he ever put out. Johhny Gill pours his heart and soul into this beautiful cd.
A28FNKCGFS03VL,B000W11NDU,1,1,5.0,"By far the most vocally gifted (if, unfortunately, not most successful) member of New Edition, Johnny Gill, whose voice can either be buttery smooth or deep and growly, keeps his new jack swing to a minimum here and opts for more of a red-hot loverman persona, and it really gives him the best chance he's ever had to make the most of his voice. He really gets sensual here with the beautiful ballads ""Maybe,"" ""Take Me (I'm Yours),"" and ""4 U Alone,"" though every song is a high quality, well-written and produced piece of work."
A1JXEJFPV9EUVS,B000W11NDU,1,1,5.0,"I picked this cd up back in like 1996 and it still receives play in my cd changer. This cd is, in my opinion, the best of Johnny's work. All the songs are smooth and in his words, ""[makes] the mood right!"" This is a must for your slow jam collection. NEOSOUL06"
A2RXC61UJQQSWZ,B000W11NDU,1,-1,3.0,"As the title for this 1996 CD suggests, the more mid-tempo/ballad side of Mr. Gill are given more prominent on this release. Now this wouldn't be a problem if these songs were of the quality that we are used to on afore mentioned CDs by Johnny. What we have here are some half decent songs, that whilst not awful, are a par down on what we are used to from this artist. On to many of these songs, they all merge into each other. Only a hardcore fan/lover of quiet storm moment would fine anything of any value here. I never had my copy for long, giving it to my big Sister, who loved all things Johnny back then.
As for the more the more up-tempo songs, 'I know you Want me is OK' as is 'So gentle'.
This was the last Johnny Gill Cd I purchased( and I think that this was his last major solo CD release) With a voice like Mr. Gill has, this is a crying shame!"
A2LNEZD3YBO12O,B000W11NDU,1,1,4.0,"This is such a wonderful effort. It consists of mostly ballads, but Johnny Gill pulls it off on all the songs.  Sometimes, Johnny gets a little mellow on some cuts given the maturity and adult romantic feel of the songs. I still love the gorgeous Let's Get the Mood Right. It makes for good music to hear in the bedroom late at night.  Other favorites are Touch, Maybe and Having Illusions. I love the sexy It's Your Body and the late Roger Troutman of Zapp being on it. One of Roger's best of his final performances when he was alive. It still surprises me that he would follow the somewhat uneven Provocative with this well sung, well performed effort.  Staying True to himself and his vocal style is what makes his third Motown album my second favorite album by him."
A1JRHL29A1ABOT,B000W11NDU,1,1,5.0,"I remember this album when I was in the 4th grade. This album is a keeper. Both urgent and patient, sensitive and sultry, he raised romance to new heights. This album is filled with sensuous expressions of his intimate approach to love. He kept returning to a single theme that seems to unit his artistry intimacy. This album has been certified Gold, Remember, this was 1996."
A3PCTD8QM1BIXI,B000W11NDU,1,1,5.0,"Johnny Gill is once again in top form on his fifth solo CD, a feat which many artists only wish that they could achieve. For this CD,Mr. Gill enlisted producers such as Babyface, R.Kelly, Tony Rich,Jam & Lewis and Mr. Gill even does some production and writing himself. Stand out tracks include Let's Get The Mood Right, Maybe, It's Your Body, Someone To Love and Love In A Elevator."
A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF,B000W11NDU,1,1,5.0,This is a masterpiece this is a great cd from start to finish Johnny delivers on every song on this cd and I really do enjoy this is a nice cd to listen to when you are making love to your man or either taking a nice bubble bath I really do like and enjoy this cd so therefore I would recommend anyone who likes Johnny Gill to purchase this cd it really sets the mood right this is a very overlooked underrated cd so therefore do yourself a favor and purchase this cd !!!
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B000W11NDU,-1,-1,2.0,"Johnny Gill is One of the Best Vocalists I've heard over the past 20 plus Years but alot of the time the Words&Music don't match His overall presentation. I dig the cut with Him&Roger Troutman&also R.Kelly's ""Someone to Love"".but the up-tempo cuts don't move me at all.this Album though isn't balanced out with much else that matches some of the better material&this set suffers from that.but if Johnny Gill ever got the right Stuff to work with He would Be scary."
A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W11NDU,-1,-1,3.0,"Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album? Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself, and everyone said he was coming off too cocky. Well, Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition's Home Again came out, so wasn't he being a little cocky himself? Yeah, everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo, but to be honest, this wasn't his best album.
Take the Babyface-penned title track, for example. The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus: ""Let's get the mood right/Turn on your heart light."" Turn on your heart light? That's too cheesy, even for Babyface. And ""Love In An Elevator"" is full of corny lyrics like ""They say there's no luck on the thirteenth floor/But I found love and so much more"" and ""Like The Staples, I wanna take you there."" ""Simply Say I Love You"" is okay, but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember hearing Stevie in that song.
The only songs that really stand out are ""Maybe"" and ""It's Your Body"". The latter features Roger Troutman, and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible. The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing: sex, sex, and more sex. The sleepy production doesn't make things better, either.
Another problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs, especially the very last track, ""So Gentle"". It features a rap from Ron DeVoe, so you know what the main problem is. But the thing is that the preceding song ""I Know You Want Me"" features uninspired rapping from some other guy, and his rapping is actually worse than Ron's.
I still like Johnny Gill, but this album seems like it was rushed. And the strong adlibs he's known for usually adds feeling to the songs, but here it seems like they're trying to hide the questionable material. You're better off getting the solo albums he made before this."

Wheras the sound of the debut generally emphasized the artists ""naturalness"" this blends India's ""acoustic soul"" sound with a array of soundscapes,many of which are as equally funky and soulful.""Little Things"" is an excellent example. It's groove,the heavy-on-easy style and unique chord changes could only come from the guy who produced her debut:Stevie Wonder. Just about all of the music here maintains his signiture writing style as well,even though India is more fully in charge of the production here. The lyrics are typically ""power of positive thinking"" but the wonderful thing about them is that India's great attitude and the sincerity and brilliance of her poetry really forgive any possibility for a clishe. Needless the say the moments when this album really catches fire are when the tempo goes up a little such as on the excellent ""Slow Down"",""Can I Walk With You"" and the bonus cut ""Interested""-all rollicking soul tunes then endow her formula with a lot of rhythmic strengh. Of course that doesn't dismiss the respectful tone of ""Talk To You"",""Complicated Melody"" and ""Headed In The Right Direction"". The only song that confuses me a little here,where I love the lush music is ""God Is Real"". I realize the connection in the black community to Christianity runs deep and is significant but for the life of me I cannot tell if this song is advertising India's obvious Christian faith or if her intention is to point out that nature in itself is godly. Not being religious myself these kinds of ambiguous lyrics are always mildly curious to me. So while this album really serves mostly to establish that her huge success with the debut wasn't some kind of post millenium fluke this was really the last time,musically anyway India. Arie would have anything to prove."

A2WRWK0ARXOFSZ,B000W11N6W,1,1,5.0,"This a great release. The music is really relaxing and puts the mind at ease. Great music, meaningful songs, and outstanding vocals by india. In my opinion this release is better than the first realease which is also a great album."
AJK5WHV1GW941,B000W11N6W,1,1,5.0,"It isn't hard to say that this is a good album, it fact, it is not hard to say this album is nothing short of a masterpiece.  India. Arie delivers a brilliant sophomore album entitled, ""Voyage to India"".  In fact, if this album was really a ""voyage"" to somewhere, many would probably pay top dollar to be there!

 This is such a positive album.  The lyrics just make any listener smile.  Anyone who knows anything about India knows she loves to play the guitar, and it is evident that she loves the guitar when listening to her album.  There is a guitar in every song on the album.  Although I think she's a bit indulgent with the guitar, she doesn't bore the listener with it.  It actually sounds right nice and adds something distinctive to her album.

 ""Good Man"" is definitely an album highlight.  The lyrics are meaningful and real.  The song is about a man who has children and if anything ever happens to him, he wants his children to know he loved them and that he was a good man.  Many parents can relate to this song because it's the same way they feel about their children.  ""Talk to Her"" has one of those beats you can snap your fingers and bob your head to.  Aside from the laid back beat, the song offers a very relevant message in today's world; talk to women with respect (men).  This song has simple lyrics, but they say so much.  I love it!  ""God is Real"" is another one of the many beautiful songs on ""Voyage to India"".  This song has a very noticeable guitar in the background.  India's vocals are really good on this track, they help the song to be more believable.  The song is about questioning the existence of God.  India does an excellent job of stating her claim of why she thinks or as she says ""knows"" that God is real.  ""Can I Walk With You"" and ""The One"" are just nice love songs.  India's vocals are, again, on point for these tracks.  If anyone were to ask me to pick to tracks to listen to on this album, I'd go with these.  The album contains no fillers, just brilliant work by a great artist of today.  If debating on whether or not to cop this one, GET IT NOW!  India will take you by surprise, like she did men.  I am very impressed with the talent of this woman.  She's a shining star! 5 star album!

A24P8BEJ26FU01,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3.0,"RnB/Soul singer, India Arie Simpson released her sophomore album in September 2002. Most sophomore albums by other neo-soul artists, such as D'Angelo and Macy Gray (note that I haven't heard either of these albums) were deemed by fans to have fallen to the dreaded sophomore slump so India Arie had a lot to prove. India Arie proved she had undeniable talent with her debut album, both lyrically and vocally and most fans tend to compare the two albums. On both, India Arie wrote or co-wrote all the songs and she writes about meaningful topics such as self-respect and communication in relationships. On her sophomore album, ""Voyage To India"", India Arie provides her wonderful lyrics and vocals in songs that seem to tell what many women are thinking of, rather than being self-reflective as she was on her debut.
India Arie starts her sophomore album off with a short intro, just over a minute in length, called ""Growth"" which states that the only thing that is constant in the world is change. It's a somewhat pointless intro, but the statement she makes is definitely True. The second track is an mid-tempo song called ""Little Things"". As expected by the title, this song talks about appreciating the little things in life such as a ""call in the morning from my little sister singing me happy birthday"". As with most of India Arie's songs, the lyrics are not complex but are beautiful in their simplicity. Next comes ""Talk To Her"", a somewhat preachy song about how to talk to a woman. India Arie instructs the listener to treat the woman with respect and ""talk to her the way you want someone to talk to your mama"". In other words, talk to her respectfully no matter what she's wearing (""It doesn't matter if she's wearing a miniskirt or a business suit""), a message that desperately needs to be heard in today's society. The song also talks about the importance of respect and communication in relationships.
Afterwards comes the mid-tempo ""Slow Down"", a debatable album highlight. The song speaks about taking life day by day and not rushing through everything. The lyrics are once again simple yet beautiful. It's about remembering that speed isn't always the best way to achieve your goals. Next comes the romantic ""The Truth"", with its lyrics seemingly half-spoken, half-sung (more like spoken to a tune). Nonetheless, a sweet, romantic song about what India Arie loves about her man. The next song, ""Beautiful Surprise"", has a similar theme about finding love when you least expect it. It was written by India Arie alone and really shows off her talent for songwriting. After comes a short interlude, ""Healing"" which talks briefly about releasing all sadness from you. Like most interludes however, it is not too memorable.
Subsequently come two songs about moving away from the pains of the past, ""Get It Together"" and ""Headed in The Right Direction"". ""Get It Together"" is another somewhat preachy song that talks about having to get it together to heal your body and heart. It is a beautiful song when you listen to it but in the grand scheme of things, it does not stand out. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" fares much better, probably because it is more upbeat however it is fairly short compared to the other songs on the album. After that comes ""Can I Walk With You"" is an album highlight that seems to talk about taking friendship to another level and it is probably my favourite song on the album. Then comes ""The One"", a very overused song title but this is probably one of the better songs of that title. Lyrically and vocally it is a unique (in a good way) song but it is also quite short.
Next comes ""Complicated Melody"" another romantic, metaphoric song that compares India's man to colours, numbers and songs. It sounds somewhat odd when you read the lyrics but India pulls it off well enough that it sounds nice. Otherwise, it adds little to the quality of the album. The song, while it sounds nice, is a little too full of metaphors and comparisons. Following this comes another interlude, ""Gratitude"" which is not much different from the other two. Then comes another highlight, ""Good Man"", another romantic kind of song but better then some of the others on the album. India's lyrics and vocals work so well together and with the beat as well. The second last track, ""God Is Real"" has beautiful lyrics but the beat and vocals sound too similar to other material on the album. Finally, there is the bonus track ""Interested"" which doesn't stand out at all compared to the other tracks. The verses are not very interesting and only the chorus really sounds great.
Overall Mark: 3/5
Although this is still a great album, ""Voyage To India"" does not have the same amount of truly memorable material that made India Arie's debut so good. The songs provide great messages but many of them sound too similar and lack anything to really distinguish one from the other. As a whole the album sounds great, but when you break it down, many of the songs sound like one long song with only slight changes to the beat and, of course, different lyrics. India Arie has undeniable talent but her album lacks the catchy tunes that made similar artists, like Jewel (similar in the fact that she writes meaningful lyrics rather then Britney Spears style pop), so memorable. The album definitely has some highlights but it mostly seems too similar to be memorable."
A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF,B000W11N6W,1,1,5.0,"This is a fantastic album she has done it again. India has shown us just how talented she really is. Thanks, India for representing.  She does a good job I really enjoy this album. India really delivers and she sings some very nice songs. India writes most of her own songs she is very talented and I really enjoy her albums she is very good and I really enjoy her music. She sings very well and does a great job. I would recommend anyone who likes neo-soul to buy this album."
A1IV4XBV2XEQPQ,B000W11N6W,1,1,4.0,"Sometimes simplicity can go a long way. That is why artists like India. Arie manage to survive and succeed in an industry of overproduction and glitz. Arie returns after bearing her ""Acoustic Soul"" to the world. She is now ready to take us on a ""Voyage To India"" and it's worth taking.
Although the first track'""Growth,"" is an interlude opening up the second chapter in Arie's anthology, this record, in many senses, is more of a continuation of the previous rather than an evolution of the artist.
The only difference is the first single ""Little Things"" which is a track that, surprisingly, does not have any guitars on it, but its lyrics capture the same granola down-to-earth essence as her debut single ""Video.""
""Talk to Her"" is a run-on song. But Arie's way with melodies is best depicted by the mood jam ""Slow Down"" and the uplifting folk ditty ""Beautiful Surprise.""
Considering all aspects Arie brings into her craft, one could say that Arie's sound is a cross between Erykah Badu and Tracy Chapman.
Arie's diverse influences play a role in her distinct sound. As she has stated in her previous album, her influences range from Stevie Wonder to Karen Carpenter.
""Get It Together"", a song about maintaining strength when times are rough, captures that with her warm vocals and guitar-lead melody. Then, ""Headed In The Right Direction"" starts out like an '80's Luther Vandross anthem and then wanes towards the end.
All songs aside, Arie shines most on ""Can I Walk With You"" - a song about the need to belong. Arie's vocals on this song depict a yearning like no other. This is definitely a gem, if Motown Records had any sense this would be the next single.
""Voyage To India"" then meanders into sharp beats on ""The One"" and ""Complicated Melody,"" which is exactly what it says - it doesn't go anywhere. But the fall is cushioned by ""Good Man"" and the bonus track ""Interested,"" which keeps Arie's soulful tradition alive.
This album is bound to be a coffee shop favorite.
It contains slow jams, simple, yet deep folk numbers and sultry vocals. Although it is a well-rounded album, it sounds more like ""Acoustic Soul 2"" rather than a record with its own unique taste."
A153RFYGNYJP0T,B000W11N6W,-1,-1,3.0,"i love india.arie and respect her work, but this album isn't touching me the way her first one did. this album is filled with a bit much of the 'ya feeling' me aspect. the production i think could have been a bit better and as far as india really bringing it to us, i'm not sure thats what the case it. i think this album was rushed. but all in all you got your grammy's right. still much love for you india."
AFPQVUEI3D46K,B000W11N6W,1,1,4.0,"A very surprising sophomore release from India. Arie.  Surprising as it is better than her debut album.  The material is much stronger, lyrics much better and vocals about the same.  I'd really like to see her do some full-vocal songs.  She has the talent to do it.  The album is drenched in jazzy, soulful overtones.  A pleasure to the ears.
This album has great replayability, especially in room full of burning candles...you can't go wrong!"
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B000W11N6W,1,1,4.0,"I read some of the negative reviews of India. Arie's Voyage to India album and I wonder if those reviewers listened to the whole album. Sure, she gets preachy at times on here, but that's only on two or three songs, and even those are good. And every time I listen to this album, I love it even more.
""Little Things"" is an okay song for a first single, but there are better songs than that on here. Check out the two highlights, ""Good Man"", where India tells a story about a man who tells his wife to remember him if he dies someday, and ""Talk to Her"" (which is still very preachy), where India tells men to respect their women. The latter, as well as a few other songs, features Laurnea, who's been M.I.A. from the industry for a while. Where did India find her??? Even as a backup singer, she shines like she always did.
""Can I Walk With You"" has that ready-for-VH1 feel to it, as does ""Interested"", but that doesn't make these songs any less engaging. Also, I noticed that ""Slow Down"" has the same melody as last year's ""Back to the Middle"". But this album is still solid. Don't buy it expecting some kind of growth in songwriting or spiritual evolution (it's only been a year since her Acoustic Soul album). Because while there are no recognizable standout singles by the likes of, say, ""Brown Skin"", you'll be missing out if you don't take this voyage to India."
A2ZTFPWOPNNHTW,B000W11N6W,1,1,5.0,"My Voyage To India was a delightful excursion. I'm grateful that all I have to do is play the cd to take the trip. I've Voyaged To India numerous times since I've acquired this cd and just can not get enough of this mind, body, and soul candy.
The songs on this cd are beautifully arranged and performed flawlessly. Alot of the lyrics are pure poetry; expressing love, exhortation, positivity, and all the things that would make us better people to humanity, ourselves, and loved ones.
The vocals and music showcased on this stellar project are warm and enchanting. ""The Truth"" is my absoulte favorite track with its haunting background vocals and its acoustic spanish motiff. ""Little Things"" is tight and has that ""All That I Can Say"" by Mary J. music flavor. ""The One"" is a catchy tune that will have you singin' ""Laa Laa Laa Lalalala"". ""Interested"" has a nice groove that gets the neck to moving and foot stomping. I could review every song on here, but that would take too long so do yourself a favor and comp this JEWEL. Good music like this is hard to come by and the voyage is worth it."
A2GIB7FPB00V2,B000W11N6W,1,1,4.0,"I like this album, though not as much as acoustic soul. I agree with other reviewers that the lyrical content of the cd is not as creative or profound as her first effort.  I was hoping for more inspirational lyrics. this time around, it seems that India has fallen in love and has to tell the world about it. There is nothing wrong with love songs but i expected more than that from her. Her praises for a man gets a little tired. Overall, this is a pleasant CD to listen to. My favarite song is ""Talk to her"". Anyone who enjoyed her first Cd will enjoy this one. Just don't  look for profound musings and lyrics on Voyage to India."
APZSWNPMVSZ84,B000W11N6W,1,1,4.0,"let me say this right off the bat:
she got four stars from me strictly because she gives me somethin new to lissen to! (and that is no longer even True because i gave this cd to a friend of mine as a house warming present!)
but i'm ""ranting""... not ""hating""...
this disc isn't bad... it starts off slow with the first song but picks up rather nicely. i was actually quite happy with the music... toe-tappin & finga snappin ensued...
but sista india does do that ""lauryn hill thing"" and get a bit gratuitous with her righteousness... BUT THAT'S HER THANG YALL so don't ack like you didn't know...
some of the lyrics i actually like better than her first album, it's just after awhile it's all the same message - not that the message is a bad one/it just sounds like this shoulda been made by an 'arie-wannabe' and not by the up-and-coming queen herself...
as a fan, i just hafta hold out until she finds her voice in variety while still maintaining the vision she has for herself...
four stars is generous, but still this effort is stronger than three..."
A3OLZXHFGUAMWW,B000W11N6W,1,1,5.0,if you're tired of the same old r&b [stuff] on the radio this is for you india's on another level thank you stevie wonder for bringing us this talented sister shine on.
ABE14SVILZLNY,B000W11N6W,-1,1,5.0,"With the surprise double-platinum success of 2001's Acoustic Soul, India. Arie became that rare bird -- particularly in contemporary R&B -- who straddles the line between artistic innovation and schmaltz. Certainly a talented guitar-playing songstress, she also takes her lyrical cues from Hallmark cards, a mix at once comfortable and off-putting -- and difficult to put one's finger on.
This follow-up, seemingly rushed into stores, doesn't clear up the confusion; as with Alicia Keys, it's almost impossible to criticize a contemporary urban artist who writes life-affirming, organic songs, yet this journey ends as unconvincingly as Soul or Songs in A Minor. What's more, it lacks any sort of knockout number -- Soul had two, ""Video"" and ""Brown Skin"" -- leaving us to wonder just where Arie intended on taking us.
Which is not to say that the potential isn't there, only that balance is not. Is she the younger visage of Tracy Chapman (""The One,"" ""Power of Words"")? Channeling Chaka Khan on two gleefully old school steppin' tracks, ""Interested"" and ""Slow Down""? When she takes her own advice to ""live for the moment,"" she gets better results: ""Get it Together"" is a swirling slam-dunk of a love song, and ""Good Man,"" an overlooked track off the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, makes a nice fit here. When she comes off preachy, it's with treacly results: ""God is Real"" and ""Little Things"" are cloying bits of armchair philosophy.
Voyage is at its most interesting, and often its best, when Arie tries to come from out of the shadows of her influences and chart her own path. Though she stumbles on ""The Truth"" trying to incorporate slicker R&B-style beats into the mix, the titular Spanish folk tinges of ""Headed in the Right Direction"" says it all, as does ""India's Song,"" which could have been the album's most overwrought track but instead perfectly mixes Chapman's subdued introspection with Woody Guthrie's wide-eyed folk. These are the tracks suggest the voyage isn't over; it may have only just begun."
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3.0,"It's amazing what a few Grammy nominations can do.  India. Arie's debut album of folk-laced soul didn't break any new ground, but it was an overall appealing mix of catchy tunes and positive messages that were a welcome alternative to the talk-show/men-bashing lyrics of her ghettoized peers.  And even though she walked home empty-handed on Grammy night, her debut album, ""Acoustic Soul,"" enjoyed robust multiplatinum sales.  Expectations are naturally high, and I hoped that her followup ""Voyage to India,"" would be a musical and lyrical step forward from her debut.  While the album is thoroughly listenable from start to finish, ""Voyage to India"" just doesn't serve a platter filling enough to stick to your ribs.  Arie has her heart in the right place, and her intentions are noble, but the truth remains that she's a passable lyricist, often resorting to ""love yourself"" cliches that become one-dimensional.  And while the music is pleasing, the folkish, acoustic-based melodies and choruses seem a bit predictable.  However, I really dug ""Little Things,"" the sincerity of the love song ""Beautiful Surprise,"" and ""Get it Together.""  While ""Voyage to India"" is an okay album, it pales in comparison to better, superior albums we've heard in the last year from ""Cookie"" by MeShell Ndegeocello, the flawed yet fascinating ""Unplugged"" set from Lauryn Hill, and ""How Do I"" from Res.  Ultimately, it's a ""Voyage"" that takes off promisingly without ever reaching its final destination."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B000W11N6W,1,-1,3.0,"hearing this Album right after Hearing Beck's&I think they should tour together.on a Mellow Tour ASAP.""little things"" whihc takes it's Groove from Rufus&Chaka Khan's ""Holywood"" with a Stevie Wonder vibe from Her Vocal Presentation works.strange as it might sound I hear a Whitney Houston Voice within Her wanting to come out but it doesn't quite get there.basically I enjoy the Content at what She was saying but overall just like Her first Album I just don't feel the full Power of Soul.something with Her Material is missing for me. She has Talent but there is something that isn't there quite yet.but you never know with another Album or three down the line She might get it all.time will tell.but I do applaud Her vibe."
A23KAWGZ4RE1RI,B000W11N6W,-1,-1,2.0,"After the multiplatinum success of ""Acoustic Soul"", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup ""Voyage To India"". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on ""Voyage"" as this album is severely so-so.
First off the production is weaker than on ""Acoustic"" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either.
Tired duds like ""Little Things"" and the predictably titled ""God Is Love"" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for ""deep"" when they come off like Hallmark card messages.
Bland ""folk""-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead ""Voyage"" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. ""Good Man"" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record.
Fortunately, ""Voyage"" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. ""The Truth"" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired ""love yourself"" retreads.

Look, ""Voyage To India"" makes India to be more of a ""Black-girl"" version of bland, ""folk"" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being ""bootylicious"" or partying or ""her man"" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on ""Voyage"" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not ""deep"".
India. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'. She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the  bland R&B that dominates this album doesn't do much for both the listener or her."
A3FWHXSZSTKFIU,B000W11N6W,-1,-1,3.0,"Coming off of a classic first album, we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician/singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts.  The grooves swing, the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great. The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record.
But you know how an artist's intentions can be TOO clear?  The messages too in-your-face?  How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away?  That's what's wrong here.
The problem I have is with the lyrics: they're WAY too preachy.
I thought that the music was so well-done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio, but that's turned out to not be the case.  A song will come in with a great beat, great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you're inundated with Sunday School-level lessons for three minutes.  Where's the risk-taking of ""Brown Skin"" or the gutsy self-confidence of ""Video""?  Where's the humanity of ""Ready for Love"" or the philisophical punch of ""I See God In You""?  It's just not there this time around.  It's almost as if she's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages.  This album is cursed with the kind of ""We Are the World"" heavy-handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year.
Great playing mired in WAY heavy-handed and too-simple lyrics.  The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar, which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much-needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity.  This, however, is too far at the other end of the love/hate spectrum.  If I wanted a gospel album, I'd have bought a gospel album.  She's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well, which is fine, but because of that there's a lot of not-great sap here too.  Not even racy, midnight-mood, slow-jammy sap...it's just simplistic I'm-in-love type stuff that, lyrically, you could get anywhere.
The shining track here is ""The One"" but it's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record.  This is all a terrible shame; I wanted to like this one, especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of (groan) Alicia Keyes, but this record falls short in the most important department: the message."
A4622J2IA15MN,B000W11N6W,1,1,5.0,this is a great album...that song good man is right up there w/ angie stone's brotha for giving brothers their props.  you won't be disappointed with this.
A9NU8CFNVEJCM,B000W1544O,1,1,5.0,The lyrics to this song is very romantic and you will become one with your mate as you let the lyrics and music saturate your being and just let your love mood flow with the music...It all begins with a CHOICE so I simply say choose wisely and just let Love take place within yourself.
A2CA8W5VZSPYY2,B000W1544O,1,1,5.0,its a nice recording and I myself don't have anything bad to say about it... I myself like good music. thank you very much.

A23A25I667ZYN,B000W15BBK,1,1,5.0,You really can't go wrong with Johnny Cash! The sound and quality of this download are both good! Great song.
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B000W15BBK,1,1,5.0,"Maybe you heard the Adam Lambert or Alan Jackson version, but the Man in Black is who made it an international hit in 1963.

Johnny co-wrote it with his soon-to-be-wife June. Their daughter Rosanne said, ""The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.""

I have this on my running playlist. There is are mariachi-style horns and guitar-drum beat which pace this excellently for runners looking for more pep in their step.

""Love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire.""

I full recommend ""Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash.

A1CHLJQMZN8LHG,B000W158SQ,1,-1,1.0,"I admired them so much when they debuted.  Courtney Love is the frontwoman.  It's pretty fast for grunge, yet hard.  My favorite parts are when the bass completely stops and she sings.  Ultimately, I think she's really cool."
A2MTVOIM3LXKWH,B000W158SQ,1,1,5.0,"Although I'm not a Courtney Love fan (or Hole either), I really like this song. Fun little ditty and great lyrics."

Amazon has a Great music store!!  Awesome!!  best place to find what you are looking for!!  Outstanding!! :o)
AKGF27HN0OF19,B000W11NQ2,1,1,4.0,"Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one, and for the most part it works well.  After dabbling with country on the ""Riddles In The Sand"" album, Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on ""Mango"".  ""Please Bypass This Heart"" is nothing spectacular, but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it's best with ""If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me"".  I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song (this is coming from a guy who does not like country music).  Other highlights on the album include ""Frank And Lola"" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re-kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida.  ""Desperation Samba"" is another great Buffett ""south of the border"" tune.  The title track ""Last Mango In Paris"" is classic Buffett.  The album closer ""Beyond The End"" is a song a lot of Buffett fans don't seem to care for, but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc.  The album also includes several of Buffett's popular concert favorites ""Jolly Mon"" and ""Gypsies In The Palace"".  Some of the production on this album is very 80's oriented which dates it a bit, but overall this is another good album from Jimmy."
A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000W11NQ2,1,1,5.0,"Last Mango In Paris is a classic Jimmy Buffett album.  After the fairly putrid Riddles In The Sand, he comes back strong with the perfect mix of satire and Caribbean rhythms.  He is at his storytelling best in songs like ""Frank & Lola"", ""Desperation Samba"", the hilariously heartbreaking ""If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me"", the superb title track and the adventurous ""Gypsies In The Palace"" (which has Harrison Ford on the bullwhip).  ""Jolly Mon Sing"" has taken a life of it's own becoming the basis for children's book he wrote with his daughter.  It may well be the pinnacle of his calypso songs.  Last Mango In Paris is often forgotten, but essential Jimmy Buffett album."
A1QDD2V7AWGPEE,B000W126VS,1,1,5.0,"This a song by the Platters that is one of there best if not the best and is very dear to my heart.
Me and my Wife Betty of 44 years still dance to if with loving memories.

A17RU14JUAI9O0,B000W16Z6K,1,1,5.0,"Just one of those tunes you seldom catch on the radio, so just get it."
A256JOUD8X0J7R,B000W16Z6K,1,1,5.0,This and Smile Like You Mean It are my two favorite songs by the Killers.  I loved the Hot Fuss album when it came out.  I bought these to add to my ipod.  Quality is great.

A2NYZMD56AWRWC,B000W16Z6K,1,1,5.0,I never knew how sang it until I searched for the song.  I love the song for the longest time and when I found it I had to download it. Download was quick and easy. Sound and quality was good.
A22HSBTXF6WLT7,B000W16Z6K,1,1,5.0,"I liked the song, it provides many many minutes of me dancing shirtless in my roommate's room while he's at work."

A3IE9HT3TAOOJ3,B000W16Z74,1,1,5.0,"Killers have a great sound (for the most part). This one tickles my fancy and I like to bounce down the road to this one too. Great beat, easy to wiggle the ol' hips to, and bob the head around. Yeah, I look spastic, but so what - I'm having fun!"
A22HSBTXF6WLT7,B000W16Z74,-1,1,5.0,"But it was just him covering it for a terrible movie.  this version is also enjoyable, and makes you want to wear a cowboy hat."

A3IG4HHH9WMO3N,B000W11JU2,1,1,4.0,"This is a great song, with powerful lyrics that causes the listener to look beyond the physical and embrace their inner self.
Very well done Ms. Arie."
A1E56PU394428A,B000W176Y0,1,1,5.0,This has taken over the title of my favorite song.
AARHFHP17QFNG,B000W176Y0,1,1,4.0,A very somber song but is so beautiful. I cannot believe I just discovered it by hearing someone else (J Rome) sing it on YouTube.
A2206W97E6C8U2,B000W176Y0,1,1,5.0,I heard this song sung by a male singer on American Idol. I looked for the original artist and discovered India. She has a smooth rich voice so pleasant to listen to. I will definitely look into her music more.
A2B5FPOCP3IPIF,B000W174DI,1,1,5.0,"Its a song. Either you like it or you do not. Obviously I did, that is why I bought it."
A2WNT0M77XRT81,B000W174DI,-1,1,4.0,I love the beat of this song. It has too much bad language for my taste but the beat is great would not recommend this to my friends.
A1K3SG4HTS36RS,B000W174S8,1,1,5.0,I love the Amazon Cloud!  Songs download in minutes and are available to listen to.  I like being able to purchase one song and not the whole album.

A1OQ66R7ZI2GEW,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,This is a good song. Johnny Cash at his best. It plucks at your emotions. A mournfull song full of raw emotion.

A31IF5TD2TMSH3,B000W174DI,1,1,5.0,"Our whole family loves Eminem, especially his funny songs.  I don't make explicit content ""taboo"" to my kids over 10, my feeling is that if you make something taboo, they'll want it even MORE.  So we don't make a big deal out of it (not like they've never heard the words before and c'mon, they're just WORDS).  This is another great song, by a great singer.  Period!"
A38DI14LE9WJXR,B000W16A56,1,1,5.0,One of my favs I like alot of Joe's work  I will be getting more this way soon I like how easy it is to get your favorite songs this way.

A2VIXSEAN6QO8Y,B000W16A56,1,1,5.0,Good tune from Joe Nichols. Has good lyrics and a nice upbeat tune. Nice country hit. A little blast from the past.
A179EHWXB6NSIQ,B000W173RU,1,1,5.0,"My summary says it all - Johnny Cash was never in 'better voice' than when he recorded this song - that includes his 50's and 60's songs.  He has more range and smoothness in this song than any other - perhaps it's the message that he's trying to send to all believers, and his convictions are well made in the lyrics of this song; quite spooky when you listen to what he has to say, as it applies in the current age as much as it did in 1990, 2001, and now.  I put this song right up there second only to ""Ring of Fire"".  This is Johnny Cash at his best."
A2PCHYJ7SQBS5A,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"Love, Love  me some Kem."
A2MYCWFRTOEU6Q,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,Great version of the song by one of country music's greatest. Rest in peace Johnny and June.
A299RHMH1M9PIW,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"On his last album before he dies, Johnny Cash proves that he is still great by taking this song from Nine Inch Nails and turning it into his life's anthem. Johnny Cash doesn't just cover this song but he OWNS it. He reinvents it and makes it more powerful that the original. Hurt has become one of my favorite Johnny Cash songs. The music video is amazing. Yes, this song is a ""must have."""
A2JVIA9P648H6Y,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"I bought this song because it was in the trailer for Logan, but it wasn't even in the movie!  But what a great song, much better than the original artists, I love it.

As music goes, the download was smooth, the quality of the file was flawless to the novice ears, and when played on multiple devices, to include an mp3 disc where I had over 200 songs made no differencethe quality was spot on.  Amazon has delivered yet another fine product and I love the fact that the songs I have purchased are backed up on their cloud.  What a great service, I love it, and I enjoy the massive selection offered by Amazon!  I love the ease in which music can be selected, listened to, and backed up via Amazon's digital services."
A3IYLLZ0T0TTVV,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,Heard this version on YouTube and loved it. I think it was also on the trailer for Logan.

A2I4SF9BPIFL74,B000W176MM,1,-1,3.0,I like Kem and this could be a good on-the-road CD.  He is not my best male artist but his music is somewhat different than what I am accustomed to listening to...very smooth.
A160NZXRYJHZA,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,A haunting song from a man who knew he was dying from heartbreak since June passed away.
A10ADY0N5QKCHQ,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,Really love this song from Johnny Cash.
A1VE4HGNEBRJPX,B000W1774O,-1,1,5.0,You hear Johnny Cash's pain when he sings this song.  I think his rendition of the song is perfect.
A1H7JPAHFETCSQ,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"Heartbreaking, but in the best way. Humbling, reminding us to not become too attached to this world. To focus on love and personal spiritual growth as opposed to materialistic things,"

AFAJTPU988FU8,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"This is one of the most heart-felt pieces of music I have ever heard.  I am not a NIN fan, but Johnny Cash puts so much pain into this rendition that it overwhelms me to play it.  It is just about perfect."
A8SSQ3F61OD30,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,Nice song
A1QDOS1ODOLH3P,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,I became aware that this a Trent Reznor composition but Johnny Cash made this song his own.  It seems like Trent had the Man in Black in mind when he was writing this song even though we know he wasn't.  Combine this song with the unforgettable video and what you have is a masterpiece.
A31F7XAEJQQHPS,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,love it

The music directors of the series should be given awards for their choices. Even when the self-righteous hypocritical characters irritate me, the music continues to draw me back.

ALSCSX3AOL9DP,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,Love the rawness of this song. Almost seems as if it was created for Cash. I have always liked the original but this is the version I wear.
A2MDSOEI9W5WBF,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"Johnny has mad many songs that are wonderful. The ghostly sound of ""Hurt"" makes it one of my favorite. I don't know of any other song that has this sound.

RIP Johnny Cash!

A23ZCTK03U40QB,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"Johnny cash just shows how a real singer/musician sings all through their life.
I realize listening to this song hurt his voice never failed from that great voice over the years
The one I grew up listening to as a small child.there is no denying this man's greatness. This is not
 my favorite of his songs-  although it does suit his voice well, and considering circumstance ... I listen to it now and
Ihear his emotion only to well.. he lived a long beautiful life with his wife, I hope they are sitting at the far side of the Jordan..."
A3JGZTA25MYGWV,B000W1774O,-1,1,4.0,i felt like the song hurt was a honest song  i think thats why i like it i noticed that its on the radio also

A12W8NRSYR593I,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,What a song.....what a man to transcend his memories into a tune....what a heartfelt voice capturing each word just right.....this is one of those songs that you hope is never covered by those superficial singing shows or another artist. Johnny Cash OWNS this song!
A1Q8PMUXW8D1DI,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"Been a fan of his for his entire career, and I've found that I really love the older Johnny Cash over the younger. You can feel a sense of urgency and feeling in his later songs that may not have been present with his earlier stuff. This, along with Redemption Day, are great examples of Cash at the end."
A356X26TH0GS9X,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"I've heard it said that when Trent Reznor, who wrote this song and performed it in solo and/or with Nine Inch Nails, he was very much opposed to Johnny Cash covering this song.  Yet, when Trent heard JC's version, he was truly impressed.  So am I.  This was recorded by Cash just after the death of his wife June Carter Cash, and shortly before he himself died.  I can hear the heartbreak in his voice.  He sounds old and weary, yet that works so well for him in this song.  This was truly his last iconic hit, in my opinion.  I love performing this song at karaoke, since I have a deep voice.  But it is incredibly challenging and difficult to achieve his style.  I've done it before, but it seems only by accident.  Cash is truly a master songwriter and performer, and this track is truly an exclamation mark on his entire repertoire."
AG9PJLR2LP6NJ,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"What a beautiful song.  Johnny Cash had such an incredible voice and a way of writing that was pure poetry.  This song is haunting.  It'll tear your heart strings.  The pain is palpable and resonant.  Makes me cry every time I hear it.  It's Legendary, as is the man.  He speaks to my soul."
A1UWMOFWP3NTF8,B000W159H6,1,1,5.0,"Ok, I bought this song/s from Amazon in a download so I liked it, I can't say If anyone else would like it, listen to it and if you like it, download it, Amazon makes it easy to do, much easier that iTunes."

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W1774O,1,1,4.0,"Hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary Johnny Cash passed away. Yet, his music was definitely a cavalcade of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well. But when he did a cover song that was out of the ordinary, he not only made it his own nicely, but it sometimes still stands taller than the original artist in that tone. The prime example of Johnny's musical intimacy came nearly at the end of his life when he did a cover of Nice Inch Nails song Hurt. The song is definitely something still worth listening too. Not just from Johnny's voice, but also because of his simplicity of the guitar and piano. It is a great song to listen too, not just if you are a die hard Johnny Cash fan, but also for anyone who is new to his music. Get this, and you won't be hurt.

Song: B+"
A1JRHL29A1ABOT,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"I remember this album when I was in the 10th grade. This album is timeless. This album is accompanied by a saucy blend of textured vocals; scatting, love filled lyrics; and bass, drums, guitar and percussions and is the essence of everything that we've come to love and miss about soul music. This is a 10-song heart-felt journey through love, loss and redemption. This album is a testament that soul has found new life in his music. This album has been certified Gold."
A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000W1877U,1,1,4.0,"Joanna Newsome is not for everyone, that's for sure, basically Joanna singing with harp, and sparse other instruments. Her 2006 ""YS"" album created quite a stir, though. (It was my 17 yr. daughter who introduced me to her, incidentally). This live EP was recorded on the YS Fall 06 tour.

""EP"" (3 tracks, 24 min.) brings a new song, ""Colleen"", which is pretty much in the vein of the ""YS"" album. Next is ""Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie"", from ""The Milk-Eyed Mender"" album, in a slightly altered version from the album. Then comes a 13 min. blow-out version of ""Cosmia"", from the ""YS"" album, which here live sounds much more invigerated than the album version, and I can't stop playing it.

If you are familiar with Joanna Newsome, this is a great companion to the ""YS"" album. If you are new, this is the prefect introduction to her sound, and I highly recommed checking it out for those of you. No, it's not mainstream, far from it, but this is great music by all accounts."
A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000W1877U,1,1,5.0,"Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year's ""Ys,"" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk.

And after the solemnities of ""Ys,"" apparently Newsom has decided to go a bit more lighthearted. ""Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band"" is an unpretentious little EP, with some new songs and new takes on older songs -- a fun little treat.

It opens with the strong folky chords of ""Colleen,"" a slice of Celtic-flavoured balladry that trickles through an oddball melody. ""I tell it as I best know how,"" croons Newsom in her crazy-fairy voice. ""Pick me up and toss me round/I lost my shoes and tore my best gown...""

She then follows it up with new versions of two older songs: the gentle haunting reimagining of ""Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"" and a full-band version of ""Cosmia,"" which seems nicely fleshed-out and polished.

After to the legendary grandeur of ""Ys,"" this little EP seems relaxed and laid-back, as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set. They're done with an ear for fun, but that doesn't take the delicate, appealing edge from the music.

Her twangly, delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes, and what sounds like some soft drums, all mingled together. In ""Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"" we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp. And over it all is Newsom's creaky, meandering vocals, wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy.

One new song and two reworkings, but ""Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band"" is stil worth getting for anyone who likes eerie, weird little folk songs."
AL5I3OVMH953O,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"I never heard the original version but just this is his song now! He spoke from deep in his heart and you can see his life unfolding before his eyes as you listen...it reminds me of when Whitney Houston covered Dolly Parton's I'll always love you, sometimes another artist can just sing it better!"
AUPZF5LJ4SXGL,B000W1774O,1,1,5.0,"Interesting to hear an old, familiar voice from country music sing such a heartfelt modern song. Way to stretch yourself Johnny!"

A2WDGB4M6DVRDW,B000W16ZEM,1,1,5.0,"Jefferey Osbourne made a name for himself singing with LTD and went on to do the same as a solo artist. Love Ballad took me down memory lane to a time when I was a teenager and thinking I was in love. Such a wonderful love song,"
AJK5WHV1GW941,B000W176MM,1,1,4.0,"I would hear Kem on the radio, mostly on the stations which focused on playing jazz music and said to myself, ""This is just where this artist belongs"". I liked his voice from the first time I was introduced to it. It's very unique and befitting for jazz. It has been a long time since I have heard Kem on the radio, but something just compelled me to pick up his debut album and listen closely; I'm glad I did.

Please be warned: The younger generation may not like or appreciate this album. For example, when I was listening to this album, my brother gave me a crazy look and said, ""What the hell are you listening to?"" On the contrast, my older sister heard me playing the LP and said, ""You know about Kem? I didn't know you liked Kem!"" I really don't want to limit him to a particular audience, by this really is grown folks music. There is not one up-tempo song  in sight, just slow jams and mid-tempos. Everyone doesn't always like fast music anyway; I'm one of them. I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music. I get so tired of it, I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays. ""Love Calls"" was the first single from ""Kemistry"" and what a fantastic song it is! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about. This song is very laid back and mellow; it's sure to put one in a romantic mindset. Also, the lyrics are really good. He's letting the listening know that when love calls, there is no where to hide. ""Inside"" and ""Cherish this Moment"" are fine moments on the album. These tracks actually bring Sade to mind. I love the hook on ""Inside"" simply because it's catchy. This album is slightly flawed because it was boring in a few areas, but overall, I was impressed.  He did a fine job.

Mikeisha's Top 5

1. ""Inside""
2. ""Brotha Man""
3. ""Love Calls""
4. ""I'm Missin' Your Love""
5. ""Miss You"""
A6UOM11FVGTRL,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"Kem sounds a lot like Al Jarreau.  Smooth, jazzy, with some R & B style make this album a must.  I highly recommend this cd for some good old fashioned love songs..."
A3UE57S8G2G72Y,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"Kem sings about love, a universal subject. Some of his songs are spiritual, which is terrific. His lyrics are intellectual. Kem is a very talented musician. He sings about letting things happen in their own time, missing your lover, wanting to be with your lover, cherishing moments, finding peace, and so on. It's a mixture of jazz and r&b/soul. I highly recommend this album to everyone."
A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"First let me say that I love the wordplay used for the title of Kem's debut album.  Now on to the music - initially when I heard his first single, LOVE CALLS, I thought it was Al Jarreau but as the song went on I realized that it was a new artist named Kem. The rest of the songs are totally and unmistakably, KEM!!

I love the vibe of this entire album and had a hard time not pressing repeat on a few songs, namely: LOVE CALLS, MATTER OF TIME, SAY & YOU ARE.
Yes, it is more of a ""chill out"" album but certainly not one that bored me - I found myself paying attention to the adult lyrics and the beautiful music production.  I'd highly recommend this disc to lovers of r&b mixed with subtle jazz notes - it's a great debut from a real artist who I hope to hear much more from in the future (despite his sorry label and lack of promotion)."
A1NKC3FZQNY45V,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"Jazz at it's finest, smooth, straight to the point excellent to work and listen too.  Chill out, boop the head, superb distant driving music. Kem is a great artist. Do not ever stop dreaming your creativity is right on the money."
AYR0049I3E5UB,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"I have two of Kem's albums.  This one is my favorite, but I truly like his second album too.  I am definitely a fan of Kem's music.  This is the type of music that will never get outdated and will sound great in any era."

A9WFV9DEWY4S0,B000W16ZEM,1,1,5.0,"Jeffrey Osborne the ultimate lead singer of LTD sang this Ballad and it was the Song of our High School Prom 1967.  I did not have a boyfriend back in the days because I valued music more than most of the boys I knew and they were too shy to want to dance.  This song came on and one of my high school crushes came and asked me to dance.  It did not matter that he could not dance very well, I was just on top of the world that I was dancing to one of my favorite groups singing my favorite song at the time.  LTD was not the same for me once Jeffrey Osborne left the group but I still listen to his music.  It was and is still soothing, I play it when I am studying or when I am having trouble falling asleep or when I want to go back to sweet memories.

Just take your time and listen to the meaning of the words and you will love it to.  What great music we had back in the day.
I have been able to purchase all of my favorite music that used to be on my vast collection of 45's and Albums through Amazon<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Ballad/dp/B000W16ZEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Ballad</a>.

A117RJ6J5CO53D,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"I just recently had a opportunity to purchase this album Kemistry.  I heard about his music before I actually knew who he was and why wasn't music in the spotlight.  After listening to each song on this album the soothing vocals, music and lyrics he has establish a following with me along with other fans because is breath of Fresh Air from the  Music Mainstream.  If you like new comer John Legend, Kem is Several notch better than John Legend.  Just vocally and lyrically, Kem is a fore runner and his record company should spend lots more money marketing him. His life story Kem should be a Movie.  It amazing what God when you let him put his destiny for you and how when you tapped into your God Destiny and Purpose what Radiants witnin a person talent and abilities.  This album is a good showcase.

My  Personal Favorite song is Love Calls,  this by itself establish his prescence in the music industry.  I have rated each song. Other favorites

1. Matter of Time  -Excellent intro

2. Miss You  - Calming & Amazing

3. Say  - Soothing Vocals

4. Inside  - Another Wonderful Example of Kem's vocal ability

5. I'm Missin' Your Love  -Anazing Song and Soohing melodies

6. Love Calls  -  SO VERY AMAZING VOCALS, LYRICS & MUSIC Arrangements - Kem at his Finest

7. Brotha Man  -  Rich and Wonderful Vocals

8. Cherish This Moment -Great

9. This Place (Dedicated to the Church of Today) -Slow but so Meaninful, Brilliant Vocals arrangements.  It is another example of Kem Ability to tap into his roots

10. You Are - Amazing and Soothing Vocals

I would encourage everyone who likes a Great Vocal and Lyrical &Musical arrangements that will elevate your mind  to a Positive and Loving Prescene.  A Calming effect this album  is a Keeper to purchase.  Kem is Unique & Original.  His music is in a Class of it own.  I Look Forward to Kem Music in the Future.

Go Get Kemistry and Be Prepare to Mezmerized!"
A3IC5E3OFHYAZX,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"Yeah, the '80s may have watered it down with excessive layers of synthesizers and the general favoring of style over substance. Sure, the '90s have all but stomped it out due to the ubiquitous presence of hip-hop's ""dark"" side (heavily-programmed instruments, blatant sampling, offensive lyrics, bad singing). However, thanks to budding artists like Kem Owens, soul music has finally come around full-circle after 20+ years of musical diarrhea.

Kem's sparkling debut should truly set the standard in terms of what to look for in good soul music: REAL INSTRUMENTS (played by REAL MUSICIANS, of course), REAL SONGS (inspired, meaningful lyrics and solid composition skills), and REAL SINGING ABILITY (knowing HOW to sing in addition to having vocal talent). If more and more artists today would just adhere to these relatively simple guidelines, then there wouldn't be so much bad music out there to begin with. An album containing a few hit singles and a load of filler doesn't do it for me. That's why I'm recommending 'Kemistry' to ANYONE who honestly craves good music without the hype to go with it.

p.s. It's no wonder why most reviewers on here keep giving this album 5 stars. They know what they're talking about. So do I. DON'T MISS OUT ON IT!"
A3FZ4NE1C45RU,B000W176MM,1,1,4.0,"Every now and then a musician comes along with divine inspiration. Their words and melody capture you the first time and every time you hear their sound. I was completely awed by Kem! I thank my friends at Underground-soul for the tip on this one. This guy is great. He is soulful and by today's standards what one would call ""eclectic"". Kem fuses gospel with soul and an outpouring of emotions is demonstrated on this cd. A joy to listen to, I highly recommend this one. DJ COA"

THIS IS A SOLID ALBUM EVERY SONG ON HERE IS GREAT WAY TO GO KEM!!!!!"
A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"Kem - Kemistry (Motown, 2003)
This whole album is terrific; not a bad song in the bunch. ""Say"", ""Missing Your Love"" and ""You Are"" are my favorites and they should have been released as singles. I may be wrong but the only single I know that was released was ""Love Calls"". But I'm doing my part: whenever I make a soul compilation for my friends, I throw in a random Kem track so they know that there are other good songs on this album. -EJR"

I will admit that when I was younger I did not understand the part about searching for his lost shaker of salt. It wasn't until I actually tried a Margarita that I realized what the salt is used for! Jimmy Buffett has been called ""the mayor of Margaritaville"" because of this song. I do not drink alcohol so I am not going to waste away in Margaritaville. But, I will continue to listen to this song.

A1UZQ95B8LL61J,B000W174QU,1,1,5.0,"'Margaritaville' is Buffet at his best.  He could have retired after this song, just like Robin Thicke could retire now after 'Blurred Lines'.  Apparently Buffet's success with this led him to specialize in songs about booze, but 'Margaritaville' would be pretty hard to match."

A1K3SG4HTS36RS,B000W174QU,1,1,5.0,I love the Amazon Cloud!  Songs download in minutes and are available to listen to.  I like being able to purchase one song and not the whole album.
A3923W0OJNGUHN,B000W174QU,1,1,4.0,I rated it this way because I have always liked the song. Jimmy does a nice job with it. It is a keeper.
AEJAGHLC675A7,B000W174QU,1,1,5.0,"Had to download this classic track from Jimmy Buffett's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Songs-You-Know-By-Heart/dp/B000W1MDRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Songs You Know By Heart</a>, his 18th album and the first greatest hits compilation, which was originally released in January 1985. Still have the album purchased right after it was released and play it on CD to this day. Despite its release date, the album only includes songs from 1973 to 1979.  And of course, ""Margaritaville"" is still Buffett's single large chart hit.

""Wastin' away again in Margaritaville,
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame,
But I know it's nobody's fault...""

Had been inspired by this song when I wrote my review of this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classic-2-Ounce-Salt-and-Pepper-Shaker/dp/B005NKJVGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classic 2-Ounce Salt and Pepper Shaker</a>&nbsp;set, so it just seemed right to post this quick review of this Jimmy Buffett classic, especially since it's an album that I've owned for all these years.

Some classic hits are just that for good reason.

A1B9LEMJ5EFWO2,B000W18J9G,1,1,5.0,I have been in love with this song since I first heard it. I actually bought the CD because of this song. This is gonna be a song my husband and I dance to at our renewal of vows ceremony.
A2UVEQAQVSBOS6,B000W18J9G,1,1,5.0,"I had already heard this song before I downloaded it. Amazon gave me credit for a download, so I chose this song. Once again I do not know what your preferences are, but I am satisfied with this song."
A2WCYNH4TJBFGK,B000W18HWU,1,1,5.0,I just like the music and I love to dance. Old school but old school is sometime the best.. love it!
A13NRL82GSVEA2,B000W18HWU,1,1,5.0,"I needed to make me a playlist for a long road trip, this is one of the songs I choose!"
A2NC6D6YGYHG4G,B000W18HWU,1,1,5.0,This is one of those tunes you have to crank up and dance to...even when you're alone. Great to get the party going.
A3UGHNEHEVSFPT,B000W18HWU,1,1,5.0,"The first time I heard this, all I wanted to do was get up and dance.  This was nice--and I'm glad that the DJs haven't forgotten it."
A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W176MM,1,1,5.0,"I remember hearing ""Love Calls"" being played on the radio at work all the time, and the DJ never said who made the song. Maybe the DJ didn't know, because nobody else did either. When I finally found out the song was from a newcomer named Kem and that his album Kemistry was out, my brother and sister told me to pick the album up. And boy, talk about good advice.
Since ""Love Calls"" is the first single, it's probably also the most recognizable song on the album - but I don't know if I would necessarily say it's the best song. Not to say it isn't a great song, but there are other great tracks too, like ""Inside"" (no, it's not about sex) and the gospel-flavored ""This Place"". And ""Brotha Man"" is a great storytelling track.
With ten tracks at around 47 minutes, it's clear that Kem isn't a debut artist who's trying to overprove himself. And he doesn't need to, because every song on this album is great. So why isn't he getting the recognition he deserves? Probably because he's on Motown, the label that seems to only promote artists when they feel like it (see also Remy Shand). But hopefully Kem will soon sell several copies of this great release."
AA8HFTJIAQA4G,B000W176MM,-1,-1,3.0,"Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound. Well not new just different from most contemporary music today. Essentially he's a jazz singer when you break it down. Listening to his CD is like an extended set of the ""Oasis After Dark"". He released this CD on his own a year ago and after sellin 10,000 copies he managed to get the attention of Motown. Listening to this CD is difficult because while the tone is great and his vocals are good there seems to be something missing. I often found myself asleep before the CD was finished. Kinda like listening to one of those ""Sounds of The Earth"" CD's ... or something to help you go to sleep. 10 distinct songs about love and life. He goes from an Al Jarreau sound on Track 7 ""Brotha Man"" till a Simply Redd feel on Track 3 ""Say"", my favorite track on the CD by the way. Soothing is the best thing I guess you can say about this CD. A nice CD to go to sleep to. Now whether that's a compliment or not I'm not sure. This is definitely not for everyone, but the Jazz Enthusiast will probably be more likely to find use for this CD. ""Is it like Floetry""? No. They are more hip than this CD. ""Is It like SADE""? No. She invokes more soul in her music. ""Al Jarreau?"" No. Jarreau is more livelier than this cat. This one still kind puzzles me. My favorite cuts are 3,4,5,and 6. See if you can get a better grasp on it than I can."
A2ZTFPWOPNNHTW,B000W176MM,1,1,4.0,"After hearing ""Love Calls"" on the radio, I had to hear more from this gifted vocalist. At first listen, I could hear the purity and the many dimensions of that VOICE, which is soothing, smooth like 18 year old Appleton, seductive, and playful. Kem is not your ordinary run of the mill singer but an extraordinary song stylist. His voice dips and dives, rounds syllables (much like Al, Anita, & Phyllis), scats, and just downright croons.
After getting ahold of Kemistry I was not dissappointed, rather joyous of the fact that I owned a solid musical experience. This is adult music at its finest. The ambience is intimate and jazzy. The instrumentation is also complimentary to Kem's vocal prowess. There are also nice percussive elements that add to the vibe of the cd. My favs are ""Love Calls, Brotha Man (lyrics are beautiful), Inside, and This Place.""
There's not much else for me to say about this product other than get this cd."
ANNJH6BX6TK7Z,B000W18M3Y,1,1,5.0,"Have a Kindle fire that I wanted to download with oldies songs, found the song on Amazon.com and it was quite easy to work with on my Kindle."
A18PHRALHBLMF4,B000W16ZPG,1,1,5.0,since buying cds are out of style and iTunes is always expensive I prefer to use amazon for music song is great and the preview is long enough for you to get an idea of the song
A2966LIDHCRWK2,B000W16ZPG,1,1,5.0,I forgot about this song until my sister got married a couple years ago and had it playing at her reception.  I absolutely love this song!

A1C7Y31S5QXNTR,B000W16ZPG,1,1,5.0,"""Insensitive"" is a particularly good song from the 1995 album of the same title.
Well delivered by the very talented Canadian artist Jann Arden.
""Insensitive"" is moderate tempo and is about asking someone advise on how to be insensitive.
The song just missed the top ten pop in 1996."
A348GYLVPWT8AK,B000W16ZPG,1,1,5.0,Its a song for me that just speaks of parts of my life and it kind of just tells of what a woman puts up with in relationships...men are insensitive.

A3ROZZ6GSY2G9W,B000W177O4,1,1,5.0,I know most people prefer Margaritaville--not me.  Come Monday is his best!  His smooth voice and this great song are a perfect match.
A1UWMOFWP3NTF8,B000W177O4,1,1,5.0,"Ok, I bought this song/s from Amazon in a download so I liked it, I can't say If anyone else would like it, listen to it and if you like it, download it, Amazon makes it easy to do, much easier that iTunes."
A1Q8PMUXW8D1DI,B000W177O4,1,1,4.0,"If you are a fan of songs with feeling, or a Buffett fan in general, you have to have this song. It's really very good."
A2M2EJC4TG1VD1,B000W177O4,1,1,5.0,One of Jimmy Buffett's best song's in his song book.  A Classic among all of his classic's.  You just can't go wrong with this cut.
A2ADCQKOPLX63B,B000W177O4,1,1,5.0,"This song is one of Jimmy Buffett's earliest hits, but many people have never heard it. I love it because of its great melody, but also it's not about swigging and sailing."
A1UZQ95B8LL61J,B000W177O4,-1,-1,3.0,"I know Come Monday was a bit hit for Jimmy Buffet, but it's no 'Margaritaville'.  I think it's okay to good."
AVTQB8FI2KW8Q,B000W177O4,1,1,4.0,"Jimmy Buffet is most famous for his fun hits like ""Margueritaville"".  ""Come Monday"" was also a popular hit and different from the others.  It is very sweet and romantic and I think it may be based on True events in his life."
A2CL2VIWEML88,B000W18J3W,1,1,4.0,"Ne-Yo is one of the smoothest song writers of his time coming off of the heels of writers like Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds another writer tat when you hear his songs sang by anyone you know it's his song. Ne-Yo has that same quality. Though scary for a song writer to step in front of the curtain, Ne-Yo came out swinging with this one. He deemed to be in touch with his sensitive side and though this is a break up song (broken up) it's melody makes you happy and it makes you want to fall in love all over again. It's the happy - sad song...I love it great sing along song..."
AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000W18J3W,1,1,4.0,"R&B singer, Ne-Yo's, first big splash on the charts came with his 2006 release of ""So Sick"".  This chart-topping song describes a guy's lament over a lost love and the pain that is caused every time he hears songs that bring back those memories.  The music video, set among a ski resort in some snowy mountains meshes well with Ne-Yo's smooth voice."
A2LR1I5WZV3RAT,B000W1562O,1,1,5.0,"Great 18 year old song.  Got a little airplay and then vanished beneath the first wave of rap.  Shame, this one belongs on your list right now."
A2BH945DHGH5J7,B000W1562O,1,1,5.0,"This is another one of those songs that I just had to purchase.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for music from the 1970s,1980s and 1990s!!!."

AMPXEKJNVIX8L,B000W1772Q,1,1,5.0,I liked Soundgarden's original track just fine. But Johnny Cash takes it to a whole new level. The recording quality is excellent as well.
A2DO8HH8GBK76E,B000W1772Q,1,1,5.0,"I'm a fan of both Cash and Soundgarden and this was quiet honestly a better version of this song then the original. It has a lot more soul to it, more experience to it, heaver in my opinion. Great Cover and song."
A3NGS086X59WJK,B000W1772Q,1,1,5.0,"Love this. Show you how Johnny Cash can take a ""rock"" song and make it his own. I was totally blown away the first time I herd this song."

good version of buffet!"
ALLU4SGSA4SJG,B000W15BRY,1,1,5.0,"I was seven year old the first time I heard this song. We had just moved across the country and I had come to realize the world was a bigger place than I could have ever imagined. It inspired me to travel both within the U.S., the Caribbean, throughout a good deal of Western Europe and Northern Africa and as far east as Turkey. I discovered early on that regardless of their circumstances, the color of their skin, their religious convictions or where they live that underneath the trappings what people need and want are all the same. I still have some mileage left to go, but it's been a good ride thanks to this song."
ATNM9FCY8R05J,B000W15BRY,1,1,5.0,The qualty of the sound is very good. I will keep this song for a long long time.  Thank you

A1KC6PZI4TGZ9W,B000W1AKB6,1,1,5.0,"My friend Mario Perez loved One Way and used to blast this on his JVC double cassette player.  It is cool and reminds me of 1991.  We partied hard, did business, and relaxed to One Way..."
ALL9XFM0Q1N4E,B000W178XO,1,1,5.0,It's a great album with a ton of hits from the Man in Black! If you are a Johnny Cash fan then this is a great buy if you are missing some of his hits.

I ordered this one because of the song Rescue...great tune. The cd itself is disappointing, though. I realize we all go through changes and I believe this cd was put out during/after her move to LA? Seems like she was really going through some down time (I could be wrong about this) This cd is so very depressing and repetitive.....only on a couple of tunes do I hear a break out or some power within the music. I'll continue to buy her music that's for sure....this is just not a cd I'll be listening to very often."

A2U15B5HYZCDG6,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5.0,"Having the majority of Lucinda's albums, I must say this is the one that stays in my CD player the most.  All the songs on this album are great and some in particular will keep you thinking long after you hear them (Fancy Funeral, What If).  You may want to hear ""Come On"" in private, especially away from children or the prude due to subject matter and how she lyrically gives the kiss off to a guy that ""didn't know where to put his hands"", and he couldn't even make her Come (On) (you'll get the idea at first listen).  One of Lucinda's best albums, followed by Essence and A World Without Tears."

AGEIT17HENDIS,B000W1AO4Y,-1,-1,3.0,"I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw (in the good sense) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums. First, on the Hank Williams tribute album, ""Timeless"", where she did a cover of his classic tale of love's trials and tribulations ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself. I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of ""Cold, Cold Heart"". I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt's ""Beulah Land"" on his tribute album. Finally, I noted the fine job that she did on a duet with John Prine on ""Wedding Bells"" on his ""In Spite Of Ourselves"" cover album of country classics.

That said, although I have high, very high regard for Ms. Williams' cover work I am more ambivalent about her own albums. This album under review is such a case. I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs. She, obviously, can write thoughtfully of love, lost, the cruel nature of the world, her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above-mentioned efforts is missing here. A few do, however, stand out. ""Mama You Sweet"", ""Words"", ""West"" and ""Rescue"" clearly rise to the occasion. As I say, the rest is so-so and suffer a little from trying to cross-over from her country base."

A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4.0,"Although Lucinda Williams has been doing her thing for almost thirty years, it seems that she didn't really get a WHOLE lot of attention until she released Car Wheels on a Gravel Road in 1998. That album was so influential that it seems that all of her albums after that point will be compared to it, which might account for all the negative reviews for her latest album, West.

Actually, now that I think about it, this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options. But if this is your first Lucinda Williams album, I suggest you get educated on some of her earlier material first. She doesn't sound different or anything, but, well, Lucinda is another one of those singers that makes great songs yet she doesn't have a great voice, so if you're not a fan of hers, this album might put you to sleep. But it really IS very accessible.

Lucinda composed this album following the death of her mother, which is probably why most of the songs are mellow. They don't drown into each other though, as I can easily pick up highlights like ""Are You Alright"", ""Learning How to Live"" and the title track. And the songs about her mother are poignant yet exceptional, as shown in ""Mama You Sweet"" and especially ""Fancy Funeral"". But my favorite song would probably have to be ""Words"".

While I can do without ""Come On"" and the nine-minute spoken word ""Wrap My Head Around That"", the rest of the album is quality Lucinda. It might not be her best album, but it's far above-average, so if you want to find exceptional music, go west.

Anthony Rupert"

A3ADFUS74MLPMA,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4.0,"I've always enjoyed Lucinda's music, you can always find a few classics
on every collection, especially this one. It took some time but I really
enjoy the musicanship and her vocals are such a treat, she says what
she feels(not everything makes sense but hell, who really cares) she
is stretching some on many of these songs and getting away from
her base at times but she is a gifted alt-country rock talent that deserves to be heard in these times when music created for the masses is
really letting us down. Sure she's something else when she rocks out like
on Car wheels on a gravel road, she's dealing with the death of her
mom and under the LA influence  but each album gives us new insights, and
no one sings like this."
A1EFKMVDARBPZ0,B000W1AO4Y,-1,-1,2.0,"I am a Lucinda Williams fan and have been for a long time, but this CD is not her best.  Many of the songs sound the same to me -- sad, slow, boring.  Buy it if you're a long time fan and want to follow her career, otherwise I'd skip it."
A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5.0,"The career of singer/songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP, ""West.""

A moody collection of life, love and Americana, the record testifies to her ever-evolving talent and drive for musical perfection.

Williams is a tough chick -- the kind you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of -- but her sensitivity comes to the forefront once again.

""Are You Alright?,"" the lead single and opening track, is beautiful in its stark vulnerability. Asking questions such as, ""Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?"" and ""Is there anything I can do?,"" Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would-be lover. She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored, unyielding honesty.

This upfront quality permeates the collection. ""Everything Has Changed,"" for instance, underscores the monotony of life, whereas the richly melodic ""What If"" has Williams questioning many so-called facts of life.

""Where Is My Love?"" is passionate and pleading in its quest for the ultimate affirmation, appropriately going hand in hand with the autobiographical song ""Learning How to Live."" A particular standout, the latter finds Williams picking up the pieces of her life and moving on after a difficult breakup:

""'All I have left is this dime store ring/But I wouldn't trade it for anything/The days ahead will never be the same/For you I might have even changed my name/I'm learning how to live.""

The melancholy edge of the disc can also be attributed to the recent death of her mother, whom she pays tribute to in the desperate yet understated ""Mama You Sweet."" This experience surely played a part in the composition of another standout track, ""Fancy Funeral."":

""So don't buy a fancy funeral/It's not worth it in the end/Goodbyes can still be beautiful/With all the money that you'll spend/There's no amount of riches/Can bring back what you lost.""

Her search for love continues on the haunting, lyrically intense ""Unsuffer Me.""

Alternately, ""Rescue"" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress.

Different melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album. ""Wrap My Head Around That"" has funky, organic grooves with clean-cut lyrics that don't mess around with pretense or metaphors, and the surprisingly upbeat ""Come On"" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame.

""Words"" attests to the life-affirming power of language, whether uttered or harbored within, providing the most seductive melody of the disc, while the title track closes the album with her most evocative lyrics yet:

""I sleep out in the desert/Under the stars above/And keep making an effort/To wander into love/Who knows what the future holds/Or where the cards may fall/But if you don't come out west and see/You'll never know at all.""

Williams will likely never be able to replicate the cultural impact of her already classic 1998 album ""Car Wheels On a Gravel Road,"" but ""West"" proves that her talents as a musician continue to mature.

With her compelling abilities to connect with listeners on such an intricate, personal level, it is no surprise that more than 20 years into her career, her fanbase only continues to expand.

iTunes and Best Buy are among a myriad of music retailers that sell slightly different versions of ""West,"" offering various bonus demos of the album's selections."
ADJBUPS8SJHTC,B000W1AO0S,1,1,5.0,"This is the most insightful and profound songs in Mary J's career. Why I say that? because not only does it sounds good but it makes you think about your own life. I believe that there are singers/entertainers that have certain jobs and although Mary J was still going through her own personal crisis, she was on her way to being the sister that sings songs to empower black and other women of color. And this song allows you to examine your life and change it for the good."
AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4.0,"'West' is definately a step in the right direction after 'World Without Tears'. Vocally there isn't a lot different than Willaims has ever done. Musically, she or her producer, Hal Willner, has taken a few positive strides.

I do agree with others the lead-off track is one of the weakest on this disk. The repetativeness is completely distracting and not worthy of Willams' talents.  Ditto w/""Mama You Sweet"".

The strongest tracks are by far ""Unsuffer Me"", ""Where is My Love"", ""Rescue"", ""What If"" and ""Wrap My Head Around It"".  Especially the strings on ""Unsuffer Me"" and the guitar on ""Where is My Love"" really make the songs.  They are subtle yet make all the difference.

I do like ""Fancy Funeral"", though it is a little down...even for me.  ""Come On"" starts really good, but it doesn't really go anywhere.

The good thing is, the rest of the songs are perfectly serviceable.  Nothing outstanding, but nothing making me hit the 'skip' button like I did with 'World Without Tears'."
AE31M52VLKOG6,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5.0,"Lucinda's voice and guitar playing are so soothing  Are You Alright is my favorite of the bunch.  This is an excellent song about being concerned about a special friend in need.  The track Words is another highlight on this disc.  This is a great song about the power of  writing.  Words can truly comfort a person who is lonely, and I truly believe this.  What If is a beautiful song about the dream of peace in the world.  I could visualize the  vivid images in the song while listening to it.  Fancy Funeral is another gem on this album.  This is a very solemn song about how money does not matter when someone dies.  Learning How To Live is a song about learning how to move on after breaking up with someone.  The lyrics in the song are very meaningful to me.  Lucinda gets help with some talented musicians on this CD.  Come On is a track about feeling frustrated in a relationship.  Doug Pettibone gives this song a nice edge playing the electric guitar here.  Jim Keltner provides a sexy deep drum beat on the track Wrap My Head Around That.  I liked all the tracks on this album very much."
A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,4.0,"Lucinda Williams is in my opinion one of the most overlooked musicians in our era, considering that it's taken way too many years for her to get critical and some commercial acclaim, starting with 1998's ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". The current decade has found Williams to be very productive, with 2001's ""Essence"" and 2003's ""World Without Tears"" studio albums and one live album. Now comes the new studio album.

On ""West"" (13 tracks, 69 min.), Lucinda Williams sings about her usual topics of relationships, loss, loneliness, heartache. She also confronts the death of her mother (""Mama You Sweet"" and ""Fancy Funeral""). The opener ""Are You Alright"" sets the tone for the album: a slow-tempo, aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame. There are not many up-tempo songs on here, which may bother some people, but it doesn't bother me as in the end this is a mood album. Highlights for me include ""Unsuffer Me"", which is the best song on this album; the bitter yet funny ""Come On""; the epic 9+ Min. ""Wrap My Head Around That""; the sweet ""Words""; and the title track, which closes the album. The CD I bought came also with a 2 song (11 min.) bonus CD, which brings demo versions of ""Where Is My Love"" and ""Rescue"". Nice, but not really essential.

In all, I have come to like this album more with every listen. This is certainly not the most accessible Lucinda Williams, nor her best (that would still be ""Car Wheels""), but this is a rich album in every sense. But it's not for anyone in a hurry. I saw Lucinda Williams live on her ""World Without Tears"" tour, and was blown away by her stage presence. I can't wait to see how the songs from ""West"" will translate in a live session."
A2HM8TATPHTJDN,B000W18GBW,1,1,5.0,This album brings back memories... I can almost instantly remember where I was when this album came out. Music is the soundtrack to life!
A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B000W18GBW,1,1,4.0,"Hearing the four man crew from Queensbridge, The Lost Boyz, once again brings back nostalgic memories of the golden age of hip hop music. Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah (R.I.P.), Spigg Nice, and Pretty Lou knew the formula to making good music, with most concepts working. With many dope recognizable singles such as ""Music Makes Me High"", ""Renee"", and ""Lex, Coups..."" (there is a remix floating out there I strongly recommend you hear). But what separates this crew from other groups is personalty. Mr. Cheeks is very charismatic on the microphone, and Freaky Tah plays the background vocals (those unfamiliar, think of him being what Flava Flav is to Chuck D in Public Enemy, only more serious).

One reason that makes this album great is their creative hooks, some of them will have you remembering for a while. ""Music Makes Me High"", and ""The Yearn"" are both entertaining (although I believe ""Da Game"" is very similar to the latter song). ""1,2,3"" is another great song too with the late Freaky Tah on the solo. ""Get Up"" is another song to easily remember, and slightly changes the atmosphere on the album. Other dope tracks to check out are the title song, and ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless"".

This album is great for the '95/'96 era and can easily stack up to the many east coast hip hop albums that came out around that time. The album flows great, and I personally believe many fans will enjoy. The lyrics are definitely on point majority of the album. Peace.

A25NMMI7AH30W2,B000W18GBW,1,1,4.0,"This debut from New York's southside Jamica, Queens crew led by Mr. Cheeks has made boyz with their hustlin', partying, street grooves on Legal Drug Money.  With memerable, catchy hooks and freestyle rhymes the Lost Boyz had themselves an almost classic.  Their party, upbeat joints like ""Music Makes Me High"" and ""Get Up""  are what makes this such a hot commodity.  On the other end of the spectrum we have ""Renee"".  This is a song mourning over a death.  Besides, Mr. Cheeks uses the word love and keeps it raw and hardcore.  Member Freaky Tah also represented on here with Mr. Cheeks and with a solo song, ""1,2,3"".  Going back to their most obvious freestyle flow, listen to the two of them on ""All Right"".  A couple more upbeat tracks would have absolutely made this a classic."
A175TPTHMNS7S4,B000W18GBW,1,1,4.0,"In my mind, this CD is what east coast hip hop should sound like.  This album had an impact in that was summed up well by one reviewer that said: ""When this album dropped in '96, everybody's ears perked up a bit and heads turned.""  This was one of those albums that you could turn on and just zone out to.  Tracks like ""The Yearn"", ""Music Makes Me High"", and ""Get Up"" were sure to get any party started while cuts like ""Legal Drug Money"", ""All Right"", ""Straight From The Ghetto"", and ""1,2,3"" were equally effective tales of ghetto life.  Then you throw in classics tracks like ""Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz, & Benz"", ""Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless"", and ""Renee"" and you have as good a rap album as you're gonna find on the east coast.  Even the intro is hot without taking all day to get to the point.  This is easily the best album released by the Lost Boyz.  It seems that Mr Cheeks leads the charge while Freaky Tah picks up the slack.  Tah doesn't rhyme much, but he does manage to spit a few bars on ""Legal Drug Money"", ""The Yearn"", ""All Right"", and ""1,2,3"".  And when he's not rhyming, he's ad libbing in the background on most songs (don't front like I was the only one that was singing along with Tah in most of those songs).  There are a few shortcomings that keep this album from achieving classic status.  Freaky Tah has a very simplistic flow that can come off as boring from time to time (but not often).  Then there are tracks like ""Da Game"" and ""Is This The Part"" that could've been left off the album and no one would've missed it.  Aside from those mishaps, the rest of the album is flawless.  It's been 8 years since this album came out (damn, that was 8 years ago?!) and you can still zone out to it in 2004.  Overall, this album is near classic with party jams and street tales that are effective in their purposes.  This CD is definitely worth your money if you're considering buying it.
Standout Tracks: 1 2 3, Legal Drug Money, Straight From Da Ghetto (My Favorite), Renee, Jeeps Lex Coups Bimaz & Benz, & Get Up"
A10DNCYK7YISHU,B000W18GBW,1,1,5.0,"I consider LB as hiphop revolutionaries just like Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, etc...  They may not have had very complex lyrics but their simple lyrics carried a lot of knowledge.  They are AWAKE to the world especially with racism, depression, and violence... check out ""Renee"", ""Channel Zero"", ""Lifestyles of the rich and famous"" if you don't believe me....
Their lyrics are on point and the beats are real nice... some tracks almost have an ATCQ feel to them.  There's no guest appearances on here so you'll expect to hear Mr. Cheeks doing all the lyrics with Freaky Tah providing backround vocals.  But Tah gets his chance to shine on ""1, 2, 3"" and he's an OK lyricist not as good as Cheekz though...
This is a very good debut CD for any group to come out with.  It's such a dissapointment that LB had to end their carreer due to the tragic loss of Freaky Tah... R.I.P...  and I heard now the Mr. Cheeks's latest solo attempt songs aren't up to his usual potential and it's sad to see one of hiphop's best groups vanish...
Check out this CD...
I'm Out .... Mind Power!"
A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5.0,"On August 10, 2005 Lucinda Williams played at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh.  It was the last live concert that my wife and I saw together.  Lucinda was touring in support of ""Live @ the Fillmore"" & said she was writing songs for a new record.  As I recall, she played a new song she said she'd recently written, ""Everything Has Changed.""  I preordered Lucinda's ""West"" set while my wife was still here.  Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe.  Lucinda lost her mother; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me, they punctuate every breath I take.  I spin the CD & Lucinda's gentle aching voice comes on, ""Are you alight?""  When people ask me that, I want to say, ""He*l no!""  But when she sings, ""All of a sudden you went away; I hope you come back around someday; I haven't seen you in a real long time; Could you give me some kind of sign?  Are you alright?  ...Cause I've been feeling a little scared,"" it sounds like she's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love.  What an amazing song, ""Just tell me that you're okay.""  If this were the only song on the CD, it'd be worth it.

""Unsuffer Me"" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss.  Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it.  ""Anoint my head with your sweet kiss, my joy is dead; I long for bliss,"" she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone's electric guitar churns mercilessly.  Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity.  During my wife's last weeks, my daughter said to me, ""It's like watching a train wreck; you can't look away.""  There something of that strength that comes through in Williams' music.

Other cuts are also amazing.  ""Learning How to Live"" is a breakup song, adjusting to loss.  ""Fancy Funeral"" may sound a bit bizarre, but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed.  The sheer force of Lucinda's anger in ""Come On"" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed-breakup song, ""Dude, you're so fired; shut up, I'm not inspired.""  ""Words"" has Lucinda's voice, weathered, worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best, writing a good song.

Yes, Lucinda has an amazing catalog of recordings from ""Happy Woman Blues"" to the self-titled record to Car Wheels & World Without Tears.  ""West"" takes a well deserved place at the table as one of her most compelling, moving works.  Bravo!"
A2JDIX1X3JH8S8,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5.0,This is an engaging compilation of soulful/lustfull/ plaintive songs...great atmospheric acoustics...vision and poetry.....contrary to Rolling Stone's Robert Christgau's review which takes issue with producer Hal Willner---this is a fully accomplished cd and stands as the great soul companion to Essence...which really was her best.....
AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5.0,"This is an album about loss and survival. It's darker than some of Lucinda's other releases. It may not be for all Williams fans; it certainly is very different and more experimental than her last three albums. If you're uncertain about it the first time, give it a couple of other spins--it'll grow on you. The depth of emotion and Lucinda's raw vocals (meaning they weren't re-recorded--producer Hal Wilner used the demo vocal tracks as he loved the emotion in the performances) give this album an extra kick. I've seen some mixed reviews from fans here--I suspect this is an album that fans will probably come back to later and realize how good it is.

Clearly under the influence of later Dylan (perhaps ""Time Out of Mind""), the album features a nice mixture of midtempo numbers and killer ballads. Williams' voice which aches with longing and bitterness in many of these songs continues to be one of her strengths in addition to her top notch songwriting. She strikes reminds me somewhat of John Hiatt. ""Words"" has one of the sweetest melodies Williams has come up with the opening line sums up much of this album--""I would rather suffer in sweet silent solitude"". She may feel like she's in solitude but these moving, observant songs open up a world to music fans everywhere.

The music clips might be a bit deceptive. This is a moody, atmospheric album (even more so than her previous efforts). It also sounds even more personal than usual. The musicians that provide backing on the album including vets such as Jim Keltner give the album a distinctive sound. Producer Hal Willner does a great job of capturing the rich, distinctive qualities of Williams' voice.

This is one of Williams' finest albums holding its own with ""Lucinda Williams"", ""Sweet Old World"" and ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". Be aware, however, if you are a Williams fan that this is probably one of her more experimental albums and one of her most moody, atmospheric productions yet. Kudos to Hal Willner who convinced Williams to keep many of her raw, demo vocals for the album. What they may lack in polish they make up for in emotion.

BestBuy is currently offering an edition with a second disc featuring two demos for tracks on the main album. ""Where Is My Love"" and ""Rescue"" (both terrific songs). Personally, I'd love to hear some acoustic demos or performances of some of these songs vs. electric demos but that's me. Pick it up today!"
A26TWY9AD935HC,B000W1AO4Y,1,1,5.0,"Lucinda Williams has made a career out of doing things her way.  Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be.  With the success of CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD, that relentless fight finally paid dividends as the commerce finally caught up with her art.  Rather than repeating CAR WHEELS formula over and over, Lucinda left behind the Southern travel logs and delved into more emotional material.  The songs on ESSENCE and WORLD WITHOUT TEARS not only dug into the deeper depths of her psyche, but also loosened up musically, mixing more rock and hard blues into her Americana palette.  WEST seems like a logical extension of the two previous albums emotionally, while moving into new territory musically.

Produced by veteran Hal Willner, WEST takes a quantum leap from her previous releases by taking arrangements far beyond where her previous music went.  Saving the vocals and guitar from demos, the songs are built up layer by layer with strings and keyboards and various session players including Jim Keltner and Bill Frisell to create music quite different from her past efforts.  The good news is that the production is not camouflage for weak material.  Williams has delivered a solid set of tunes, at times harrowing, as she pokes at he emotional scabs of broken relationships and the death of her mother.  I can see how this material will put some off, when they are looking for material closer to CAR WHEELS regional sketches.  Still, you cannot deny the solid songwriting on songs like WHERE IS MY LOVE, WORDS (a ode to her poetic muse) and ARE YOU ALRIGHT?  Other songs like UNSUFFER ME, RESCUE and the talking blues/rap of WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT move into new territory, to my ears at least, with great success.

I'm glad that there are artists like Lucinda Williams who choose to challenge themselves and their fans with each new output of work.  Those that take the ride with WEST will be rewarded with a CD of solid songs and performances that rank with the best of Lucinda's previous work.  WEST seems to me to be the end of a trilogy of work that includes her post CAR WHEELS work.  If you're not a big fan of the previous two albums, you'll more than likely be disappointed with this new one.  In that case there is always the back catalog to enjoy.  I'll be interested to see what new directions she chooses in the future, and will no doubt, continue to enjoy this CD for years to come."
A2LE835K9ID9OH,B000W1M500,1,1,5.0,"My son did a school project to this song four years ago.  He made a PowerPoint presentation with various pictures and he did a great job on it.  After his sudden death in 2010, I came across this presentation on his cell phone with him laying on his bed singing this song with the original song playing in the background.  Priceless!"
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000W1MCCQ,1,1,4.0,"December 29th, 2009 (1:04 AM)

A beautiful mid-tempo from Miss India. Arie. This is definitely in my top 2 favorite songs by her. In fact, if you were to ask me what song is better than this one from her first two albums and a few of the tracks from her third, I'd say this one takes the cake.

It just doesn't get more contemporary soul-ish than this. The runs and the deep notes are so amazing on this track. And it means that much more when you actually know like all the lyrics to the song!

Other songs with meaning recommended (all by India):

Nature (Acoustic Soul)
Slow Down (the remaining three are from her second album, Voyage To India)
Little Things &
The Truth.

(Can't help it I'm a Biblical Major at heart) Not to crazy about the video but this song is somber, real, heartfelt, and actually uplifting. Recommend."
A3FSR7WRSEJSSB,B000W1MCQW,1,1,5.0,I first heard this song when my 16 year old son was playing it mixed in with his thrash metal bands. It caught my ear and I loved it. Then I heard the lyrics and loved it even more. A very good Christian song.
A26SYWPO0N46R,B000W1MCQW,1,1,4.0,"This song by Cash is different, haunting as if a premonition.  Cash had the voice for songs like this, and he put that voice to worthy use later on during his career.  Some people may not like the song, but I do."

My wife and I had just got promotions and we listened to the CD to remind us to enjoy life and not get too wrapped up in our careers. I cant find the CD now but I wanted to own the song again. Were both retired now and weve been dealing with some heavy duty health issues. Now more than ever we need to be reminded just how precious and short life is.

A171B3B9Y3SZ3E,B000W1MDPW,1,1,5.0,"I was pleased with this product because I recieved it for free after purchasing a CD from amazon. I love how we are able to recieve free mp3 songs when we buy CDs because there are some albums that are not all that great except for one song. This service comes in handy because I am able to buy that one song I absolutely love, which is this song."
A3VATUIL0LYMSZ,B000W1MDPW,1,1,5.0,Do I have this? Love the song. Fan of hers. (this is where I start the required babbling - just to fill up the spaces)

A33MSGR68V0TJ0,B000W1MDPW,1,1,4.0,I hope You Dance is a wonderful song with a special message.  Lee Ann Womack applies her heart to this song.  I would love this song being available by Gladys Knight.
A1X8W0ESL3BH54,B000W1O23I,1,1,4.0,I like this song. Heavy D was the type of rapper one could listen to in front of your mother. He is missed.
AQXT1UD6U6QCG,B000W1O23I,1,1,5.0,"Heavy D has always been one of my favorite ole skool entertainers. He wasn't just a rapper he entertained his audience. There will never be another like him. ""Somebody for Me."" was my favorite. It took me back in time when the fells just hung out and jammed this cut. Thanks for the memories Heavy!!!!!!!

  Kevin J."
ACWD9XZ6I6NB8,B000W1O23I,1,1,5.0,So sad that he had to leave us so early. He was definitely a hitmaker and this one was a great hit. Love it!
A3KKJLBSC1R7Y2,B000W1O23I,1,1,5.0,He was a True artist...i grew up with the man! this was hip hop and r/b at its best! RIP!
A2LF7JP80LQG2J,B000W1O23I,1,1,5.0,Now that we found love is my favortie song on this album.  Check it out. I give it five stars.
A2WDA5X643S67J,B000W1Q010,1,1,5.0,Great song
A3GUICSN92RH42,B000W1Q010,-1,-1,1.0,This would have been a GREAT song if this idiot didn't overstep the bounds of decency and have the unmitigated GALL to mention the name of Jesus in this song in such a horrible manner. This was completely unnecessary and completely ruins what would otherwise be a really hot song. Makes you wonder why someone talented enough to record this can be so callus and stupid as to WAY overstep the bounds of decency.
A2NUXRHIDXD0VO,B000W1Q010,1,1,4.0,"Generally speaking, I have an extremely low opinion of the entire rap genera, but a small few pieces I give exception to. This is one of those works. ""My Dick"" is nothing but pure crass comic genius. It doesn't sample the tracks of songs far greater than it, it doesn't labor to spin some BS thug life fable, nor does it try to be anything other than what it is. What it acomplishes is laying down old school rap with only one concern; busting out awesome rhymes, and doing so in fantastic comedic fashion. The only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is my aforementioned bias against rap in general."
AN2OQO25R328V,B000W1QXT4,1,1,5.0,"I love finding old school songs.  That was real music back in the day. I had most of the Chaka Chan songs, so I was glad to find the songs I was missing."
A1E220U86IS7Y8,B000W1QXT4,1,1,5.0,Chaka Khan is simply amazing. Her vocals are so beautiful & strong. This is my jam. You can't go wrong with this song!!
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000W1QXT4,1,1,4.0,"It's a slow groove in which Chaka coos and soars a bit towards the end. Everlasting Love by Rufus and Chaka Khan is an instant R&B classic. It oozes love and provides you with a great musical experience.

Prepare to put it on repeat if you like old-school R&B.

4.5 stars."

AB6O8EM172B74,B000W1QVYG,1,1,5.0,"As a guy who has been hurt by women (as we all have been!) - this song turns out to be a terrific release of some of the frustration and anger which a man may feel as a result of having been hurt, dumped, or somehow otherwise 'offended' by a member of the 'fairer' sex.

The lead singer, a man called Graham Bonnet, does an awesome job of getting the message, and 'feeling,' behind the Title (and lyrics) out to the listener.

The video inspired me to purchase this song, and, although my mood is not always angry, spiteful, or vengeful - I am usually able, upon 'demand,' to 'conjure up' the proper memories and female related pain and torment to completely, and thoroughly, enjoy this classic British rock song from the late 1970's!

You can't literally give 110% in anything that you do - the numbers will simply not allow it.  But (and you need to watch the video to fully understand appreciate where I am coming from here) in this case, with this song, and in this video, 110% is, in fact, given.

Rock on!"
A17KVY5ZWRWQ3R,B000W1QVYG,-1,1,5.0,This is the better of the 2 songs by this name that there is.

A2BH945DHGH5J7,B000W168T4,1,1,5.0,"I purchased this track as an MP3, and it seems to work well in either the Amazon Cloudplayer or the Windows Media Player.
In my opinion this is an AWESOME track!!!.  I would recommend this track to any fan of Classic Rock Music!!!."
AVP1NL6GYMVR,B000W168T4,1,1,5.0,"If you are a fan of 80's pop... Level 42 is definitely a group that warrants an add to your collection.  I had forgotten about this song until I was walking through a grocery store and heard it on the audio system in the store.  It brought back many memories.  To me, this music is what I call ""happy music"" as it seems to bring back only happy memories.  Level 42 has a unique sound that, to my knowledge, has not been successfully duplicated by any other group.  Must have."
A1Q8TMHHMPQHO9,B000W1MEEC,1,1,5.0,"Lovely music!

This beautiful album was RECORDED on September 16 and 17 (not originally released as the data on the amazon claimed at the time I wrote this review)- Kenny Burrell, a True giant of mainstream and moderately modern jazz guitar really shines here in the illustrious company of Richard Davis on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.

Some of the songs are really swinging, some are beautifully sad, some are pretty darn modern, but the general feeling of the album would be - in my interpretation - warm. The cozy tone of the leader's guitar really enriches his fanciful solo flights as well as the numbers where the rest of the trio has a larger role.

Initially issued on LP in 1960, the album was re-released in 1966 under the title ""Man at Work"", with really beautiful photo by Don Brownstein reproduced inside the CD's package (the cover photo of Burrell, taken from the original edition, is by Chuck Stewart). Actually, my only problem with this lovely CD is that the original liner notes - printed twice, are too small even for a reasonably young fellow with a normal eye-sight... Keeping the cover art was smart, but the backside of LP is not visually interesting enough to compensate for too small letters.

If you like jazz-guitar or mainstream jazz, you should get this album, to hear fresh and convincing versions of various standards (f. i. Ellington-Strayhorn's ""Just a sittin' and a-rockin'"", Monk's ""Well, You Needn't"") as well as some less often performed songs."

It wasn't until I finally listened 2 the words that I thought WOW this is a very powerful song, not just 4 dancing, but it makes u listen, really listen."
ARYVQL4N737A1,B000W1S6L2,1,1,5.0,"This is a great song by Alicia Meyers, who is going solo on this one without her group One Way. Alicia's other solo single, ""If You Play Your Cards Right"", is another favorite at get-togethers too :) A great song by a often overlooked, talented singer!"

Then I recall a trip back from San Francisco? Then when I drove my chopper up to Canada for a vacation. It brings back a flood of memories, that's why I like it."
A2W4LX7D3GPIXH,B000W1QYBG,1,1,5.0,"SteppenWolf. the bands name came from a book written by Herman Hess, All about joining in the dance of life no matter how young or old you are. There's joy in letting yourself get loose. Anyway Steppenwolf was a great band from those fantastic 60's. And there were a lot of pusher around selling their posion candy all for the evil dollar. Great song, recommend listening to it."

Listening to this song made me remember old friends I haven't seen in years. And of a time when certain family members were still around. And old flames and crushes when my heart thought it 'knew' what was real. Hehehe.
 At the same time, this song's message still rings True...""brown"" eyes can get your heart thumpin' too. ;)"

AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000W1M56O,1,1,5.0,"I didn't know much about the band The Killers, but when I heard this song I had to download it. I viewed the music video on YouTube, no only is the song great; but the video ROX. This is one band I was skeptical about until I heard their music. I would recommend this song to anyone, regardless what your music preference is :).

A2LBHVGMUK36CF,B000W1T2TW,1,1,4.0,Subdivisions is one of my all time favorite Rush songs! If I could find this CD locally I would buy it.
A146R8D7UBEFKQ,B000W1T2TW,1,1,5.0,"A masterpiece. Everything is perfect. You can hear this song 500 times and still be moved. Lyrics, musicianship, melody....all the great things about Rush in 5 minutes."
AORSH1CU6IPHC,B000W1T2TW,-1,-1,1.0,"I have analyzed the Rush track ""Subdivisions"" with digital audio workstation software and have determined that this version has been altered from its original sound.  Hold on to your original ""Signals"" CD for the best sound!"

A2PKE927BIZXBO,B000W1T2TC,1,1,5.0,"Rush is a very sophisticated band. But to me this is their version of a ""Big Dumb Party Rock Song"". Rush is more of a Progressive Rock Band. It's a awesome tune."

A3V3U4YXPIUSLY,B000W1T2TW,1,1,5.0,"Didn't hear much Rush in there early years but a service buddy loved them. We'd argue over who was better, Rush or the Police. I do like Rush more after 2112."
A3PI6O5RQF35OA,B000W1SRR0,1,1,4.0,"When I heard that this song was done by the Cardigans' lead singer, I just had to download it. ""Lovefool"" brings back a lot of memories, because it was really popular in my early high school days and my friends and I used to sing it all the time to annoy each other (although I loved it). Nina's solo effort is quite good, and it is clear that she can sing well on her own, although she occasionally sounds a little nasally. The lyrics are quite thought provoking for a pop song. I hope Nina keeps performing."
A32T2H8150OJLU,B000W1SRR0,1,1,5.0,"Nina Persson's ""Black Winged Bird"" is lilting and soothing, romantic and bordering on melancholy.  The relaxing flow of this song makes it inherently listenable as foreground or background music.

I particularly like the fact that the song relies on Nina's vocal talents and not on overdone electronica or instrumental overkill.  The strings and other back-up instruments that complement Persson's voice are spot on.

While this song may not have the pop appeal or driving force it usually takes to gain major recognition, I've had this track on my iPod's playlist ever since it was made available at Amazon.com.

This song isn't what I'd cal mainstream country, folk, or even pop, but is an intruiging mixture of those genres.  I don't really like country that well, but I LIKE this song.

Thanks for a nice track Nina and Amazon!

5 stars!"
ADJN47U9ADUK2,B000W1T2TM,1,1,5.0,The Illuminati is stealing artwork. They're stealing history. RUSH knows all about the aliens too. And you should too. Did you know that we live in a huge universe. Earth is a little over zero percent of what makes up our universe. Maybe less! The space invasion is being prophecied about. Rush could save your lives. Or maybe we're all doomed anyway.

A17PH3CJW86JL1,B000W1TJC2,1,1,5.0,I enjoyed Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66 while growing up. I loved hearing the song on the radio. I found myself humming to it a lot. I decided to order it and it still sounds good. Brings back old memories.

A5P7STTZE2MJV,B000W1UAMA,1,1,5.0,This is old school Mary J and Dr Dre. This song is a throw back to the early 90's but well worth adding it to the rotation. It has a nice edgy dance beat to it that is definitely all Dr Dre.

Great song. You will like it too.."
AWQ0342H9RASL,B000W1T29C,1,1,5.0,"I first heard this song in high school...many,many, years ago, and it really was to me the anthem of hard rock. It was fast, heavy, and loud. I had those kick ass sounding old school Craig headphones with that kick ass bass and treble. Sammy Hagar had a voice of the hard rock bands and only Sammy could hit the pinnacle with ""There's Only One Way To Rock"" to become Rocks best! Crank up the drums, crank out the bass, crank up my Les Paul in your face! There is only one way to rock and Sammy Hagar is the way."
A1W7268RRFD3DJ,B000W1TKEY,1,1,5.0,chaka khan is such a great singer. love her music - past and present. she still has it going on.

AW9U0ST9IR7W2,B000W1TKEY,1,1,5.0,great - wish you could make your own samplers with individual songs - would be cheaper than buying individual songs  or buying an album for only one or two songs
A2MC6P200KHJ2A,B000W1TKEY,1,1,4.0,Pretty good!
A2IHB3M0ZIKNOZ,B000W1TKEY,1,1,5.0,"What happens when one of the greatest composers of R&B/Funk discovers a woman who would go on to become one of the greatest singers of R&B/Funk is Tell Me Something Good. Stevie Wonder was deep into his Funk classics like You Haven't Done Nothin' and Boogie On Reggae Woman when he first heard Chaka Khan & Rufus and the word is, virtually on-the-spot, wrote Tell Me Something Good for her. It's one of his best songs, one of her best songs and one of the best early 70's songs, period.

It's stripped down, too, right to the essentials. It doesn't have the multiple rhythms of a typical Wonder song of the time, it doesn't have the elaborate vocals of Earth, wind & Fire or Kool & the Gang, or the smooth horn section of the Ohio Players. But it doesn't need all that because it has Chaka Khan singing her heart out. This song tore up the airwaves in 1974 and is just as good today."
ANYY7Z3R1LAUN,B000W1TKEY,1,1,5.0,Come on......I can NOT sit still when this song comes on! It gets my groove thing going and just what I need to get motivated in the kitchen!

A1AOQA6MY9FMB9,B000W1T29M,-1,1,5.0,"This song is the best description that I know of, of the heavy metal mindset, and a metal concert. I originally heard it on the Heavy Metal soundtrack. It's easier to understand Sammy on this version. The very end of the song does not have the swoosh/jet plane soundtrack sound effect."
A2FG0XM7UQSKUV,B000W1T29M,1,1,5.0,This is the song that everyone needs to have in thier collection. Who don't like Sammy! Easy to listen to.
AV1S53AGJEEF4,B000W1T29M,1,1,5.0,"Sammy Hagar sounded best when he was solo. (Not with Vanhagar) Back in the early 80's ,he was king of the road. The movie is a trip in itself and we'll never see another old school animated movie like that again. After waiting decades for the legit home video, it was worth the wait. Awesome soundtrack which also included Black Sabbath and Devo."
A8IFUOL8S9BZC,B000W1TJBI,-1,-1,2.0,"2 1/2

It was nice to see SY expanded their limitedly frenzied vocabulary a little further with some experimenting, but the sum still equals a mighty uneven album with very few songs that will end up standing the test of time."
A3EUXTG2UR21BB,B000W1VES4,1,1,5.0,"Nice to have my childhood song available as a crisp digital version.
Sure beats a scratchy records or wore out cassette tape sound."
A3SI83LHXQCVS2,B000W1TJBI,1,1,4.0,"And I don't really see why. Longtime fans call it their poppiest, and while it's definitely the mellowest, that doesn't mean that it's not noisy or self-indulgent for the mainstream. While the lyrics don't mean all that much, it adds up the eccentricness of the album, making it more fun with each listen. About the only other flaw with this album is that Lee Ranaldo doesn't sing on any tracks on this album.
""Bull in the Heather"" is a classic, as is its video with that Le Tigre girl cameoed in it. Kim has an excellent voice on it, as well as it being loved among the fans. The outro part sounds real cool.
Opener ""Winner's Blues"" is a real nice track, as it's an acoustic-like track, a brilliant track on this album.
I just love ""In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader"". It's a punk-like track here, probably the fastest one, and Thurston sounds as if he's having a lot of fun during the recording of it. Then it goes into ""Sweet Shine"" the only song with any real length on the album. It's a great love song.
She has some pretty interesting tracks as well. Her style overall has a sexy sound to it. ""Bone"" is very awesome, I love the energy of the drums on it, then the chords are well-progressed. It's just a real memorable one on this album. She sings 7 of the 14 songs.
'Experiental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' is something that really shines on track 12 ""Tokyo Eye"", a very noisy song. It's very awesome to listen to either in the car or on your stereo.
This one's good for introducing people to SY. I got this January of this year, and I think it's excellent. There are some flaws, but overall, I think it's pretty good. The songs are very short, which helps, 'cuz it doesn't really contain enough epic stuff. So yeah, I am recommending it here. Esp. if you don't like the mainstream much and think that this sounds cool, like I do."

A3PNHS2QSEEQ4X,B000W1VFA6,1,1,4.0,"I really enjoy this traditional rock song from the 60s band, Steppenwolf.  Listening to it helps me to reminisce about that musical era, as you listen to the upbeat rock rhythm, and the electric synthesizers melt it into a dreamlike sound."
A6375070JH5V9,B000W1TJBI,1,1,5.0,This is probable the greatest Sonic album....it has the classic cosmo-grunge guitars that characterizes it and excellent songs.....the weird thing about this album is that it's a 3-4 minutes average album.....instead their past albums had 18 minutes songs....(a totally electric orgasm)and even a 34 minute song at the end of Day Dream Nation......this is the kinda album that could get these guys on top of the mainstream....but they kept away from those pendejadas.....really cool album.....buy it before the world ends.......

A35PBET6ASHY7J,B000W1UXZO,1,1,5.0,I can appreciate music from this era... not like music today. You really do have to choose carefully. Definitely deserves high rating and highly recommended. Can't get enough of this music.
A1ANRKHR4QWXJU,B000W1UOTY,1,-1,3.0,"This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto."
A5LWPQ0QOMJUJ,B000W1W8UW,1,1,5.0,"good beat

Great song. You will like it too.."
AS02LU5CR8VJP,B000W1W8UW,1,1,5.0,"This is the radio version of this song that I was looking for. This is the version I remember and wanted to buy and that is exactly what I got. This is not a live version, it is a studio recording most commonly heard. I have never had a problem with sound quality when buying from Amazon. I bought this MP3 a while ago but it needed to be reviewed because it is that cool. This is the version by Mary J. Blige (as stated) and is the remake of the Rose Royce version."

A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B000W1SB94,1,1,5.0,"PJ Harvey's debut album is raw, quiet, and gutsy. I guess you would call this an indie album, very subtle and low-key in production quality. Some great songs here, some of my all-time favorites are Happy and Bleeding, ""Hour of season, happy and bleeding, long over-due too early and it's late too."" Sheena-la-gig (hope I spelled it right!) is one catchy and fun song, ""Look at these my childbearing hips, look at these my ruby red ruby lips..."" Oh My Lover is a classic, ""You can love her and you can love me at the same time."" Plants and Rags, a gorgeous ballad, ""Dreamt of man, he fed me fine food he gave me shiny things."" Fountain is another standout, ""On my hill I wait for wind..."" The rest of the tracks are fabulous as well. Dry is the perfect album if you want a strong female singer and talented songwriter all in one, buy this hidden masterpiece!"
A37ZKZP74PYAVY,B000W1SB94,1,1,5.0,"""Dry"" is P.J. Harvey's debut album, released in 1992 it was a critical success while it did modest on the commercial side of things. Harvey was a breath of fresh air to the industry and was that generation's Patti Smith. Her mixture of pounding riffs and raw vocals created one superb album, the multi-talented Harvey wasn't content with just singing she had to co-produce the album, play guitars and violin, and write all but two of the tracks (those two she co-wrote). There are standouts but the album is overall a solid effort and flows well.

The album starts with the simplistic ""Oh My Lover"", the track is simple yet effective and isn't an all-out assault on the ears. I really like the starkness in P.J.'s voice.
""O Stella"" seems a bit like a reprise of the previous track, though I do like this song better, it's shorter and does more musically, but that doesn't mean I hate ""Oh My Lover"".

Next up is ""Dress"", I like the repitition in the lyrics and the double bass part which is played to perfection. The song has a very syncopated feel, even though at times an irregular feel.
""Victory"" is another great track with a nice echo section in it and some nice guitar parts. The bass is great, the drums are probably stronger than ever since the start of the album.

""Happy And Bleeding"" sounded like it had elements of country and folk in it upon first listen and I still can hear little elements of it, though not as much now, it's another great track though a bit of variation in the riffs would've be nice.
""Sheela-Na-Gig"" is one of the best songs on the album and the most successfull single off the album, the structure of the song is perfect, especially the 'I'm gonna wash that man right of my hair...' bit. I like the chorus, it's really catchy.

""Hair"" keeps the same formula that has made the album what it is and doesn't interrupt the flow at all. All the basic things are here, good lyrics, catchy hooks and superb instrumenation.
""Joe"" is another short track that is set at a very fast tempo, it seems to be gone and over really quick. It's still a nice track though.

""Plants And Rags"" is the best song on the album and seems a bit out of place on the album, I love the way the strings are used and written. This song is without a doubt the most emotional album on the album and P.J. proves her voice's potential well on this track.

""Fountain"" starts off incredibly lo-fi and then breaks into the signature sound of the album. I like the contrast and how it makes the song a bit segmented. ""Water"" has been described as the 'lightest' track off the album, although it does seem a bit light, it still has that punch about it. Great vocals by P.J. again.

Overall, ""Dry"" is special, it retains it's rock-alternative sound while still displaying emotion and beauty. The two best tracks would have to be ""Plants And Rags"" & ""Sheela-Na-Gig"", simply because they well, standout. This album though is incredibly solid throughout and flows nicely making this an irresistable album by a True musical genius."
A39LMJKTAZ3NNH,B000W1XIWO,1,1,5.0,Awesome.
A3FS34ETBO665M,B000W1XIWO,1,1,5.0,This song always reminds me of Star Trek. The year is 1968 and the model of the Enterprise is on the market. Spanky and Our Gang is on the Radio. A pleasant sound in a tumultuous time.
A3IRAA9JD6HBO1,B000W1XIWO,1,1,5.0,A great old song with a wonderful sentiment.
AXA2ZO7Q33VCO,B000W1XIWO,1,1,4.0,An old favorite.  I love it.

A3ES4ZGTF6JI85,B000W1XIWO,1,1,5.0,"Songs from them just take me back to simpler, slow paced times. On this particular song, I really like the ending where there are multiple layers of vocals going on simultaneously. Timeless!"
A1KM5TIQL9MFJM,B000W1XJT6,1,1,5.0,"Their best effort, in my opinion.  If you only buy one Rainbow album make it Rising.  This one shows the band at their peak."
A5889INEGKCQY,B000W1SB94,-1,-1,3.0,"In 1992 P.J. Harvey released her debut LP. The Album Dry was released on an indie label and the budget was just around 5 thousand dollars. Often proclaimed to be one of females rawest and toughest albums this album took me as a suprise it is nowhere near the desription I read. Dry may be perhaps PJ.
Less accesible efforts along with Is This Desire however it is an aquired taste and of course what kind of music you listen to. Less heavy and hard rocking and agressive as it's follow-up Rid Of Me. Dry has 7 fantastic songs Oh Stella, Victory, Happy And Bleeding, Sheela - Na - Gig, Hair, Plants and Rass and Water but the 4 other tracks are so forgettable. And also do to poor production the album which was obviously recorded in mono does not deliver the goods that it is supposed to deliver. It is sometimes disturbing and heavy but it doesn't exactly kick your butt because it is so hidden. It also laks in great hooks and brilliant guitar riffs like her other albums.
However PJ. Harvey's Dry has indeed something special about it and lyrically it is very good much better then Rid Of Me but musically it is less compelling and challenging then any of her other albums but it is her debut and if this had only included these 7 songs it would have been an artistic triumph and something that polly jean would be proud of all her life."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B000W1W96K,1,1,5.0,"Yes I Agree this is Shameless Promotion of Material that's Been Put Out SO Many Times.but for the New Listener this is a Great Introduction.

AUQ1XKCEHD7J8,B000W1XHGG,1,1,5.0,"Rush Fans will tell you, ""They are better to go see than to listen to.""  I've been present for Rush Performances five times between 1977 and 1981.  I agree with that assessment.  I was deaf in my right Ear for six months due to a welding accident and went to Saginaw, Michigan to see Rush at the end of their Hemispheres Tour that winter.  The Rockets were the Backup Band that night.  Near the end of the show I moved from the floor up to the back center position to get the best sound.  My Ear broke open and drained out and I could here with both ears again.  I was ecstatic.  This composition was one that I could hear properly.  I love it.  They introduced Free Will, Jacob's Ladder, and The Spirit Of Radio after a final Curtain Call.  Sorry to go on so long but I also seem to remember Mr. Lee saying as the Show began, ""We're going to do everything tonight"", which may be what happened?  These Guys are Top Notch Entertainers.  Oh yeah; I had to wait for more than six months to finally get, Permanent Wave.  My Friends were sick of my promotions of Them by then.  Listen to this without distraction or better yet, go see Rush for yourself."

A32XSKO7TOI0BH,B000W1W96K,1,1,5.0,"As a teenager i absolutely loved  Motown. I bought every Motown 45 that I could get my hands on sight unseen. There isn't a Motown artist who I don't like. However, of all of the Detroit stars there is one that was my favourite from the get-go. Come and Get These Memories was my introduction to Martha and the Vandellas (and make no mistake the Vandellas were an integral component of the sound). For about six years I waited with anticipation the next Martha release. I have listened to these songs so often that I know every word to every song.

This is a great collection. Every song is a killer. It is a five star collection. BUT, there are many excellent Martha songs not included. Where's Livewire, In My Lonely Room, Wild One? There are others equally deserving that have been omitted. So, as good as this compilation is, it is far from perfect. You don't need to be a completist in order to regret the omissions. If you are looking for a Martha collection go further - there are numerous other collections that contain more. Notwithstanding my reservations I cannot give any Martha CD anything but five stars."

Oh well they can't take the music away!  :)"
A1TGCU5CZF9LKA,B000W1W96K,1,1,5.0,"I'm a big Motown fan, and I figured it was time to add some Martha Reeves to my collection. I heard her through an old 'Best of Motown' CD that I bought years ago, and I loved them. So, I felt it was only necessary to add them to my collection.

This one, 1999's '20th Century Masters' is the way to go if your new to this wonderful trio. 'Dancing In The Street,' of course, is their biggest hit. That was actually the song on my old Motown CD, but I liked it a lot. Other highlights for me are 'Jimmy Mack,' 'Heat Wave,' and 'Quicksand.'

So, if you want some more great Motown to add to your collection, don't pass The Vandellas by. They are simply too good to ignore. Highly, highly recommend. Plus, as always, the sound quality is excellent.

Enjoy this one!!!"
AZ4FKZXXNULDR,B000W1W96K,-1,1,5.0,"I love the music of MARTHA REEVES and the VANDELLAS. This is why I ask where did this version of JIMMY MACK come from? Don't get me wrong, it was nice, but not the one that I grew up with. This
brings me to another question: WHO DECIDES WHAT A GREATEST HITS
CD IS? You buy the cd supposedly with all the hits from your favorite artist but whomever compiled the cd put a different version of one of the jams on the cd. OR, there is an impressive list of hits on the cd but one or a few of the hits are missing?
Maybe the answer is that all of the GREATEST HITS will not be on
the disc unless the cd says ANTHOLOGY or THE COMPLETE... Still,
what indicates that a version of the love song that YOU grew up
with ain't on the disc?"
A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000W1W96K,1,1,4.0,"After Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown's biggest female stars.  But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition.  Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session.  The song, ""I'll Have to Let Him Go,"" which is not included in this collection, was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas.  The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes, although the lineup changed over the years; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites, Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese).  The group's second single ""Come and Get These Memories"" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way.  Other Top 5 hits included ""Dancing in the Street,"" """"Nowhere to Run,"" ""Jimmy Mack,"" ""I'm Ready for Love,"" ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,"" and ""Honey Chile.""  These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968, when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip.  The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown, Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 1995.  This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group's hits, but is limited to only 11 cuts.  Consequently, while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy."

But they managed to consistently crank out top 40 hits for about 5-7 years.  They had a number of personnel changes but still managed to stay consistant.  Very good tune."

This is another classic that time forgot about, and now is available in digital format. Catchy tune, and good lyrics.

Its important to introduce the newer generation to the previous generations music, that is what keeps the memories alive and opens up their minds to other genres of music rather then the radio kill they play today.

This is one of those songs to introduce them to!"
A1TKJ3L7FMZ01Y,B000W20FY2,1,1,4.0,"The first time you heard ""While You See a Chance"" in the early 80's you hear these luscious arranged keyboard sounds, and it welcomes the 80's decade with a up tempo keyboard solo, then you hear the voice and you say to yourself ""Isn't that Steve Winwood? The same guy who played organ in the Spencer Davis Group?""  You automatically get a road map of Winwood's new 80's direction.  It's a direction of synthesizers dominating his sounds, and soloing with unique keyboard phrases that defines this era of his career.  Arc Of A Diver is the beginning of  Winwood where he redefines himself.  The album's mix is below par.  The instrumentations that are put together also fail to adhered some kinda of unity, but this is excused because Steve Winwood played all the instruments.  Winwood also engineered and mixed the whole album.  In my opinion when it comes to artists that play all their instruments on their albums I put Arc Of A Diver in the top 5.  Their are some good uptempo danceable songs like ""Second Hand Women"", and ""Night Train.""  ""Slowdown Sundown"" is more classic Winwood ballad.  You can hear the organ, but their is also a beautiful multimoog solo.  Their are only seven tracks on this album, and a important album in Steve Winwoods career.  The album is only 40 minutes long, but enjoyable!"
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B000W20FY2,1,1,5.0,"Now I have a feeling that following the disappointing reception of his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steve-Winwood/dp/B001GHSFMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steve Winwood</a>&nbsp;three years earlier that some refinements had to be made in order for Winwood to become as commercially successful as he was creatively so. One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic/harmonic instincts he might've developed during his Traffic period. Also he might've also had the sense that,although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi,that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall. And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings. The result was this album-one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist.

  ""While You See A Chance"" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for. With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction? This is essentially an electronic/new wave re-imagining of the uptempo gospel/soul he started doing from the outset. The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder-like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number. ""Second Hand Human"" is a hugely melodic,chiming synthesizer heavy pop/pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album. Starting off as a melodic,folksy ballad ""Slowdown Sundown"" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains. ""Spanish Dancer"" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody. ""Night Train"" is a sleekly electronic jazz/funk jam while the dynamic ballad ""Dust concludes the album.

  To my way of thinking? Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose. Winwood didn't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out. He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco/new wave synthesizer touches. And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive. He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them. I include Prince and Stevie Wonder in with that too. Although this album does have its detractors for that very reason among some of the less tolerant followers of the ""keeping it real"" music critic brigade? It would be very difficult to debate how much this album successfully extended on what was started on Winwood's commercially failed debut album and actually began an entirely new and fruitful career for him as a solo artist with a lot to say."
A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B000W20FY2,1,1,5.0,"Amazing what you can do when your back's against the wall!  It is said that Winwood was seriously considering giving up on his musical career and this album was his last throw of the dice; what a throw!  The sparse instrumentation as compared with his group work plus the signature synthesizer which I personally like and think gives the album a unique sound allows for Steve to showcase his best talent i.e. his remarkable tone in his vocals without the rest of a band to distract from it and he bares his soul here with meaningful lyrics told by a master storyteller.  I enjoyed every track which are all consistently strong making this come in a close second to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-in-High-Life/dp/B00599UE1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back in High Life</a>as his best ever album.  This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release is pretty good and although the design and assembly is not among the best that I've seen it is good enough coming with a very good inner sleeve and a foldout containing all the lyrics in Japanese only.  Overall this will please both the mlps collector as well as other fans as the sound quality has been remastered very well too.

Good enough mlps design, good sound quality and excellent tracks makes this an easy review.

Recommended!"
AFSBKKDFLZZX5,B000W20FY2,1,1,5.0,"Although this early 1980s Winwood release has been overshadowed by some of Winwood's better known albums from later in that decade, this is still a great album.

I actually prefer Arc Of A Diver to some of Winwood later work, like Roll With It, which is better known and was more commercially successful. This is a really good album. Those reviewers who are trashing it should give it another listen."
A3464G00K8ZYD1,B000W20FY2,1,1,5.0,"ARC OF A DIVER is Steve Winwood's masterpiece. Many of the songs cut a lot deeper than their pop veneer would indicate on first listen, including, especially, the opening cut, ""While You See A Chance"", which tells people not to let opportunities pass them by, and the title track, which is about how hard connecting with others can be. Winwood's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes even disco pap like ""Second Hand Woman"" and ""Spanish Dancer"" bearable, and results in ARC OF A DIVER being an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000W20FY2,1,1,5.0,"During my MTV days, Steve Winwood's big 80's splash with songs from Back In The High Life didn't go unnoticed by me.  After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat ""While You See A Chance.""  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.  I find myself enjoying this song more than ""Higher Love.""

The title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  ""Spanish Dancer"" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called ""lazy music"" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.  This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life.

I wonder why ""Second-Hand Woman"" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being ""a slot machine to take my dime"" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds True for the near eight minute on-the-run opus ""Night Train"" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.

Two non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are ""Slowdown Sundown.""  A wistful ballad, calling wine that ""glassful of memories""  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track ""Dust"" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, ""a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing,"" meaning time, ""the universal healer.""  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote ""the sands of time wash us all clean.""

Mellow, but not ""lazy music"" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads."
A10XJR7CWHNKWU,B000W20FY2,1,1,4.0,"Steve Winwood's second solo album, 1980's ""Arc Of A Diver,"" remains one of his most popular releases, and it is indeed an excellent album. Winwood produced it, co-wrote all the songs, and plays all of the instruments himself. And, of course, he sings with that marvelous Ray Charles-ish voice. The album is a keyboard-heavy platter of pop, and it's all good. The catchy ""While You See A Chance"" was a big #2 hit for Steve on the U.S. singles chart, but there are also other goodies including the atmospheric title song, the breezy ""Second Hand Woman,"" the great grooves of ""Spanish Dancer,"" and the up-tempo funk-pop of ""Night Train"" (featuring some fine electric guitar from Winwood). Steve also slows things down a bit for the cool mellowness of ""Slowdown Sundown"" and ""Dust."" ""Arc Of A Diver"" is a great Steve Winwood album."
A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000W20FY2,-1,-1,3.0,"I have several Steve Winwood CDs, which admiddetly I don't play much anymore. But when I recently saw this CD in a second-hand store cheap I couldn't resist. I mean, I used to LOVE this album when it originally came out in 1980. I played it over and over in those days.
""Arc of a Diver"" (7 tracks, 40 min.) contains the hits ""While You See a Chance"" and ""Second-Hand Woman"", and the title track is well known too, but it all sounds a bit... 80s synth-lite now. The only track that really remains a stand-out now is the brooding, grooving ""Night Train"".
This album set the stage for the commercial blockbusters ""Back in the High Life"" and ""Roll With It"". With the hind-sight of 20 years or so, it is strangely clear to me that Steve Winwood's solo output simply hasn't aged well. It was exciting music then, but isn't now, sorry."
A2HWD9PTM7RBXN,B000W20FY2,1,-1,2.0,"My title is kind of blunt isn't it?  However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies.
The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.
After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.
Dear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment."
A2EENLV6OQ3DYM,B000W20FY2,1,1,5.0,"The 1986 album ""Back in the High Life"" may have sold more  copies, but ""Arc of a Diver"" is Steve Winwood's best solo album.  It contains the smash hit ""While You See a Chance,"" and plenty of  other smooth jazzy pop songs in the same mode.  There is not a bad song in  the mix, though the standouts are ""Slowdown Sundown,""  ""Spanish Dancer,"" and ""Dust.""  Though fans of Winwood's  days with Traffic may lament the lack of adventurism on this album, those  who love great songcraft will feel right at home."
A25UWXZ2A92OM1,B000W216ZY,1,1,5.0,The price of the song was reasonable. Song sound was clean and untampered with. I appreciate the product. Love this song.

A1NN80MZE4WAHU,B000W1XHOI,-1,-1,1.0,"I love the band and the music so much that I had to download this song. However, like so many times in the past, Amazon can't deliver good/quality mp3's to me. Half (about 20) of the mp3's I've downloaded from Amazon have audio artifacts/defects and glitches. I report them to Amazon and they refund money to me and say they will fix the problem. Weeks later I'll attempt to download the song again and it will still be defective. I've grown tired of this and have decided to avoid Amazon mp3's all together and will take my business to Itunes instead. Also, I thought it might be my system, but it hasn't failed with any other mp3 provider or download service - plus I recently installed a new, state of the art router. FIX YOUR PROBLEMS AMAZON!"
A3NXCL9NJTL3TF,B000W201NC,1,1,5.0,Love the ease of ordering through Amazon. Love the preview ability and search mp3s function. Love the Cloud player & online storage! 5GB = 1000 songs!! I'm gonna download all mp3s through Amazon from now on! Who needs iTunes when you have Cloud?!

A3EBK445KB31VD,B000W216ZY,-1,1,5.0,"I know what I like & I love this cover of Tainted love, Marilyn Manson does.
I think you should down load this, even if you don't like Marilyn M. It's just so full of Marilyn creep factor goodness. The vid is funny, frat boy Marilyn, struts amongst the norms, infiltrating, playing with some pretty bunny heads, druggy haze, but the song revs slow & a durge occurrs. Tainted is your drink, your dignity, & your pride is at the bottom of a kiddy pool...
This is classique' Marilyn cover, but I loved the original till Marilyn amped up the anti & lowered the barr.
This one is his show of digits. 

Get the song & down load now, if you didn't already, too bad for you. If you have a copy of the vid, wow Bravae props."
A19T9VM3RDUJBF,B000W216ZY,1,1,4.0,Dark as expected.

A131E9IR67XE4I,B000W216ZY,1,1,5.0,"I LOVE this remake!  I fell in love with it on Not Another Teen Movie when the spoof version of Sarah Michelle Gellar's character in Cruel Intentions is walking down the hall in slo-mo.  It's so fitting, and then when you listen to the whole song and watch the video, it's just awesome!  The original and this cover--both 5 stars."

A32BM1CZ627MVJ,B000W21FZU,1,1,5.0,"I love the fusion of Middle Eastern music with Sting's vocal gifts.  The video released with this melody is hypnotizing, and it is hard for me to listen to the music without visualizing THAT.  Almost a religious experience.  Close your eyes and rock your hips.  Lovely."
A32BM1CZ627MVJ,B000W21FZU,1,1,5.0,"This song is/was the music for a charming video on YouTube that features Aishwarya Ra, and fits well with the Mediterranean beats popularized on the SciFi Channel's ""Battlestar Galactica"" series.  Excellent belly-dancing music!  Enjoy!"
A368R6C5ZEO71R,B000W21FZU,1,1,5.0,Great song
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W21FZU,1,1,4.0,"Hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since Sting had started his successful solo career, after he had said goodbye to The Police. Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.

Song: B+"
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W21FZU,1,1,4.0,"If there is honestly one thing that I do adore about Sting, is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own. He has been doing it for 30 years on his own, and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police. I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock. But when he has a song come out, people will really listen to him, most of the time. When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999, many people weren't very eager at listening to the album at first, after the title track was released. However when Desert Rose was released as a single, many people really flocked over to the album. Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90's. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold. This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan.

Song: B+"

This is a full bodied, vibrant and hauntingly, mysterious compilation."

A2LLZATKJ9MKA,B000W1ZH3C,1,1,5.0,"After Lynyrd Skynyrd's plane went down, high schoolers such as myself were anxious to see what the surviving members would do musically.  The remaining guitarists, Gary Rossington and Allen Collins, formed Roosington Collins and this song became the band's biggest hit.  Although lacking the Skynyrd sound without Ronnie Van Zant and the others, this song stands on its own very well and also holds up very well today."
ARKTOWXV7NRYR,B000W216J0,1,1,5.0,Always great!

A3THSGE4JMQRJC,B000W20GLO,1,1,5.0,"My favorite Police album is Outlandos d'Amour : the first four songs make for a particularly good sequence. This particular song is simply amazing, part hard rock, part reggae, great earnest vocals by sting and backing vocals by the band. I try to make my suggestions on Amazon original, this particular choice is hardly that! But man, is it ever a good song!"

The Police is one of my favorite bands and this song from their Synchronicity album to me was the best. For anyone who loves 70's and 80's music this song is a must have for you collection.

Thanks,

A1H2ATYIVND5KV,B000W22QSA,1,1,5.0,"Love this song.  Haunting, sad, and hymn-like, Vince wraps his voice around the words and melody and never lets go.  That's why it's a classic in my book."

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000W20GOQ,-1,1,5.0,"Sweet Dreams Are Made of This by Marilyn Manson is an alternative rock music take on the Sweet Dreams Are Made of This song by the Eurythmics (which is also a brilliant song  by the way). The only difference is that Marilyn Mansons version is a grittier/darker remake.  Im guessing-from reading online meanings of the song-that the basic summary behind Marilyn Mansons version is the controversial notion of a person witnessing both people being abused and those that are the abusers themselves (which Im guessing can apply to either personal or professional/career settings).  I myself am lucky to have a loving husband so fortunately this song is not life imitates art for me.  However, Im intuitively collecting this song as a way of understanding the shadowy/dark sides of human nature for my professional storytelling career aspirations."
A19T9VM3RDUJBF,B000W20GOQ,1,1,4.0,Dark as expected.

A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000W23ISM,-1,-1,2.0,"Ever wonder what Sting is singing about at the end of the song? (""Pi-ojo, Pi-ojo, Pi-ojo"") The spanish translation of the word ""Piojo"" is  "" flea"" or may refer to  a pain, a bothersome person. So, every little thing she did may have been magic but A. Either this chick had fleas in her hair or B: she may have been considered a bothersome person...or C: Maybe this wasn't about a girl at all and Sting wrote it for his Cocker Spaniel. So the story behind the song is even more intruiging than the song itself, no thanks to the stereotypical FM playlists put together by the unimaginitive program directors at the 'so-called' classic rock stations."
A2DYXCOPZTRI7G,B000W23ISM,1,1,5.0,"First and most all... The police have been a bit hit back ine day.

A39SJQJYO2DV7X,B000W20GOQ,1,1,5.0,"MARILYN! really nailed this song and made a classic! it was the guitar riffs that made it a gem to listen to over and over again i never get tired of it,and so many movie studios are using for their movie promos and trailers Marilyn is making millions! off of it alone and not to mention the legendary Annie lenoxx the ""original composer"" who wrote the song people dislike marilyn but he's a musical genius and a very intelligent and knows what he's doing all i can say is DO MORE!!"
A131E9IR67XE4I,B000W20GOQ,1,1,4.0,"This was one of the most popular remakes of any song when I was growing up.  It's got that dark, edgy style he's so famous for, and it's nice to have a different version of this song.  Love the original, really like the cover."

Highly recommended!!!  (Just THIS song...though)"

A3GIEMJF0B98G9,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,One of their best albums!  My favorite Weezer song is on this album:  Say It Ain't So.  Even the non-popular songs on this album are a thing of beauty!  Sample it for yourself and see. 
A22M1S44P7RG0A,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"It sure did!..much thanks!
Much Thanks to the Seller."
A2IK776FY6MEMG,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"I'm in a Weezer mood today. I'm listening to their entire catalog this afternoon and it's not getting old.

I was in high school when these guys rocked the world with 'Buddy Holly'. It meant nothing to me at the time though. Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90's (You know, the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE's thing. I didn't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth. I was just super lame.)

Looking back on it now, after having enjoyed Weezer for the last decade or so, they really are amazing. They have a distinctive sound that's very alternative but also very much their own. It's also not a hard sound. I find their instrumentals to be soothing ear candy.

And it's not an accident that 'Buddy Holly' is the song everyone remembers form the blue album. It's the best song on the album. Yeah it's the one with the most radio play, but that's because it's awesome. 'Susanne' is a close second, mainly because it reminds me of the closing credits to Mallrats. (Which I loved in the 90's but had no idea it was Weezer sining. I told you I was lame.) But 'Susanne' is only available on the deluxe version of the Blue Album. It's not available via the Prime streaming option. If you're buying the album, the Deluxe version is the only way to go. Don't get just the basic version."
AI3TTQMOR04T2,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,What can be said about this great Disc made better by MOFI and SACD!
A2IIAQ7VVAHXTD,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"Beautiful, there is really nothing I could say about this recording that is in negative spotlight.

The album is amazing, certainly reminds me of grade school and staying up late during sleep overs jamming this on cassette.

Years later, they release it on vinyl, and suddenly I am re-experiencing it for the very first time, with subtle imperfections and a more pronounced acoustic range.  If you have high end headphones, you will enjoy this."
A1E45OPF6KECIL,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,I used to have this CD and liked it OK. After seeing Weezer do the whole thing at Riotfest this year I downloaded it and started listening to it again. I like it even more now.
A25KDGSE2EVYXY,B000W21ER4,-1,1,4.0,"This is Weezer's first ever album, and I think it's pretty good. I think Raditude might be my first favorite. I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin' tune to listen to, but it's not quite hard-rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.

""My Name is Jonas"" might be a song about the singer's brother, since the actual singer's name is Rivers. A punk rock song with a light guitar intro. The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first.

The Amazon sample for ""No One Else"" says ""My girl's got eyeballs,"" but the whole line is ""My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head."" The music is fun, catchy, and a little simple.

""The World Has Turned And Left Me Here"" is so Weezer-y, you can almost immediately tell who sang it if you hear it for the first time on the radio. I would've given it a 5/5, but it kind of got old after a while.

""Buddy Holly"" is Awesome! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly? Kinda, kinda not.

Next comes ""Undone"", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.

""Surf Wax America"" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.

Next comes ""Say It Ain't So"". This one has everything that a Weezer fan would like; Pretty good lyrics, rockin' chorus, guitar solo, and it's really catchy. Say it IS so!

Somebody said that ""In The Garage"" this one is an anthem for nerds/ rock 'n' roll lovers, and I might have to agree. It's my favorite song on the album. I like the intro because it sounds so different from the rest of the song. [Is that a bagpipe?]

""Holiday"" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure. Yes, it has a middle section, but much louder and better than the one SWA had.

""Only in Dreams"" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5/10]

Now for the bonus tracks:

For ""Mykel and Carley"", I'm not so sure who Mykel and Carley are, but the song was great! It had a guitar intro that reminded me of the intro for My Name is Jonas. Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band's newest album, Death to False Metal.

""Jamie"" is Just boring. Enough said.

However, ""Susanne"" is Another great hit from Weezer!]

Finally, we have ""PaperFace"". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it."
AD6G80D2PS6UG,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,It has so many awesome songs. It's really fun to sing along with on road trips and when you want to just veg out in your own little world.
A19I5KZQM3CA6W,B000W21ER4,1,-1,1.0,"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?

To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.

After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.

On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.

A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):

I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.

If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as ""You're just jealous!"" or ""I'd like to see you do better!"" or ""How is it in your parents' basement?"" or ""You must jerk off to your computer!"" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:

""Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!""

FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.

To those of you who would call me ""pretentious"" or ""music snob"" or ""self-righteous"" or ""self-absorbed,"" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is ""simple,"" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:

""Devil's Night Out"" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" by The Sex Pistols
""The Essential Heart"" by Heart
""Highway To Hell"" by AC/DC
""Meat Is Murder"" by The Smiths
""The Strange Case Of..."" by Halestorm
""Greatest Hits"" by Tom Petty
""Complete Greatest Hits"" by The Cars
""Ugly"" by Life of Agony
""Remain In Light"" by Talking Heads

As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!

I also wish to point out that arguments such as ""Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!"" or ""You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!"" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)"
A17J91PKRJR8TU,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"What happens when you take an awesome album, and then put it on the best quality sound medium?  You get an amazing record.

If you are a HUGE Weezer fan, this is the only True way to listen, but if you are just a mediocre fan, it is not anywhere near the ridiculous price that sellers are wanting to this record."
A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"What a great way for a band to start, by making one of the greatest albums in Rock history! I can't get tired of ""the Blue Album"". I listen to it about six times a week and it still isn't old. It is pure genius, there is no other word to describe it. What I love about Weezer is that their sound is their own, you just can't find Rock like this like you can on a Weezer album. Each record always has something new, which really adds to the lifespan of the album. That's why this one has stood the test of time.

I mean, look how many hits are on here! There isn't one bad song to be found. Even the lesser known songs on here are amazing. I truly can't stop listening to the album. Perfection"
A2582KMXLK2P06,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"I'm mostly a classic rock fan stuck in the 60's and 70's, but Weezer caught my attention upon immediately hearing them for their talent at writing hooky pop songs.  They are really good at writing memorable tunes, and they deserve respect for that."
AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"Weezer's infamous self-titled debut (otherwise known as ""The Blue Album"") is one of the few pieces of music from it's time that still holds up just as well today. When they made their mark in 1994, Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling, uninspiring grunge clones. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate, they did, however, create a quite perfect debut, one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today, but Weezer remain vital, and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple. You can't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who, whether they realize it or not, knows a good Weezer tune. So, it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release, a Deluxe Edition made it's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b-sides, outtakes, demos, live songs etc. The question is, is it worth buying again?

The answer? A resounding yes. For starters, I'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it, what better time to get yourself another copy. And even if it's still in perfect condition, the bonus material is worth it alone, for the Weezer fanatic. I don't have to tell you how good the original album is. You've heard it, you know. It's perfect, front to back. The material on the second disc, while admittedly not as good as the album itself, is still worthy. Take, for example, Rivers' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub, ""Mykel and Carli"" (who passed away in a tragic car accident), with it's chorus that, in typical Weezer fashion, sticks in your head for the rest of your life. ""Suzanne"" and ""Jamie"" are probably the most well-known b-sides among Weezer fans, while a trio of demos -- referred to as ""The Kitchen Tapes"" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history. There are also live songs (""My Name Is Jonas"" & ""Surf Wax America"") and acoustic versions (""Jamie"" and ""No One Else""), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of ""Say It Ain't So"" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album). Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics (finally) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer. The package is very well done, and surely outshines the bare-bones nature of the original release.

Overall, a good album just got even better. Despite it's price tag, the average Weezer fan just should not be without this. It might make you love the band even more. You definitely get your money's worth. And as I said before, the original album itself is just classic. Say what you will about Weezer's newer material, but this stuff just can't be beat. They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty. I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album, an accomplishment a lot of musicians cannot acheive."
A13N40YR6UZFRW,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"Someone else made a comment that the content wasn't enough, but I would have to disagree. First, you get a second disc with all the blue b-sides which I thought was a great idea. Second, the packaging with the extra pictures and song lyrics was cool to. So I don't understand what else one can ask for. The disc was also remastered. This is a must buy for any Weezer fan."
A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"It's kind of hard to expound on Weezer's classic debut. In the aftermath of grunge and the death of Kurt Cobain, along came four noisy geeks who made the world safe for noisy hook laden songs about loudmouthed girlfriends (""No One Else""), the joys of high-school love (""Buddy Holly"") and a great metaphor about an unraveling relationship (""Undone - The Sweater Song""). Along with seven other great songs, this was a first album that yielded some perennial material, and founded the cult that Rivers Coumo rides today.
So why should you pony up the extra dough for the ""expanded"" edition? Is the second disc really worth it? For a change, the answer is yes. You get four great live tracks, complete with some funny self depreciating comments, one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer (""Jamie""), and a handful of demos. The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled ""My Evaline"" that highlights Weezer's uncanny harmony abilities, something occasionally lost in the din.
If you're reading this, you're probably already inclined towards buying this. Go ahead. Maybe we'll get lucky and ""Pinkerton"" will get the same royal treatment."
AO3VO3TW1CCJP,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"I have to agree with a lot of Weezer fans that the blue album really is their best CD. But by re-releasing it with the b-sides that we all hunted so feverishly for in the internet, they made it so much better! I remember how badly I wanted those songs, and now they're here!
So you get the great quality of the blue album plus all the b-sides you've been looking for. It's wonderful!"
A3UJJGY799F76I,B000W21ER4,1,1,5.0,"This album, I don't know, it just reminds me of so much stuff about college life, the whole feel of it will remind you of when you were in high school or college. These are really great catchy alternative rock tunes too, now digitally remastered. My faves are ""Buddy Holly"" and ""Say It Ain't So."" But itz all good, yo. :)

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000W23918,1,1,5.0,"The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson is a compelling alternative rock song that I first heard as a teenager in the 1990s (from both local radio and television).  I take this songs meaning to symbolize the singers way of truthfully admitting that we do live in a world where many people are prejudged (even outside of Hollywood)based on physical appearance/weight.  This song actually creeped into my dreams as an adult after I reluctantly accepted that I must get a handle on my weight not just for health reasons but reasons having to do with getting a job and how my value as a woman may be perceived (whether I like it or not). I took this song being in my dream as an intuitive warning to accept that reality that I just mentioned without feeling self-pity (I prefer to avoid public sharing when I had that dream). Nonetheless, The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson is a rock song with depth that explores a persons journey to greatness without letting the physical appearance judgements consume them."

A1OKPC1K12YZEP,B000W23KD0,1,1,5.0,I used to listen to this with my mom.  Brings tears to my eyes now. I really love some of the Irish Rovers songs.

A1Y2L864RKMD2U,B000W23KD0,1,1,5.0,"When I downloaded this song and started singing it like I was back in the 60s again, my husband knew exactly who sang it. Reminds me of the best of times."
A16ZS3AK509CVQ,B000W23IE6,1,1,5.0,"Andy Summers & Sting wrote this but only Sting received credit. Andy Summers, a great guitarist in his own right, made the song what it was and is today.... a classic regardless of your specific music genre liking."

AOZYVALWGGOMO,B000W23IE6,1,1,5.0,I always love that song. There was someone in my life that I related to when I heard that song.
A39EGBEBK33PBR,B000W23IE6,1,1,5.0,"I love everything POLICE, and especially Andy Summers (Sting)!"
AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B000W23IE6,-1,-1,3.0,"And the crazy of the lyrics never gets old.  How do you piss off crazy if you were looking to do so?

Heh. This song encourages you to do so if you listen to the lyrics.

It doesn't wear as well as the awesomely hilarious Human by Human League who are way pretty.  I think the same thing now as the first time I saw the music video for this.

Happy D-/Edward Snowden Day!"
A30N3X56DAZ7W5,B000W23IE6,-1,1,5.0,"The police with Sting as lead singer made this song #1,and the remastered version sounded like the original but better."

AK1O1SSMJMUPE,B000W23IE6,-1,1,5.0,"If I am forced to a specific number of words in rating songs, I will no longer leave a rating or a response. If I paid money for the song that should suffice that I wanted the song anything beyond that is not for my benefit. After payment that should be the end of my obligation. The rating system should be the stars only without having to leave comments."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000W23IE6,1,1,5.0,"When it has came down to Sting's songwriting, he has shown a lot for his solo work, but that also worked very well with the intimacy of The Police, and the way they captured a beautiful sound. The songs from Rock and Pop still have stood the test of time, nearly 30 years after their last record Synchronicity. But out of all the songs the trio had done, the one that has stood the test of time and beyond in Every Breath You Take. It is definitely one of the most iconic songs of all time that has put words beyond what could ever be said. I like the song not only because of the rhythm, but it really takes me back to a time when music was really becoming all about fads in the 80's, but this songs goes beyond the fads, and stays True to the song. Sting may have wrote it in regards to a divorce, but the song is definitely a must download for any Police fan, or for anyone who had never heard their music before.

Song: A"
AOVE04Z903K7,B000W23IE6,1,1,5.0,It's Excellent and one of my favorite songs. I really enjoy 80's music when I was going to High School.
A2C6YK3IMXY2VO,B000W23IE6,1,1,5.0,"Well first I love it because Sting is singing it. It to me is a bit of a love song. I'll watch you breathe, I'm looking at you. Love love."
A16Z3HTUIYPDH8,B000W23IE6,1,1,5.0,"There was a large van outside my house playing a song. After listening carefully to the beat with my neighbor he suggested it might be ""Every Breath You Take."" Went went inside and purchased the song on Amazon. We have not worked up the courage to leave the house yet."
A7KA68ILUFPOV,B000W23IE6,1,1,5.0,"Police have always had songs with great beat, and their songs appeal to most people. I like their choice picks."
A3P4OCFJHME34N,B000W2384G,1,1,5.0,There is not one Sting song that I do not like. This is one of my all time favorites. The man is overflowing with talent and I shall enjoy it..
A1IA1ZKGRN3UES,B000W23J9U,1,1,5.0,This was my wedding song almost 20 years ago! It's been a while since I've listened to it but it brings back memories from the best day of my life when I married my best friend~
A3YJ1HDE2U7BE,B000W23J9U,1,1,4.0,"Our lead singer sounds like George Strait, and is crazy about this song. It's got a very melodic tune, nice lyrics, and usually quiets a crowd to listen. This song grows on you, and I'm beginning to like it more and more."

I saw him perform in Joliet, Illinois and even with a ""Chicago throat"" he was still awesome and his band top top performance.  Get it you will enjoy."

A1ZB7LENP3V4K7,B000W23IAU,1,1,5.0,Vince Gill truly has a magnificent voice and not like anyone else.  His voice is mellow and rich not the run of the mill you often hear this days.  I like him now and I liked him the first time I heard his voice.  He has a God given talent and you know it the minute he starts to sing.

A3NCZFGM3NBDM0,B000W24ULG,1,1,5.0,"At any party or get together - I want to remind family and friends about love. Like we can't survive without air, food and water; none of us can survive without LOVE. We're all searching for it, we all need it. Now listen to the way the Intro of THIRD WORLD'S, NOW THAT WE FOUND LOVE begins; Listen to the rhythm, the base, drums - the way it drops and how the dread sings each word from his gut; bringing the love, knowledge and vibes of how we must hang on to love, etc. Get up and dance, move yea, move yea. Let hate be your enemy, and only love will set the spirit free. WOW! You said it brother. I won't ever get tired of this song, NEVER! First recorded by The O JAYS, and later done by my late friend Heavy D - My heart and soul is filled with love and my feet want to dance when I hear NOW THAT WE FOUND LOVE. I'm glad I have THIRD WORLD in My Ultimate Reggae Collection. This is Reggae Music at its BEST. Yea man."
AFN3UT6YDT409,B000W23KMQ,1,1,4.0,"I would pick this song although it gets a bit repetitive...I still like it, not the greatest song ever or anything though"
A2BE3MTUT0YBF0,B000W23KMQ,1,1,4.0,"Not really a Weezer fan when considering entire bodies of work, but I do love Buddy Holly because there's something kinda crazy about the song and the video that just screams 1990's before music went into the witness protection program that currently encases it. It's an upbeat tune that blends the 1990's sound with classical icons remembered through lyrics like Mary Tyler Moore and Buddy Holly. Whenever I hear it, I just get the almost irrepressable urge to stop whatever i'm doing and rock out or pop out, if one has trouble figuring out where the line dividing pop and rock was during the nineties."

AIOA8F7J8LMDK,B000W239UY,1,1,5.0,"This is positively the most moving spiritual country music song I have ever heard. It sounds as if it was written long ago, and has an authentic traditional sound. Anyone who has been troubled in this life is reminded of the rest and peace that will be foound because of the love of the Father and his only Son, Jesus. I would like to have this song played at my own memorial service someday:
Go rest high on that mountain
Son your work on Earth is done
Go to Heaven a shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son. Amen."

I remember when he sang this at the CMT awards and it blew me away."

You feel the cold breeze against your brown corduroy jacket. You don't ever confuse the world of this song in any other time than the zeitgeist in which it was made. A perfect time capsule, great execution, and it's own sonic universe."

A1CYX6JFGHB71Z,B000W25BZU,1,1,5.0,"It had been years since I heard this one.  I think this song is what started me on my musical quest for all ear candy that says 'moody'.  If you like this song, you MIGHT like the more modern ""Eyes on Fire"" by Blue Foundation, off their Life of a Ghost album."

A32LR5QR5ORFXW,B000W25BZU,1,1,5.0,"First became aware of Jackie Blue on a flight from SFO to JFK back in mid 70s listening to entertainment channel. Acoustics were poor, but space great (opposite of today). It was a perfect flight, great Stews, booze, food and Boeing 707. All things of the past."
A13UQNMCNE8LPG,B000W25BZU,1,1,5.0,"This song has merit. It's about a boy , Jack and the kids never let him play ball with them. When they do, they pick him last. He ends up being almost picked to be an all-star pitcher but loses and becomes the first Kenian to run the US."
A33QL7Y8Y9SQSI,B000W25BZU,1,1,5.0,"this was one of those songs from back in it's time no one knew who they were , but it was kind of a cool song ."

A13AW7HQFCISU2,B000W239UY,1,1,5.0,"People either love or hate Vince Gill it seems; his voice is quite distinct and easily picked out.  BUT if you like his voice and you like christian music, this should be in your mp3 player, on the computer, in the car, on your phone.  A classic hymn remade so very well and the first time I heard it, It brought me to tears.  ADORE"
A1H048MX5LKW73,B000W239UY,1,1,5.0,"I had this song played at my 18 year old son's funeral. He was such an angel and was so loved by so many people the world over. He has no idea how many people were sending him e-mails offering their prayers for his recovery. He was diagnosed in July of 07 stage one , turned 18 in December and passed away that following April. I miss him so very much."

A7TUTFAU729UU,B000W25BXM,1,1,5.0,The Mamas and The Papas has always been a True classic as I grew up listening to them.  The older music are so much more soothing for me than the new.
ARYVQL4N737A1,B000W25BXM,1,1,5.0,"This song by the Mamas & the Papas appeals to a wide range of listeners and musicians and has been covered by artists you wouldn't normally associate with this style of music, so that proves that this is a great song.

A2YPI831EUQ1ZU,B000W25BXM,1,1,5.0,"I loved the Mamas and the Papas when I was growing up. The music was beautiful, and I could actually understand the words. There were so many performers whose lyrics I couldn't make out, and singers like Janice Joplin who just screamed unintelligibly. I still enjoy listening to this group so many years later."

I WOULD LIKE IT WHATEVER WAS GOING ON IN MY LIFE AT THAT TIME."
AQYZYXYDCQPHK,B000W239UY,1,1,5.0,"No other song, I believe, has had an impact on country music, in the last 30 years, than this one.  I don't think he wrote it to be a song for funerals.  But, I believe I've heard it at least 75% of the funerals I've attended.  Ricky Skaggs and Patty Loveless are flawless in their harmony work.  A True song for the ages.  It will be listened to long after we're gone.  I would put this song in the Top 10 country songs of all time."
A3OQPUZ6XKQSSY,B000W239UY,1,1,5.0,"Go rest high on the mountain ,a beautiful tribute to a friend whohas always been there for me .downloading single,was played at service always takes me back .loved song ."

A9CDS78S3J71G,B000W25KJ2,-1,1,4.0,"There is a story behind my finding this song.  For some reason, the Sixpence None The Richer version of this song was all over the place.  I suspect it was connected to some commercial or another.  I liked the tune a great deal and wanted to have it in my collection.  But if you want rabbit stew you have to have a rabbit.  Without knowing the song title or the artists it was an uphill battle.  By memorizing some of the lyrics I was able to Google to lyric sites and it wasn't long before I got what I needed.

There are a few covers of the song out and about, but I rate the La's version a strong B+ and the Sixpence None The Richer version a solid A.  But I decided to buy both and they are a great addition to almost any rock/pop collection."
A1TVZI1FQUQ34Y,B000W25KJ2,1,1,5.0,"I bought their song because I like their recording from the ""I married an Axe Murderer"" movie.  Great Tune to listen to."
A3KE9D58PF3VW,B000W25KJ2,-1,-1,2.0,disappointed. Waste of my money as I only like it the way Sixpence does it.  Why so many versions of the same song?
A3LG4DFM8VJ3QS,B000W272FC,1,1,5.0,"One of the rock-n-roll classics that belongs in any collection. An artifact of the psychedelic era, it evokes the zeitgeist - the good feeling with an ethereal quality.

""Good sense, innocence, crippled and kind.
Dead kings and many things I can't define.
Oh Cajun spice, sweats and blushes your mind.
Incense and peppermints, the color of thyme."""
A34VCCL1YO6D0I,B000W272FC,1,1,4.0,A fun and light song.  I purchased for nostalgic reasons but have listened to several times since.  A classic 60's hit.  Also who can go wrong with the Amazon DRM free downloads.  Great price and great flexibility.  I love it!

AK0TW820PCJSU,B000W272FC,1,1,5.0,"It's so late sixties with the organ and the mod clothes.  The Doors probably did it best, but this song by Strawberry Alarm Clock is still quite excellent."
A3FCYI00KYG3D2,B000W26ASM,1,1,5.0,"This is one of those classic 90's hip hop rap dance songs to which you simply HAVE to have access. Pandora is great if it comes up, but make sure you have a copy of your very own."
A20173T9HDB759,B000W27DPG,1,1,5.0,Awesome song!

A1G7YNZXPBWA4Y,B000W27BFI,1,1,4.0,This is very good music and I'm sure if someone buys it it will be because they are familiar with it and want a copy for their collection.
A1VKB23S2O5NWR,B000W291YM,1,1,5.0,"I didn't know this song's name but since I heard it, love it. As you can see it took me a while to find out the name. Vanessa Carlton sings lovely and plays the piano so well! I love it."
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000W291YM,1,1,4.0,"This song features nice lyrics that give you just a taste of what to expect on the CD. Very catchy and sing-a-long-ish. But the best part of this song (if you didn't know already) is the outstanding piano which to me is inspiring.

I love the bridge and the ending best.

4.5 stars.

end note: Other album highlights are Rinse, Twilight and Paint It Black (a Rolling Stones remake)."
A3DYLNS3B1ZUUO,B000W291YM,1,1,5.0,great song

A3OSZMNBO13W93,B000W291YM,1,1,5.0,"This song reminds me of traveling to Canada to my Father's funeral. This song was popular at the time, and it sure did seem like a thousand mile ride. I just wanted to be with him one last time, and this song will always be a beautiful reminder. Thank you!"
AHA6BYRJ515TE,B000W291YM,1,1,5.0,beautiful song
A36EDWL4F3AASU,B000W291YM,1,-1,2.0,"This song was an anthem to all them cool ass white chicks in the early 2000s (in fact, it was played in the Wayans Brothers classic movie White Chicks. I originally gave it one star but bumped it up to two for comedic value. I picture a bunch of really white chicks snap dancing Carlton Banks style to this tune!"
A3VSBLDBSDFJ5M,B000W291YM,1,1,5.0,Meaningful
A1S72AW8X4Z2R2,B000W291YM,1,1,4.0,I like this song.  Never heard of it before someone told me that that should be my themesong.  Hmmmm...the jury is still out on that
ACNLW80ZD8VEA,B000W291YM,1,1,5.0,"Good music, interesting style.  Everyone's heard it, so there's no need to go into detail.  This is exactly what you think it is."
A18TQ16JSAXSPQ,B000W291YM,1,1,4.0,"The melody of this song is so lovely...I hear it all the time over the speakers of public radios, but never bought it until recently.  It's a great song to put on in the car--wherever really, as long as you're moving!  Still, I'm not always sure what the lyrics mean...""If I could fall into the sky/ Do you think time would pass me by""...very figurative.
Still, great tune.
Enjoy"
A1AJUV4X9LS6AA,B000W291YM,1,1,5.0,"In my opinion, A Thousand Miles is a great song. I never get tired of listening to it. I am also positive that anyone who is going through a breakup can relate to it and enjoy it! I highly recommend this song!!"
A39SZ4B8TRX9E9,B000W29A34,1,1,4.0,This song is very 80's but not outdated! I enjoy the acoustics and the lyrics. Harriet Wheeler has a sweet yet stable voice.
A2P12VZMQVMBNS,B000W29A34,-1,1,4.0,"But this song is okay. The song is not my favorite of their works, but it's still good enough to purchase for 99 cents."
A3CRD9FQ7Y5W33,B000W29A34,1,1,5.0,Memorable 90s tune that stayed with me all these years.  Worth the purchase just to hear the flowery pop tune.  Nice and calming and just fun to listen to.
A1352I3HWDQCZH,B000W2S5X0,1,1,4.0,GOOD MUSIC
A26MDD444A02X5,B000W2S5X0,1,1,5.0,what can you say about smoking` Joe . His second CD . When it came out it was on LP . I played that record everyday and never got tired of it . It`s still my favorite Joe Satch CD

AHGZYB93YOQK8,B000W3TI6C,-1,1,5.0,A+
A10KCGSDJJAVRO,B000W3TI6C,1,-1,3.0,"These versions of many blues and soul standards are all fine, there are a couple of Freddie penned trax as well.  I've read the quibbles in the All Music Guide and thru out the Freddie King reviwes listed below, but I still really like this music.  Yes Leon's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix, and the strings and backing female voices occationaly over power King's playing and mar and date the arrangements, but it's soooo good, even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie.
.
I'd suggest picking up the 2-disc ""KING OF THE BLUES"".
That CD contains all of these cuts and then some; about 60 in all, in a generous package.  There are only a handful of songs that are not up to par and some that are so good you will wonder why you did not already have King in your blues collection.  For those looking for a blues CD beyond Freddie's vintage 1950's classics, see ""KING OF THE BLUES""."
A2DQS8NG3Y27XX,B000W3TI6C,1,1,5.0,"This is a fantastic album by Freddie King.  Recorded in 1972 on Leon Russell's Shelter label, the album features Freddie on guitar, Leon on piano, and Donald Duck Dunn on bass.  Great renditions of Lowell Fulsom's Reconsider Baby, Howlin Wolf's How Many More Years, and Bill Wither's Aint No Sunshine.  Plus a coupl eof track written by Isaac Hayes and David Porter.  In the thirty plus years I have been listening to this, I have worn out at least four copies.  Freddie really knows how to make that guitar sing. I saw Freddie perform with Eric Clapton at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City shortly before he died, it was a once in a lifetime musical experience for me. Another time, I walked into a blues bar on Bourbon Street in New Orleans many years ago and there was this old, old man playing ""Big Legged Woman"" on the slide guitar and it was amazing! The Texas Cannonball lives!"
AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B000W7H4KA,1,1,5.0,"When I was a kid, this was a treasured item in our house hold. This is essentially an album of a radio documentary broadcast on WMCA radio in New York as a tribute to JFK shortly after the assassination. Substantial segments of his speeeches and interviwes are provided with good narration to tie it all together.

As a child born exactly one year, one month, one day, and one hour (December 23, 1964) after JFK's murder, my father would occasionally play this on the stereo at home and this turned me on to JFK. Even at that age, I somehow understood the challenge of his inauguration, the call to put men on the moon, the urging for peace in 63, and the Civil Rights speech in particular spoke to me then and sends chills up my spine today.

Only complaint-this needs to be on CD. Use this to teach the younguns about JFK."
A2VHYWSV7ZLZOV,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5.0,"Ah, the Supreme Warbler!  She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical.  Were they parody?  Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil and spat them out when they were spent?  There were, after all, musical satirists like Anna Russell and much later, The Bonzo Dog Band and Monty Python, who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits, and made pots of money doing it, too.  But they knew exactly what they were doing.  What about Mrs. Miller?

Jonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller, but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller.  The former act was, in case some readers don't know it already, a gifted piano player/bandleader Paul Weston, and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer's singer, Jo Stafford.  She eventually became Weston's wife.  They were best known as themselves, but forged a separate career in musical parody.  What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing isn't easy, and Jo did it by singing sharp.  Try it.  It's harder than singing flat; believe me (and sounds even more horrible).  Now, you may be asking, what do Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have to do with Mrs. Miller?  For me, it's personal, but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people.

I tried to introduce a foreign-born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene.  He would have none of it.  He said, ""she's doing that deliberately; that's not funny.""  You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller.  In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny, and Mrs. Miller roll-on-the-floor hysterical, I got an unexpected response.  No, he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you, and maybe even some songs you hate.  Somehow, she's innocent, charming, and yes, very, very funny.  Whatever the True story, and you'll read of several in these Amazon reviews, what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures.  She may or may not have been exploited, or she may have exploited herself, but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal.

Just listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming.  How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time?  And face it, who's gonna take ""Sweet Pea,"" ""Catch A Falling Star"" and ""I've Got A Tiger By the Tail"" seriously, anyway?  This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting.  And her ""Boots?""  Sorry, Nancy, Mrs. Miller's is The Definitive Version.

My one, small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of ""Up, Up And Away.""  Talk about Definitive! (If you're a Mrs. Miller fan already, and haven't heard ""Up, Up and Away,"" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity). But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in ""Lover's Concerto.""  She NAILS it!  And people said she couldn't sing!

I think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task, both musically, and as comedians, but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof, enjoyed it, made some money, and did it with purpose; you can even hear them winking in their recordings.  I do think they are funny, but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny.  My coworker was right about one thing:  Mrs. Miller was Grandma.  And you might laugh WITH her and even AT her when her back was turned, but never would you sneer at her face to face.  No, you want to give her a hug, because somehow these crazy, one-of-a-kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer.  I completely disagree with those who say that laughing at Mrs. Miller's music is cruel.  I think Mrs. Miller might have understood, had she lived to witness her digital revival, that she had created something entertaining and unique, even if it wasn't taken as she had intended.  Nothing to be ashamed of there, and if her life was in some ways tragic, its legacy is not the least bit sad."
AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5.0,"If you've ever heard of something called KARAOKE and have been forced to sit through it, you should know that Mrs. Miller lives in all of us, or maybe atleast many of our close acquaintences.  I personally like Mrs. Miller but hate Karaoke.

Mrs. Miller was the epitome of a loveable housewife singing music with the most non-hip and non-understanding of innocence and that is what makes this album great... She tried so hard and was so diligent and serious.  And the risks she took!  Sure she could have sung opera or inspirational music, and got laughed at far less (actually probably ignored) - - but whether or not her recording career was a joke on HER, the fact that she accepted the challenge to record such unlikely (then) pop and rock and roll material is what made her GREAT.

In the end, Mrs. Miller was definitely the ED WOOD of vocal-dome period.  Yet as bad as she was, it is so entertaining to hear her sing and share it with other people... for this reason I highly recommend this album...  (P.S.  Its ashame they never filmed her life story and got Shelley Winters to play her !)"
A2INX8B6VXUVW6,B000WAJIE2,1,-1,3.0,"Back in the the mid-1960s, Capitol Records signed an almost-60-years-old housewife to a recording contract, for some reason.  She was Mrs. Miller, who sang with a quasi-operatic soprano.  She mostly recorded cover versions of recent pop hits.  She often went off-pitch, and sometimes she fell behind (or got ahead of) the beat.  She sang with more vibrato than Tiny Tim, and occasionally she would perform bird whistles.  Of course, the whole thing was a joke by the record company.  It's pretty funny, although it wears a bit thin after a while.  I don't think too many people can take 21 songs by Mrs. Miller!  But if you can't get enough of Mrs. Miller, this is a pretty comprehensive collection."
A20JK8DT702CWE,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5.0,"Go ahead - - play your Metal Machine Music and your Nurse With Wound and your :zoviet-france: and your Merzbow and your Obituary (!) at your next little get-together.  All I ask is that somewhere in the middle of it all you also play just one track from the venerable Mrs. Elva Miller.

Here is Uncle Autumfair's Absolutely Unconditional Guarantee:  it will be Elva who will be remembered, discussed and ruminated over for weeks to come."
A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000WAJIE2,1,1,5.0,"Elva Ruby Connes Miller was truly one of the most amazing voices of the twentieth century. That isn't to say that she has a great voice, or even a good voice, for that matter. What she has is an amazing penchant for an off-key vibrato intensive warbling that makes her second only to Florence Foster Jenkins for most hilarious soprano of the last century. Miller was a fixture in local community theater and amateur productions, and at one point even took her talent to Vietnam to entertain the troops. I am sure they were very entertained. Truly this woman had a heart of gold, even if she had a tongue of lead.

This compilation is stunning in its breadth. The treatment she gives to these songs cannot even be imagined until heard for oneself. She covers a variety of styles, with a heavy concentration of 1960s sugar-pop like ""Monday, Monday"", ""Let's Hang On"", and ""Yellow Submarine"". (Yes, it's True that Ringo sings substantially better than Mrs. Miller.) Particularly entertaining is the truly dreadful altered lyric masterpiece ""Queen of the House."" I can't imagine having been a supporting musician or recording technician that had to sit through multiple takes of these masterworks.

Listening to this CD is delightfully awful, and I recommend the experience highly to any audiophile who thinks they have heard it all.

Rock on, Mrs. Miller!"
A36HVSEHYYPQW,B000WAJIE2,1,1,4.0,"What can I say, I couldn't resist throwing in a few words about hapless Elva Miller and her cool, wild an' swingin' ""hits.""  The music is really irrelvent, as Mrs. Miller's fame and musical career was all about her persona, and her lack of being able to keep time or pitch.  This is what I gather, anyway, as her 15 minutes of fame was already up several years before I was born.  I was introduced to this phenomenom as a young child, as my parents had a copy of this floating around that they'd received as a Christmas gag gift from some friends circa late 60s.  Always rearing it's bed-haired head around the holidays, when the whole family gathered around the stereo for a good laugh.  Funniest selections are:  the frightening ""Monday, Monday"", Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Are Made for Walking,"" as well as dad's ""Stranger's in the Night"" (dooooo-beee-dooooo-beeeee-dooooooooo!!)  and the all time Mrs. Miller classic ""Downtown"", complete with out of time vocals and ear-piercing bird whistles.  For those of you not in on the joke, just imagine your 70-year-old Church choir director doing Friday night kareoke at some redneck bar."
A2LYY02ICN1DPM,B000WB0PIO,1,1,5.0,"I don't know why these songs about being hurt connect to me so. As someone who found the love of his life you would think I would only want to here ""happy"" songs but even with the most wonderful woman in my life I do remember what being left alone and missing someone that I could not have felt like and how hard it was to dust yourself off and grow from the situation."

A3SLVVDVXPTXKX,B000WCZW7M,-1,-1,1.0,"What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another ""greatest hits"", ""ultimate"", ""essential"", ""box set"" or ""whatever"" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.

What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old ""christian"" audience, ""pop"" audience, ""adult comtemporaray"" audience, all of them?  She's all over the place.  I think everyone is kinda over it.  She has a great career - nothing to be dissapointed with.  It's just time to retire.  For example - I dind't even know this was released.  Never heard anything about it.  It was never promoted - probably because there's nothing to promote."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000WCZW7M,1,-1,3.0,"The past few years have really brought out anew for pop star Amy Grant. She had moved back into her Christian roots well with her core audience, but unfortunate, she hasn't been able to click with newer music buyers. Since her A&M catalog was recently moved over to EMI, on her label Sparrow. While so many acts have done well with a new label in catalog sales, Amy still has a long way to return to the success she had a long time ago. A few years ago, it was well said with her previous hits package Greatest Hits 1986-2004 which did very well with the actual appeal. Now that she has another hits package, does Amy Grant really have the appeal she once conquered with record buyers?

Amy Grant's 2007 Greatest Hits mixes in a bit of the old and the new that Amy had delivered well from her 90's pop mix, to her contemporary mixes of soul and Christian music. The songs have been remastered nicely, and tries to deliver nicely as a re-introduction to Amy to a whole new audience. The collection includes some of her great gems like Every Heartbeat and Baby Baby, to her contemporary Christian classics like Lead Me On and Father's Eyes. While the collection works fairly well for new fans, it misses a few great songs from her pop era that worked better from her previous hits package. The collection overlooks a few great tracks like The Next Time I Fall, her often overlooked duet with former Chicago singer Peter Cetera, as well as The Things We Do For Love, which she did for the Ellen Degeneres film Mr. Wrong, and her delightful cover of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi from House Of Love, which had a very colorful video, and a better beat than when Joni recorded it years ago.

All in all, Amy Grant's Greatest Hits isn't a bad collection though, but it just doesn't deliver like the A&M days really did, or her previous Greatest Hits 1986-2004 album, which unfortunately is no longer in print. Hopefully, there could be a better hits collection that could attract Amy's great pop days like that one did, but this one could've had more to be desired, and that makes it a missed heartbeat.

AIYB8FUXTF365,B000WCZW7M,1,1,5.0,"This has a good collection of Amy Grant's hits. The one I find missing is ""Big Yellow Taxi"". A suggestion may have been to make it a 2-CD set (one with her pop hits and one with the Christian ones) as I'm sure more songs could've been included. There are notes from Amy Grant about each album (except ""The Collection"") in the CD jacket. Overall I definitely recommend it for any fan."
A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000WCZW7M,-1,1,5.0,"With three decades of music under her belt, Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections.  And while they are both great, there was no place to find a sample of her entire career.  Until now.

This disc is an attempt to collect the hits from Amy's entire career, and it does a remarkable good job.  With just nineteen songs, it hits all the highlights.  It includes ""Simple Things,"" the title track from her last major studio release and ""Old Man's Rubble"" from her self title debut.  In fact, it includes at least one song from each of her major studio releases (not counting the hymns projects or the Christmas releases) except for her third, ""Never Alone.""  Heck, it even includes ""Stay for Awhile.""  That song originated on Collection and went on to become a hit in its own right.

And there are plenty of classics here, from ""Baby Baby"" and ""Saved by Love"" to ""Thy Word,"" ""El Shaddai,"" and ""Father's Eyes.""

Having said that, there are some drawbacks.  Fans who already own all her releases will find absolutely nothing new here.  All nineteen tracks have been previous released.  While they have been digitally remastered to sound better, I must admit I don't notice the difference.  Of course, when you are getting almost an hour and twenty minutes of music, this is being picky.

An equally picky point is the over representation of ""Heart in Motion.""  I know it was her biggest release by far.  But it gets five tracks, which is about a quarter of the disc space.  And, to be honest, it's not my favorite of her releases.  Seems like one or two could have been cut to include a song from somewhere else.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"" didn't make the cut.  That would have been a good switch.

Finally, there's the timing.  Amy's last two releases have been a greatest hits and a live disc.  I know she just changed record labels, but I would have preferred to see this after another studio release.

In reality, these are all minor quibbles.  Any fan of Amy's music will find lots of memories in these nineteen songs and be glad to have them all in one place."

A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B000WCZW7M,1,1,5.0,"In 1991, during high school, I was exposed to Amy Grant's ""Heart In Motion"" album.  I didn't realize at the time what a diverse catalog that she had (starting from 1977).  Over time, I became truly blown away by Amy's sweet, sexy, breath-y voice.  And in the course of 4 decades, it hasn't changed all that much -- it's slightly become deeper and much more mature.  And she also married guitarist Vince Gill in 1994 after they met for the duet on 1994's ""House Of Love.""

This CD is a short overview of her work, which is mostly her mainstream hits -- from 1977 to 2003.  I actually own the deluxe version which has over an hour of bonus content, including 5 music videos and Amy's own interviews of the songs.  So now I will rate each song, which is in backwards chronological order.  :)

Simple Things -- 5 stars; Takes A Little Time -- 5 stars; Lucky One -- 4 stars; House Of Love -- 4 stars.

Baby Baby -- 5 stars; Every Heartbeat -- 4 stars; That's What Love Is For -- 4 stars; Good For Me -- 4 stars.

I Will Remember You -- 5 stars; Lead Me On -- 4 stars; Saved By Love -- 4 stars; Stay For Awhile -- 5 stars.

My Father's Eyes -- 5 stars; Old Man's Rubble -- 5 stars.

I enjoyed all of the hits on this album including ""Stay For Awhile,Baby Baby,Every Heartbeat,House Of Love"",and more. I was just a little disappointed that they did not include her 1986 minor hit ""Wise Up"". I really like that song but it is not included on here. Also ""I Will Be Your Friend"" and ""Big Yellow Taxi"", are not included here as well. They also could of included her Christmas single ""Tennessee Christmas"". The record company needs to get this straight and release a complete greatest hits album. Other from those songs missing, this is a must have Amy Grant collection."

A37HUQ6I3QNZDW,B000WGMYI8,-1,1,5.0,It was technically free for taking surveys I got a $1 mp3 credit everytime I cashed in on a site I am not if I can name but the bonus is over now it ran in Dec  Free is always the best!!!!!!!
A3AFI1CSZKWSG1,B000WGMYI8,1,1,5.0,The full song. Has great quality and isn't choppy and plays immidiatly and you don't need wifi to play after you download.

AR0ZMU7YZW7JR,B000WGFX36,1,1,5.0,"This cut tells it all by using only one word. Another wonderful song. Not only good for dancin, but good to mediate on the lyrics. There is message in the music."
AF9VTVJBW6UD4,B000WGFX36,1,1,5.0,As always the sound was very very good and no problem downloading to my Windows Media Player. Very good stuff
AVKHYC2D7MD56,B000WGFX36,1,1,5.0,"One of the best songs from Club Nouveau, a very popular song when I was Freshman in High School. The title of the song says it all, it's one of those songs that describes life in school to a T. I love this song and still do to this day, it's one song once you hear it you will be like I experienced that.

A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000WGRNA2,1,1,5.0,"This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits. In Europe, an expanded 13-track collection was released adding the other three but this version is long out of print. So this album, apart from being a high quality original album, also served as hits volume 2 until the more comprehensive Definitive Collection was released.

The one track that made it onto the American hits collection is Where've you been, which has become Kathy's signature song. However, in this particular song it is the lyrics that people seem to love - they relate to the sentiments expressed. The other hits were all upbeat, catchy songs - Come from the heart, Burning old memories and She came from Fort Worth Texas.

Of the other songs, my favorite is Hills of Alabam. No surprise, really, as this was written and originally recorded by my favorite bluegrass singer, Claire Lynch, who adds backing vocals. Claire's own version can be found on an untitled album by the Front porch string band, of which she was lead singer. The title track is also excellent, as are Here's hoping, True north, Love chooses you and I'll take care of you.

While I slightly prefer her two previous albums (Walk the way the wind blows, Untasted honey), there isn't much to choose between the three and those two are better represented on that hits collection. So if you already have that, this should be the next Kathy Mattea album on your shopping list."
AMW1OYXWOGZGJ,B000WGR1TU,1,1,5.0,"I've been listening to Styx since the 70's.  I've worn out the albums, cassettes and CD's.  Now it's time to just get everything in MP3 format.  One down 15,000 to go!!!"
A340M6DUC7BSBM,B000WGKUNO,1,1,5.0,The good old 80's teenage love songs.
A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000WGKUNO,1,1,5.0,I have always liked this song because; it is nice to listen to.  I enjoy the words and story the song tells is fun and funny.  The sound is complex and beautiful in a way that is very soothing to my autistic mind.  I love how it starts in one key and ends in another more upbeat key.  This is the old 1970's disco sound.  Yes I am old enough to remember disco first hand.
A1188LXSJLEP1C,B000WGKUNO,1,1,5.0,"The Jets were a family singing group in the 1970's or 1980's; I believe they were from Polynesia or someplace in the south seas.

Anyway, I really like the sound of this single; how everyone blends together!  I heard them once at the Shoreline Ampitheater in Mountain View, California.

Anyway, a blast from the past!!"

A3QS5UV4968O7C,B000WH0UKQ,1,1,5.0,I was reminded of this song on Cable music and remembered how great it was. So I had to buy a MP3 download from Amazon.
A1GJ832ASTPIZ8,B000WH0UKQ,1,1,5.0,This was purchased more as a replacement for my CD collection. This duet with Michael McDonald is one of her best songs.
A1Z2BK739AXXE3,B000WH0UKQ,1,1,5.0,This song says it all without you having to stumble through one attempt at how you're feeling when your relationship is over.  You cry and then you pick up the pieces and move on (unless he comes back - LOL!!!)
A2K23CE05XBXOI,B000WH0UKQ,1,1,5.0,Patti LaBelle sings this classic beautiful song with Michael McDonald from Doobie Brothers fame.  It is a song that I highly recommend for lovers of either artist.

AIOJQ6D6OQ43R,B000WGYZZS,1,1,5.0,"This is from a James Bond movie, played over the closing credits. I know most of you have the Celine Dion version of this, but trust me, this is the better version of this song. Soaring vocal like no one else and Patti makes you believe her. If you must have both, get this one first."
A103DHU1X6VC9T,B000WGYZZS,1,1,5.0,"I absolutely love this song. Pattie Labelle is an exceptional singer and the sound quality is very good. Buy it, buy it, buy it ! ! !"

A16T3KMKPG7MGQ,B000WGYZZS,1,1,5.0,I enjoy music a whole lot. it's good to find the old school music today. Most of the new Music today is missing what the old school music have. clean lyrics with a story to tell.
A3IH5L48F016GF,B000WH2CS4,1,1,5.0,"I grew up listening to The Dells. My dad has a great collection of old music. However, this song is played in the movie ""The Five Heartbeats""."

A2FLJBM1R6TIWX,B000WH0ULK,1,1,5.0,"This is such a great sounding and heartwarming song by Patti LaBelle - with a deep message - that I give it 5 stars.
Anybody who is a Patti LaBelle fan, and others, might find this enjoyable, as the message speaks to all of us.  It can make us think about appreciating what we (do) have when compared to seeing misfortune/s around us.
I think this is a gift from the many gems by Patti LaBelle.  Love it!  Enjoy!

Los Angeles, California"
A2BITHZ7QMA27J,B000WH2IDS,1,1,5.0,This is an obscure song by them and it is I think one of their best! The vocals are clear and so deeply touching. The wording is really great for this song. I know you will like it if you listen to it!
AOIQXY51I12F1,B000WH2IDS,1,1,4.0,Lyrical and beautifully written piece.  Very esoteric and moving.  Classic 60's innovation.  Recommend it to baby boomers and alternative music lovers.
A2VSNRJOQET5BM,B000WH2IDS,-1,1,5.0,"This was, I believe, the only other release by the Left Banke. This did not climb the charts as another of there releases did; ""Walk Away Renee"" was the other."

I like listening to oldies."

A38YATKTY2TNPJ,B000WH7EAU,1,1,5.0,"I just had to add this classic rock tune to my growing collection. A huge hit back in the day, it still gets air play even today. This rock ballad made very effective use of the violin to create a rock and roll classic. You can probably count the other hit tunes that made it big with violins on your fingers."
A1SCY185GQ341U,B000WH7EAU,1,1,5.0,Great music of the 60's!
A15T3Y3BL2AJ9V,B000WH7EAU,1,1,5.0,That song brings me back to 1966. 'Left Banke' was formed in New York City in 1965. Their ecclectic style was referred as 'Baroque Pop'. Their instrumental arrangements hint toward music from the J.S. Bach era. This is a very nice song. I still like to listen to it.
A1L3WBV2TZ1VXG,B000WH7EAU,1,1,5.0,One of the greatest songs of all time.
A3RM36CXFUCSV1,B000WH7EAU,1,1,5.0,"Being a Music Buff since my childhood & now, able to collect those favorite tunes from yesteryear ""Walk Away Renee by the Left Banke"" is one of my most favorites. While this selection was being played by most Rock-N-Roll ""AM"" Stations, I was going with a Young Lady named ""Renae"", She was Bright, Funny, So Affectionate, She was also very particular, and when I told her that I was going into the Military...Well ""it was all Over"". This Tune deals with something ""similar"", it's also a Classic among Classics ""In my own opinion of course"", Anyway I Like It, Enough Said."

AQMGZH232OM9I,B000WH7EAU,1,1,5.0,"This was one of the best songs to come out in the 60's.  It has a very pretty tune and anyone, who is collecting oldies, should definitely have this one in their collection."
A2M6RMUZ7XLEHJ,B000WH7EAU,-1,1,4.0,"I collect hits of the 60s.  Many of them, like Walk Away Renee I am old enough to recall but chose not to buy back in the day.  This was a monster hit in 1966.  13 weeks on the chart reaching #5.  Rolling Stone placed the song at number 220 in the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Nuff said."

AK1O1SSMJMUPE,B000WH7EAU,-1,1,5.0,"If I am forced to a specific number of words in rating songs, I will no longer leave a rating or a response. If I paid money for the song that should suffice that I wanted the song anything beyond that is not for my benefit. After payment that should be the end of my obligation. The rating system should be the stars only without having to leave comments."

Boyz 2 Men are known for their great harmony , and just like their previous Cd this CD does not disappoint. It is loaded with good music. If you are a fan of Boyz 2 Men get this CD asap."
A299AG3O394X32,B000WKT6B2,1,-1,3.0,"No denying their talent and vocal skills, but I like their debut more with fast dance and beats vice the downtempo ballads and at times maudlin songs."

A8SCX6VUTE05H,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5.0,"CooleyHighHarmony is a classic album that has yet to be topped by any of these so-called R&B artists that are out now. Boyz II Men put Philly on the map as well as laid themselves a strong foundation in R&B with that album. There was only one way they could have went after Cooleyhighharmony: up. And they did with this superb sophomore release.

There are too many tracks that are vintage Boyz II Men tracks. Thank You, All Around The World, Vibin and U Know are excellent tracks the the Philly quartet. I'll Make Love To You and On Bended Knee were on Blender(cheap knockoff of Rolling Stone) and Vh1 as awesomely bad songs countdown but those love ballads are classics so the hell with Blender and VH1! These are the songs that these immature little freaks were conceived to and they have the nerve to trash it but never once do they mention any Eminem, D12 or any Shady records artists as well as Justin Timberlake. Are they trying to say that none of these artists make awesomely bad records? Really? I find that type of favoritism questionable. Plus forms of media like Vh1, Blender and GQ only appeal to idiotic trendies that think that saying ""Meh"" at the beginning of every sentence and defending movies that stink to high heaven makes them hip.

50 Candles, Water Runs Dry, Trying Times and Yesterday are more smooth R&B ballads that give this album a much needed boost. There are no bad songs on this album so I'll keep going on.

Bottom Line: Boyz II Men's II is the best sophomore album from an R&B quartet of all time. The ballads are exceptional and the fast songs aren't bad plus the group still has what most groups R&B groups now sorely lack: harmony. If you love 90s R&B in its purest form you cant go wrong with this sophomore effort by Boyz II Men.

Standouts: THANK YOU, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, U KNOW, VIBIN, TRYING TIMES, I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU, ON BENDED KNEE, WATER RUNS DRY and YESTERDAY."
A28FNKCGFS03VL,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5.0,"Already world superstars with their first album, Cooleyhighharmony, Boyz II Men went boldly and brilliantly forward with this album, featuring two of their most beautiful ballads ever with the smash hit ""On Bended Knee"" and ""Water Runs Dry."" Also of note is the nonhit ""All Around The World"" in which the group does seem to take a trip of sorts around the world, stopping to please their legions of fans every step of the way."
A3PCTD8QM1BIXI,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5.0,"While most artists suffer a sohphmoe slump Boyz II Men did just the opposite and scored home run with the classic II. II is a carefully constructed crowd pleaser, accentuating all of the finest moments from their hit debut. While there are some high-energy dance tracks, the album's main strength is its slower numbers, where the group's vocals soar. The slow jams Trying Times & 50 Candles are excllent and can easily hang with any of the songs they've ever recorded. As far as the singles I'll Make Love To You, Yesterday, On Bended Knee and Water Runs Dry they need only word to describe them which is classic."
A25NMMI7AH30W2,B000WKT6B2,1,1,4.0,"In Boyz II Men's sophomore album, II, they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer Dallas Austin and founder Michael Bivins.  This LP begins with the deepest of gratitude on ""Thank You"" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.  Both ""All Around The World"" and ""U Know"" are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights.  One thing they do is provide another angle for Boyz II Men.  For a more relaxing environment, ""Vibin'"" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.  ""I Sit Away"" is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by Tony Rich and production by veteran L.A. Reid and Tony Rich.  Stepping into a more modern jazz feel ""Jezzebel"" strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal.  Over a piano solo, Boyz II Men harmonize on ""Khilil (Interlude)"" to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with ""Trying Times"" written and produced by Wanya Morris, Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson.  Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights ""I'll Make Love To You"" and ""Water Runs Dry"".  Heavyweights Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on ""On Bended Knee"".  ""50 Candles"" drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content ""...feels like one of those nights...""  They show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on ""Yesterday"" they perform accapella.  If real talent that you seek, members Shawn, Michael, Nathan and Wanya has uncompromising talent for any age, era, or time that you can enjoy for long time."
AYOO12C9Y2T95,B000WKT6B2,1,1,4.0,"Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to ""Cooleyhighharmony"", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group.

HIGHLIGHTS:

This album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before ""Khalil"") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half.

Part 1 has ""Thank You"" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. ""Vibin'"" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'/dancin' the night away/Groovin'/Vibin'/non-stop until the break of day). ""I Sit Away"" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and ""Nobody Knows""..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)

In the ""slow side"", Babyface's ""I'll Make Love to you"" set a record for the length of time at #1. ""On Bended Knee"" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and ""Water Runs Dry"" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic ""Yesterday"" and they pull off the True feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.

LOWS:

""All Around the World"" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's ""Travelin' Man"" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, ""Khalil"" is a pretty blah track. ""Jezzebel"" is a dull overlong affair. ""50 Candles"" includes the lyric ""Holding your body like a plastic molding""....'nuff said.

BOTTOM LINE:

There are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like ""I Sit By"" and ""Yesterday"" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans."
A2LNEZD3YBO12O,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5.0,"Boyz II Men were at their best with this album!  Excellent songs with I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, Water Runs Dry and some others.  They tear it up on the funky songs of the first half such as Vibin', I Sit Away, Thank You, Jezabel, and All Around The World. Loved their remake of the Beatles' Yesterday. This is an album that gave them many awards and multiplatinum success for the music and the harmonies alone.  And people like Babyface, Jam and Lewis, Brian McKnight and others produced some fabulous stuff here! A dynamic R&B effort with pop leanings that still holds up 10 years later!"
ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5.0,"This CD is a throwback to my youth.  I was about twelve years old when it came out--back when Boyz 2 Men was truly  a hot commodity.  They have a wonderful ""old school"" flavor reminiscent of the old doowop guy groups of 1960s.  This is especially evident in the four part harmonies, the smooth and romantic lyrics and the original interpretations of old standards (""Yesterday"").

Where do I begin to describe the mood of this wonderful and innovative R&B album?  There is something for everyone on this CD.  We have the funky, catchy ""Thank You"" that samples from ""La-Di-Da-Di"" performed by Doug E. Fresh.  The hook is infectious!  We have ""All Around the World"" to get you up and dancing, no doubt.  One of my personal favorites is ""I Sit Away,"" written by Tony Rich (of the Tony Rich Project fame).  It has a haunting hook and a beautiful, introspective feel.  Truly an ode to solitude.  There are also a couple of songs on this album that became huge hits for the fellas back in the early 1990s.  They include ""I'll Make Love to You"" (on those songs to get you in the mood), and ""Water Runs Dry.""

One of the strongest points of this album is the luscious arrangements and fine tuning of production on each of the cuts.  Even my least favorite of the songs--""50 Candles""--has a very sexy, clean and catchy arrangment.

Check this out!  And all of you young ones out there, don't write the Boyz as just another R&B band from the 1990s.  They were truly in a class by themselves."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000WKT6B2,1,-1,3.0,"For the music of 1994, the scene changed immediately, from Grunge to Hip Hop. In the case for Boyz II Men, they became even more popular then the boys from Philadelphia. At that time, they became bigger than most of the manufactured music out there. Although they started big, the ballads they were making were explosive.
The 1994 album, II became the most successful R&B album of the decade, selling almost 14 million albums, and launching 4 smash hit songs including Water Runs Dry, I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, and Thank You. At that time, they really proved that the music spoke for itself, not an image among all boundaries. The style blended beautifully with similar artists like The Temptations, The Four Tops, and even The Jackson 5. Nevertheless, they actually were at the very beginning of the Corporate Pop era that lead to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. Luckily, the music wasn't locked into Teen Idol stardom, which made Boyz II Men one of the most popular groups of the 90's.
It is kind of sad that a lot of teen acts that are out there aren't mature enough like Boyz II Men. It is just incredible to know that some acts constantly can't capture that era. Hopefully, the next True Soul group, can recapture the legacy Boyz II Men set."
A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B000WKT6B2,-1,-1,2.0,"Middling second album has the boyz in top vocal form, but the material they work with here is very, VERY average.  ""I'll Make Love to You"" is a safe, radio-friendly, G-rated ballad courtesy of Babyface, and even Jam and Lewis stumble on the through-the-motions ""On Bended Knee.""  Only on ""Water Runs Dry"" do things get a bit interesting.  It sold a gazillion copies, but does that really speak for album's quality?  Boyz II Men's sophomore offering is not quite a disaster, but it's a very dull record that plays by the rules and does nothing more.  Is that supposed to be progress?"
A2BO41VARYGTAC,B000WKT6B2,1,1,5.0,"Ok...here I go...I have to comment on the review of ""A lover of Mew"" (poor Mew), from July 22, 2000. He compares the Boyz as being on a par with Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Sade, and Kenny G. Oh come on, the first 3, of course not, they are completely different, and terrific in their own genres...but Kenny G, DOH! I think the Boyz would give up singing if they ever heard that one. Comparing Boyz 2 Men to Kenny G is like comparing silk to polyester, prime rib to hamburger, Belgian chocolates to dog chocolates and champagne to grape juice. Come on Mew! Hey, maybe there's a reason why, in your ""About Me"" section, you give yourself the nickname of ""The Jerk"".
Ok, now I have that out, I shall get back to the album. These guys are a talented foursome from Philly. Their vocal harmonies are of the best Motown tradition, but given a modern touch and are second to none. ""I'll make love to you"" is one of the most romantic songs ever, but we've come to expect great songs like that from Babyface. The Boyz also wrote quite a few of their own songs that are featured on this album,  which further showcases their talents. This album is a must for all R&B fans."

Yeah, that's what club owners wanna see. Forget how cheesy the track may be or if Soulja Boy is a one hit wonder. Time will tell. It is what it is, a brilliant marketing plan complete with solid online interaction with fans. Soulja Boy is everywhere from YouTube and beyond. The song is simple, catchy, and a lot of fun for children.  Nothing more, nothing less. No need to bash Soulja Boy or publicly diss him like Ice-T and Snoop Dogg did. Either you'll like it or you won't! There are a lot of copycat versions of it too. They all suck to be honest, but the Travis Barker Remix is worth listening too.

Also when I purchase songs from Amazon MP3 the music sounds so much better and clearer as opposed to other music formats. I was not recommended this song from anyone I just knew this song from the first time it was published and had to have this song back. Thanks Amazon MP3!

A2QAZW64EZDJ7Q,B000WL7MXU,1,1,5.0,Man! This is a great group of songs from the 50's & 60's. Original recordings by the people who sang them. I listen to this cd every day I go out walking. 43 songs to bring you back to where you were and what you were doing back then. I think all us older (over 50 years old) folks will get a kick hearing these old favorites. It's a great price for a lot of music. Well worth the money.
A23XM3YT3QH1AF,B000WL7MXU,1,1,5.0,I totally enjoyed this group of songs. They were all performed by their original artists and good recordings which even included a couple of Elvis; songs. Totally worth the few bucks I spent.

AJUNJ4JWSULI0,B000WL7MXU,-1,1,4.0,"I bought this set back last September when it was 50 Originals instead of Greatest (43) Originals. Ironically, back then I wrote ""It's a darned shame that at least a one unmarked re-recording snuck into this set. Runaway is obviously not the original version. (That's the only one I'm sure about; perhaps other reviewers can find more.) At least half of these songs really are the originals, and the collection would be easily worth the money just for them. I would have given ""45 Real Originals"" a 5-star review, but the sour taste of a re-recording lowers my rating for ""50 (Mostly) Originals"" to 4 stars.""

Now we've dropped below 45 songs, but that re-recording of Runaway is still one of them. This package is still a great value, but for sneaking in this clunker, I can only give it 4 stars.

A14OKOZW0PDTAD,B000WL7MXU,1,1,4.0,This was a good mixture of songs at a great price of $1.69. Says 50 originals but a few might be re-recordings.
AJUNJ4JWSULI0,B000WL7MXU,-1,1,4.0,"I've never heard of this label, but somebody sure did a great job of assembling 50 hits in a collection that's cheaper than buying two individual songs. In a category full of cover bands and re-recordings, it's great to hear True original songs, and their clarity is an unusual bonus for an oldies collection.

On the other hand, it's a darned shame that at least a one unmarked re-recording snuck into this set. Runaway is obviously not the original version.

Seeing someone that you have always loved happy with another special person that finally captured their heart is a blessing and a beautiful thing. It's a hard thing to swallow but it is not only easier to let go of them in so many ways but seeing them finally find their someone too and knowing yourself also has your own someone special makes everything just beautiful in all shades..

A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000WLICZC,1,1,5.0,"Strange enough, you don't hear many songs on rock radio, that actually know how to rock. ""Psycho"" however rocks the house down with its almost Nirvana alt hard rockin'. Nope, this song isn't afraid to let out a yell or two, or three, but their not screaming through the whole song either. Nope, it's a perfect blend sure to please a real rock radio listener.

The verses work very nicely, and keep the song moving toward the main show of the chorus. And the chorus really rocks. Sure, it might be a little too familiar for rock radio in its short burst of the 1st round, but it saves all its energy for the rest of the song, when it brings the house down with its catchy and infectious energy that sounds right out of the 90's.

Overall, with its loaded gun of energy, and familiar, but still rockin' elements driving it, if you listen to rock radio, you're going to love it. This song really took me back to that 90's alt rock movement with bands like Collective Soul and Nirvana, and ""Psycho"" certainly does the greats justice."

A3D9KO6R1JB845,B000WLIL62,1,1,5.0,"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer has always been 1 of my favorite Christmas songs. However there aren't many versions of the song I like. But Burl Ives performance of Rudolph is fantastic. This version is slower and longer than the version from the TV show featured on the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer soundtrack. But this version is still up tempo and very well sung. Unfortunately too many artists ruin this song by trying to make their renditions too much their own. Dean Martin refers to Rudolph as ""Rudy"" in a few lines of the song and Jewel performs this song in a horribly slow and dragged out manner. Burl Ives sings this song the way it's supposed to be sung and keeps it at that and that's why Burl Ives performances of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer are the best versions of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer that exist."

A1OTC9I35U0TXT,B000WLIN4C,1,1,5.0,George Strait is my favorite country and western singer.  I have just about all of his number one singles and play them often.
A3D9QZXGU3KV5O,B000WLIN4C,1,1,5.0,"Love, love, love George. And this is by far one of my very favorite songs. It makes you want to get up and dance."
A2DJYERRIH5C8T,B000WLIE7I,1,-1,3.0,"The hits just keep coming on this cd.  He never strayed too far from the style that made his songs hits in the first place and he kept having hits after anybody else would have faded off a long time ago.  Ther are 16 songs on this cd.  Opening with The Best day shich tells the story of what you consider the best day of your life.  Depending on what part of your life you happen to be in.  Murder on Music Row is the story about what Nashville and radio has done to the legends of music.  Done as a duet with Alan Jackson it wasn't as big of a song as I would have thought it had been.  Then the rest of the cd is one hit after another.  Like Adlida, Carried Away, Blue Clear Sky,His  rodeo song I Can Still Make Cheyenne.  You could play this cd on random and every song is Truely a hit.  And of course after this came out he kept having hits.  Same old King George."
A1TGCU5CZF9LKA,B000WLIE7I,1,1,5.0,"George Strait has had so many number one hits it's kind of hard to count. He had 50 a couple of years ago, but he's had so many since than, I honestly don't know.

This set documents most of his best work of the 1990s, and includes two mighty fine new recordings, 'The Best Day' and the duet with country music legend Alan Jackson, 'Murder On Music Row.' You also get some of his finest songs of the 1990s as a country chart topper, including 'Lead On' and 'Carrying Your Love With Me.'

And, MCA did a great job remastering the songs too. The sound quality is excellent!

Overall, this is a great set to own. And if you own 'Greatest Hits Vol. 2' and/or 'Greatest Hits,' pair it with this, and you have a mighty fine George collection.

Highly recommended for the new or casual Strait fan. You'll get your money's worth with this set. Very entertaining. ENJOY!!!"
A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000WLIE7I,1,1,5.0,"The album picks up George's career where the boxed set (Strait out of the box) ends, so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998. It shows that George's style was evolving but still firmly rooted in traditional country music.

The album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album, the first (The best day) being an excellent ballad. The second song (Murder on music row) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle, a bluegrass performer. Here, George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson. George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet, George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song. While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place, they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days.

The remaining tracks are taken from just four albums, these being Lead on (Adalida, Lead on, You can't make a heart love somebody), Blue clear sky (the title track, Carried away, I can still make it to Cheyenne, King of the mountain), Carrying your love with me (the title track, Round about way, One night at a time, Today my word slipped away) and One step at a time (True, We really shouldn't be doing this). Of these songs, Today my world slipped away is a cover of a Vern Gosdin country hit but the others (as far as I know) are original songs.

Picking out highlights in such a strong collection is difficult, but I'll nominate Murder on Music Row, Adalida, Blue clear sky and King of the mountain. If you are new to George's music, this compilation makes a great introduction."
A1ALPL858XSDE,B000WLIE7I,1,1,4.0,"Hallelujah!  George Strait and MCA have finally released a single-disc collection of hits that isn't skimpy!  Unlike Strait's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks, of which two are new recordings.  Specifically, it picks up where the multi-disc retrospective Strait Out Of  The Box leaves off, with the old hits culled from Strait's 1994 through  1998 albums.
 While more extensive, this anthology is far from  perfect however.  ""Lead On"" and ""King Of The Mountain"" (the latter barely  scraped into the top 20) drag along unmelodically and are slower than  molasses.  Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits  (""I Can Still Make Cheyenne"" recalling ""Amarillo By Morning"" and  ""Adalida""  bringing to mind ""The Love Bug"").  With ""Carrying Your Love With Me"" and  ""Carried Away,"" Strait even repeats himself within the same collection.
  If you think I am getting too nit-picky about this set, you may be right.  The crisp, heartfelt delivery on ""You Can't Make A Heart Love Somebody"" is  just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country  music.  And as ""Blue Clear Sky"" and ""Round About Way"" illustrate, no one  handles a play-on-words more effectively than Strait.  You'd also be  hard-pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than ""We  Really Shouldn't Be Doing This.""
 The two new singles contribute in  mixed degrees to the Strait legacy.  Recent chart-topper ""The Best Day"" is  nice, but it also seems too similar to some old hits (""Love Without End,  Amen,"" ""Check Yes Or No).""  Here our protagonist progresses through a love  for camping, cars, and finally, his ideal woman.  Much better is ""Murder On  Music Row,"" a duet with Alan Jackson.  This mega-event pairing of two of  modern country's most traditional (and successful) artists is an  effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today's  country....
 As  noted earlier, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is not flawless.  In light of  its several strong points, however, it has to be recommended as a must buy  for all country music listeners."
A1MAZQUR7WF4,B000WLIN4M,1,1,4.0,"I liked the music in this one, the music of the refrain, more than all the lyrics in total.  I wish the lyrics were stronger.  George Strait can make anything sound great!"

A9Q28YTLYREO7,B000WLIE7I,1,1,4.0,George Strait Sounds Real Good On the Duet with Alan Jackson Murder On Music Row. Country Music Like other Styles OF Music have Been Increasingly watered Down over the Past Decade for More Mainstream Acceptance but Strait  doesn't fall into that trap. His Music Has stayed solid. Adalida still sounds  great. He is One Of The Very Few Artists in Country Keeping the Music Real.

AO4WLAROM2JQI,B000WLJDSC,1,1,5.0,This is one of the best box sets you will ever buy.  And watching George play this as his last song on stage in Texas just reminded me of how great it is.
A3D9KO6R1JB845,B000WLJDSC,1,1,5.0,The Cowboy Rides Away is a fantastic song and George Strait's performance on it is superb. The Cowboy Rides Away is a song that you just listen to and just feel it. What a wonderful piece.
A2HGQ2FZNXH1GH,B000WLJDSC,1,1,5.0,I'm not a huge (or regular) country music fan but I keep an open mind to all kinds of music and have always liked George Strait.

A1UNR1BH9BLVXP,B000WLJDSC,1,1,5.0,George Strait continues to raise the bar each and every song he produces.  He out produces those half his age and gives the fans a new song that is relatable to all.
A1ILIA9UCC6PXC,B000WLJDSC,1,1,5.0,"When I saw George sing this as his tribute to Dick Clark during the ACM awards, I just had to have it.  The words are appropriate to Dick Clark and of course just the cowboy ethic that George Strait personifies also.  Both guys were CLASS ACTS."

A1ALPL858XSDE,B000WLLA8S,1,1,5.0,"If you only know Billy Currington from ""Party For Two,"" his hit duet with Shania Twain, you need to expand your horizons and check out his 2003 self-titled debut and this latest gem, which reveal what Currington is really capable of vocally and stylistically.

DOIN' SOMETHIN' RIGHT opens and closes with foot stompers (""I Wanna Be A Hillbilly,"" ""She Knows What To Do With A Saturday Night"") which will have you dancing in the streets (or at least at your local honkytonk).  It between, we get a somewhat gentler Billy, with the title track/lead off single providing a relaxed yet heartfelt delivery, and a lusty ""Little Bit Lonely"" plus ""Here I Am"" showcasing incredible charisma.

""Good Directions"" is the type of down home, good ol' boy number that Kenny Chesney succeeds with (again and again and again).  Billy's remake of ""Lucille"" is a nice update, hitting a little harder than Kenny Rogers' original, while a collaboration with Michael McDonald on ""She's Got A Way With Me"" offers a power ballad change of pace.

Hopefully, this diverse collection will elevate Billy to the next level on the country music food chain.  It's a fine effort that clearly avoids the sophomore jinx."

AQ81L25HHHB18,B000WLNUN6,1,1,4.0,"As odd as it may be, out of the hundreds of CDs in my collection, few of them are Christmas CDs, and of the Christmas CDs I do have, there aren't many of them that I listen to very often, even during the holidays. This one is one of the exceptions. One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall ""laid-back"" feel. I like that it isn't wild or very rocking. Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me (usually, anyway). Burl, with his warm, friendly voice, doesn't come across as a ""celebrity"" but as more of a ""grandfatherly"" figure. The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back-up vocals. Of course, the title track and ""Rudolph"" are probably the most-known tracks on the album, but the others are good, too. The album has one of the best versions of ""Little Drummer Boy"" that I've heard! ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" closes the album perfectly. Right now, it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s) from the album, but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song, and it would probably be ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away."" The only thing I really dislike about this album is how short it is (under 30 minutes). It would have been nice if it had included some bonus stuff, or had been paired with Burl Ives' Christmas Album (which contains completely different material). But still, this is a wonderful album!"
A12R54MKO17TW0,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5.0,"Burl Ives
Have a Holly Jolly Christmas

There are a few different Burl Ives Christmas CD's on the market and so I encourage you to check them out to see which one you like the best.  This is a very very good one.  The version of ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" here is NOT version from the famous cartoon.  This version is much slower than the famous version, but is equally good.  Whichever CD you choose, if you're going to play Christmas music, you ought to have a Burl Ives CD along with your Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby CDs.
Five Stars"
A1OTC9I35U0TXT,B000WLMNEI,1,1,4.0,It is an older song but it has a good beat and I also like the sentiment of the words.
AS02LU5CR8VJP,B000WLMNEI,-1,1,5.0,This is one of few country songs I love. It is a studio recording and is not a live or concert version.
A3LVQVYXBL6T7U,B000WLMNEI,1,1,5.0,"Billy Currington has  a great song here that fits right in to today's country music spectrum. It's original punch line is delivered outside of the usual country cliches, yet remains very country in it's content and performance."
AARHFHP17QFNG,B000WLMNEI,1,1,5.0,"I really liked this song from the first time I heard it. Humorous. Great music, lyrics and voice. I love it!"

A3923W0OJNGUHN,B000WLMNEI,1,1,5.0,"I use to stop working to hear this song. SO I had to get it as a single when I found it.
I like the way he sings."
A1RUBF0FK78E5Y,B000WLNUN6,1,1,4.0,"I've had this CD for some time. It contains two of Burl's classic holiday songs, Holly Jolly Christmas and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Santa Claus is Coming To Town is on here too. Burl puts his own spin on holiday faves like White Christmas, Winter Wonderland, Silver Bells and I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.

There are some unfamiliar songs on here that you don't hear, like  Christmas is a Birthday, Christmas Child and Snow For Johnny. Burl does justice to all of them. A nice CD to have in your holiday collection."
A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5.0,"Burl Ives really isn't remembered as much as he should be these days; and that's a shame. On this album Burl sings wonderfully; and his friendly, grandfatherly vibes go into every song he sings! This CD is a must-have for fans of Burl; and anyone who wants some very special holiday songs would do well to add this to their music collection. The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is very nicely done.

The title track opens the album; this catchy, infectiously happy and upbeat tune could never go out of style; and Burl practically owns this song the way he delivers it. He puts a lot of positive energy into his version of this song; and it shows quite clearly when I hear him perform it. Great! ""Christmas Is a Birthday"" is very easy on the ear; what a charming ballad--and it's religious, too. ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" switches gears back to a more secular song; Burl puts his own stamp on this tune by playing a bit with the tempo and a few key changes--and it all holds its own very well.

""White Christmas"" glows brighter than silver and gold combined when Mr. Ives sings it; that background chorus rounds out the number nicely although wisely the arrangement makes it so that they can't attempt to share the spotlight with Burl. ""The Little Drummer Boy"" has another terrific arrangement; the percussion and guitar are used very well and the music fits perfectly with Burl Ives' singing. In addition, ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" leaves nothing to be desired--this music is all THAT good!

""Winter Wonderland"" shines bright in Burl's capable hands; I really like this number. ""Silver Bells"" couldn't have been done any better and the CD ends with Burl Ives performing ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day."" I haven't heard this number as often as I've heard the other tunes on this CD but it's really quite beautiful and it even leaves me wanting more.

Burl Ives turned out a wonderful record album back in 1965; and it's amazingly wonderful to have this on CD in our times so that we can enjoy it over and over again. I highly recommend this album; it's full of splendid holiday music."
A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000WLNUN6,1,1,5.0,"The only complaint about ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas"" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums.  His first, ""Christmas Day in the Morning,"" came out in 1952, followed by ""Christmas Eve"" in 1956.  ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas"" came out in 1965, with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" the following year.  The title song of this album was written by for the special by Johnny Marks, who also wrote the song ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" which Ives sings on this album, and the final track, ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.""  That is a pretty good trio of Christmas songs, which would make Marks one of the best writers of Christmas songs ever.

How this album is different from the previous Burl Ives Christmas albums is that he has shifted to this point to more of a pop-oriented approach to singing Christmas songs that the traditional folk style that defined his earlier albums.  There are still some folk songs on this album, with ""Christmas is a Birthday,"" ""Christmas Child (Loo, Loo, Loo),"" ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away,"" and ""Snow for Johnny.""  But most of the songs are definitely more popular than secular, with ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"" ""White Christmas,"" ""Winter Wonderland,"" and ""Silver Bells.""  I tend to think of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" as being more religious than it really us, but that is more because the music is more hymn-like.

The net result is that you have Burl Ives singing eight recognizable Christmas songs and introducing you to four songs that you have probably not heard before that are perfectly suited to his strengths as a singer.  Ives started out in the 1920s as an itinerate folk singers, moved to Broadway in the 1930s, appeared on the radio in the 1940s, and became a popular folk singer in the 1950s.  But most people today probably remember him as the Snowman who narrates the story of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" that still airs each holiday season forty years later.  Because of that connection it is entirely possible that a Burl Ives Christmas album will be warmly received in your home by those who do not know about the rest of his resume.  He certainly produces the requisite warm seasonal feelings."

I love ""When She Gets Close to Me"" and ""Next Time"", of course ""Walk a Little Straighter"" gives me chills each time I hear it. Billy can also cut loose and have fun on songs like ""Off My Rocker"" and ""Where the Girls Are"". This guy is going places and I look forward to following..."

A3LPZ3KE5TAZMA,B000WLTDIM,1,1,5.0,"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play ""Amarillo By Morning,"" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to ""Amarillo by Morning.""

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered."

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B000WLQKPQ,1,1,5.0,Must Be Doing Something Right by Billy Currington is a heartfelt love song that appears to be about two people in a close and strong relationship (whether long-term and/or married) and the singer is giving praise and reminding himself how great things are.  This is definitely a perfect love song to add to an uplifting love song playlist.

AK0CENM3LUM28,B000WLQKQ0,1,1,4.0,"Bailamos (Enrique Iglesias) / B000WLQKQ0

I hadn't heard of Enrique Iglesias until he showed up on my Pandora radio play list, but this song is a truly lovely dance song. The instrumentals are stunning, and Iglesias' smooth and deep strains complement the style perfectly. There's nothing terribly *new* in this song - it's a very standard dance-and-romance song - but a song doesn't need to be innovative to be beautiful, raw, and real. Listen to the sample and you may love it.

Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.

A1YSJO181F6H01,B000WLTDIM,1,1,5.0,This may be one of George Strait's earliest work but it never goes out of style. You don't have to be a cowboy to enjoy this classic.
A2TL3M5614FTZ8,B000WLTDIM,1,1,5.0,"Never got old. The music, the lyrics, it's just good ol' country music before it changed so much. All of George Strait's old music definitely has a nice message and good music to go with it. Not to mention its the kind of stuff you can listen to with family."

We are fortunate to have a wealth of music talent here and access to great live music at multiple venues every night of the week. I try to take advantage in my middle age.

I played and then she said oh yeah, I do like this one a lot. When I searched, the song it did come up, but I didn't recognize the lyrics. I admit had a little trouble finding, because I heard this song on a tv show. I knew the name of artist (Linda Perry), but not the song title.

A1WPFIZ8P3O86V,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5.0,"Most people wanting a representative collection of Patsy Cline's hits for their music library will be satisfied with the 22 songs included on this single disc collection - 59 minutes altogether.

It has 'Crazy', that great Willie Nelson song that has played from jukeboxes and bars throughout American for the past few decades, always sounding as good as ever. I think it's considered to be the most played song ever, by whoever keeps track of such things. Its worth getting this album for that track alone, although if you are download friendly then you could shortcut that process and simply purchase the track all by itself.

But if you did that, you'd miss the 21 other great songs here, starting with 'Walkin' after Midnight', and continuing one after another to transport us to those days in the late 1950's and early 1960's when Patsy Cline was at the top of her career.

The only better collection for just about anyone short of Patsy Cline fanatics would be this one -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patsy-Cline-Gold/dp/B0007OY44M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patsy Cline: Gold</a>&nbsp;- that includes all of the 22 tracks on this 'Definitive' disc, plus 10 more, spread over 2 CDs.

A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5.0,"Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley, September 8, 1932 - March 5, 1963) was a superbly gifted country music singer--very few could, can or ever will match her ability to take any tune and make it sound wonderful, special, fresh and very new! Patsy also put her heart and soul into everything she sang; and that's grand. Sadly, she died so young in a private plane crash; but at least she lives on through her music. This is an excellent CD of her artistry for both fans and newcomers alike.

There's not a single dud in the lot here; every song is just that good! ""Walkin' After Midnight,"" written by  Alan Block and Donn Hecht, is a fine way to start the track set--Patsy is squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! The music, as is the case with all the tracks here, fits in perfectly with Patsy's vocals. ""A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)"" is very well done and Patsy does a great job on ""Lovesick Blues"" which is a number I really like. ""I Fall to Pieces"" (Pasty's first #1 hit on the country charts and her second hit on the pop charts) and ""True Love"" from Patsy's 1961 album entitled ""Patsy Cline Showcase"" are most poignant and Patsy sings ""San Antonio Rose"" with panache--I love it! ""Crazy,"" a number by Willie Nelson, shines bright in Patsy's more than capable hands; it's her signature song despite the fact that she didn't like it at all initially!

""Strange"" is very well done--there's some backup vocals for Patsy and while they do sound pretty good Patsy never really needed backup; her talent carried her through every time! Patsy's interpretation of Hank Cochran's ""She's Got You"" is very impressive; and Patsy's ""Heartaches"" is easily the very best I've ever heard! ""Half As Much"" is easy on the ear even if the lyrics aren't all that happy while ""When I Get through with You (You'll Love Me Too)"" is certainly more upbeat. ""Imagine That"" gets a fine treatment from Patsy and ""So Wrong"" yet again features Patsy's beautiful contralto voice. ""Why Can't He Be You"" is another moving number.

""Leavin' on Your Mind"" is an incredibly fine tune that gets the royal treatment from Patsy Cline and ""When You Need a Laugh"" is a real gem! ""Back in Baby's Arms"" has a great sound to it as do the other numbers here and songs like ""Faded Love"" make me wish so badly that Patsy was still with us. ""Always"" is a classic for sure and the album ends with two splendid songs, Harlan Howard's ""He Called Me Baby"" and Don Gibson's ""Sweet Dreams (Of You).""

Patsy Cline shared so much of her gift with us that we are all better off for it. I highly recommend her exceptional music."

A28HZTGUEXWSGV,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5.0,Patsy Cline is a True classic.  There has yet to be a country singer to match her!  Listening to this CD is truly wonderful.  It is one of my favorites of all time and I don't even consider myself to be a country music fan!
A1LAW35XZ4AKZF,B000WM0OQQ,1,1,5.0,I had forgotten all about this version until I watched Stuck on you so I  researched the song and bought it!

A2OAKHL0E0A4YQ,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5.0,"There are icons in all types of music. Patsy Cline is an icon in country music. She is one of the few artists who sings with such emotion, she can put a lump in my throat. This one features 22 of her greatest works. There are way too many personal favorites like: Sweet Dreams, I Fall to Pieces, Back In Baby's Arms, She's Got You, Crazy and well really she could make any song come alive with emotion. The sound is superb. My only beef is that I purchased this for only 8.95 at Wal-Mart in the cardboard box and it does not feature a booklet with dates, personnel. Well, I'm an old record nerd, but for most people that may not matter. (All these songs were recorded between 1957 and 1963, the year of her tragic plane crash). If all you want is the music, this is one everyone should have in their home. Patsy Cline was in the forefront of lady country singers and the ""Countrypolitan"" sound of country music which brought country music from the sticks to the city. She was a once in a lifetime singer!"
A5S3JYV2I3KDW,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5.0,This is the first country album I ever bought. After listening to it in iTunes I immediately changed the genre to Rockabilly. Patsy Kline is by far the best and only Rockabilly album I own. I give most of the songs a 5 or 4.
AGEIT17HENDIS,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5.0,"Frankly, on the face of it Patsy Cline would not fall into my idea of a torch singer. That is, until you heard that voice coming out of the past to chill you to the marrow with her heart-rendering versions of some very classic country and crossover ballads. For those of us who came of age in the late 1950's or early 1960's this was the music at the high school dance where you got to ask that guy or girl that you had your eye on for that slow dance that gave you time to talk and feel out the situation. Thanks, Patsy. This volume contains so many classics it is hard to know where to begin but I counted at least 15 that you ABSOLUTELY need to listen to. That, my friends, rather says it all. Classic Hank Willaims tunes like Cheating Heart, Willie Nelson's Crazy, others like Why's He Not You and She's Got Him. Wow. A few non-ballad novelty type songs could have been left out and done no damage but when you look at the overall package. Again, WOW."
A1J5KCZC8CMW9I,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,4.0,"Her couple 12 track ""Greatest Hits"" albums are indeed great, but this is truly the definitive collection of Patsy Cline. 22 remastered tracks in all, that sound even better than you remember. If you're searching for THE female voice in classic country, search no more. I enjoy every song here, but the stand-outs surely are ""I Fall To Pieces"", ""Walkin' After Midnight"", ""Back In Baby's Arms"", and of course ""Crazy"". If today's country radio sounded this good, I might still listen to it. These songs are wonderful to play around the house, with your kids, and especially with your ""True Love"". Highly recommended."
A2MVZS39F3XKH3,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5.0,"Whether you love classic country music or hate it, whether you were there to hear Patsy sing ""Walkin' After Midnight"" in 1957 or saw the movie ""Sweet Dreams"" OR just discovered her, this is a compilation that will not let you down. This Winchester, Virginia, native thrilled the music world like no other and continues to do so, long after her untimely death in a plane crash with country singers Hawkshaw Hawkins and Cowboy Copas.  Patsy could make her voice break and thus break our hearts with her soulful rendering of songs written (and often recorded) by some of country music's greatest.  Consider ""Sweet Dreams"" (Don Gibson), ""Crazy"" (Willie Nelson), ""I Fall to Pieces"", ""She's Got You"", ""Why Can't He Be You?"" (Hank Cochran), ""Back in Baby's Arms"" (Bob Montgomery whose life has been rich in ""country"", including a pre-Crickets duo with Buddy Holly), ""Faded Love"" (co-written by Bob Wills of Texas Playboys fame), ""Leavin' On Your Mind"" (co-written by country/honky tonk great Webb Pierce) and ""Always"" by one of the all-time great composers of American standards, Irving Berlin.  If you want just one Patsy Cline CD, this is probably the one for you."
A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B000WLTMPQ,1,1,5.0,"Patsy set the standard for female country singers, with many of those that followed trying (or so it seemed) to be the next Patsy Cline - even today, over forty years after her death in a plane crash. Many compilations are available but most of them seem to miss something important. Not this one - all of Patsy's classic songs can be found here.

Crazy was a top ten pop hit in America and (in 1990) a top twenty hit in Britain. Heartaches was Patsy's first American top forty pop hit. Don Gibson wrote Sweet dreams and had a big country hit with it, but once Patsy recorded it, it became much more popular and will be forever thought of as a Patsy Cline song. She's got you was an American top twenty pop hit and was also Patsy's first British hit, albeit only a minor one I fall to pieces was yet another top twenty pop hit in America. Walking after midnight is the song that began it all for Patsy in the fifties. Poor man's roses, Back in baby's arms and Leaving on your mind are other Patsy classics included here. Faded love, a cover of a Bob Wills song that, like Sweet dreams, is regarded as a Patsy Cline classic despite being a cover.

Also here are Patsy's fine interpretations of Lovesick blues, Half as much (Hank Williams), True Love (Bing Crosby), San Antonio rose (Bob Wills), Always (written by Irving Berlin) and many other fine songs.

If you just want one CD of Patsy's music, make it this one."

Those red light low, while you dig the flow, and your sweet baby grinding on your leg; Baby I'm for real, many have covered this tune, but it is still The Originals that will send the both of you flying to the moon. pick this tune, and let it inspire you to pick up that fancy pen you put away for the phone, and write your baby some words from this song: You still remember how to write don't you, or have your thumbs replaced the plume."

A2BHEPYIDR182L,B000WOWR00,1,1,5.0,"What is there to say,that hasn't already been said about this song? It is amazing. It is one of those songs I would never get tired of."
A24RRTWFT5KILR,B000WOXOQ6,-1,1,5.0,"This is the version of the song from January 1980. Amazon encoded at 256 kpbs. If Ray, Goodman & Brown sound familiar it's because they where previously known as ""The Moments"" with the hit ""Love On A Two-Way Street"" (also a major hit for Stacy Lattisaw in 1981).

Classic 1970's sound. Ray died at age 45. His smooth voice is missed."
A1PJP9MKDSGZPV,B000WOWXD6,1,1,4.0,"The Jam, just sad only a few albums! Love the Bollywood beats... Indian tantric sounds are amazing... Cop this!"
A310KT1UQC5UNU,B000WOWXD6,1,1,5.0,"I love this song;  I've pretty much been addicted to it ever since it was first released back in 2002.  As a matter of fact, I have the Truth Hurts CD which includes this single.  Nonetheless, I was unable to resist purchasing the MP3 version so that I can listen to it on my Kindle and Ipod.  The tune is quite mesmerizing and, I think, soothing,  Strange, I know, considering it's sung in high pitched voice.  LOL  I recently introduced my five and seven year olds to it and they both love it.  My daughter--7--says it reminds her of Arabian dancers."

,B000WOUTKA,1,1,5,"This is exactly the type of song I expected from Tom Petty. A very unique style  but, one that I really like."

,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,Love this song I was glad to have found it at such a great price. Clear sound and instant delivery
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,This song was an easy download.  The cloud player/downloader makes it very easy to purchase Mp3 songs from Amazon.  I also love the deals that are available via the music store.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,"...to the house parties of the 70s and 80s. Slow music, slow dancing, red light in the basement, a fine dude kissing your neck....sorry...I got carried away. If you want to remember those good ol' times, buy this song."
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,great band love their music
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,Like!!
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,Great track!!

,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,One of the best song's of the 80's I miss this group. Real music back then.
,B000WOWPZM,1,-1,3,"The quality of the song is a little crackly. I heard this song on the radio the other night, and I wanted to have it on my MP3 player. It is a good song. If you find a version with a better quality, go for that version instead."
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,"Have you ever just been driving in your car and you hear those first few notes and all of a sudden you are overcome with emotion.  You begin driving with one hand, the other is now a microphone or a very vivid gesturer of your feelings.  Your voice begins without you realizing, singing along with all of the memories of past best friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, and imaginary friends swimming in front of your eyes.  Then you realize that you are crying as you sing at the loudest your emotion allows. Two hands on the wheel now, clinging while you say whoa-oa-oa. Then your hand returns, holding up a hush finger to your memory, ""Don't speak!"" you wail.  The words all come to you and for about five minutes you are overcome.  Wherever you are, red light, freeway, parking lot, side streets, or waiting for the song to end before you leave your car because you are at your destination, you sing.
This song deserves more than just that karaoke rendition in your car. It deserves to be heard more.  It deserves to be owned.
Buy this song.  Sing this song."
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,4,I remember hearing this song when I was in college.  I had to download it for my Ipod just for old times sake.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,"See this is considered GOOD MUSIC. This song has a positive vibe about it, that will make you feel good whatever you are going through."
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,"What can I say about this Excellent Group that would do them justice other than how GREAT they are.  I have loved this group from the first time I heard him until this day!  They are a family that has some of the greatest voices in the music bussiness.  Their harmonies will make you sing along with them and if you love music like I do you'll be singing their tunes in your head too.

My whole family loves this group and one of its members brothers gave my sister a kiss on the cheek when she got her album autographed.  They were very nice and continue to this day to make fabulous music.  I miss them creating new sounds although some of them still perform like El Debarg one of the brothers.  If you and your special sweetie want to hear some mellow danceable jams, Get This One!"
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,Love finding classic songs that take me back to my childhood and remind me of family car trips and vacations.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,This song is a good one. This is the song you would love to sing and hum. And you can listen to this song.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,I remember when this song came out in the 80's . Oh my word this  song  bring back a lot of good memories. And tells you how a man should make a woman feel.
,B000WOXVOQ,1,1,5,I certainly enjoyed this item.  I would definitely recommend it to any and everyone who is interested in this item!

,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,Great song.
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,Love it
,B000WOWPZM,1,1,5,Fell in love with this song when I heard the Spanish guitar playing in it. And who can't relate to this song as we have all been broken hearted at least once in our life by someone. Never get tired of this song.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,Great classic song with a good beat.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,"There are the songs that really made the the 60's and 70's and this is one of them. This is not a one hot wonder band, listen and you will find most of their songs are what your parents and older siblings were listening to. Thats how I first was introduced to these vibes, from my older brothers. Not my generation but it's good for the soul"
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,4,Great band
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,here we go again. My band. Man these guys really know how to harmonize.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,Love
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,"Roots rock song from the 1950s - great lyrics - True as still today, as then."
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,Great song from back in the day.  Lot's of humor in the song and very original. Love to listen to this t ok brighten up my mood.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,Sounds just like it did when it was famous.  Love the group and this song is a favorite. I recommend it.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,4,"Good music: good song good artist. Hope this music flows down to the next generation of artists at some point...I'm a little worried at the direction the music is going, but we always got these classics to listen to"
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,4,"While trying for many years to upgrade my music system to include songs that were important to me, I found this song done by Three Dog Night that I enjoyed very much when it first came out. I decided that I should buy this song and include it my system, and am very glad that I did."
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,I grew up with classic rock that my Dad introduced me to.  He made sure that I knew what good music was no matter what the genre!
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,3 dog night was a staple rock band. The very idea of anyone reviewing songs from the 70's without mentioning them is wrong in every way. Mama Told Me is the center of their rocking.
,B000WQ6XL2,1,1,5,"I rate this band a 5 star because they sound great. Yes, its an older band but still sound just as good listeing to them now as they did back then. A must hear kind of song."
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,I already owned Three Dog Night's Joy To The World Greatest Hits collection -- and this song was not included.  A great single purchase finish the 3DK collection.
,B000WQ6XL2,-1,1,4,I bought this tune just as a trip down memory lane and it did send me back to the 70s. It is a somewhat cheesy tune with vocal with lots of affectation which has some comic value. The recording doesn't really hold up and needs to be remastered. But if like me you need a brief escape to the70s this might do the trick.
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,These songs helped us get through the difficult times cause it spoke about the feelings we had that we could not put into words..
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,Three dog night is an awesome group. I love their songs and this one is a great song.
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,Great
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,This is classic music and I love this group and this song particularly. I listen to this all the time in my Ipod
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,I grew up with classic rock that my Dad introduced me to.  He made sure that I knew what good music was no matter what the genre!
,B000WQ6XK8,1,-1,3,...the best songs Three Dog Night did.  But it's okay.  Downloaded it because it brought back memories of losing my first real love...
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,I bought this song as a gift for my dad although I myself have been listening to it very often.
,B000WQ6XK8,1,1,5,"Sounds great, downloaded without errors and meets expectations.  Amazon offers a great selection of music and they're are my preferred download site."
,B000WQNGCG,1,1,5,Good song
,B000WQNGCG,1,1,5,love the song
,B000WQNGCG,1,1,5,"This song has such a good beat.  If you love 90s music, this song will fit right in to your playlist."
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,music is great
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,"I gave this five stars for my Wife. I bought this version for her. She loves it. Me, I love the Aerosmith version. I'm not too crazy about this one. To me it's a little slower timing than the original. But speaking for my Wife, It's the greatest."
,B000WS2THW,1,1,5,Love their music
