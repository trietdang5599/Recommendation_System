The line up of the group includes Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan on guitars with John McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums. The song itself is an instrumental with a slow bluesy feel and mood to it. It is to me one of the loveliest songs ever produced by this band from their entire songbook.

So why buy it again?\n\nBecause this new 2015 CD reissue is on Big Break Records of the UK (BBR is part of Cherry Red) and I always get a bit excited by their sensationally good Remasters. The Audio on this peach is best ever and along with quality presentation, a Previously Unreleased in the Bonus Tracks that actually enhances, a total playing time of nearly 78 minutes and a miserly mid-price  and Im a very happy satin-suited bunny.

The 16-page booklet is the usual BBR fan fest of American 45 repros, trade adverts and band photos intertwined with indepth and affectionate liner notes from noted Soul buff CHRISTIAN JOHN WIKANE. This CD Remaster also comes in one of those round-corner super jewel cases  tasty...\n\nIn some respects  its hard in the distance of 2015 to imagine what a Soul Monster this album really was in 1972 and 1973. Three of the US 45s listed above hit the coveted No. 1 spot on their R&B charts  \"I'll Be Around\", \"Could It Be I'm Falling in Love\" and \"One Of A Kind (Love Affair)\" while the sublime and socially informative \"Ghetto Child\" peaked at an impressive No. 4 (and should have been a foursome with its illustrious predecessors). But even these belie just how good the 'whole' album is - with the exception for me of the vaudeville jazz brass of \"Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You\" which I always thought was wildly out-of-place.\n\nBut the album's masterpiece is the hidden one never edited for a 45  Lead Tenor PHILLIP WYNNE giving it some serious Soul pleading throughout the gorgeous 6:56 minutes of \"I Could Never (Repay Your Love)\" that ends Side 1. Surely this is what great Seventies Soul is all about  written by BRUCE HAWES  it features melody, passionate vocals and a complimentary arrangement that elevates rather than swamps. Another less-famous gem is \"We Belong Together\" where vibes and treated guitars ease in the smooth vocals and heartache of \"...where's the love we said would never die...\" Atlantic chose \"How Could I Let You Go\" as one of the representations of Quality Soul on their Rhino Handmade \"Atlantic Soul\" 4CD Box Set of 2009. And what can you say about the gorgeous \"Ghetto Child\"  a song that resonated lyrically and musically with British and Irish fans - giving it a No. 7 placing in September 1973 on the UK singles charts.\n\nI must admit that the four bonus outtakes that appeared on the 1995 remaster of \"Mighty Love\" (presented as tracks 11 to 14 on this CD) are massively disappointing. Those looking for the sophistication of the album should look away. Far better is the very cool and complimentary Remix by Mike Maurro of \"I'll Be Around\" which bigs-up the intro and emphasizes those wonderful string arrangements  although at 7:06 minutes it kind of outstays its welcome a tad. The Tom Moulton Remixes of \"Could It Be I'm Falling In Love\" and \"One Of A Kind (Love Affair)\" run to 6:40 and 5:51 minutes respectively and do the same trick as the Mike Maurro stab at \"I'll Be Around\"  with \"One Of A Kind (Love Affair)\" definitely coming off best (what a tune).\n\nI've loved returning to this SPINNERS album - I really have - and Im quite certain Soul fans out there will smile just looking at its cover. Well done to BBR for doing the business by this affectionately remembered LP and those halcyon days. Buy it and do the Soul Step with your sister on the kitchen floor like you used to. Or just think of that special girl. \"...Could It Be I'm Falling In Love...\" once again...","summary":"\"...Falling In Love (Again)...\"  The Spinners by THE [DETROIT] SPINNERS (2015 Big Break Records 'Expanded Edition' CD Remaster)","unixReviewTime":1447459200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The song did first appear on the soundtrack of the film \"City of Angels,\" which I haven't seen, so perhaps the title has something to do with the movie?  *shrug*\n\nAt any rate, despite the possible confusion over the name, this is a lovely song, a love ballad with powerful guitar music and melancholy but warm and inviting vocals.

Dusty Springfield became an international pop star in 1964 with the release of her debut single ''I Only Want to Be With You''. Her winning streak continued throughout the rest of the 60's with major hits including ''Wishin' and Hopin' '' (1964), and ''The Look of Love'' (1967), both written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, the team that supplied Dionne Warwick with most of her early hits. Of course everyone recalls her signature tune, the haunting \"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\" from the summer of 1966.\n\nIn 1968 Dusty Springfield decided that it was time to shift gears. She made the decision to leave the comfortable confines of Philips records and signed a new deal with Atlantic. Now Dusty had always been a huge fan of all of those great black singers from the early 1960's and longed to record that kind of music. Her debut album for Atlantic was \"Dusty In Memphis\" which is considered to be a classic. The debut single from that LP was a tune that Aretha Franklin had inexplicably rejected. \"Son Of A Preacher Man\" would go on to become a Top Ten hit in both the U.S. and in England. This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"Generally considered to be one of the finest efforts of Dusty's remarkable career.","unixReviewTime":1475539200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Angel seems to be a spiritually healing music tune about meeting someone who has a blissful\/joyful influence on ones life. The lyrics of you came when I wished for you within the song indicates meeting someone in your life who seems to be almost sent from heaven in ones life. The lyrics just now I realize within part of the song seems to me to be a positive dedication mini story about noticing after getting to know the person how they are an angel. Fortunately for me, I consider my husband of 14 years an angel in my life and I am frequently reminded from his positive example on  how to have both a forgiving heart and a modest spirit. He is very modest on multiple things that I feel he deserves to give himself more value on yet that is something obviously for another post.","summary":"Cloud Nine 80s Pop Love Song","unixReviewTime":1525305600,"vote":null,"image":null}

They released a dozen or so singles before finally hitting paydirt in 1970 with \"It's A Shame\".\n\nConvinced that the group needed to go in an entirely different direction, good friend Aretha Franklin convinced they to leave Motown and sign with Atlantic Records where she introduced them to producer Thom Bell. This was a match made in heaven. And as they say the rest is history. One of their first big records at Atlantic was \"Could It Be I'm Falling In Love\" in early 1973. The song spent 15 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #4 and was a #1 on the R&B charts as well. Great song!","summary":"A top ten hit from early 1973.","unixReviewTime":1470960000,"vote":null,"image":null}

I picked up my first copy around Christmas time in a Woolworth's. I still remember sitting at the soda fountain and drinking an old fashioned coke while I checked out the back cover. This was Jon's first solo album after leaving Yes the year before. In fact, several of the songs were written as possible Yes songs. I actually think that the majority of the album is actually quite strong although some of my Yes friends at the time didn't seem to care too much for it.

It's like going to bed on a warm summer night as a breeze blows lightly through the curtains. Like snuggling on a soft giant papasan chair in 1976 and having this on eight-track. Like buttah. No rough spots whatsoever; even the heavier guitar solo is balanced by strings to maintain the equilibrium.\n\nIf it were some sappy 70s love song I wouldn't like it. It's romantic, yes, but also esoteric and cool, like a Bogart movie. A tourist arrives in a town and meets a mysterious woman. He spends the night with her and in the morning realizes that he has been left behind by his tour group so he is stuck there. No big deal to him, he's carefree and open. Any way the wind blows....\n\nIt has some of my favorite lyrics of any song, especially:\n\nShe comes out of the sun in a silk dress running\nLike a watercolor in the rain\n\nGives me goosebumps sometimes when I hear that.\n\nAlso, you go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime. I had no idea who Peter Lorre was for a long time, but I knew his voice from cartoons. Eventually I saw him in Casablanca. He was also incredible in M.\n\nShe comes in incense and patchouli. Nowadays, whenever I hear the word patchouli I imagine John Cusack telling Tim Robbins to get his 'patchouli stink outta my store' in High Fidelity. Great film for music geeks.\n\nThe middle instrumental passage is great as well. It flows...strings at 3:10 into light electric guitar at 3:24 into heavier electric guitar at 3:54 into Phil Kenzie's superb saxophone at 4:14...then into the final verse.\n\nFYI: the cat is the fourth animal symbol in the 12-year cycle of the Vietnamese zodiac, replacing the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac. So, if you were born in 1963, 1975, 1987, or 1999, you might be a cat.","summary":"OCT 28","unixReviewTime":1497312000,"vote":null,"image":null}

So in a very real sense, not much has changed in the intervening thirty years.  We do have more Latino Governors and Congressional Latinos as well as the first Latina on the Supreme Court, but we are still grappling with the everyday problems of immigration, civil rights, and the wars on drugs and poverty.  Madonna's smash hit from the summer of 1986, \"La Isla Bonita,\" was both the heir apparent to a view of Latino America that harkened back to the West Side Story of the 1950s or even the \"Feliz Navidad\" of the 1970s while rejecting the more negative stereotypes of a guns-a-blazing Speedy Gonzalez or an overtly sexual Don Juan.  Her song and message infused the American pop landscape with images of warm ocean breezes and the young love between a boy and a girl.\n\nCatching its wind from the sexual reformation and women's liberation of the 1960s, the gist of the song and video is a young girl's desire and fantasy for intimacy and escape from the confines of her apartment in a Latino neighborhood, symbolizing sexual freedom within the confines of proper society.  While the song emphasized the lyrical melody of soft Latino folk and guitar music to a calypso beat, the accompanying video incorporated elements of the family, the Church, and everyday street life in the barrios.  While the song was a longing by Madonna to be near the tropical and warm, her video was a senorita's longing for her new love, a street guitarist named San Pedro. The charm of the song and the video was in their simplicity and innocence and how it captured a Latino's perspective on life in general.  With young and old alike dancing in the streets, a Madonna in full Spanish regalia bounds from her apartment to join the muchachos in their celebration of love, life, and unity of purpose as the lyrics expressively sing of all nature wild and free and a paradisiacal Spanish lullaby.  Madonna is both a woman in control, as she flirts with each of the street dancers, and strangely vulnerable as she swaggers from the scene.\n\nIf America is marching towards a future a bit more European and a bit more bi-lingual or even multi-lingual, then \"La Isla Bonita\" will continue to serve as an example of all that is good and pure and playful in a culture which either thrust itself or was thrust upon by natural forces the American scene.  While locally we have experienced everything from the brutal murder of an illegal immigrant named Luis Ramirez to Latino life and culture being displayed daily by newspaper, radio, and television, Madonna's unabashedly, even foolishly, romantic portrayal and expression of Latino life stands as a charming reminder of what America really is, and that is a melting pot of humanistic ideals that are common to all people.","summary":"Madonna's \"Latin\" America","unixReviewTime":1390176000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Coming out of the sacred steel music tradition of the House of God Church, Randolph knows how to whip up a gospel frenzy. His pedal steel swoops through the entire album and drives the jams of his extended band. This is high-energy, positive music delivered with a high level of musicianship. It all goes by a little too fast and furious at times, but it is infectious.\n\nMake no mistake. This is a Christian album, or at least a spiritual one. The lyrics may sound like love songs, but believers will catch the cues. If you miss the point, Randolph makes sure to name-check God in the final song. Every song is written to uplift the soul with positive lyrics of hope and thankfulness.","summary":"Unclassified can't be classified","unixReviewTime":1397433600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It is a grooving, smart, well-crafted piece of music. Phil Collins is good at this kind of thing...but people often forget that he is a fantastic drummer, too. He's keeps the rhythm snappy and on point.\n\nMy only complaint is Phil's voice on dahnce with me, you never dahnce with me. That's a fairly minor one.

They called themselves The Shondells. The group caught the eye of a local record producer and the Shondells were given a chance to cut a record. The Shondells released a tune called \"Judy\" in 1962. Although that record went nowhere, a local DJ that was starting a new label late in 1963 decided to give The Shondells another shot. They recorded a tune called \"Hanky Panky\" on the fledgling Snap label and this time they had themselves a local hit. However, the record never received any airplay outside the local area. Fast forward now to 1966 when Tommy James received a bizarre phone call from a promoter in Pittsburgh with an urgent request that he come to town to do a live concert. Since Tommy had never even been to Pittsburgh he had no idea what was going on. As it turned out, this promoter had found a copy of \"Hanky Panky\" in a used record bin. He liked it so much that he began playing it at dances all around town. Suddenly, radio stations in Pittsburgh were getting requests for this tune. Tommy James packed his bags and headed for the Steel City. The original Shondells had broken up so if was going to do concerts he would need a band to back him up. He hired a local Pittsburgh outfit called the Reconteurs to fill the bill and Tommy James and the Shondells were born. Soon thereafter the group signed with Morris Levy's Roulette records and re-recorded \"Hanky Panky\". This new recording was a bit more uptempo than the original and was an immediate smash. \"Hanky Panky\" would climb all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart and would remain there for two weeks. Tommy James and the Shondells were on their way.  Though this was never one of my favorite Tommy James songs the story behind the story is pretty interesting.","summary":"One of the more bizarre stories in the history of rock and roll.","unixReviewTime":1465862400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Cheesy 80's FM Radio embraced ANYTHING Plant (or Page) tossed into their dogbowls. Then , in 1988, Robert Plant (with Page on this track) released the incredible return to form , \"Now and Zen.\" The zany FM stations praised it as the Second Coming but it was just a finely crafted, (and clever wink) to the music industry. Plant had nothing to prove to anyone (He has always been ' the tall cool one') and having his friend Jimmy Page sample a few classic Zep riffs, Plant scored big with this one. Perfect tempo, pitch, and catchy tracks made this album his most successful in years. 'Heaven Knows' is one of the best tracks, but check out the wistful 'Ship of Fools' and the bonus track, \"Walking Towards Paradise\" is a hidden gem. Not sure why the record company decided to leave it off the original LP.

Side One is a suite of related tracks.\n\n\"SIDE\" NOTES --\n\nONE -- 1.) Spoof of the George Lucas sci-fi epic opens with un-P.C. fey humor. 2.) Redneck couple can't get served, as she's \"in drag.\" 3.) Multi-tracked bit at a Chinese restaurant. 4.) Mr. Redneck can't order a drink. 5.) Song where hamburgers are a sexual experience.\n\n\"SIDE\" TWO -- 1.) Milwaukee DJ Buzz Wired makes random phone calls, trying to give away some BAM (Bumming Around Money). 2.) The same dummy (\"Bob Btchin\") from 5 years earlier bungles his way through the game and wins with a wrong answer. 3.) Headache sufferer visits a Chinese physician. 4.) Record company exec suffering from a headache is hounded by a pushy, overloud producer, who demos a punk single by Ronny Rump and the Rumptones. 5.)

It was 1973 when the college radio station put the needle down on this track.  i thought, very pleasant as i went about my business and marveled that the song just kept going and going.  I called the station and asked 'who is this?' and was told it was John Coltrane.  I've been a die hard fan ever since.  I love the small combo jazz.  Some call it 'dinner music' but how could you sit still with Coltrane on the sax.  The newer version includes the single version of MFT, but this is just great for sitting back, and relaxing.  If you don't have it, get it.  You will not be disappointed!  BTW, it has since been determined that Coltrane was very unique in his playing because of what he did with his breathing technique.  Too bad he left us so soon....","summary":"My first taste of Coltrane was....","unixReviewTime":1394496000,"vote":null,"image":null}

If ever there was a song that helped define the mood and feelings for baby boomers during the mid to late '60s you could make a good case for The Doors \"Light My Fire\". Approximately 6:30 minutes in length it broke the conventional rule of radio that a song couldn't or at least shouldn't be more then three minutes long. But the song would get plenty of air play. With its psychodellic tone and mesmerizing organ solo and of course Jim Morrison's voice it is easy to see once you combine all these elements together why this is such an outstanding recording. If you are a child of the 1960s this is a must to down load on your MP3 player.","summary":"One Iconic Song","unixReviewTime":1487808000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It was only one of three singles that ever cracked the Top Twenty for the Bay Area funk-soul band Tower of Power (1973). It starts out with the silky vocals of Lenny Williams, as a pretty piano begins to weave itself into the story. Then, some beautiful strings highlight the chorus as the famous TOP horns ramp up to a crescendo. The lyrics are heartfelt, powerful, emotional. and painful, as the singer looks back at a relationship where he blew it, and now realizes his mistakes. He wants to make amends, but alas, it's too late. He must leave now, because of all the damage he did to her and their relationship. She has moved on with her life. Despite this, he is still so very deep in love with her, which is why it is \"So Very Hard to Go.\" Halfway through the song, there is that powerful sax solo that makes this tune so memorable.

Stinnette","reviewText":"A 70's hit, one of those melancholy sets which were not uncommon in that decade. \"Bread\" was a highly successful band which produced hit after hit, and their albums sold millions. Actual vinyl back then! \"Diary\" was written and produced by David Gates (Bread's keyboardist and vocalist), who was responsible for most of Bread's hits. Released in 1972, the song made it to #3 on Billboard's Easy Listening. It's a story, sung slowly and gently, from the singer's perspective. He discovers his wife's diary, reads it, and at first thinks the love expressed there is for him. As he examines things more closely, he discovers she's speaking of someone else, and his heart breaks. But his love for her is so great, he accepts this and, after an apparent unspoken divorce, he wishes for her and her new husband \"all the sweet things they can find.\" The 1970's saw several such wrenching songs, but this one is among the best, musically and through its expression of selfless love. If you came of age in the 70's, and ever had a crush on someone only to lose her to another, this song will speak volumes. Bread's music generally was melodic and what we now call \"soft rock,\" although that term didn't exist back then.\n\nGates and Bread's other vocalist (and guitarist) James Griffin started out as good friends, and were the foundation of Bread, but as time went on friction developed between them because Griffin, also a writer, thought Gates's work was given more exposure and resentments built. Bread disbanded in 1973, but reunited in 1976. It didn't last, and Griffin left the band. Bread continued here and there, with little subsequent success, and is now only a fond memory.","summary":"\"Diary\" -- one of the sad, sweet things","unixReviewTime":1473033600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Heartfelt, soulful, and packed to the core with emotion. The opening horns soar gloriously, sweeping across the heavens, and then, they suddenly come crashing to a halt, as the vocals gently begin. He's in love with a woman, a few years older than he. She tells him repeatedly he's wasting his time, he's just too young for her. But he won't have it; he's a good man, he'll make her happy....no, he's not wasting his time. Someday she'll understand...just what it means when a man comes to her with his little heart in his hands! He'll never, never, never, never do her wrong....all he wants right now is just to get next to her, just to hold her, and please her. And then, as the song ends in a wound-up crescendo and stops on a dime, the final trumpet is joined by the rest of the brass section with a stunning grande finale.

Led by singer-songwriter David Gates, Bread would amass an impressive total of nine Top 20 records during the years 1970 thru 1973.  Formed in Los Angeles in 1968, David Gates and Bread would quickly establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with on the Billboard Hot 100.  Their debut single \"Dismal Day\" failed to make the charts in 1969.  However, the group's second record \"Make It With You\" went all the way to the top of the charts in the summer of 1970. And the hits just kept on comin'.  In late March of 1971 Elektra records released the beautiful love song \"If\".  The song was an immediate hit peaking at #4 in May of that year.  As far as I'm concerned this is the best song they ever recorded.","summary":"A 1970's \"soft rock\" favorite.","unixReviewTime":1470009600,"vote":null,"image":null}

There are a lot of nice folky ballad with beautiful melodies. Dan Peek, especially, is talented at writing gorgeous, fragile melodies. It's not an uneven album at all, most of the songs are about as good as eachother, although I think those last two, 'Tomorrow' and the highly orchestrated 'Seasons' would be my pick, with that exuberant trumpet and vivacious strings I feel as though I'm in spring garden full of flowering plants and colourful birds and animals.\n\n'Hearts' is also somewhat of a transition album from the purely folk sounding album to a sound where they experiment more with arrangements and different styles; after all, they had George Martin at their disposal. 'Woman Tonight' is their first attempt at reggae, and while this genre isn't best suited to them, this is a nice song.\n\nWhile Hearts is one of their best albums, I would instead recommend buying the five pack \"Original Album Series\", which includes their first five albums, which is their best period of music(Including the entire \"Hearts\" album). It should be within most peoples' budget, and contains almost all of their biggest hits, as well as many brilliant album tracks that you may have never heard, and will probably be glad to discover. I would also recommend buying the album \"Hideaway\", which is fairly cheap to buy by itself, and contains a few songs essential to the America cannon.\nFor a little bit more than the price of most 'greatest hits' compilations, you will have all their hits except \"You can do Magic\" and \"Border\" and ALL their very best songs.","summary":"A very nice listen","unixReviewTime":1423440000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Constant horns all over the place, and often times soulful vocal melodies overriding everything else to a great extent.  Pretty good stuff though.  If there's one thing you can't fault Tower of Power for, it's not being boisterous enough, haha!  This band takes the supposed high energy level of other bands at the time, reinvents said excitement and shoots it through the roof!\n\nNot a single song is below 5 and a half minutes either.  \"Knock Yourself Out\" opens with nice marching horns and somewhat messy vocals, but perhaps what sounds like messy vocals is just a very enthusiastic and uncontrollable lead singer!  The background vocals provide the \"Knock yourself out woooh!\" part.  Solid melodic sax solo in the middle too.  I really like this song.  \"Social Lubrication\" opens with steamy bluesy guitar lines before quickly shifting into a funkier and soulful direction.  I feel the vocals are a little unfocused\/uninspiring here which makes the song sound a bit clunky, but I like the horns during the chorus.  The vocals remind me of Terry Kath of Chciag fame a little bit during the middle part.  I like the \"Everyone's got their own way\" part because it's sung so honestly.  The vocal melody gets more intense near the end.  Overall decent song but not one of my favorites.\n\n\"The Price\" provides refreshing horns mixed with funk in the beginning.  Geat driving verse melody.  \"It's a hard thing to say but that's the price I gotta pay, the price is too much my darling\" is a VERY strong melody and lyrics.  Lots of horns decorating the song and making it stand out boisterously, and a nice guitar solo at the end.  \"Back on the Streets Again\" has a quality funky groove and sincere vocals about survival and making a return back on the streets in apparent grand fashion based on the lead singers confident demeanor.  Decent though relatively messy saxophone solo in the middle, and the rhythm is notable for doing some tricky stuff.  \"The Skunk, the Goose and the Fly\" is funky with cheerful\/playful vocals.  More exceedingly boisterous singing with funny lyrics \"Drunk as a skunk, loose as a goose!\"  AWESOME guitar solo.  Wow if this band ever wanted to jam on the guitar for an extended period of time, it would be incredibly good.  I wonder if they DID jam when performing this live.\n\n\"Sparkling in the Sand\" is my favorite song on here by FAR.  Instead of being a horn-drenched tune with a loud soulful vocal melody, it goes in a quieter gentler direction while keeping the soul sound completely in place.  It opens with beautiful dreamy flutes.  \"When God made you he had a lot to do, in a day or two you were my dream come True\" is a funny and beautifully sung line.  Reminds me of Blood, Sweat and Tears when the brass instruments arrive.  There are no words to describe how beautiful the vocal melody is while the lyrics emphasis the subject of love.  The flute that jams throughout the song is really amazing, as is the trumpet solo later on.  The jazzy tempo change at the very end is beautiful too.  \"You're a diamond sparkling in the sand\" is a memorable line.\n\nOverall, well if you like a LOT of horns, constant horns, this is the album for you.  There's also brief guitar solos, funky rhythms and constant soulful vocal melodies, but in the end other than the vocal melodies, nothing else is as instantly noticeable as the horns.  It can be a bit much to take overall, but I still thoroughly enjoy East Bay Grease and highly recommend it.","summary":"starting the tower climb","unixReviewTime":1435968000,"vote":null,"image":null}

For a couple of years in the mid 1960's the group known as The Monkees was nothing short of a national phenomenon. Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Michael Nesmith became household names virtually overnight. Their debut single \"Last Train To Clarksville\" was released in September of 1966 and would go all the way to #1 on the Billboard charts. That very same month \"The Monkees\" TV show debuted on NBC and just a few weeks later \"The Monkees\" LP was released and would go on to top the national charts for 13 weeks! Producer Don Kirshner would spare no expense in providing quality material for his sensational new group. The Monkees would record tunes by such notable writers as Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, Neil Diamond and Carole King and Gerry Coffin to name but a few. Meanwhile, Kirshner also employed a number of the top studio musicians of the day to help to make these records. Over the next couple of years The Monkees would boast a total of a half dozen Top Ten singles and four #1 albums. Over the decades their most enduring recording continues to be the phenomenal 1967 hit \"Daydream Believer\". Here's to everyone who contributed to this record in any way (and there were a lot of people). This is the crme de la crme of 1960's pop.","summary":"The Monkees final #1 hit from late 1967.","unixReviewTime":1469577600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Because of course history tells us a different story to the chart indifference he suffered then - \"Sail Away\" is a great album - a masterpiece really - and an early jewel in a very large and long career arc. He is also helped by an impressive array of session players - Ry Cooder, Chris Etheridge of The Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimmy Bond, Wilton Felder of The Crusaders and Milt Holland to name but a few (Randy plays piano and sings). It's lonely at the top indeed. Here are the memos from Simon Smith and his Amazing Dancing Bear...\n\nUK released May 2002 - \"Sail Away\" by RANDY NEWMAN on Rhino\/Reprise 8122-78244-2 (Barcode 081227824426) is an 'Expanded Edition' CD Remaster of the 12-Track 1972 LP with Five Previously Unreleased Bonus Tracks and plays out as follows (41:51 minutes):\n\n1. Sail Away [Side 1]\n2. Lonely At The Top\n3. He Gives Us All His Love\n4. Last Night I Had A Dream\n5. Simon Smith And The Amazing Dancing Bear\n6. Old Man\n7. Political Science [Side 2]\n8. Burn On\n9. Memo To My Son\n10. Dayton, Ohio - 1903\n11. You Can Leave Your Hat On\n12. God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)\nTracks 1 to 12 are his 4th album \"Sail Away\" (3rd studio set) - released May 1972 in the USA on Reprise MS 2064 and July 1972 in the UK on Reprise K 44185.\n\nBONUS TRACKS (Previously Unreleased):\n13. Let It Shine\n14. Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong (Studio Version)\n15. Dayton, Ohio - 1903 (Early Version)\n16. You Can Leave Your Hat On (Demo)\n17. Sail Away (Early Version)\n\nThe 20-page booklet is a pleasingly in-depth affair with a Page 3 introduction from the great songsmith himself and a further essay\/assessment pleasantly called \"Of Freaks, Geeks, And God\" by Editor of the Rolling Stone  DAVID WILD. There is even some personalized notes on the five Previously Unreleased outtakes and how pleased Randy is with the sound of the new Remaster carried out by long-time Rhino Records Audio Engineer associate - DAN HERSCH. This is a gorgeous sounding CD reissue - warm and full - as this quietly subdued album has always cried out for.\n\n\"...In America you get food to eat...Won't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet...You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day...\" You can't really imagine (even now) the impact those opening lyrics to \"Sail Away\". Firstly very few artists would have risked them. Newman isn't casually slagging off America or taking a cheap shot - but he is highlighting hypocrisies and attacking homegrown racists and their simplistic crap all in the same song. The fact that he does all this inside a haunting melody (orchestration conducted by Louis Kauffman) is all the more remarkable. Newman then digs at his own supposed Rock Star lifestyle in \"Lonely At The Top\" - the applause - the money  the after parties. The song was used as a title to a CD Best Of for Warner Brothers in 1987 remastered by Lee Herschberg  a disc I bought back in early days of reissue.\n\nAn uncaring God and our blind allegiance to pie-in-the-sky indoctrination crops up in the sly and disturbing \"He Gives Us All His Love\". The distinctive rattle of Ry Cooder's slide guitar strings comes slinking in on \"Last Night I Had A Dream\"  a song I only half like actually. Speaking of which - his Alan Price hit \"Simon Smith And The Amazing Dancing Bear\" dates back to the Sixties and put RN on the songwriting map. But again - I've always admired the song more than I actually liked it. \"Old Man\" is one of the saddest melodies on the album - a tearful farewell by a son to his father - a Dad he clearly dislikes and loves in equal measure.\n\nSide 2 gives us the masterful \"Political Science\" - a song with lyrics that inspire awe and giggles even now  a full 45 years after they were released. The protagonist singer tells of American Generals and Politicians weary of trying to be nice to the world  why bother man - they hate all Americans anyhow. So to Hell with them all and let's drop the big one now (not on Australia though - don't want to hurt no Kangaroo - besides they've got surfing and good weather too). \"Burn On\" is one of the album's secret nuggets - a river in Cleveland suddenly containing magical qualities as a red moon of fire rises in the distance. Understated observation number 424 comes in the shape of \"Memo To My Son\" - as witty and as wise a love letter from a father to a son as you'll ever hear. Like most young Dads - he's struggling with all the joys and terrors a child brings - but there's a simple love in there that's so touching. In the liner notes Newman's fairly dismissive of \"Dayton, Ohio - 1903\" but I actually think it's beautiful - a mournful 'missus and me' ballad. The ever so slightly perverse \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" tickled many people's fancy (Tom Jones even covered it for \"The Full Monty\" film) - and it's easy to work out why as it plays - the song is witty, acidic and lusty. Buddhists and Hindus join Catholics and Jews on Satellite TV for the seriously harsh \"God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)\"  a nonchalant even disinterested Almighty poo-pooing his creation Mankind as they beg for mercy from plagues and suffering.\n\nYou can't help thinking that the wonderful outtake \"Let It Shine\" was left off the album precisely because it is so upbeat and uplifting - not in keeping with the album's overall moody demeanor. But it's a treat to hear it and \"Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong\" - fully formed songs that actually deserve the moniker 'Bonus'. As I already liked \"Dayton, Ohio - 1903\" - a pretty 'early version' of it is alright by me. And the early version of the title song is radically different and fascinating for it...\n\n\"...I hope people like them this time...\" - Randy Newman remarks in the new liner notes (the next LP \"Good Ole Boys\" from 1974 was also reissued in this CD series) - maybe a little mellowed by the years and distance. I'd agree.\n\nI know RN is not everyone's cup of Darjeeling - but his songmanship and affecting melodies\/lyrics warrant your attention  yes even deserve it. And 1972's forgotten and overlooked \"Sail Away\" album is the perfect starting point...","summary":"\"...Drop The Big One Now!\" - Sail Away by RANDY NEWMAN (2002 Reprise 'Expanded Edition' CD Remaster)","unixReviewTime":1501718400,"vote":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71MSZv40y2L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71AhnSRcujL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71HxrDfANvL._SY88.jpg"]}

While some folks may not like their music...calling it too sappy, or or too commerical, one thing is True... the vocals of David Gates are what is immediately recognizable, when listening to this group. Yes...most of what is on this disc could be considered \"soft rock\" ( I am not a big fan of musical genres), but the talent contained within this 70's band is unmistakable. For you folks who are approaching ( or may already be there), the 50 somthing age, a little of this type of rock does the soul (and ears) a bit of good. Some of Bread's music can be conducive to cuddling with your sweetheart. The band can (at times) \"rock out\", as demonstrated by the track \"Mother Freedom\".","summary":"one of the better \"soft rock\" 70's bands","unixReviewTime":1402444800,"vote":null,"image":null}

There is some nice synthesizer throughout with some contrasting drum rhythms here and there with a solid bass line. The lyrics are unobtrusive.

While I enjoyed all kinds of music, my preference during that time was for much tamer music. In the summer of that year, The Vogues released \"Turn Around, Look At Me\" a remake of a relatively obscure Glen Campbell tune from several years earlier. I immediately fell in love with the song and the group. The Vogues had been around for awhile, having achieved significant chart success on Pittsburgh's Co&Ce label with songs like \"You're The One\", \"Five O'Clock World\" and \"The Land of Milk and Honey\". But this sound was different. Fifties rocker Ernie Freeman had become the producer\/arranger for the group. His combination of lush production values and impeccable harmonies produced an incredibly pleasing sound that proved wildly successful. \"Turn Around\" was a huge hit for the group and was followed in swift succession by remakes of \"My Special Angel\", \"Earth Angel\", \"Till\", \"Moments to Remember\", \"Green Fields\" and others. I bought every one of these singles. In fact, I enjoyed The Vogues so much that I used to even play the flip sides frequently.  Here's to one of the best records they ever made.","summary":"You don't even know that I exist.","unixReviewTime":1467849600,"vote":null,"image":null}

They were a phenomenon to be sure. And the statistics would tend to back up these assertions. Whether you were addicted to Top 40 radio in the 1970's or a fan of progressive or classic rock you were sure to find the music of Chicago emanating from your radio.\n\nIt all began with an LP entitled \"Chicago Transit Authority\" released in the spring of 1969. While the album would never attain Top Ten status it would remain on the charts a staggering 171 weeks! And from this LP would emerge a couple of classic hit singles \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\" and a tune appropriately entitled \"Beginnings\". And Chicago would never look back. Over the next two decades the band would have over four dozen hit singles and produce some of the finest and most successful albums of the period. \"Beginnings\" was originally released as a single in 1969 and it failed to make the charts. Columbia decided to re-release the single in June 1971 and it would become the band's fourth Top Ten hit.

It represents Ric Ocasek's peak songwriting capabilities and does provide an opportunity for Eliot Easton to demonstrate his guitar skills.  It has that classic Cars sound--a quirky bridge between rock and new wave\n\nTo be clear the three-star rating I give this song is a good rating.  I suppose someone else might give it four stars, but I save four stars for great songs and five stars for songs I simply could not live without (there are only 8 five-star rated songs in my entire music collection.)\n\nIf you like the Cars sound and do not own any of the songs on the album \"Candy-O\" then purchase the whole album.  Because I already owned \"Let's Go\" from another compilation, I could not quite justify the cost and bought this individual .mp3 instead.  I own five of the songs on this album:  \"Let's Go\", \"It's All I Can Do\", \"Double Life\", \"Candy-O\" and \"Dangerous Type.\"\n\nIf you are trying to gauge my review, understand that I tend to prefer the Cars more rock-oriented songs, which are sometimes, but not always their most popular.  \"It's All I Can Do\" is definitely one of their more pop-oriented songs.  It just happens to be one of their better ones.","summary":"Classic Ric Ocasek\/Cars","unixReviewTime":1389225600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's a slowly building song that starts out like a club band slow dance number with very tight, polished harmonies, but goes far beyond what you would expect in its arrangement and production. Usually there would be a vocal departure after the first melody, a return and a finish. Instead, the song goes into a long instrumental bridge that gets increasingly bluesy and builds to a big climax of organ, synthesizer and wordless vocals that's really stunning, and then returns to the main melody of the song. With the instrumentation, the loud lead vocal and the halting rhythm, you are reminded at times of Pink Floyd, a band that one wouldn't ordinarily think of at the beginning of the piece. This is because the song was produced by Alan Parsons, who had produced The Dark Side of the Moon and who went on to his own group, the Alan Parsons Project. The song also has a super clean and polished studio sound, the kind you would associate with groups like Steely Dan or Toto, also due to Parsons production. On top of that, it's just a nice song to listen to.","summary":"Soft Rock Classic From 1975","unixReviewTime":1402790400,"vote":"2","image":null}

Top 40 radio was at its peak in those days and I was glued to my radio for the Top 40 Countdown each and every week! For a few years during the mid-sixties a blued-eyed soul quartet from New York City ran up an impressive string of hit records. Felix Cavaliere, Dino Danelli, Eddie Brigati and Gene Cornish formed the Young Rascals back in 1964. Rock and roll afficianados might recall that all except Danelli had been members of Joey Dee's Starlighters who had several hit records in the early 1960's including the #1 smash \"Peppermint Twist\" in 1961. This talented new group was soon making lots of noise in the New York City area and several labels were interested in signing them. It was Atlantic that had the great good fortune to sign The Young Rascals in 1965 and just a few months later The Young Rascals released their very first single.\n\nI have to say that I liked just about every single The Rascals ever released. They were great pop records.  In 1967 Atlantic released How Can I Be Sure.  This was the group's highest charted record with Eddie Brigati singing lead. The song peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was something of a departure from The Rascals standard fare.  This is probably the most beautiful tune the group ever recorded.","summary":"One of The Rascals most popular hit records.","unixReviewTime":1468368000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.

There is a lot of funk going on with a decidedly muscular feel. Peter Cetera has yet to take the spot light sharing vocals with the other singers with a lower vocal register.\n\nI like the rhythmic intro and mid-song drum solo with timbale, glocks, tamborine, shaker, etc. It definitely epitomizes the best of the era. It ends with a great improvisational guitar solo.\n\nThis is the 5:42 new edit, remastered version.

There was music by The Beatles, the British Invasion and all those dynamite tunes being cranked out by Motown. But there was another group on the scene that somehow managed to crank it up yet another notch. Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels exploded onto the scene in late 1965 and over the next 18 months had a fabulous run of raucous, driving hit records that included \"Jenny Take A Ride\", \"Sock It To Me Baby\" and a driving remake of Bill Medley's \"Little Latin Lupe Lu\". The granddaddy of them all however was the group's 1966 hit \"Devil With A Blue Dress On & Good Golly Miss Molly\". This song has been cited by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as one of \"The Songs That Shaped Rock & Roll\".","summary":"WARNING!!!

In fact, the legendary R&B group The Drifters had been formed in 1953 to showcase the vocal prowess of lead singer Clyde McPhatter. In late 1954 McPhatter was inducted into the Army and assigned to Special Services in the continental United States, which allowed him to continue recording with The Drifters. However, when he was discharged in 1956 he left the group to pursue a solo career. Over the next few years he would record a number of outstanding sides for Atlantic records. His biggest hit during this period was released in late 1958. \"A Lover's Question\" was a tune written by Brook Benton and Jimmy T. Williams. The song peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts and spent a week atop the R&B chart.

Together with three friends from high school Phil formed a group called The Teddy Bears and eventually recorded the song for the Dore label who released it as a single. Within months \"To Know Him Is To Love\" streaked to the top of the Billboard charts and remained there for three weeks. While he enjoyed performing Phil Spector's real ambition was to become a record producer. Phil moved to New York and honed his skills for a couple of years at the legendary Brill Building. While there he had a hand in making a half dozen hit records including the Ben E. King classic \"Spanish Harlem\".\n\nBen E. King was born in Henderson, NC and raised in Harlem. Ben had the great good fortune to work with the legendary vocal group The Moonglows while still in high school. He joined a doo-wop group called The Five Crowns in 1957 and they would become the new Drifters in 1959. Ben E. King can be heard singing lead on The Drifters classic \"There Goes My Baby\".\n\nAs a result of contract disputes with Drifters manager George Treadwell Ben E. King made the decision to leave the group in May 1960 to pursue a career as a solo act. It would prove to be an extremely wise decision. At the tail end of 1960 Atlantic released King's debut single on it's Atco subsidiary. \"Spanish Harlem\" would spend a total of 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts peaking at #10. The tune was co-written by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector and produced by Leiber and Stoller. \"Spanish Harlem\" was ranked #358 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs\nof All-Time\".  This is the original hit recording.","summary":"An American classic.","unixReviewTime":1472515200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Instead, Benjamin Orr, the bassist, took on the vocal part of the track. Also, the musical style differed from typical Ocasek new wave.  It turned out to be their biggest international hit. I liked the song a lot, but I never bought the album. Now I have the song on my play lists and I am glad about that.

It was released in 1976, when I was nine years old. I have vivid memories of hearing it during that summer, driving around in the VW Beetle with my Mom, hanging out at the public pool as it played over the loudspeakers. In a way, it is a kind of security blanket. In my mind's catalogue of songs, it shares a drawer with 'If you could read my mind.' Maybe I like soft songs with 'if' in the title? Nah...'If'' by Bread would never be allowed past security. Kick that one to the curb. That's the song that starts out with that 'wawawawawa...wawawawawa...'sound. 'If a man could throw up on a song, then why can't I throw up on it too...' hahaha.\n\nBut......I digress. IYLMN was a global smash for Chicago, hitting #1 in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands. I think it inspired every song in Air Supply's catalogue. It starts out all soft and gentle, light horns and strings, a finger cymbal. Peter Cetera busts out his high-pitched Beach Boy vocals. Nice harmonies, a soft Terry Kath acoustic guitar solo, joined by strings. The only part I don't like is around 2:00, those rising strings are totally over the top and unnecessary. And I can always do without James Pankow and his trombone, ughhh. I especially love the layered string buildup on the outro. And how about Cetera's 'Oooh, girl, just got to have you by my side' scat. OK, this is not the kind of music I typically listen to, but it's like being a Cubs fan...I can't not like this song, no matter how I try. Now, 'Hard to say I'm sorry?'

For a couple of years in the mid 1960's the group known as The Monkees was nothing short of a national phenomenon. Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Michael Nesmith became household names virtually overnight. Their debut single \"Last Train To Clarksville\" was released in September of 1966 and would go all the way to #1 on the Billboard charts. That very same month \"The Monkees\" TV show debuted on NBC and just a few weeks later \"The Monkees\" LP was released and would go on to top the national charts for 13 weeks! Producer Don Kirshner would spare no expense in providing quality material for his sensational new group. The Monkees would record tunes by such notable writers as Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, Neil Diamond and Carole King and Gerry Coffin to name but a few. Meanwhile, Kirshner also employed a number of the top studio musicians of the day to help to make these records. Over the next couple of years The Monkees and Co. would boast a total of a half dozen Top Ten singles and four #1 albums.\n\nBy March 1968 The Monkees had already amassed an impressive total of 7 Top 20 hits including three #1 songs.  It was at this time that Colgems released their next single \"Valleri\".  In my opinion this was the most rockin' tune that The Monkees ever recorded.  Featuring the aforementioned Davy Jones on lead the song rocketed to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.  But winds of change were in the air and the phenomenon that was The Monkees was coming to an end.  \"Valleri\" would be their final Top Ten record.","summary":"The most rockin' tune The Monkees ever recorded.","unixReviewTime":1472169600,"vote":null,"image":null}

He placed nearly 40 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop charts and for over two decades was a fixture on Billboard's Top Country Singles chart. And the man could croon with the best of them! Ray Stevens certainly made his mark on the American music scene. Much like the late Charlie Rich, another incredibly gifted and versatile performer, Ray Stevens might have achieved even greater commercial success had he concentrated on just one or two genres. But there were simply too many sides to Ray Stevens to allow that to happen. And he was a very gifted songwriter to boot.\n\nIn April 1969 Monument records released what just might be Ray's most creative and entertaining tune ever. \"Gitarzan\" is a novelty song about a character who lives in the jungle and forms a musical band with his female partner, Jane and their pet monkey. The song features Tarzan yells, scat singing, and a funky Boogie Woogie, as well as a quote from the song \"Swinging on a Star\", with the line \"Carrying Moonbeams Home in a Jar\" sung with the wrong notes. The song reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1969. Tons of fun!","summary":"Probably the best novelty record Ray Stevens ever recorded.","unixReviewTime":1471305600,"vote":null,"image":null}

He made me think of it so often I finally looked for the song and was so surprised and delighted to find it. Brings so much laughter into my small life. I am almost a shut in with the occasional disabled bus trip to doctors or to purchase something necessary I cannot get online at a reasonable (cheap or reduced cost) price. We all need to do whatever we can to bring laughter and whatever joy we can find into our lives, no matter how limited we are. This always makes me laugh and is a treasure to hear now. I never cared much for it when I was young but really appreciate the humor since I relate it to my friend. He likes to be the only one to talk (I don't mind a bit) so even if I try to insert a comment of agreement he will protest I don't allow him to finish a sentence, LOL.

A song that not only features her strong, wonderful voice but also a powerful message about survival that still resonates with people even today.  Released in 1974, it features not only Carly Simon on vocals but also James Taylor on acoustic guitar.  The song deals with how, after a good person enters someone's life, everything changes for the better.\n\nPerhaps though what makes this song so powerful is its message of hope and survival after suffering.  While some may see this as a kind of self-absorption, the song really could apply to so much more--long-term abuse, mental illness, loneliness, or chronic physical illness being some examples.\n\nIt may have been made in the 1970's but the message is really timeless.  Carly Simon just knocks this song right out of the park.","summary":"Timeless song, perfectly performed. Make time to listen.","unixReviewTime":1469923200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Sherwin","reviewText":"George Benson \"(born March 22, 1943) is a ten time Grammy Award winning American musician whose production career began at the age of twenty-one as a jazz guitarist. Benson first came to prominence in the 1960s playing soul jazz with the likes of Jack McDuff. Benson then launched a successful solo career, alternating between jazz, pop, R&B singing, and scat singing. This one-time child prodigy topped the Billboard 200 in 1976 with the triple-platinum album, `Breezin.' He was also a major live attraction in the UK during the 1980s and continues to attract a large following today.\"\n\nThese five tracks display George Benson's great talent; this music is really good! \"On Broadway\" has a terrific beat and George sings this with lots of genuine passion. There's also the hauntingly beautiful \"This Masquerade;\" I could never tire of hearing George perform this song and no one could ever do it better than George does! \"Turn Your Love Around\" picks up the tempo a bit and this catchy tune still gets lots of airplay today. \"Turn Your Love Around\" is an excellent song. \"Breezin'\" is very well done and the track set ends with George Benson performing \"Give Me the Night.\" Give Me the Night\" just plain sounds good and I always like to hear this number.\n\nGeorge Benson is a brilliant artist and hopefully he will perform for many years to come. Diehard fans will likely have these songs so this music is best suited for the casual fan or relative newcomers just discovering George Benson. I highly recommend his music.","summary":"George Benson's music is BRILLIANT !!!","unixReviewTime":1349308800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Sherwin","reviewText":"Christopher Cross \"(born Christopher Charles Geppert; May 3, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter from San Antonio, Texas. His debut album earned him five Grammys. He is perhaps best known for his US Top Ten hit songs, `Sailing,' `Ride Like the Wind' and `Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do),' the last of which he recorded for the film Arthur starring Dudley Moore. `Sailing' earned three Grammy Awards in 1981, while `Arthur's Theme' won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1981 (with co-composers Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen).\" Christopher Cross continues to give concerts to this day.\n\nThese five tracks available for download as MP3 files display Christopher's talent and artistry but I am disappointed that \"Arthur's Theme\" is not among them. \"Sailing\" has Christopher squarely front and center and his smooth voice never sounded better! Moreover, the musical accompaniment for Christopher's vocals couldn't have been any better; what a great songwriter he is! \"Think of Laura\" is very pretty even though the lyrics are somewhat bittersweet and \"Ride Like the Wind\" is brilliant! \"All Right\" just plain sounds good; this tune about a man trying his luck at love once again is catchy and Christopher Cross does this beautifully. \"No Time for Talk\" again highlights Christopher's gift for singing songs he wrote himself.\n\nFans of Christopher Cross will probably have these songs already; therefore this music is best geared toward the more casual fan who may just want to download one or two numbers. Indeed, these tracks are particularly good for people just discovering Christopher's genius. The omission of \"Arthur's Theme\" is a real disappointment; but I still recommend these five songs.","summary":"the magical artistry of Christopher Cross -- but where's \"Arthur's Theme?\"","unixReviewTime":1349568000,"vote":"5","image":null}

JJLC was released originally on\nZZ Tops' third album, \"Tres Hombres\" album, in 1973.  It was the band's breakthrough album. Push\nto the mid-80s when CDs made the scene and the original '73 mix was discontinued. The CD mix\ninstruments seemed to sound very different, especially the drums. The mid-80s CD version was the\nonly one available for over 20 years. When the album was remastered in 2006 (this version) the\noriginal 1973 mix was used. Hallelujah, brother.\n\nThe song also has many people trying to decide the meaning of the lyrics as well. Anything from\nthe spiritual side to a gospel radio station to drug deals. To be quite honest unless the writers\ncome forward and explain, line by line, what their original meaning, or intent was, I really don't\ncare. Here is why: The Music.\n\nThis music is so blues-drenched, with it open ringing tones and walk-down chords on the refrain,\nthat all I can think of is that this was handed to ZZ Top as a gift from the Blues Gods from on high.\nIt seems so much like a classic blues tune in many ways. You got some nasty 12-bar blues, add\nsome honky tonk and finish off with a growling, wailing, ringing 6 string electric. That stinging\nlead punctuates your soul to the core. Never mind that Billy Gibbons played it through a '55 Strat.\nOh, and don't forget the gravely can-barely-sing vocals. Nice and Cool. I wouldn't want it any other\nway.\n\nThe album also sported their big hit single, \"La Grange\", basically a well-done homage to the\ngreat John Lee Hooker. \"La Grange\" is still in regular rotation on radio stations to this day. I would\nmuch prefer to hear \"Jesus Just Left Chicago\" over any other ZZ Top song. To me this song was\nborn classic and remains that way to this day. Some feel \"Tres Hombres\" was their pinnacle work.\nJJLC, I feel, had a lot to do with them hitting their stride on the album. Have a listen and immerse\nyourself in the decades of blues influences ZZ Top has synergized thorough their souls.","summary":"Earthy Blues-Drenched Boogie: Jesus Just Left Chicago by ZZ Top [MP3 \/ 2006 Remastered]","unixReviewTime":1387152000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It was long ago back in the sixties that I bought this record  on a 45 and I still have it today, well worn from being played so much because it was a good party song to dance to. Sonny and Cher made a great duo and it was a sad day for music when Sonny lost his life.

This song features production by Graydon and piano and synth by Foster. Graydon also does guitar work here and when you catch the guitar work towards the end of the song, it's incredible. The lyrics are pure poetry and, to date, I don't think anyone could have pulled this off like Al Jarreau. I'm sure this song could have been given to a screamer or belter, but the lyrics are too unique to be relegated to that platform. The keyboards are sparkling and this production has all the glisten that made other peer-songs a success: Lionel Richie's \"The only one\", Peter Cetera's \"The Glory of Love\", Paul Anka's \"Hold me till the morning comes\". If you were to look at the words of the chorus on paper, they would never come alive the way they do in this arrangement. Honestly, everyone involved in this project made it an adult contemporary success. If you're not an Al Jarreau fan (shame on you!), this song is also available on \"Slow Grooves\", a compilation of mid-80s R&B\/Soul that features Freddie Jackson, Jeffrey Osbourne, Teddy Pendergrass, Levert and more(may only be available on cassette). Don't let the critics fool you by calling this sound \"dated\". If you enjoy the love songs of the mid to late 80s, this is a timeless masterpiece to hang on the wall of your heart.","summary":"A winner for production","unixReviewTime":1385164800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I was seven years old, and I was at church camp in the summer of 1974. I slept on a top bunk in a green cabin. Previous occupants had written weird stuff on the ceiling. Anyhow, I didn't like being at camp too much, but there were these hippie junior ministers who played acoustic guitars and had us sing hippie religious songs, like I am the resurrection, and tunes from Godspell. They were pretty cool. They also had a Chevy van with these big speakers that weren't locked down to anything. So, one night we were going somewhere and I got to ride in the van. I got in it and someone put one of the speakers in my lap and said I had to hold onto it. They turned on the stereo and I soon felt an amazing vibration surge through my hands and into my brain and I had no idea what was going on...but it was like some kind of epiphany. I didn't know it was Roundabout at the time. But I recognized it when I eventually heard it again, and I knew it was Chris Squire's Rickenbacker bass that had affected me so much.\n\nThat bass comes in at 0:45. It has this woody, round texture, almost like a thick cord of elastic rope, this is what it feels like to me. Rick Wakeman's keyboard riff at 1:53 is pretty dramatic as well. We had a pipe organ at my church, so I probably thought this was another hippie religious song.\n\nMountains come out of the sky and they stand there...they just stand there, doing what mountains do.","summary":"DEC 7","unixReviewTime":1495756800,"vote":null,"image":null}

They raise a family and then it starts all over again. Its pretty neat how he manages to get so many little bitty's in the song. Its a fast song and probably would be good for dancing the Texas two step. I really like Alan Jackson's songs because they are mostly old country.

I like this one for the 13 second descending metallic fade in, the driving beat, the strings throughout, the weird middle fast spoken bit, the little 'day in the life' outro, the imagery, e.g. 'the tired streets that hide away.' It's a song like the Beatles's 'Misery' - the lyrics tell a story of self-pity and hopelessness, but the music sounds otherwise. No point in 'bringing us down' too much, eh Jeff?

For Billy Joel whom has made music for over 20 years, he definitely has shown to not only make brilliant music, his songs sill today are more timeless, than most of the jokes today on radio. While he chose not to record new music, he still gets the chances to perform whenever his heart has desired. Still, the Piano Man from Long Island, NY is definitely one of those musicians that songs has gotten better with age, and not tried to be what the younger generation wants. One of my favorite staples of Billy's happens to be New York State Of Mind as one of those brilliant and intimate songs that captures and ignites you at the soul from the simplicity of the orchestration, organized by the great Phil Ramone, to the soul of Joel ticking the ivories. It is just a great download for anyone whom had never heard anything great from Billy Joel before.

Sadly, it has been 20 years since the deviating suicide of Michael Hutchence of INXS, and his death is still just as sad and unparalleled for anyone whop is a hard core fan of the 80's Australian rock band. Yet, INXS did try and comeback hard in 2005, with a new lead singer, J.D. Fortune, and he took the group back to the heights they used to have for a brief shining moment with their 2005 album, Switch. Their lead single, Pretty Vegas from the Switch album is one of those songs that tries to bring in the hearty hard core pieces from some of INXS's past songs like Devil Inside from their Kick record. The song is alright, but not anything that tries to be more striking to bring in new fans of INXS. It is just so sad that INXS isn't together anymore, but they did leave a amazing imprint in Australian rock music that has still has not been matched from the land down under. Maybe the next Michael or J.D. will come around the corner and try and be more than fiercely pretty.\n\nSong: C","summary":"Once Rocking Again","unixReviewTime":1483401600,"vote":null,"image":null}

These are great CD's when traveling with the grand kids for sure. We all sing the songs together and talk about our favorite parts of the movie or show the song comes from. We are making new memories associated with the songs on my traveling CD's. Very nice to have when you cant get reception on the radio in some places, and we never have to worry about songs being inappropriate for the kids. This was a great idea and so glad I thought of it. Happy travels for us, we will enjoy these songs for years to come. as many songs on it has been around for years already it is great to share with the kids.","summary":"A very fun song, it is a classic for sure","unixReviewTime":1461196800,"vote":null,"image":null}

{"overall":5.0,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2016","reviewerID":"A3SRSLNNFP7ZFI","asin":"B00136JOO8","style":{"Format:":" MP3 Music"},"reviewerName":"Alexander Julian","reviewText":"Forms of poetry are often logos of memes with positive flaws while songs have new kinds of sentences, considering my patience with time as though my eyes are actually the students for these ears under my hair.  Yes, and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  Dylans associations with mankind are fine because he stays loose and plays with syntax to get insight whether he uses plain English or not, so the intrinsic behaviors to his godly motives are fascinating if also miraculous of intellect as well as rarity.  Utter honesty is his best defense when visions are as light as air, contemplating here about the evolution of deaths even if my prosperity can never be considered the obvious return from my oral literacy or one special type of speech impediment.  Dylans accuracy of life portrayal isn't sketchy but quite a definitive reference to wisdom and proclamations which become ironic for possible answers thatd be too long.  The catch phrase Blowin in the Wind for me implies mystery of wisdom since torrents of weather really haunt peaceful armies before spelling out an unknown danger, being itself a collection of memes that form the real word in a society of slippery doves and washed mountains.  My favoritism of folk music is too my actualization of materialism with secondhand spirits during this sleepy discovery of rounds with musical notes, turning my exhausted body into a medium of reception in the causing sunshine near those musical videogame consoles.  Dylans courage is really his fear, very much in tune with his awkwardness of bravery at a moment here and there, performing with twisty physics; I can say more about this, and Dylans determination isn't usually his regret throughout song playing but promises in emotional terms.  His childish strength is his romantic reign of the songs pieces of advice relating to Earths likely devastations, so Dylans imbecility is cute yet truly serves as a warning symbol for doubt exaggeration.  Blowin in the Wind is a romantic chant because Dylan juggles ideas with infatuated meanings rather than observing an obvious thesis, and by getting to basic predictions he turns out to be a very unlikely hero.  Dylan can inscribe lyrics under purple light due to his abstractions with easygoing agony as well as vague demands, and he cuts a statement to the bone, living through reactions toward ordinary nature in his interesting admiration of defense.  Maybe rapid feedback from reviewers gets customers going, but I like to treat our reading as a chance for meditation instead of fashionable conversation attributed to busy people.  In fact, fashionable conversation attributed to busy people is a source of aliteracy.  By my phrase admiration of defense, Im describing what romance is in poetry.  Indeed, with answers blowing in the clouds around the bends of Dylans proclamations over historic references, I believe we need to be more confused about our learned behaviors since our knowledge of love may occasionally be a precipice to the darkness.  Yes, and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  Blowin in the Wind refers to an answer; however, it may refer to a question in addition, so we can try to find statements in the air without having favorites that ruin vivid scenes or training aggravated nerves.  Its pretty neat to be called a friend after Ive realized my personal edification of sensation over mystery, so Dylans casual attraction to his notions is his gusto of his involved presence around quick-playing harmonicas as well as catchy tunes that play out the roles of a guardian over humanity, and its legal.","summary":"Students Running Eyes","unixReviewTime":1465257600,"vote":null,"image":null}

So much negative was written about the man, it is often too difficult to find a common middle ground among those who favor him versus those who do not mind repeating what seems to be the most popular. Leave Me Alone announces clearly that Mike HEARD it all, evening the references to him and The Elephant Man, which he shows in the video. His expression, through both music and his words, never seem to bring what he wanted the most: peace and\/or acceptance. The Glove started as the result of his vitiligo and that experience, clearly marked what most call abnormal, and he felt the same. Who wants to feel less than, even if others do not say the same? I can recall being teased as a child, from, \"He wears mascara!\" because of my long eyelashes, or, \"He has eyes like Tweetie Bird.\" I got dogged openly, in front of the girls I so wanted to notice me. But for every, and I mean EV-ERY person that ever teased me, including the girls I liked but who only thought, \"Oooh, he's so cute;\" as Biz Markie said, \"They caught the Vapors!\" So the big eyed, mascara wearing male grew up into those eyes and lashes and while those childhood taunts are more whispers now, it is quite easy to identify with at least a part of what makes Michael tick, tock. Perhaps not on the worldwide scale that he knows, but insecurity is insecurity, even if it is witnessed secretly. Leave Me Alone is the theme song for so many of us at various points in our existence, and our lives do not need a camera for an audience: the audience is always there in our minds. Michael unfortunately became the poster child for Ridicule, and it is awful such a powerful song was born out of pain and not pleasure.","summary":"~Did THEY really listen?~","unixReviewTime":1400025600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It made some noise way back when Whitney was still being established. It was never a track on any of her albums, but was labeled more as a Jermaine Jackson song. The keyboard and accompanying instrumental work on this is definitive of the time period  and is an aspect of music that is sorely missed in the contemporary market; remastering really does it justice. Probably sweeter than her Bodyguard work, but not as maudlin as things such as \"All at once\". It's possibly a few steps away from the soul category that her duet with Teddy Pendergrass put her in at the time.","summary":"In the beginning......","unixReviewTime":1424649600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Yet sadly, they have tried to capture that essence without Steve. But it took a very long time before Journey would rejoin the group, and their Trial By Fire album would be the last bow Journey would make without Steve. When You Love A Woman, the lead single from that album is firmly and definitely still a great song that showed what Journey was still able to do in voice and song that measured with their 80's ballads like Open Arms and Separate Ways. The song definitely was underrated, yet still showed the absolute beauty that Journey still could've put forward with Steve, but decided not to and instead said goodbye to him. This is a great memory of what Journey had said goodbye to in love and song.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Perry's Last Bow","unixReviewTime":1391817600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It was tremendously welcomed and embraced by the listening public and has been covered by famous singers and musicians such as Whitney Houston, George Michael, Freddie Cole and Earl Klugh, to name a few.\n\nThe many charms of \"For The Love of You\" from the first note to the last are attributed to Ronald Isley (lead vocals), Ernie Isley (drums\/acoustic guitar), Marvin Isley (bass guitar\/percussion), Chris Jasper (keyboards\/synthesizer), O'Kelly Isley Jr. and Rudolph Isley (background vocals).\n\nThis is a great love song that is meant to be listened to and enjoyed forever.

While he was extraordinarily popular, he died with a very dear broken heart, and with nothing to show for it, with sever debt and problems where he was plagued with accusations of being a pedophile. While he was found not guilty, he was dearly damaged overall. When he released his final album when he was alive, 2001's Invincible. It not just sold poorly, he accused Sony of racism and poor management, where his album definitely suffered and so did he as a entertainer. His final top 10 song, You Rock My World remains a upbeat and soulful dance hit that has been dearly underrated and overlooked among Jackson's biggest dance songs like Beat It and Dirty Diana. The song brought in a more R&B groove that is driven, with a good sample of Sybil's Don't Make My Over, and showed one final time that Michael was still trying to stand, even though he was looked as a mixed bag. Still, it is a upbeat song worth listening to for die hard fans of the late King Of Pop, and new Michael Jackson fans alike, only whom discovered him because his Michael's death.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","summary":"He Rocked Our World, One Final Time Alive","unixReviewTime":1462060800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The crap they raged against still hasn't changed. We need to stop writing songs about the problems, and actually step up and FIX them.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe lyrics just feel hollow, as for the meaning of the song, when the corporations and governments of this world are more toxic than ever. The Beatles nailed it over half a century ago... \"You say you want a revolution...\" But no one's got the stones to make it happen ever again.\n\nInstead, we'll bury our heads in the sand and let the right and left and the megacorporations and religions a, b, and c, control our world while we slave away to prop them up further above us every day.

One of my all time favorite movies too.  I  have made a CD of this song and many other old and new family friendly songs for all of our road trip we take all summer long. Is a great CD when traveling with the grand kids for sure. We all sing the songs together and talk about our favorite parts of the movie or show the song comes from. We are making new memories associated with the songs on my traveling CD. Very nice to have when you cant get reception on the radio in some places and we never have to worry about songs being inappropriate for the kids. This was a great idea and so glad I thought of it. Happy travels for us, we will enjoy these songs for years to come. as many songs on it has been around for years already it is great to share with the kids.","summary":"One of my favorite things is this song","unixReviewTime":1461196800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Not that I had completely stopped listening to Mike, that would never happen. But it can become pretty routine and extremely easily to get stuck on particular favorites, keeping them on repeat, without savoring the full spectrum of his creations and collaborations. More that anything, smooth jazz is the staple of the vast majority of my music, but considering that I have trumped well over 10,000 tracks, I am knee deep into R&B\/Soul, as well. On a recent drive my wife stated she wanted to hear more Mike that anything else, and that caused me to have to go down into the cellar, into the archives if you will, and re-discover much more that I possess of his music. Another Part of Me is just one example of how BAD he really is, and in my opinion, it solidifies his position not only as the greatest entertainer ever, but the greatest singer, too. This is definitely a dance hit, if you can a way to not kick your leg high and bring your mouth and nose together in a failed attempt to mimic him! His vocal range is just awesome, and whether the music is slow and soulful or upbeat and gritty, he always gives us the right pitch to match every single hit. You can get lost in the music as it is driven to heart stopping highs to even lovelier lows, but when tracks are remastered, be sure you set your system right to just stop, and just listen. The arrangements, when discerned, will whet your appetite for more and you'll appreciate his artistry that much better. Truly, if asked, he could just simply say, \"Well, singing, like dancing, it's just Another Part of Me.

Among The Limeliters best known tunes were \"A Dollar Down\" (their only charted single), \"There's a Meetin' Here Tonight\", ''City of New Orleans,\" and \"Lonesome Traveler.\" Glenn left the group in 1963 to pursue a solo career. Glenn had two songs reach the Billboard Hot 100. The biggest of the two was 1965's \"Baby, The Rain Must Fall\" which was the title song of a motion picture starring Lee Remick and Steve McQueen. The song peaked at #12 on the pop charts and climbed to #2 on the Adult Contemporary charts. It was always a joy to hear this tune.

It is unfortunately that there aren't many good songs that were made from films these days. What she had really accomplished from her work in The Bodyguard, The Preacher's Wife and Waiting To Exhale, really captures the essence that really isn't felt in music and film anymore. Her songs from Waiting To Exhale might have been fewer than The Bodyguard & The Preacher's Wife, but they are still a joy to listen to. Count On Me, Whitney Houston's duet with gospel great Cece Winans is actually one of those comfort songs that really stays with you at the soul. It is one of my favorite songs Whitney recorded in her lifetime, and it still says a lot more joy at the down to Earth connection she had made in the voice. Cece really also complimented Whitney so nicely, from the inner visions as well. They had remarkable chemistry together.

Many of today's female divas do not come from the heart, and they do not even try. Hard to believe it has been 20 years since the legendary Whitney Houston appeared in Waiting To Exhale, and the film honestly still sends shivers up my spine on the Terry McMillan adapted film. Whitney's music from the film after all these years still ignites beautifully from the heart with each and every note recorded. Her signature song, Exhale (Shoop Shoop) remains as one of my favorite songs that she did from a film soundtrack. The simplicity of her own voice and beloved heart still ignites a intimate fire that hasn't seemed to go out after all this time. It is one of my favorite movie songs, and truthfully one of Whitney Houston's best. If you have never heard the music from Waiting To Exhale, than I sincerely suggest you download Exhale (Shoop Shoop.)\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Shooped","unixReviewTime":1432339200,"vote":null,"image":null}

From my perspective, all mixed up by 311 appears to be about figuring out the wisest actions and the best ways for an individual to go along in their life while successfully separating a sea of both critical and well-meaning people who may be trying to steer a man or woman another way. With the lyrics, trust your instincts, Im guessing that all mixed up by 311 symbolizes tuning into your intuition as the smoothest way to go when trying to successfully separate what a person wishes to personally do in comparison to what their critics, friends, and\/or family members may tell them.","summary":"rock anthem for intuition?","unixReviewTime":1420675200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Musically, she is one of the greatest divas in the world, that has shown that True beauty is solely from the voice within. She showcased a amazing bravado at the heart of the matter. But overall, she died at a very young age. But if there is one thing that I have known about Whitney, is that unlike other divas of today, her voice really reached from the deepest inner soul, something that I still adore today, much more than today's divas like Rihanna or Beyonce' Knowles that are products, not people. It also is the 25th anniversary of The Bodyguard soundtrack, the biggest selling soundtrack in the world, that absolutely defined a era of the music, the 1990's. I absolutely adore all of the songs Whitney Houston performed on the soundtrack, and Run To You is absolutely no exception. The song is absolutely beautiful & soulful from Whitney's vocals, each time I hear the song. It truly is astonishing & beautiful. It really is that high of the top tier, as is the case with I Will Always Love You & any other ballad Whitney had recorded over the years. It truly is a lovely opus that is worth any listener's ear that really strikes the essence of beauty.

They will never be soulful and beautiful as was the great Whitney Houston. If there is one thing that I have adored about Whitney is that she always sang from the soul brilliantly. But not only do I think of Whitney alone, I also do think if her one and only baby, Bobbi Kristina Brown, whom tragically died in 2015 from abuse from drugs and severe depression dealing with Whitney's death three years earlier. But when I do think of Whitney and Bobbi together as mother and daughter, I do think of so many of Whitney Houston's songs, and with the anniversary of Bobbi Kristina's passing, I do think of the two of them in song, and the song where Bobbi Kristina go her short start is My Love Is Your Love. The song is definitely soulful and very upbeat from the heart today, as it was back then in 1998 when it came out. Wyclef Jean wrote a very lovely song for Whitney Houston and it still is one of those songs that I love listening to.

Also, with the tragic coma her daughter has been under, it is so sad to think about how heartbroken Whitney would've felt. Still Bobbi Kristina's introduction through Whitney Houston's music was with the song My Love Is Your Love. The song is still a refreshing and joyous song that really brought Whitney out in the forefront at a generation that was interested when really great R&B music was coming into play from acts like TLC, Toni Braxton and others. Wyclef Jean really wrote a beautiful song for Whitney Houston.

Honestly words can still not express the beautiful and lovely treasure she had shared with the world for over 25 years, in the gift of song. That is still just as strong and intimate more than a lot of the joke divas of radio today like Beyonce' Knowles or Rihanna who've cared more about severe overexposure, rather than the natural intimacy and simplicity of the voice within. Whitney Houston had shown that musically for years with each and every original song she did, as well as the covers of the rainbow she made for her own. That is definitely the case with each and every song she did for the movies as well. Her rendition of I Believe In You & Me from The Preacher's Wife is one of my favorite cover songs she had ever recorded. Her rendition of The Four Tops classic definitely was made to her own so nobly. I think of this song for Whitney, just as deeply as any song she had ever recorded for movies like Waiting To Exhale & The Bodyguard. If you have never heard a Whitney Houston song before, well this is one I sincerely recommend you listen to.\n\nWhitney Houston: 1963-2012...

This is a song of changing fashion. It's quite cynical and has the wry humour that Billy Joel has made his specialty over the years. The music echoes the late '50s early '60s styles very well and carries the mood and lyric very well.

With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.","summary":"Love :)","unixReviewTime":1459555200,"vote":null,"image":null}

She has had songs that have sincerely set the world on fire and delivered throughout the best of times and the worst of times as well. When she released her greatest hits album, there were a lot of songs she had came out with, some good and some bad. But she did have  some excellent songs she recorded for the record. Could I Have This Kiss Forever, with Enrique Iglesias honestly one of those few songs that have showed her sensual voice heart and soul. While it hasn't had that longevity as other duets that Whitney had made for years whether it was the great Teddy Pendergrass or her ex-husband Bobby Brown on Something In Common. Still, it honestly is a electrifying song that still delivers so well. If you love Enrique Iglesias and the Latin drive of songs he has had for years, and for what he had done with Whitney, than this is one song I sincerely recommend.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","summary":"Kissed Forever","unixReviewTime":1425513600,"vote":null,"image":null}

This song was their first hit. It made the charts in the US, Holland and Australia. It was first released as a single before the entire album was finished. A discerning ear can detect some differences between the single and the album version. In my opinion, the differences are insignificant. Their music is very peppy and uplifting. It makes you wanna get up and dance your legs off. I did, back then. Now I'm old and less agile. But when I hear that song my humble gait seems to go through some sort of rejuvenation. I need to listen to it more often. I just love it. The MP3 sound quality is acceptable, actually quite good.","summary":"Timeless Classic","unixReviewTime":1486080000,"vote":null,"image":null}

My favoritism of folk music is too my actualization of materialism with secondhand spirits during this sleepy discovery of rounds with musical notes, turning my exhausted body into a medium of reception in the causing sunshine near those musical videogame consoles.  Dylans courage is really his fear, very much in tune with his awkwardness of bravery at a moment here and there, performing with twisty physics; I can say more about this, and Dylans determination isn't usually his regret throughout song playing but promises in emotional terms.  His childish strength is his romantic reign of the songs pieces of advice relating to Earths likely devastations, so Dylans imbecility is cute yet truly serves as a warning symbol for doubt exaggeration.  Blowin in the Wind is a romantic chant because Dylan juggles ideas with infatuated meanings rather than observing an obvious thesis, and by getting to basic predictions he turns out to be a very unlikely hero.  Dylan can inscribe lyrics under purple light due to his abstractions with easygoing agony as well as vague demands, and he cuts a statement to the bone, living through reactions toward ordinary nature in his interesting admiration of defense.  Maybe rapid feedback from reviewers gets customers going, but I like to treat our reading as a chance for meditation instead of fashionable conversation attributed to busy people.  In fact, fashionable conversation attributed to busy people is a source of aliteracy.  By my phrase admiration of defense, Im describing what romance is in poetry.  Indeed, with answers blowing in the clouds around the bends of Dylans proclamations over historic references, I believe we need to be more confused about our learned behaviors since our knowledge of love may occasionally be a precipice to the darkness.  Yes, and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  Blowin in the Wind refers to an answer; however, it may refer to a question in addition, so we can try to find statements in the air without having favorites that ruin vivid scenes or training aggravated nerves.  Its pretty neat to be called a friend after Ive realized my personal edification of sensation over mystery, so Dylans casual attraction to his notions is his gusto of his involved presence around quick-playing harmonicas as well as catchy tunes that play out the roles of a guardian over humanity, and its legal.","summary":"Students Running Eyes","unixReviewTime":1465257600,"vote":null,"image":null}

While the music from Born In The U.S.A. was supreme in the 80's, the music out of his Tunnel Of Love album shows just how much Bruce really rose to supreme heights, but also the end of his first marriage ending, and finding a love anew with his wife of over 25 years Patti Scalfa. One Step Up is definitely a great song, and one of Bruce's underrated gems of his that came out of the 80's. I definitely love the song not just because it is brilliant and simple, he shows a nice heart into his words and appeal. We really do not have great artists in this era like the reign of \"The Boss.\" This is a great download for die hard Bruce Springsteen ans, and newcomers of this era alike.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"One Step Ahead","unixReviewTime":1416009600,"vote":"2","image":null}

The song depicts the singer in a hopeless marriage that he and wife keep living the same old sad story and act.  They keep fighting and having little battles in their dirty war.  This drives the singer to a bar where he contemplates sleeping with another woman.  He sees that she isn't married and he knows he's just pretending to be.  After he's seen his potential one-night stand he remembers that he dreamt the night before that he danced with his wife to never ending music.

One of the most memorable was \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" in which a teenage driver had a fatal accident in the stock car race he had entered to win cash to buy a wedding ring. The tale was all the more effective for being sung in an angelic high tenor by Ray Peterson.\n\nRay Peterson was born in Denton, TX on April 23, 1935. As a young boy he contracted polio which required lengthy hospitalization. But while in the hospital he began to sing for the other patients and decided that is what he wanted to do with his life. In 1957 Ray Peterson moved to Los Angeles and signed a recording deal with RCA Victor. He had several modest hits and then in June of 1960 RCA released \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" written by Jeff Barry and Ben Raleigh. It would become a Top Ten hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"A real tear jerker!","unixReviewTime":1469059200,"vote":null,"image":null}

One of the best songs ever written by Paul Simon. Considering the list of great songs he has written over the decades that certainly says a lot. With his partner Art Garfunkel they created a mood and tone to the song that was a commentary about society in the mid-1960s as America was in the middle of a political and cultural turmoil. Their harmonization, which was always something they were well known for, is exceptional in this recording.

After all, in the mid to late 1970's no one was considered less cool and more irrelevant than Barry Manilow. His records were played on the radio ad nauseam and lots of \"sophisticated\" people dismissed his music as trite. But the fact of the matter is that Barry Manilow and his producer Ron Dante made some of the most enduring pop records of the last 40 years.  Now I must confess that I do like quite a few of Manilow's 1970's hits.  Among my favorites is a tune from the 1978 motion picture \"Foul Play\" starring Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase.  \"Ready To Take A Chance Again\" is a tune that most people can readily relate to.  Although it just missed cracking the Top Ten it was still a substantial hit in the autumn of 1978.  A terrific pop ballad.","summary":"A song about a situation most folks can relate to.","unixReviewTime":1470441600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It has been the case with too many crooners today. But when Marvin Gaye was around, he sincerely showed his soul so uniquely in a place and time where his sensuality in song at hand and voice. Sadly though, it has been over thirty years since he was violently murdered by his own father. But honestly, his work has been bigger than life today, even though he is not here anymore. His last major hit, Marvin's only big hit when he left Motown for CBS Records, Sexual Hearing is one of those tracks that still delivers from the swooning of the seductive soul. It is one of those songs that continues to show why Midnight Soul has a very deep place in so many hearts. It is a song that really is worth its money every time you listen to it. If you had never heard a Marvin Gaye song before, well this song is one that I recommend that you do go to from start to finish. It might've been Marvin Gaye's last big hit, but it is still sexual at the soul.\n\nSong: A","summary":"Sexual Soul","unixReviewTime":1464912000,"vote":null,"image":null}

They really do bring back so many memories. Memory lane as they say. Some of these songs can really bring you back to a certain times of your life. Often times I remember things that I had long forgotten, or so I thought. It is just great to listen and relax and enjoy these great songs. I grow up with so many of them. I love that I have my music on Amazon, this way I have them every where I go that I can excess my Amazon Music. I do often listen on my laptop when I am travel and staying in hotels. Nice to have some thing familiar with me. I love that I will never ever lose them or scratch them ever again. No more finding the wrong CD in the case either! That really was aggravating. Will have them forever if you are buying your music in mp3 form from Amazon.","summary":"I really just love listening to these older songs","unixReviewTime":1462320000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Speedwagon's music fit perfectly with my life and the intense emotions of a young adult out in the world. Keep On Loving You brings back a real mix of feelings and reminds me how I was feeling back in those days..\n\nKeep On Loving you was especially timely as it hit the airwaves just when a relationship which seemed to have great promise fell apart. I got the \"Hi Infidelity\" album and recorded it to cassette to play in my car. Pretty much all of the Hi Infidelity music fits into my category of driving music. I wore that old cassette out and hard to record another.\n\nI don't have cassettes any more but the MP3 I have hooked into my car audio features \"Keep On Loving You\" prominently on my driving playlist and I still love driving beat and smooth harmony of the vocals.\n\nREO Speedwagon's \"Keep On Loving You\" and the whole \"High Infidelity\" album have stood the test of time and hold up well for me even 35 years later. It's great music to listen to while driving and takes me back to a intense emotional time in my life. I think it's an essential track whether you were coming into age in 1980 or caught it much later. It stands the test of time and is worthy of 5 stars from me.","summary":"Brings Back 1980s Feeling, Great Driving Song, Good Beat\/Smooth Harmonies, Stands Up Well Today","unixReviewTime":1450656000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Paul McCartney is one of those, Steve Tyler is one, Neil Diamond is one, Gordon Lightfoot is one,  Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith are a pair but then there is Bruce Springsteen. He doesn't just sing ABOUT things in his rock ballads but it is pretty obvious that they come from someplace extremely personal, most likely his own life. \"The River\" is a great rock ballad that touches very personally on a significant portion of the population of the United States, the tragic story of teenage pregnancy coupled with a declining industry to employ these fathers. In Springsteen's \"The River\" the new generation repeats the old generation except now the jobs are gone.

One of the local alternative radio stations frequently played this song on their radio station. I also heard B.Y.O.B by System Of A Down a lot during the summer of 2005 because it was featured on my Yahoo music radio subscription (Yahoo music radio was similar to the current Pandora music subscription features in that multiple music genres\/radio stations were offered, but it was later discontinued). Anyhow, B.Y.O.B by System Of A Down is a brilliant hard rock song the uses lyrics of everyone going to a party with the seriousness of a political music discussion. I admit that I was strangely compelled to check out the B.Y.O.B music video (and eventually purchase the song)after it was recommended to me after I watched Love Is All Around by DJ Bobo and Clint Eastwood by The Gorillaz.","summary":"Political Rock Song?","unixReviewTime":1406073600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Not only are her songs strong and straight from the soul and heart, but she has much better songs than those wannabe divas like Beyonce' and The Pussycat Dolls. Her latest single, Superwoman, the fourth single from As I Am is absolutely no acception. The song is very heartfelt and delivers a very strong message to woman everywhere, about defying the odds, and proving that you can be aything that you want to be from the heart, unlike the images we've been seeing from Paris Hilton and Ashley Dupree, the foolish and selfish call girl who slept with former New York Governor Elliot Spitzer, that has said the only way you can be a role is by being a bit sexier on the outside. Thankfully, Alicia really proves that theory absolutely wrong, and just being yourself in the heart and soul is really all that should matter, whether it is being a lawyer or doctor or just about being anything. I like the message Alicia delivers, and it should be delivered to woman everywhere as a strong sign that you really can be a superwoman.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Super Keys","unixReviewTime":1216857600,"vote":null,"image":null}

I'm guessing that it comes from the fact that this song, lyrics aside is a masterfully crafted hit of a song that carries emotion to match the lyrics. It is a very angry song but at the same time, it is a very liberating song. Without saying it explicitly, the song appears to be by a man, not an American, who is jaded by a recent relationship with an American woman. Since Burton Cummings is Canadian this would be an appropriate vantage point from which he might write. If you've ever felt used and unjustly dumped, this would be your choice of angry songs. However, it is a great hit on its own merit and deserves a spot in your collection.","summary":"A Great Tune After A Breakup","unixReviewTime":1498780800,"vote":null,"image":null}

What an intense song! A dramatic first 15 seconds, very intense and focused, then hurricane Janis roars in with the 'come on' vocals before taking it down into the first verse. But soon her intensity is back up and she is screaming out pain and suffering at the hands of the man she loves with abandon, but he treats her like you know what.  She's like, 'fine, keep crushing my heart if it makes you feel better', but she still can't bring herself to leave him. It's like an anti-torch song, or more like a flame thrower song. I like when Sam Andrew comes in with his vocals on the chorus. His guitar solos are awesome too.","summary":"JUL 26","unixReviewTime":1497052800,"vote":null,"image":null}

She has shown real beauty & soul from the voice within with each note she has sung. But it is surprising that it has been over 15 years since she broke out with Songs In A Minor. The album had launched her soulful reign as one of the most premiere artists of the 2000 decade & beyond. Whenever I listen to Songs In A Minor, I do enjoy each track from start to finish. Fallin' is absolutely one of my favorites & her third single A Woman's Worth is also one song that shows real beauty from the eyes of a lady, into what a man wants at the heart from someone to stand by him. I really love how deep the soul is from Alicia, but a lot of people have forgotten about this song after awhile. Still, when you listen to Alicia Keys, you know she is in the pantheon of the greatest songstresses in the world, whether it is Whitney Houston, Roberta Flack or Nina Simone. If you never heard a Alicia Keys song, well I suggest you check this one out.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","summary":"A Lady's Strength","unixReviewTime":1505174400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Imagine my pleasant surprise when I noticed (after meeting my husband around 6-8 years later) that he enjoys this song (my husband had previously purchased the Fashion Nugget cd by Cake before I figured out he liked The Distance).  The Distance song by Cake gives the song imagery of race car driving and about a character who is so dedicated to his intensity for race car driving to where the interest at times encroaches on his personal life. I understand that this 90s rock classic could mean something else, it was just that I felt the need to guess as I write this before I eventually turn to the songfacts and\/or songmeanings website to analyze the tunes meaning.","summary":"One of My Husbands Favorite 90s Alternative Rock Songs","unixReviewTime":1460332800,"vote":null,"image":null}

This song, which first appeared on the album \"Vinyl Confessions\" marks the end of my teenage rock years, just before I got into the newer rock of the 80s dominated by such bands as the Police, U2, INXS and REM.\n\nIt is difficult to recommend this song on its merits.  As with most Kansas songs, the musicianship is good to excellent, but the songwriting itself is uninspiring.\n\nIf you like the progressive\/art rock sound this song won't offend you.

It is so sad that many of today's divas like Rihanna, Beyonce' and Katy Perry, just haven't even shown a brilliance in soul and songwriting that has really stood the test of time. It is so sad that many of today's divas so far never will have Alicia Keys style and strength in song. When she came out with Songs In A Minor back in 2001, it really was a game changer when a lot of soul music was deeply overlooked in regards to rap and hip hop throughout the 90's. The song that started it all for Alicia Keys, Fallin', still remains simply soulful and striking from each and every not Alicia put into the song. She definitely showed that she can not only sing, but Alicia can have style in song from beginning to end. I like this is song a whole lot. If you have never heard a Alicia Keys song before, well this is the first one I suggest you download for your music library.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Still Fallin'","unixReviewTime":1468454400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Take, for example, \"She Wolf.\" It has a really great beat, and it's a cute danceable tune. But the lyrics need to be fixed.

Speedwagon's music fit perfectly with my life and the intense emotions of a young adult out in the world. Keep On Loving You brings back a real mix of feelings and reminds me how I was feeling back in those days..\n\nKeep On Loving you was especially timely as it hit the airwaves just when a relationship which seemed to have great promise fell apart. I got the \"Hi Infidelity\" album and recorded it to cassette to play in my car. Pretty much all of the Hi Infidelity music fits into my category of driving music. I wore that old cassette out and hard to record another.\n\nI don't have cassettes any more but the MP3 I have hooked into my car audio features \"Keep On Loving You\" prominently on my driving playlist and I still love driving beat and smooth harmony of the vocals.\n\nREO Speedwagon's \"Keep On Loving You\" and the whole \"High Infidelity\" album have stood the test of time and hold up well for me even 35 years later. It's great music to listen to while driving and takes me back to a intense emotional time in my life. I think it's an essential track whether you were coming into age in 1980 or caught it much later. It stands the test of time and is worthy of 5 stars from me.","summary":"Brings Back 1980s Feeling, Great Driving Song, Good Beat\/Smooth Harmonies, Stands Up Well Today","unixReviewTime":1450656000,"vote":null,"image":null}

The correct translation of the word \"oye\" is listen. The translation of the lyrics is thus: \"Listen to my rhythm, good for fun, mulata!!\" (thanks, Alexei - Sao Paulo, Brazil)\nGregg Rolie, who sang on many of Santana's early hits, took the lead vocals on this song. Rolie was a founding member and keyboard player for Santana; he joined Journey in 1973.\nThe original version by Tito Puente was used in a commercial television advertisement campaign for Nissan.

It was part of the sound track for the movie 'Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid'. This is Bob Dylan at his best. Only he can make a song like this come to life. Well, he did write it. He wrote many songs for other performers, and many other performers covered material that he wrote and performed. This song was covered by 'Guns N' Roses' and 'The Raign', for example. Those versions are not too bad but do not stand a comparison. Some songs just simply need to be performed by Bob himself as the others just can't cut it. This is one of them.

The incident has been overblown by the press -- and Weird Al and Coolio even made up and settled their differences somewhere along the line -- but in the end it probably turned out to be good for Al's career.  After all, how many people would have paid much attention to Al's parody had it not been for Coolio kicking up a fuss?\n\nI dislike rap in general and am ambivalent toward \"Gangster's Paradise\" specifically... but Al's parody is a hilarious sendup, poking some not-too-harsh fun at the Amish and having some fun with the original song without mutilating it beyond recognition.\n\nOne of Al's greatest strengths has been creating parodies that still hew close to the original song, often to the point of having musicians from the original group perform their parts.  \"Amish Paradise\" is very stylistically close to \"Gangster's Paradise,\" to the point where, the few times I have heard the original, I've mistaken it for Al's version up until he started singing.  The humor comes from occasionally tweaking elements of the original song or music video for humorous effect, and from they lyrics themselves.  Plus, it's just funny to hear the song being sung with utmost seriousness, but with such absurd and ridiculous lyrics.\n\nSaid lyrics do poke fun at the lifestyle of the Amish, but they're never mean-spirited.  It's probably very unlikely that the Amish will ever hear the song for themselves, but I doubt they'd find much in the song offensive.  It does call the Amish's lifestyle boring, but let's face it, our technology-addicted culture probably WOULD find the Amish way of life boring and primitive.  It's all for comedic effect, and not to bash or demonize anyone's lifestyle.\n\nEven as someone who isn't a fan of rap, I place \"Amish Paradise\" among my favorite of Weird Al's songs.  It's fun, catchy, and a good homage to the original without being disrespectful.","summary":"No such thing as bad publicity","unixReviewTime":1424649600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Pepper","reviewText":"Originally on the minor label release \"Cold Spring Harbor\", this is to my taste Billy Joel at his very finest, maybe the best love song he wrote. Unfortunately, Billy had to escape from the lousy deal and inept management\/production of the contract with his first label and literally hid out in a piano bar for a couple of years. The two best thing that came from his experience with that first record company were this song, which miraculously is one of his best despite the conditions it was originally recorded under, and \"Piano Man\" which arose directly out of that piano bar. There is another version recorded live in front of a small audience by Columbia Records and released on \"Songs from the Attic\" in 1981. That version reached number 23 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart and number 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It is the one on most compilations. The original is on one of several versions of \"Greatest Hits Volumes One and Two\" and the live version is on others. The best way to get the original is to download the version from \"Cold Spring Harbor\" The version I downloaded at this link was the live version. They are enough different to make it worth having both! Both versions are great, with the original version being more tender. The live version benefits from the energy of a small intimate crowd and is the familiar version.","summary":"Get both the live and the original version!","unixReviewTime":1397260800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Over the next several years Petula Clark would brighten America's airwaves with sensational singles like \"I Know A Place\", \"Don't Sleep In The Subway\", \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\" and \"My Love\" to name but a few. In March 1967 Warner Brothers released Petula Clark's stunning interpretation of \"This Is My Song\", a tune written by silver screen legend Charlie Chaplin.

The only talent she had was when she was a part of Destiny's Child. But on her own, she has oversaturated the market where it has been too much about her, and no one else. When she was starting to get out on her own, she had one or two songs, but that was it. Her collaborations with her husband though, not even exciting. Her song Deja Vu from her 2005 album B' Day, has not been impressive, trying to recapture the chemistry she one had with him on Crazy In Love, and sadly she does not impress at all. I really did not enjoy the song, and sadly it is not worth listening to, especially when it has been overplayed so many times.

When Motown pulled up stakes and moved the bulk of its operations to the West Coast in the early 1970's the center of gravity in the world of soul music shifted dramatically. But it did not, as the executives at Motown had hoped, follow them to Los Angeles. Rather, the new capitol of soul music was located about 450 miles to the south and east of Detroit in the City of Brotherly Love. For it was just about that same time that producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff in conjunction with CBS founded Philadelphia International Records. It would go on to become the dominant soul label for the next decade featuring artists like Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, Billy Paul, The Three Degrees and so many others. But clearly the most important and successful group to record for Philadelphia International was The O'Jays.\n\nNow before signing with Philadelphia International in 1972 The O'Jays had been around the block a time or two. The group was formed in 1961 and was originally known as The Triumphs. The group was renamed by Cleveland disc jockey Eddie O'Jay.  During the 1960's The O'Jays amassed a total of 10 charted singles but none made a huge splash on the Billboard Hot 100.  That would all change in July 1972 with the release of \"Backstabbers\" which would peak at #3.  It quickly became apparent that Gamble & Huff knew how to best utilize the talents of this venerable group and several more hits would follow over the next few years.","summary":"One of the best singles of the 1970's.","unixReviewTime":1470096000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Musically, he had shown a lot of brilliance. But personally, Michael was suffering internally and that is why he passed away so young. Yet it was already 7 years since the King Of Pop passed away and shocked the world. When Michael Jackson did release his Invincible album in 2001, it fell not just in poor sales, but disgusted promotion from Sony, and Jackson wound up abruptly leaving the label on protest and indignity. But also the songs didn't strike outside of the R&B arena at the whole. Heaven Can Wait is one of those overlooked songs that could've been bigger from he soul Michael had shown at the song. At the time, Michael was trying to fit into both the N'Sync & Backstreet Boys era, which feel through the cracks. But the song has had more cult status posthumously, as is the case with Maxwell sampling Heaven Can Wait for his song 1990x, which is a better sampled song at the soul.

But after hearing from multiple sources that \"Africa\" was one of their best, I decided to give it a listen.  Turns out I'd heard it before, I just hadn't known the title or connected it to Toto at all.  And while I still prefer \"Rosanna\" over \"Africa,\" \"Africa\" is still a very enjoyable song, and makes me want to check out more by the band.\n\n\"Africa\" is a nice upbeat song, a well-done mix of pop and rock with a tune that's pleasant to listen to and good vocal harmonies.  The lyrics are somewhat generic -- despite the occasional Africa references (such as Kilimanjaro), it seems more like a generic love song than anything else.  Still, as another well-known band likes to say, \"some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs, and what's wrong with that?\"\n\nA pleasant song, and a good listen for anyone who enjoys Toto or '80s music in general.  Pairs nicely with \"Rosanna\" or anything by Starship or Journey.","summary":"Somewhat generic but very pleasant and upbeat song","unixReviewTime":1517788800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The latter song is actually not so bad in a happy, hippy-ish kind of way but compared to their old stuff like \"Drops Of Jupiter\" it seriously pales in comparison.\n\n\"Ordinary\" is a very awesome song about life through Spiderman's eyes basically. He is saving the world and stuff but people take him for granted.

From a very early age Ocie expressed a keen interest in becoming a singer. His first love was jazz but he also dug the blues. He was greatly influenced by people like Nat King Cole, B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Tony Bennett, Billy Eckstine and Ray Charles. Ocie sang with a number of big bands including a two and a half year stint with the Count Basie Orchestra in the early 1960's. Then in 1966 he signed a recording contract with Columbia records. His first single in early 1966 was a mellow, slowly swaying and highly memorable song called \"Thats Life\" (by Kelly Gordon  Dean Kay Thompson). \"Thats Life\" made some noise but didn't sell enough copies to hit the national charts (later, in early 67, it bubbled under at # 127). While riding in his car Frank Sinatra, however, heard the song on the radio, arranged a meeting with O.C. and asked for O.C.s blessing to cover the song.  O.C. was flattered, and almost a year later, in late 66, Frank took the song into Billboard Hot 100, where it climbed all the way to #4.\n\nThen in the autumn of 1968 O.C.s cover of Bobby Russells gentle and innocent ballad \"Little Green Apples\" hit the market and became O.C.s biggest hit. It went as high as # 2 on both the pop and R&B charts and became a certified gold record. The record also garnered two Grammy awards as Pop Song of the Year and Country Song of the Year for 1968.  This is the original Columbia hit recording you would remember from the radio.","summary":"One of the great vocal performances of the 1960's.","unixReviewTime":1477872000,"vote":null,"image":null}

I have loved this song since it first came out, but at the time, I was young enough, I didn't really understand what it was about.  Now, as a grown up who watched a loved one fight and loose a battle with drug addiction, I get it.  And for a pop song, this is actually pretty haunting in it's sound.  But that is appropriate, because that is exactly what addiction does...it haunts not only the person who is using, but everyone in their lives.  And sometimes, like in the original video for this song, you end up with nothing but memories which will continue the haunting.  So many people think they're just signing on for a bit of fun, whether it's with street or prescription substances, and end up signing their lives away.  It's been 15 years this week since my brother passed away.  And it's a week that always haunts me, as does this song.  But I still love this song, even now that I am very painfully aware of what it means, it holds up very well to the passage of time, and not everything does.","summary":"Haunting Song about Addiction","unixReviewTime":1492819200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Born in Epsom England in 1932, Petula Clark made her entrance into show business at a very young age. In fact she hosted her very own radio show \"Pet's Parlour\" at the age of 11 and made her debut on the British charts way back in 1954. At the tender age of 22 Petula Clark would become a major recording star in Britain. She maintained a constant presence on the British charts for the next decade and was a major star throughout Europe as well. Then lightning struck in early 1965 when \"Downtown\" went all the way to #1 on the U.S. pop charts. Just a few months later Warner Brothers released the follow-up single \"I Know A Place\". The song was nearly as big a hit as \"Downtown\" in the U.S. peaking at #3 and would earn Petula Clark a Grammy for \"Best Rock & Roll Female Vocal\" of 1965.  A memorable vocal performance!","summary":"Grammy award winning single from 1965.","unixReviewTime":1468972800,"vote":null,"image":null}

In the late '50s into the '60s the folk music scene overflowed with talent including Dylan, Beaz, Peter,Paul and Mary to name just a few. By the mid-60s as Dylan shocked the folk music scene by playing an electric guitar at Newport, folk music itself would soon follow suite. \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" would become the most well known and loved song of the folk-rock movement. Performed by The Byrds, music written by Pete Seeger and the words from the book of Ecclesiastes combines for a memorable recording. Just an overall mesmerising performance that is still 50 years later relevant and important and will be, no doubt, that way for generations to come.","summary":"Memorable Recording","unixReviewTime":1476748800,"vote":"2","image":null}

But when it has came down to his last studio album was here was alive, Invincible, it has been a bit more lagged than strong when it has came down to great songs. While it did have some good songs like You Rock My World, Butterflies and Cry, others just simply couldn't drive in the heart. Break Of Dawn, showed more of a dance and R&B rhythm from what Michael had shown in his other songs. The song honestly wasn't a strong one, but showed his vocals maturely. Sadly, though I didn't feel it was one of his stronger songs in R&B, the way he had it with Bad and Thriller. It really wasn't his best effort, but a good song after time has gone by. If you are a massive Michael Jackson fan, get Invincible as a album.\n\nSong: C+","summary":"Broken Dawn","unixReviewTime":1414195200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The songs really have defined here as a definitive diva in the ranks of legends like Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and the great Natalie Cole. Every song from Secrets really remains seductive, beautiful from the essence of the soul of the songstress itself. When I think of Secrets, I really think of every song because it defined her more than her debut record did in 1993. One of my favorite songs that still ignites from Secrets, You're Makin' Me High, still ignites as a sensual essenced song that will really want to make you get your groove on with the one that you love. The song still 20 years after it came out, is strong as other sensual songs like Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On and Chris Isaak's Wicked Game. It is one of my favorite seductive songs that really is worth the money, and if you have never heard a Toni Braxton song, well this is one the top tracks I absolutely recommend overall.\n\nSong: A","summary":"She Still Is High","unixReviewTime":1481241600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The shock of the death of Pete Burns has been deviating, but not a real surprised. He really was one of the most driven artists that had been more known as a one-hit wonder, than having massive success beyond the 80's. But also, his death was from the years of drugs and plastic surgery and him becoming a transvestite, becoming a man and being a woman at the end of the day. But nevertheless, he will always be known for just one song. That is how his friends and fans want to remember him and Dead Or Alive. You Spin Me Round (Like A Record) remains one of the most driven anthems to have ever came out of the 80's, in excess but also at heart as well. It has been one of those songs worthwhile at spirit, but also shows just how strong the 80's anthems ignite today, more than almost all of the artists that have ever came out with a album. But anyway, this is how Pete Burns should be remembered, as a fad, but as a strong example of what music was like in the era of excess.\n\nSong: B\n\nPete Burns  1959-2016","summary":"Pete Burns R.I.P.","unixReviewTime":1477353600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Back then it was, Make that change.\n\nAesthetically both philanthropy anthems are about the same, but the message sounded more urgent in 1987. The melodies are well composed and the ad-libs during the final minute near classic Michael Jackson, but, despite backup from a full gospel choir, he sounds less energetic, ironically less Invincible, here.\n\nmarcellee.com","summary":"4 of 5","unixReviewTime":1498003200,"vote":null,"image":null}

But honestly, it has nearly been seven years since his tragic death occurred, and the world mourned at once because his passing from drugs, sedatives and abuse he had suffered for years. I definitely do not think Michael Jackson had ever forgotten how much he was accused of a pedophile and how so many of the things he was accused of hurt him at the very end of his own life back in 2009. He had very few good songs though that Michael recorded before he passed away that really showed a lot of heart when he was going through a lot of strife. Cry from his failed Invincible album actually was a good and somber ballad, but never got the recognition Michael wanted from the album. The song is very somber and shows just how dark the world could be with so much hatred going on the world. It is a beautiful song, but more could've been done to make sure this song had the success overall. It is a very underrated song worth listening to, for die hard Michael Jackson fans, and new ones alike.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","summary":"Cried, One Last Time","unixReviewTime":1466553600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Nevertheless, he left an intimate legacy that just influenced a generation. It is so ironic that for the final video he did before he died, the world joined in unison to mourn his passing, and that also was irony for Cry from his last studio album, Invincible. While the song never received airplay, I remebered how vivid the video was after his heartbreaking death, seeing people hold hands across the world and in harmony and grief. The song is one of the better songs from Invincible, though never got any airplay, as did You Rock My World, nor its video recieved full attention while he was alive. The song is noble heart and soul from the voice within. Nevertheless, it is one of the overlooked gems from his career that I really recommend as a must for your MP3 collection if you're a die hard Michael jackson buff. It is up there with Man In The Mirror and some of his deeper ballads that've been overshadowed by the imagery of his music videos. Michael's Cry was there, and everyone noticed his goodbye at the very end of his life.\n\nSong: B+","summary":"Michael's Cry","unixReviewTime":1270944000,"vote":null,"image":null}

That is sadly the case with David Cassidy. After all of the stardom and success in The Partridge Family, he passed away from a broken heart, after his years of battling drug and alcohol addiction, bankruptcy and numerous failed marriages with failing as a father to his children. It is no surprise to me, just like other child stars whom had died early with their deep wounds like Dana Plato & Gary Coleman from Different Strokes that also died from the same, damaged heart. One song that I will always remember of David's from The Partridge Family is really his signature track from the show, I Think I Love You. The song really is a trip back in time to when music and harmony was innocent in the 70's, with so much strife in the world and the beginning off the peace movements of the generation. David really was a blessing at the end, but could have been more if he was on the right path, and not with one that had so much wounds at the end. He will be missed at the innocence that David was.\n\nDavid Cassidy: 1050-2017\n\nSong: B","summary":"He Knew He loved You","unixReviewTime":1511308800,"vote":null,"image":null}

It was an impressive beginning for the group known as The Lovin' Spoonful. The group termed their approach \"good-time music\". Yet their biggest hit was a bit of a departure from that idea. \"Summer In The City\" spent a total of three weeks atop the Bill Hot 100 in August of 1966. This gritty tune features a series of car horns during the instrumental bridge, starting with a Volkswagen Beetle horn, and ends up with a jackhammer sound, in order to give the impression of the sounds of the summer in the city. Very different and extremely impressive. The song would sell more than a million copies and has been recognized by Rolling Stone as one of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All-Time\".

It was virtually impossible not to be mesmorized by the sounds eminating from my little Radio Shack transistor radio. The Beatles were at the height of their popularity and Motown was churning out one memorable tune after another. I went on vacation with my parents for two weeks in mid-July and when I returned a couple of hippies I had never heard of---Sonny and Cher--had several records on the charts!! It was difficult to decide which 45's to buy with the limited resources from my paper route. It was about this time that two rockers from Long Island teamed up with two folkies from Greenwich Village to form what would become the Lovin' Spoonful. They would become one of my all-time favorite bands. The debut single \"Do You Believe In Magic\" quickly raced up the charts and became a Top Ten smash. This is one of my 20 favorite singles of all-time.","summary":"Debut single from one of the 1960's most important groups.","unixReviewTime":1467763200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Nena's 99 Luftballons was one my favorite songs and the English version was played on the local radio, though the song had special meaning to me because I took German in High School, and I heard the song in German. While I was driving through Norway's beautiful Lofoten Islands I came across 3 young Swiss backpackers hitch hiking along the side of the road. They had to get to Moskenes and hop on a ferry to get to Bodos (Norwegian mainland). Given the time of day, I realized I had to just drive them to the ferry terminal or they would have to camp in the cold Norwegian night. Along the drive the 3 Swiss students translated the German version of the Nena's 99 Luftballon into English for me. They were a Swiss German speakers so they did not fully understand what Nena was saying, but he German version is lot more interesting. The German version has nothing to with 99 red balloons. Rather it is about mis-identifying 99 air balloons (weather balloons) which lead to 99 years of war. German artists are so avant garde, like Mike Myer's Dieter.","summary":"Swiss German translation of 99 Luftballon","unixReviewTime":1473552000,"vote":null,"image":null}

This talented quintet, originally known as The Versatiles, formed in Los Angeles in 1966 and within a year they had secured a recording contract with Johnny Rivers' fledgling Soul City label. Rivers loved the sound but hated their name and as a result group member Ron Townsend came up with the name we would all come to know so well...The 5th Dimension. And it did not take very long for the group to make its presence felt. Their very first release \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" cracked the Billboard Top 20. Just five months later the group would score a major hit with Jimmy Webb's \"Up Up and Away\". Yes, the 5th Dimension was on its way! Over the next six years the group would prove to be a dominant force in American popular music amassing a total of nearly 30 charted singles and a dozen hit albums.\n\nOver the years the 5th Dimension recorded a number of tunes by the noted American songwriter, singer and pianist Laura Nyro. In September 1969 Soul City records released \"Wedding Bell Blues\" a tune that Nyro had originally recorded in 1966. The song zoomed to the top of the charts and stayed there for three big weeks. It was the group's second biggest single of all-time. This is the original hit recording that has been remastered for your enjoyment.  Simply outstanding!","summary":"The 5th Dimension at the pinnacle of their popularity.","unixReviewTime":1477353600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The term seems to be a metaphor for something deeper, something real. Who gave you the right to shake my family tree, the controversial King Of Pop asks rhetorically, Tell me; are you the ghost of jealousy? Hes apparently addressing his many detractors, but the point is nearly lost in the groove.\n\nThe beat, produced by Teddy Riley, is as cold as the concept, and the bridge conjures 1970s funk, but its the aforementioned chorus; not the words themselves, but their harmonic melodies; that haunts. Its a majestic masterpiece; one of the best Ive heard, in my life, from Michael Jackson or anyone else. Theres just something (special) about the way its layered that, at the right moment, can literally send chills down your spine.\n\nmarcellee.com","summary":"5 of 5","unixReviewTime":1490400000,"vote":null,"image":null}

However, I admit that I enjoy this song because of the catchy song and the well placed instruments.  As per the songfacts website, apparently this song was so popular when it first came out that the Guess Who group performed in the White House Lawn in 1970 (because Richard Nixons daughter Tricia was listed to be a fan of the group).Additionally even with me liking this song,  Im actually a very proud patriotic American woman  who is pro-military and has deep roots\/ties to American culture (both my adoptive parents were born as U.S. citizens and both my late maternal grandmother and late biological mother were registered members of the Menominee Indian tribe in Wisconsin). I also credit first hearing Lenny Kravitzs American Woman (which is also a good version to listen to) during my high school years as to contributing to why I can also easily enjoy American Woman by The Guess Who.","summary":"A Fantastic Rock Song and From The Songfacts website","unixReviewTime":1452384000,"vote":null,"image":null}

This is definitely Dylan at his absolute best in creativity. I mean take away the music and Bob's voice and what you have left is a poem that reads like some kind of Pulitzer Prize winning work of art. There are some songs I can never grow tired of listening to and \"It's Alright Ma\" is one of those. This is classic Dylan From his early years and one song from that period any Dylan fan would want to put onto their MP3 device.\n\n(10\/13\/2016 An added note to my review: I just heard that Bob Dylan won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature for his lyrics and how they changed American music.

This is a stone groove from Sly and the funky basstastic 'thumpin and pluckin' Larry Graham. Did you know that he is the uncle of rapper Drake? I did not know that. Some classic rhythm guitar from Freddie Stone. Horns and drums, also quite funky and cool. And it goes on and on...\n\nThe lyrics are sung by four band members simultaneously. They sound awesome on the chorus, and in little extraneous moments: 3:03, chen trench strokes, etc? at 3:08, 4:16.\n\nI think this is the song that finally turned Sly Stone away from songs about racial harmony. He didn't think people were getting the message, plus stardom had gotten out of control. He turned further inward and away from the mainstream, took more drugs, and began to write more about more controversial subjects like racism and violence. He name checks his earlier tunes, as if to say 'what was that all about?' He felt like he had sold out and lost the good vibes.","summary":"SEP 6","unixReviewTime":1497139200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I had forgotten just how accomplished a musician this man is.  Aside from being one of the world's great flamenco guitar players, Jose Feliciano can also play bass, banjo, keyboards, timbales, mandolin and the harmonica. Quite impressive! If you remember Jose from his heyday in the late 60's and early 70's then you are sure to recall his marvelous rendition of The Doors \"Light My Fire\" from the golden year 1968. Jose's intimate reworking of that tune climbed all the way to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The song won Jose Feliciano a Grammy for Best Pop Male Vocal of 1968.  Meanwhile, Jose also won the Grammy for Best New Artist of 1968.

What stood out to me was the first recordings were made at the old Cameo-Parkway building, which later became Philly International on Broad street, but when Sigma was opened in 1968, and the Delfonics started recording there, you can really hear on these CD's the voices of Thom Bell if you know it, with the background vocals, until he stopped producing them. The horns sound fantastic, especially Joe (the lips) D, and on The Delfonics theme near the end, I could have sworn that was Lenny Pakula on the organ making that sound alone, but now I hear a Kettle drum roll with him that I never hear before with this cheap headset, I had to backup to make sure I wasn't hearing things. Next I'll play this CD I'll use my good phones, or through speakers. It's hard to believe some of these recordings are 49 years old. Any disappointments? Yes, just 3 for me. Can't get over Losin' you; was remixed in mono, \"I gave to you\"; was not the extended version, and the extended version I do have is one of the worst mix out there of the song, so I'm still looking. \"Didn't I blow you Mind\", was the only song that the band recorded live together, and I love strings, but they leaked into Earls drum set and had to be lowered, and it's the only Delfonics record where the strings are too low for me, though this version is better than any previous ones, the strings are to far in the mix and I was expecting a miracle I guess. I got the CD on the 1st day it was released and I'm glad I bought it. I'm no expert, but some of these songs sound like they recorded at a higher digital rate. If you have these Delfonic songs on a CD already, you may not notice any difference, but if you have pretty good ears or thought you knew every note or sound in these songs and want the best versions of these song recorded, then this is a must buy. I don't know if this guy had the original tapes to work with, but he somehow got rid of the musicians talking in the beginning of; \"Think about me baby\", and someone's enthusiasm on \"Trying to make a fool of me\" after the music intro, maybe Thom Bell? I give the album a A.","summary":"Best reproduction of most of these songs up to now.","unixReviewTime":1467331200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Epic Records, Michael Jackson's label ever since the release of Off The Wall, is trying to push this as a new single despite the fact that it's (apparently) at-least six years old. Some of the vocals may be new, I don't know, but the music; the drumbeat of which is a replica of Remember The Time; isn't. That's a major marketing glitch that could've easily been fixed by simply releasing the song as an outtake from the Dangerous album. It's also a bad look for producer Teddy Riley, considering the fact that it's only taken six years for his New Jack Swing to sound old.\n\nOther flaws, like lack of bass on a song that should be pounding the club and subpar vocals melodies during the verses, are relatively minor. Aesthetically this is a good song overall. The protagonist, a knife-wielding killer named Susie, is bad, at-least in a moral sense, but the chorus sounds catchy enough, especially during the final peak when Michael Jackson starts hyping it up with his signature ad-libs. The song then goes from good to great for about twenty seconds. \"It was blood on the dance floor,\" Jackson sings with masterful inflections, \"It was blood on the dance floor.\" The last two times he says it are particularly striking.\n\nmarcellee.com","summary":"4 of 5","unixReviewTime":1381449600,"vote":null,"image":null}

But for female R&B singers, they just do not even come close to igniting a flame in the soul of the heart. Whitney Houston still remains a one of a kind in voice, and in absolute pure heart. Something that needs to be said. Even when she was going through her heartbreak, she still packed a punch in songs. Try It On My Own from the Just Whitney album still is a simple and beautiful song to listen to from the soul of the heart which Caro Bayer-Sager wrote for her. The song was the graduation anthem of 2003, and gave the FOX show Boston Public, its highest-rated performance when Whitney appeared on the show, singing this beautiful delight. I absolutely love this song, and if there is a hits album that delivers all of her beloved voice, this song shouldn't be overshadowed from it.

I'm glad I bought this as I've tried to track down their Woodstock set over the years and haven't really been able to do so successfully.  Nice release.  Any Santana would love it as the Woodstock set just jumps off the record as a lively live set and this lst lp, along with their 2nd and 3rd albums (Santana ll and lll I guess), as most folks know, they had that magic combo of musicians for those 3 lps and the 3 of them really are the best Santana releases ever.  Scientifically proven.  Well, ok, I'm kiddin', but you can see they just got the groove right and the distribution of sound from among this set of musicians.

Another thing it has in common with those two releases? None of 'em are all that good. I mean, this isn't a dog's dinner like it's made out to be, but it's not first-class Miles. \"Robot 409\" sounds like a bad cartoon theme, for god's sake, while both the title track and \"Code M.D.\" are beefed up electronically, seemingly to cover up their lack of any strong melody or instrumental solos. Now, I do think that \"Freaky Deaky\" makes good use of the electronic stuff - appropriately enough, it sounds freaky. And hey, \"What It Is\" is about the funkiest thing on this album, plus the squealing, Wayne Shorter-like soprano sax solo sounds nice. Meanwhile, \"That's It\" does have an amusingly unpredictable groove, making it worth hearing as well. And \"What It Is\" is stirring, that's what it is. So that makes it the best post-retirement Miles album I've ever heard, not like that's saying much.","summary":"Not as awful as it has been painted...","unixReviewTime":1195689600,"vote":"3","image":null}

The sound quality is very good.  Much better than many of the CD's released in the mid eighties.  It is 39 minutes long, which is fairly short by Miles Davis's standards.  His LP's used be 25 minutes to 30 minutes a side.  The double album, Get Up With It was 2 hours long.\n\nThis is eighties style jazz, but with a Miles Davis flair to it that makes it better than most jazz released at the time.  The eighties were not a very good time for jazz.  Sunday Brunch, light jazz was all the rage.  People like Spyro Gyra and later Kenny G were popular.  Also musicians were folding in New Age jazz (which at the time was about the only thing that was interesting).  People like Chick Corea and Bill Cobham went light and pop.\n\nThis CD has that distinctive 1980's jazz sound.  Code MD sounds like something Chick Corea would have done.  There are also twinges of 80's Weather Report.\n\nThe band on this CD includes John Scofield on guitar and someone named Robert Irving III on keyboards.  They wrote most of the compositions.  Also appearing in spots in Branford Marsalis (who now plays with all the jam bands like the Gov't Mule and Widespread Panic).\n\nThis CD is more lively and a little more main stream than Davis's earlier work.  It is certainly more accessible to the general population than anything Davis has done.  But, it isn't bland or white bread like most popular music.  If you want Bitches Brew or Sketches of Spain or Doo Wap, this isn't it.  This isn't ground breaking.  But, it shows that Davis can take on any style and make it better.","summary":"Eighties jazz - Miles Style","unixReviewTime":1172016000,"vote":"2","image":null}

So I'll remedy that.\n\nIt was and is surely one of the most exquisite sounds ever to be produced in the human throat and it is allied to an acute musical intelligence and sensibility. This is a cunningly selected anthology of religious and liturgical music, mostly of the sunnier, more melodious variety but not cloying or sentimental. The fifty-strong band that supports her is uncredited but they produce a refined sound and are clearly made up of gifted New York City locals; they play with taste and restraint, not in period style but without Schmaltz or overt Romanticism. The oboe, harp and organ soloists are excellent and never overpower Battle's light sound. Her agility and breath-control are as impressive as ever; the top notes shine and the slight huskiness in the lower reaches of her voice enchants. She sings fluently in English, German, Latin, Italian and French and the booklet provides quadrilingual translations. The music spans the Baroque, through Classical to the High Romantic period, and embraces a wide range of musical idioms from the Lied to the Afro-American Spiritual, the latter \"Were You There?\" sung a capella with flawless intonation.\n\nThe only piece unfamiliar to me was the dreamily floating, chromatic \"Schlafendes Jesuskind\" by, unexpectedly, Hugo Wolf; it reminds me a little of Richard Strausss Christmas song Die heiligen drei Knige aus Morgenland but without the Angst. However, my favourite is the \"Echo Aria\" from Bach's \"Christmas Oratorio\", in which Battle's gently lilting vocal line is echoed by the oboe and a perfectly matched boy treble.\n\nThis might not be one of the largest voices ever to grace an opera stage but it is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful; fans of her sound need not hesitate.","summary":"Divine","unixReviewTime":1399852800,"vote":"3","image":null}

He learned his Brahms fro no less than Hans von Bulow and would have met the composer n person except that Brahms had entered his last year and was too ill to travel (Walter's mentor Gustav Mahler made the journey to Sichl, where the aged Brahms spent his summers, and found the old man melancholy and misanthropic - yet from a modern perspective, Brahms was hardly elderly at 64).\n\nThere's no need for me to heap my praise on so many others'.  I only want to recount my surprise, after an absence of ten years or so,  on returning to Walter's stereo Brahms First and finding it  so dynamic and alert. When it first came out, his Columbia Sym. cycle was considered less than the mono one he made in the early Fifties with the NY Phil. Waning energies were attributed to Walter's troubles with heart disease, but that first cycle comes in raw sound, even when remastered, and it has some rough edges, too. There's a driven quality that might be the influence of Toscanini; there was enormous pressure in America for every conductor to ape Toscanini or fall under his shadow.\n\nThe remake is more Viennese, always moving forward but with a core of relaxed enjoyment in music-making. In the second movement we realize that not being close to Toscanini doesn't mean you've drawn near to Furtwangler. Walter's style isn't philosophical or searching. He's just a master of the traditional Romantic style that nurtured him in the nineteenth century.  without being personal, he's authentic. The orchestra can be criticized for imbalances due to an under-powered string body, but in Brahms's day the strings were often even less.  the scoring sounds sweeter and mellower for being able to hear horn and oboe almost all the time rather than Karajan's wall-of-sound violins. Walter is also more modest and lyrical than either Furtwangler or Karajan. In short, a reading that can carry you through a lifetime. It has Walter's famous singing quality and strength of purpose, too.\n\nAfter recording the symphony in Nov. 1959, Walter returned the following January for the Haydn Variations and Academic Festival Over. (The latter at least used to be almost universally known to young listeners - but now?) Both are done with the same blend of mellowness and authority. For once, the overture actually feels festive with the extra snap Walter gives it.","summary":"A Brahms First to carry you through a lifetime","unixReviewTime":1341792000,"vote":"5","image":null}

Few can make Brahms ring so True as Bruno Walter could and this recording, made in Los Angeles with the 'Coumbia Symphony Orchestra' shows off the maestro to great advantage. Bruno Walter (September 15, 1876 - February 17, 1962) was in the autumn years of his life when he made this recording and that aura of time and countless performances of these works gratefully remains captured here.\n\nWalter was so immersed in his music that his soul was evident in every phrase.  This is a Brahms first of great majesty. His tempi are a bit on the slow end of the spectrum , but that serve only to make his climaxes more thrilling.  The 'Haydn Variations' are so well conceived that they sound completely thought through, as though in conversation with Brahms, and the 'Academic Festival Overture' has both the joy and the pomp of the 'Gaudeamus Igitur' the work holds.  Of very special note, there is in Los Angeles a 'happening' over the nest weeks.  Gustavo Dudamel has programmed a survey called 'Brahms Unbound' and opened the first concert in this in depth look at the works of Brahms with both the Academic Festival Overture and the Symphony No. 1.  Critics and audiences somehow always expect performances of Brahms to be safest in the hands of elder conductors, by Dudamel unveiled a propinquity for Brahms that bodes very well indeed for the fat that here may be our next great Brahms conductor.  Returning to this CD of Bruno Walter and having just heard Dudamel on the podium with the Los Angeles Philharmonic provides a great resurgence in the appreciation of the genius of Johannes Brahms.

One with Jon Randall By My side and one with Sammy Kershaw Maybe Not Tonight.  It has 17 songs all together  and five new songs.  None of which to me are all that great.  On Lorrie Morgan cds there are always one or two songs that are album cuts that are better then the singles she releases.  These new songs aren't like that.

I'm hearing less and less of this song--any BM song--on the Sirius\/XM 80s or new wave channels, and I have to wonder if this is the reason.

Grindle","reviewText":"First time I was getting heavily into the music and especially instrumental approach of Jan Hammer was about a decade ago. A local DJ,now keyboardist of some note named Nigel had a local radio show and managed to interview him. He recommended I seek this album out. It was apparently Jan's first solo (no collaborative) release after departing from Mahavishnu Orchestra-though by no means his first album as a leader. He was leading a trio of himself,electric violinist Steve Kindler and percussionist David Earle Johnson. It was 1975,and he had a very set concept for this new project.\n\n  The \"first seven days\" represented in the title of course refers to the biblical concept of creation. Most of the time,two concepts are blended into one as \"Darkness\/Earth In Search Of A Sun\" for example starts very much like straight up cinematic orchestration and goes right for very intense progressive synth solos on the second half. \"Light\/Sun\",\"Oceans And Continents\" and \"Fourth Day: Plants And Trees\" start out as acoustic piano numbers and develop into electronic fusion melodic sounds-capes. \"The Animals\" is deep,bass synth heavy progressive Afro-Funk-full of Johnson's high energy percussive rhythms.\n\n  \"Sixth Day-The People\" and the closing \"The Seventh Day\" both showcase Kindler's European classic style violin playing while again broadening into electronic space fusion frontiers. This album showcases Jan Hammer's musical gift of being able to paint his broad instrumental brush strokes on a canvas capable of holding down both Hammer's strong melodic sense,as well as his ability to create tonal poems with musical sound. The overall effect of this album is a superb (and somewhat rare) joining of both European classic orchestration and Afrocentric melodic and rhythmic content. The sounds congeal,separate and split apart into their own musical worlds throughout this album. And it deserves the high reputation it apparently has among Jan Hammer aficionado's.","summary":"Jan Hammer Takes On Musical Creationism","unixReviewTime":1429228800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Recorded\n  live at Frances Le Festival Mondal at Antibes in late 1963 and then released in\n  1964, Miles Davis In Europe presents a no less exciting performance from The\n  Miles Davis Quintet when they showcased an unforgettable concert date which\n  was a pivotal part of Miles 1963 European Adventure. Beginning with a official\n  announcement by noted jazz M.C. Andre Francis, the exquisite track set would\n  proceed on a robust note with a striking backbeat take on Autumn Leaves and\n  marvelous takes on Milestones, All For You and there 14-minute lets tear this\n  apart workout finale on Walkin.  What makes Miles Davis In Europe quite the\n  live success is how the band showcased strong solos where George Coleman\n  played his tenor saxophone with such a muscular scouring sound which prove\n  surprisingly effective within the new young rhythm section and for the quintets\n  adventurous avant-garde leanings and searing virtuosity was highly displayed\n  with the young Tony Williams propelling his dynamic drum solos.  Also added\n  to the live album is how Herbie Hancock strikes up his piano artistry where he\n  swings his occasional hard bop virtue and an easy-listening endurance that is\n  evident on their take on I Thought About You as he turns up the standard with\n  impressionistic and free-flowing balladry that also allows Miles to spread wide\n  swaths of tonal colour and deep notes that bends across the stage. Now here\n  is another great live album from the great Miles Davis, one that will remain as\n  solid in its expressive abstract format.","summary":"One Of Miles Davis' Best Live Albums","unixReviewTime":1398211200,"vote":"2","image":null}

The groove is tight, but my lack of expertise with his music is nothing against him. I think at the time he popped up on the scene, smooth jazz became, at it still is, my mainstay. That is not to say I do not possess a lack of R&B music; the 70s, 80s & 90s, oh, I'll beat you down with my collection. Those are my eras of music and I have decidedly found that much has not gotten better since that passage of time. But I am sincerely glad my wife found out this is Jon B, and dude really does his craft well. I've never stepped foot inside of a club, except on the jazz scene, where both Jeff Lorber and Eric Marienthal stood right beside me while being introduced. I looked over, smiled in amazement and they both shook my hand. 1996, Atlantic Beer & Ice, Charlotte, NC. Don't Talk has the right rhythm and feel to get you up on your feet, and seeing as, 'older,' that this track is, more people will already know about this track, while it still feels so very new to me. Thanks, Jon B.","summary":"~Never knew Jon B ever had an uptempo groove.~","unixReviewTime":1398816000,"vote":null,"image":null}
