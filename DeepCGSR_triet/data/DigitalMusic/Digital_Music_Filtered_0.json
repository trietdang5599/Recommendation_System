I , only being a new christian for a couple of months prior I was on a spirtual high already and this band lifted me up higher ! Casting Crowns is one of those exceptional Contemporary Christian Bands that you would feel comfortable having your 6 or 8 year old son or daughter listen to . and I knew how much I enjoyed that album , still there most phenomenal work to date and then picked up the debut album self titled Casting Crowns . If you want to listen to a band that actually loves Jesus and wants everyone to know it , I can guarantee this band will fulfill your craving .","summary":"Great music, but even better if you see them live...ie Andy Williams Drum Solo Anyone?","unixReviewTime":1220400000,"image":null}

Peek","reviewText":"This latest effort by Casting Crowns is an outstanding project . As with their other albums , it is lyrically powerful and has a great sound . There are several very good songs on this album . The album has a theme of challenging Christians to live their faith all the time , not just on Sunday mornings . There are a couple of praise songs and a prayer - song included also , but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers . As with their previous albums , I think that this one will produce several hit singles . ' East To West ' is already in that category . Others that are very good include ' What The World Needs ' , ' Every Man ' , and ' Slow Fade ' . I would highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns . For those who are unfamiliar with their music , I would recommend starting off with their self titled debut . In any case , this is well worth buying .","summary":"Very Good","unixReviewTime":1193443200,"image":null}

But with that being said , this CD just was n't very good . Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church . Yes , it was a good song with \" If We Are The Body \" and \" Does Anybody Hear Her , \" but with \" What This World Needs , \" it 's just gotten old now . It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point , especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church is n't doing what it is supposed to . This CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums . And where the last 2 CD 's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them , this album has 2 at most . I just could n't get into any of the songs . Musically , it is average and the lyrics are not up to par . Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album , though , which will surely not disappoint . Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album . This one will sell a lot of units , but will not stand the test of time . It will collect dust on my shelf .","summary":"Wow!

It was n't Mark Hall 's voice , the band 's music , or even the harmonies sung that drew me in . I was going through a situation that \" Voice of Truth \" so eloquently and accurately addressed . I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time . Now here we are 3 albums later and once again , Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again . They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart . I really like the way that Casting Crowns ' albums generally have a theme . This album is no exception . I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone . But he also addresses the middle as in the ' gray area ' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt . Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say ... 'no way ! ' . We give God a list that says I 'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that . Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us do n't step out of our comfort zone . I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this . That said , this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it . It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation . The first song on the album : \" What This World Needs \" is a great way to start off the album . It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along . I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say . This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we 've done there is Hope for us . Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through . # 3 : Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day . No , instead it is a slow fade . Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray . # 4 : East to West- One of my favorites on this album . This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally . It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God is n't giving Mark a look into my heart . ( As if I 'm the only one struggling with issues like this . ;-) ) \n\n # 5 : The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates , this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail . # 6 : The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also . \" The Altar and the Door \" musically has a lot to offer . It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with . This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door . I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord . # 7 : Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons . One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly , because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning . I really think it should be my \" anthem \" . I admire Mark 's clever word play- \" Fearless warriors on a picket fence , Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense , deep - water faith in the shallow end , We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences , The God we want and the God who is ... \" What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be . We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction , but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right ... which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace . # 8 : I Know You 're There : This song is great ! She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem . This song is about knowing that God is always there for us . \n\n # 9 : Prayer for a Friend : This song , which sounds close to a ballad , is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord . # 10 : All Because of Jesus : This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world . I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different . I highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music . I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world . Casting Crowns does a great job of helping its listener connect ( or re - connect ) with God . One more note : This album is GREAT to work out with ! ! ! I do my strength training and cardio workouts with this album . I also like jogging to this album .","summary":"Outstanding and worthy of praise!!!","unixReviewTime":1189900800,"image":null}

And their third project should continue the trend . The group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music . There 's nothing earth shattering with either , but both work together to create some great music . Think \" If We are the Body \" but faster . The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100 % perfect outward appearances . After all , the heart is what counts . The title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church ( the altar ) and driving away ( the door ) , we loose the certainty and conviction we had . I 'll just say been there , done that . The first is the title track , which really explains the theme better then I ever could . And it 's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words . The second is the next track , \" Somewhere in the Middle . \" In fact , the phrase \" between the altar and the door \" shows up in this song , too . The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in . As with other Casting Crown 's CDs , this one features a couple worship songs . And , once again , they do n't grab me . There 's nothing wrong with \" I Know You 're There \" and \" All Because of Jesus , \" but they are n't as special as some of their other tracks . My two favorite songs are back to back . \" Slow Fade \" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith . It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day . It 's a slower song with a haunting sound . And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall 's daughter singing \" Because Little Eyes . \" It 's enough to give me chills . Appropriately enough , the next song is \" East to West . \" As you might guess , this song talks about forgiveness . It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God 's forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under . As with so many of their songs , the lyrics are powerful . Musically , there are few surprises here for the long time fan . But that 's just fine because their music is wonderful . I 'm surprised I have n't worn out Casting Crown 's first two releases I 've listened to them so often . This one will certainly suffer the same fate .","summary":"Another Great Release","unixReviewTime":1189036800,"image":null}

Whether they are just pure genius , or mad as a hatter . What the music brings s actually what really should count . For Michael Jackson , he is one that has been tormented bith ways . Arguably , after his child molestation trial vindication , many wonder if he will ever be heard from again . Arguably , that will be a test from time . Nevertheless , what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos . Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement , there has n't been anything loosely definitive , until now . The Essential Michael Jackson , a collection reflection his career in three folds : Jackson 5 , Jacksons , and on his own , is a double album reflecting his well - received career . The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels ' Moonwalking mayhem . The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It , Wanna Be Staring Something , ABC , I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You , Black Or White , and You Walk My World . The compilation does show quite a lot , but like most collections , there are just a few glitches to the parade . The album overshadows a few of Michael 's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson , Say , Say , Say with Paul McCartney , One More Chance , his last song from his Number Ones collection , and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want . All in all , Michael Jackson was strange , but one of a kind . Yet , his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time . Hopefully , he should try to do it again soon . What ever reflection , The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005 .","summary":"Wacko About Jacko","unixReviewTime":1121731200,"image":null}

The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael , and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos , plus complete details ( chart info , etc ) for each song . As for the music , this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael ( and his Brothers on Disc 1 ) . The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs , many of which are featured as ' single edits ' , which is fine as I already have the full versions . The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat , but could 've been perfect if ' I 'll Be There ' , ' Dancing Machine ' , and ' Scream ' ( Duet with Janet ) were included . It does however feature Michael 's # 1 duet with Paul McCartney ( ' Say , Say , Say ' ) , which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now . At any rate , I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than ' Number Ones ' or are n't ready to purchase the ' Ultimate Collection ' ( which also failed to include a number of classics ! ) .","summary":"The Best Michael Jackson Sampler","unixReviewTime":1370995200,"image":null}

I was still in high school when Michael and his brothers released four consecutive No . 1s ( something not even the Beatles did ) . Despite Michael 's popularity , I remained essentially a casual fan . I did n't buy a Michael Jackson album until THRILLER -- an album that spawned seven hit singles and has sold over 100 million copies to date . I eventually bought 1995 's HIStory and later 2001 's GREATEST HITS . But if you 're looking for one collection to hit all the highlights of a brilliant career ( I bought mine as a Black Friday deal ) , this is everything the casual fan needs :   solo hits starting with 1971 's \" Got To Be There \" through 1999 's \" You Rock My World \" along with a sprinkling of Jackson 5 \/ Jacksons hits . [ The only glaring omissions are the duets with his sister Janet ( \" Scream \" ) and Paul McCartney ( \" Say Say Say \" ) ] \n\n Overall , this is two and a half hours of music that changed the landscape of popular music forever .

Skylar","reviewText":"It 's no secret that Michael Jackson was incredibly talented and gifted musician , the fact that he also had a passion for his art must have helped . This two discs collection covering the man 's entire career from the time he was a little kid up to his later years as one of the most famous person on this planet . It serves as an example of how great his music was and how it 's still amazing today . Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry , Michael revolutionized it , and in the 1980 's Michael was fashion . MJ 's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need , we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time , or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time , or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album ... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael 's numerous accomplishments in the music industry , it 's how good his music was . The first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael 's time in the Jackson 5\/ Jacksons . Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall ( 1979 ) , 7 songs from Thriller ( 1982 ) , 8 from Bad ( 1987 ) , 7 from Dangerous ( 1992 ) and 1 from both History ( 1995 ) and Invincible ( 2001 ) . All the hits you would expect are here : Do n't Stop ` Till You Get Enough , Billie Jean , Thriller , Bad and much more . There is n't much to say about the songs included , they 're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this \" essential \" collection . Besides the \" Ultimate Collection \" boxed set , this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael 's career . It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5\/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc , Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career . I ca n't hide the fact that I 'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible . Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael ( although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time ) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could \/ should have been included . \" They Do n't Care About Us \" and \" Earth Song \" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career - spawning collection . From Invincible I think \" Whatever Happens \" should have been here and perhaps \" Butterflies \" . It 's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included , they do not really match the pop \" hits \" in terms of lyrics or musicality , they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance . That aside , The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want , the hits and more well - known songs . I must add it does a good job at doing so ! The Essential Michael Jackson does an excellent job of going further than your average compilation and offers Michael 's hits and some of his best songs . The fact that it covers his entire career is great ; you get a proper overview of Jackson 's music . For someone who is relatively new to Michael Jackson 's music this is really The Essential Michael Jackson .","summary":"Excellent overview of the king of pop's career (4.5 stars)","unixReviewTime":1287014400,"image":null}

Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years . Nevertheless , it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the \" King of Pop \" . Yet , there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive , and pushing the envelope each and everytime . Back in 2005 , at the time he was acquitted of the well - publicized child molestation charges , Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured . Well , earlier this past year , before his death it was re - released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series . Here is the result . The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re - introduction to his music to a whole new generation . But , overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon . The songs here have all been remastered well , as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5 , The Jacksons , and his solo efforts . The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back , the understated Enjoy Yourself , as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller , Got To Be There , Rock With You , Do n't Stop ' Til You Get Enough , as well as Man In The Mirror , to his final major hit , 2001 's You Rock My World . The extra disc also expands mostly well , by including some of Michael 's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say , Say , Say with Paul McCartney , the deep They Do n't Care About Us , and the intimate Stranger In Moscow . Yet , with all the hits from the collection , there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream , his duet with his sister Janet Jackson , Gone Too Soon ( which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS ) , and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song . Overall , despite a few overshadowed songs , The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record , and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry . If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record , this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure . R.I.P. Michael , you 've rocked the world , and so many hearts along the way .","summary":"What Was Michael","unixReviewTime":1261699200,"image":null}

Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks ; there 's not a dud in the bunch . The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well . \" I Want You Back \" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5 ; they sing and play this to perfection -- and beyond ! \" ABC \" is very catchy . \" Got To Be There \" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic ; Michael 's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age . He sings \" Got To Be There \" with all his heart and soul ; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note , either ! \" Rockin ' Robin \" is infectiously catchy and upbeat , too -- and how 's about that guitar solo ? \n\n \" Ben \" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat ( ! ! ! ) ; Michael 's excellent diction makes \" Ben \" even more beautiful . \" Enjoy Yourself \" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully ; and it 's got that ` 70s beat I always like so much . \" Blame It on the Boogie \" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are ; and there 's yet another gem in \" Shake Your Body ( Down To the Ground ) . \" Listen also for Michael to deliver \" Do n't Stop ' Til You Get Enough \" without ever skipping a beat ; and he does outstanding work as he sings \" Rock with You ; \" \" Off The Wall \" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled \" The Girl Is Mine . \" \" Billie Jean \" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released ; and it remains one of his best tunes ever . \" Beat It \" is yet another jewel on the first CD . \" Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin' \" is another catchy , infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it ; and I especially like \" Thriller ; \" \" Thriller \" is timeless and just one listen proves it ! \" Bad \" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center ; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ -- he stands right there , front and center where he belongs ! \" I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You \" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett ; and \" The Way You Make Me Feel \" is pop music at its very best . \" Man in the Mirror \" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it ; and Michael does a superb job on \" Another Part of Me . \" I love it ! \" Black or White \" is very well done ; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot . \" Heal The World \" is very sweet and easy on the ear -- this music lacks nothing , it 's all THAT good . \" Remember The Time \" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good ; it 's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it . \" Will You Be There \" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect ; and \" Dangerous \" has some beat ! \" You Are Not Alone \" is one of the most beautiful songs I 've ever heard ; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson 's songs ! The second CD ends well with MJ performing \" You Rock My World . \" Awesome ! \n\n Michael Jackson fans should consider this a \" must - have \" for their collections ; and it has so many songs that it makes the perfect introduction to MJ and his music for newcomers just discovering his magic .

In fact , Thriller and its breakthrough , extended - length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run . Those years , also , however , hosted rebellions against that same mainstream , with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions . A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap , top - down thinking and the pop band as commodity \/ tool . Michael Jackson was anything but staid , but he was of them . Industry creation though he was , Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith , plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well - beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves . He produced the toughest , most sophisticated work of his career in \" Billie Jean . \" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex . But as big as Thriller was , Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident , at - ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on . The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you , and the big early 80 's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement . This holds well up into \" Bad , \" opening the second CD , then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock . And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire \" Dangerous , \" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince . The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run , shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs . I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson 's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding .","summary":"the way you make me feel","unixReviewTime":1246752000,"image":null}

His best songs are all here \" Rock With You , Do n't Stop Til You Get Enough , Beat It , Billie Jean , The Girl Is Mine , Human Nature , etc . as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like \" Bad \" and \" Dangerous \" . THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard . There are 37 cuts . Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon . If you can only own one CD , this is the most logical choice . My only quibble is the omission of \" Never Can Say Goodbye \" which was my favorite Jackson Five song . He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics . Highly recommended !","summary":"It's the CD to own for this American icon.","unixReviewTime":1245974400,"image":null}

I sent a copy of it to my uncle in Georgia a few days after it came out on July 12 ! Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent . This one , like the box set , combines his Jackson 5 hits , his Jacksons hits and his solo hits going up to 2001 . Past albums stopped at Thriller , but this goes even further to Invincible . But my favorites are on here , from Got To Be There , I Want You Back , Shake Your Body , Blame It On The Boogie , Off The Wall , Beat It , Billie Jean , In The Closet , Remember The Time , Another Part Of Me , Bad , Dirty Diana(the hummable song ) , Smooth Criminal , Dangerous , and You Rock My World . The sound 's a little loud , but I think they wanted a full , complete listening experience to the listener . The packaging said 37 songs , but there are 38 songs here , and what a spectacular collection of Michael 's hits . I know there are people saying , \" But why is n't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here ? \" It must have been tough deciding what to put on here , because Michael has always made quality music . To Usher , Justin Timberlake , Omarion and the top singers \/ dancers , you are all great artists , but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson ! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here ! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100 - 170 miles or so on a road trip ? This is yet another great compilation album of Michael 's hits , probably better than 2003 's Number Ones . Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends !","summary":"Another excellent collection of Michael's hits!","unixReviewTime":1127347200,"image":null}

You ca n't deny that Michael Jackson is one of the most influential artists not only in pop , but also in the Twentieth Century of music itself . THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time . This collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen . This one not only contains Jackson 's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5 . Unfortunately , maybe this should 've been a 3 disc set , because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including \" I 'll Be There \" , a standard song in Jackson 's arsenal . Otherwise , it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ .

I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his \" not guilty \" verdict . If this is indeed , the case , then it should n't really matter , since the two disc \" The Essential Michael Jackson \" is actually an affordabel and , for the mosr part , comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd . Now , I do not have this cd . I already own the four disc boxed set and \" Thriller \" ( all a fan needs , really ) , but I already own must of the songs , so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it . If you 're the casual Jackson fan , you pretty much get all the stuff you need : the Jackson 5 hits ( though \" I 'll Be There \" and \" Dancing Machine \" are strangely omitted ) , early solo hits , later Jacksons recoridngs , and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums : \" Off The Wall \" , \" Thriller \" , \" Bad \" and \" Dangerous \" . The hits from those album make up well over half the collection . You will also get two post 1992 recordings , the 1995 megahit \" You Are Not Alone \" and the 2001 Top Ten single \" You Rock My World \" . As with most if not all entries in the \" Essential \" series ( as with most compilations ) , there are some problems . Judging by how many songs are on each discs , some tracks are bound to be edited . Most of these songs are the single versions that we 're used to hearing , so we should n't really be bothered buy this , except that \" Thriller \" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door , etc . Also , there are some tracks left off , such as \" I 'll Be There \" , \" I Wanna Be Where You Are \" , \" Dancing Machine \" , \" Ease On Down The Road \" , the Paul McCartney \" Say , Say , Say \" ( the only one of Michael 's solo number ones to be omitted , though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael 's ) , \" State Of Shock \" ( The Jacksons ' collaboration with Mick Jagger ) and the Janet Jackson duet scream . However as a whole , this collection will not disappoint , and is highly recommended for casual fans .","summary":"Not Perfect, But A Good Starting Point For Casual Fans","unixReviewTime":1122508800,"image":null}

CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 \" Thriller \" album tracks ( the other 2 being \" Baby Be Mine \" and \" The Lady in My Life \" ; it 's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was , and how many hits were relased from it , in the days when \" radio tracks \" meant actual vinyl single releases ) . This was of course Michael at his absolute best , now 23 years ago . CD2 ( 17 tracks , 78 min . ) compiles 8 tracks from \" Bad \" and 7 from \" Dangerous \" , and finishes off with \" You Are Not Alone \" from HIStory and \" You Rock My World \" from Invincible . In other words : only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era , and rightfully so , even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe . The only track that arguably should be on here ( but , at 78 min . already , at the expense of what other track then ? ) is \" Scream \" , the No . 1 duet with sister Janet . In the end , this \" essential \" compilation is better than any other compilation available ( HIStory Vol . 1 ; Number Ones , etc . ) as it covers both the Jackson 5 \/ Jacksons era and his solo output .

I had n't been able to find many reviews on the new $ 18.99 vinyl . I purchased this at B&N with a coupon in - store today , but will share with my Amazon brethren as I get 95 % of my new vinyl here and love to add to the reviews that I myself greatly depend on . I have decent mid - fi equipment , not really a reference system but certainly good enough to expose the quality of an inferior recording . Yamaha RX - V377 > HD598 and the CD on the same RX and phones via Yamaha CDP - S300 \n\n I prefer the vinyl by a good margin , though the only fault I can find is the vocals are a little low in this mix . Record was dead flat ( as in free of warps ) drilled dead center , poly lined paper sleeve , lyrics sheet , download card . Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. # 6 via KABUSA EV-1 . Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks , generous lead - in area and dead wax , I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00 . It may be the most quiet metal record I own as far as background , and darn sure is the best for $ 18.99 or less . The record volume overall is a tad low but nothing that 's not easily overcome by the volume control . I was impressed to the point that I will now seek out the new releases of Kill em All and Puppets , despite Puppets having some issues according to reviews . So yeah , mix sounds nice and balanced , good bass , vocals recessed a tad , but not a big deal IMO . Very happy with the price \/ quality . Would recommend .

I am reviewing the 2000 24 karat Gold CD edition of Ride the Lightening remastered by Steve Hoffman . This is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab release just so people know . I own a few of their Miles Davis LP 's remasters which sound amazing . Now back on track i have owned and played the hell out of Ride the Lightening ( 1995 ) CD put out by Elektra . While that version sounds good the 2000 Hoffman remaster blows any other CD edition out of the water . The album just has more life organic sound and does not sound harsh or filtered . The source material Mr. Hoffman worked on this release with was the original master tapes of the album . While the 1995 CD edition of RTL does not sound much different from the original vinyl version it did go through digital filtering possibly noise reduction and a few other things . My reason for buying this version was i had heard Metallica had remastered Ride the Lightening again and were releasing a box set for the album . After hearing the sound on the album in that box had fallen victim to the loudness war i searched for an alternative . Snagging a decently priced copy of this long out of print remaster was luck on my part . All i have to say is if you care about sound stay far away from the RTL ( 2016 box set ) it has nice extras which are tempting yeah this 2000 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster is the way to go . Best sounding version of RTL in my humble opinion .","summary":"Sounds very Good","unixReviewTime":1461283200,"image":null}

For an , at the time , little known metal band , the production is really good . Everyone is in top form . James 's vocals are a little higher than they 'd be after this album , which adds to the charm of this album . they had some good material , partly thanks to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine . And they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan 's attention . Fight Fire With Fire 10\/10 - starts off with an acoustic intro that fades out as the electric guitars fade in . All this to lead into possibly the fastest Metallica song ever . This is a perfect opener with great guitar work , and vocals . this is definitely in a long list of favorite songs by Metallica , which every song with lyrics on this album actually are on . The Lightning 9\/10 is an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verses . Plus a catchy chorus . Overall a very good song . For Whom The Bell Tolls 10\/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever . Granted it has stiff competition , but it might be . This one has a nice groove to it . This one 's still fairly heavy , but not as heavy as the past 2 songs . There are some good melodies , and the guitar playing is really good . I hate to give credit to Lars , but his drums really add power to this song . Fade To Black 9\/10 is the first Metallica ballad . It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads . It does n't really have a chorus , just a riff , instrumental based chorus , similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot . And it works fine . The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style , then the song speeds up for the bridge and solo . Overall a very good song . Trapped Under Ice 9\/10 after a ballad , what do any good metal bands do ? They come back with a fast paced thrasher , which is what they did here . This is the second fastest song on the album . The song has a nice pace to it , and is an overall fun listen . Escape 9\/10 is kind of the pop song of the album . Odd it gets no recognition . This is probably the catchiest song on the album . This one 's similar pacing to Ride The Lightning . It has a really good chorus , and is yet another in a long list of great songs on here . Creeping Death 10\/10 is another contender for favorite Metallica song . It 's a fairly fast paced thrasher with a great horus . It has some slower parts as well and is a great way to close out the album . Then there 's an instrumental which I wo n't rate because I 'm not really into instrumentals . It 's played just fine , so I 'm sure for fans of them it 'll do . Overall if you 're a metal fan new to Metallica , which would be surprising , this is a good place to start . You wo n't be disappointed .","summary":"Metallica and Thrash metal classic and a must own for metal fans","unixReviewTime":1321747200,"image":null}

Skylar","reviewText":"Metallica are truly one of the forces to be reckoned with in their genre of music whether you call it Metal , Heavy - Metal or Thrash is of little importance , they 're one of the greats . While everyone has their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely can not take away their achievements and the great music they have put out . Metallica already proved themselves to be a great band with their debut album Kill ` Em All which has that early real raw and unpolished sound that makes it a fan favorite . The Lightning expands on the formula of Kill ` Em All and shows a bit more maturity , I mean the debut is great and it shows a lot talent it also shows a lot of anger from some seriously p * * * * * off teenagers . You can see a certain progression , a development from the first album and they were becoming more and more the band that would release Master of Puppets . Ride is a dynamic and solid album all the way through , it also features tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that 's still very much present more than 25 years later . The opening song \" Fight Fire With Fire \" with its gentle guitar opening gives the impression that it 's going to be a slower and softer song than usual for Metallica . WRONG ! It soon changes and suddenly becomes very fast , perhaps one of the fastest Metallica songs . Excellent track to begin an excellent album . The title track , Ride , remains to this day one of my favorite Metallica songs with its incredibly fast solos and powerful lyrics . \" For Whom The Bell Tolls \" has one of the most iconic intros in Metal , once again amazing lyrics by James ( \" take a look to the sky just before you die , it 's the last time you will \" , sounds nice does n't it ? ) . \" Fade to Black \" can almost be considered a ballad for the band , the lyrics are so personal and depressing yet the song is uplifting . It 's a slower song for Metallica but it progressively gets heavier , the song has such a strong feel it 's hard to overlook how great it is . In fact it 's one of my favorite Metallica track to this day . \"Trapped Under Ice \" , \" Escape \" and \" Creeping Death \" are also very good songs that should not be ignored , those songs are excellent but have not often been played live . \"The Call of Ktulu \" is an amazing 8 + minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that . Ride The Lightning while not a concept album is mostly about the different types of death and ways of dying and it shows in the song titles ( Ice , electrocution and others ) making of Ride a dark record . Ride is also the last album on which Dave Mustaine receives credit ; here he is credited on two tracks , the title track and the instrumental \" The Call of Ktulu \" . James came up with some particularly great lyrics on Ride The Lightning as he usually does , but here it 's really special . Ride has terrific guitar work courtesy of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet , excellent bass from Cliff Burton and solid drumming from Lars Ulrich . It would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that had a huge role and impact on the Thrash movement . These songs are classic Metal tracks and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt knows all about them already . Some prefer the early raw Metallica sound of Kill ` Em All and some prefer the acclaimed Master of Puppets album . With respect to those two amazing alums , out of the three first Metallica albums I 'll have to say that Ride The Lightning is my personal favorite out of the three and is probably the one I like best of all the albums the band has done . I love Master just as much as the next guy but it 's been overplayed , some of the stuff here has been overplayed as well but to a lesser degree . As much as I love the rawness of Kill ` Em All I think the band is better on Ride . Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that Ride The Lightning is an amazing Metallica album , it features deep lyrics , skillful guitar playing and is everything there is to like about the band to begin with . A total Metal album , I very much enjoy this \" Ride \" years later . 5\/5 for this one , a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general .","summary":"Still a great ride after all those years and a genuine classic Metal album","unixReviewTime":1308182400,"image":null}

Hill","reviewText":"When fans talk about Metallica , many of them refer to the first four albums as thrash classics , grouping them together as if they all feature the same style and fit into the same genre . What I see many people fail to point out is that Ride the Lightning was just as huge a shift in sound and style from Kill ` Em All as The Black Album was from And Justice For All . When Metallica wrote Kill ` Em All , thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal did n't exist yet . They were influenced by speed metal bands like Venom and Motorhead , and produced a debut album where the musical traits of those bands were stamped clearly on just about every song . Starting with Ride the Lightning , Metallica made a full shift to thrash , essentially defining the genre by making far more use of shredding riffs , melodic solos , and high - speed double bass drumming . While James still utilized his scream on tracks like Trapped Under Ice , he employed a deeper overall tone and used a more gruff delivery . You really do n't hear many similarities to Kill ` Em All musically ; I mean , what songs from Ride the Lightning would sound right on that album ? They   showed incredible progression and maturity from the wild , intense nature of Kill ` Em All to the controlled powerhouse approach of Ride the Lightning . The album itself is an easy five stars ( bold statement , right ? ) . What metal fan does n't know For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade to Black by heart ? Crushing thrash songs like Fight Fire With Fire , the title track , Trapped Under Ice , and Creeping Death are relentlessly aggressive . Escape highlights the melodic NWOBHM influence that was virtually non - existent on Kill ` Em All . The perennial favorite Metallica instrumental , The Call of Ktulu , rounds out one of the greatest metal albums of all time . It has a sound completely distinct from their others , has some of the best songs in Metallica 's catalog , and without question belongs in any collection of heavy music .","summary":"The Formation of Thrash Metal","unixReviewTime":1302220800,"image":null}

It 's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album . It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica 's early catalogue , considering \" Kill ' Em All \" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal , \" Master of Puppets \" is regarded as Metallica 's magnum opus , and \" ... And Justice For All \" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for \" One \" . Regardless of whether or not \" Ride The Lightning \" is overlooked or not , it 's still a classic that should be in every metalhead 's collection . One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica 's debut , it seems to have a thicker , more polished , and at times , more epic sound . Do n't get me wrong , though , I still think \" The Four Horsemen \" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics , but to get a full review of \" Ride The Lightning \" , simply read on . \" Fight Fire With Fire \" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute . Suddenly , a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour . The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare . The singing is also very raw , with James singing a very staccato pattern , \" Do! ... Un! ... -to others! ... As! ... Great way to start off the album . \" Ride The Lightning \" , the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high - pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy , Devil 's Tritone riff . Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here , along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment . \" For Whom The Bell Tolls \" is a progressive , five - minute classic with plenty of great guitar riffs that occupy the first two minutes of the song . The nastiest riff of them all is featured in the chorus , and some wild guitar playing closes this war song out . \" Fade To Black \" is a personal favorite of mine , one of the best songs on the album , and one of the very best songs Metallica 's ever written . Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo . Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses , then comes a powerful chorus riff . More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out . \" Trapped Under Ice \" is another heavy song about struggle , featuring some dirty riffage and wild soloing that definitely makes itself worthy to be on the album . \" Escape \" is a more melodic , radio - friendly sounding song , but nonetheless a great track , as well . A bit shorter and a pretty cool song . \" Creeping Death \" is a song that defines thrash metal . This is an overall great song that you got ta hear . And , as always , Kirk Hammett shows us why he 's an amazing guitarist when he screeches out those awesome guitar solos . \" The Call of Ktulu \" is a nine - minute , progressive instrumental . A cool way to end the album , it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums , alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone . I personally prefer \" Orion \" off \" Master of Puppets \" , but this song is definitely a great one , too . So as you can see , \" Ride The Lightning \" is undoubtedly a classic metal album . I 've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time , and when you give this a listen , you 'll see why . All of the tracks are very strong , the songwriting 's great , as are the singing , guitar- , bass- , and drum - playing . Get this , along with the other three Metallica releases in the ' 80s , and even \" The Black Album \" if you 're interested . Overall , this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrash metal , and heavy metal in general . Good job to the ' tallica guys ! Thanks for the time , and peace .","summary":"\"Ride The Lightning\" is a high-voltage classic","unixReviewTime":1212192000,"image":null}

And it 's a more difficult metal experience in general , the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument . Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener . The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I 'm not sure it needs it . For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it 's excellent musical and lyrical assault . The production values on this album seem a little dull , the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that 's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door . But the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release . The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice , Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu . And the literary references are a nice touch . Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends ( hey , we 've all been there ) , it 's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it . All up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice . There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there . But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff . In fact I 'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it 's debut Kill ` Em All through to the black album . If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum .","summary":"Sophomore expanding of the Metallica soundscape","unixReviewTime":1199404800,"image":null}

While I 'm not particularly thrilled with a few moments here and there , overall it 's much better than what many of the metal bands in the mid 80 's were doing ( with all their big hair , constant partying and chicks ) . Metallica 's music remains fresh and exciting all these years later . This album was REALLY underrated back in the mid 80 's . People back then did n't know how to approach something with this much speed and punch . Fight Fire With Fire- a plodding guitar riff , and the idea for an acoustic intro is ripped off from a couple old Black Sabbath tunes . The verse melody is horrible but the chorus is decent . Ride the Lightning- the best part of the song is the 15 - second guitar intro . I love that . Great chorus as well that remains memorable no matter how many times it 's played . Great guitar solo as well . Some parts of the solo remind me of the mid 70 's Rainbow song called \" Light in the Black \" . For Whom the Bell Tolls- let 's just call it the way it is- this is a classic metal track in the same way \" Iron Man \" is Black Sabbath 's classic . Fade to Black- a softer number that gradually builds into a much heavier and typical Metallica track . It 's not really a ballad . It 's a shame the verse melody has been copied time and time again by Metallica themselves as early as their Black Album in the early 90 's . The original idea was right here on this album . The lyrics do n't sound very emotionally honest though . I like the second half of the song more even though parts of the guitar solo sound ripped off from Black Sabbath 's \" Snowblind \" . Trapped Under Ice- flashy guitar playing that sounds like a leftover from the Kill 'em All album . Not that that 's a bad thing , mind you . Escape- really good song , though the chorus sounds stuck in the 80 's with that dated sound . I like the way the verse melody chugs along . Great lyrics by their standards too . Creeping Death- another memorable heavy \/ speed metal track . These guys were clearly more talented than most . The guitar solo sure sounds like it was copied from a popular Scorpions song at the time . Call of Ktulu- a very slow , rocking build up . It 's really good but 9 minutes might tire out some people . You need to have at least one Metallica album in your collection , and none of them are better than this one .","summary":"The ultimate thrash metal, speed metal, heavy metal album","unixReviewTime":1197590400,"image":null}

First released in August of 1984 , Ride the Lightning was considered a metal masterpiece in the underground at the time of its release . After the promising debut album Kill 'em All in 1983 , Metallica ( which was comprised of singer \/ guitarist James Hetfield , lead guitarist Kirk Hammett , drummer Lars Ulrich and the late great bass player Cliff Burton ) , the band 's cult following got them a major record deal with Elektra Records and the band went to Denmark with the band themselves producing and using one - time Rainbow engineer Flemming Rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which I found to be the case when I first got this album in May of 1989 on cassette . The album starts off with \" Fight Fire With Fire \" which at first sounded like it was going to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars playing a relaxing melody but then Hammett and Hetfield 's guitars come screaming in as was Ulrich 's drumming which sounded like Bruce Lee on speed and Burton 's bass playing which was superb . James ' vocals on the track sounded sinister . We continue the rocking on the album 's classic title cut which is a classic thrashy cut with tempo changes that would make the prog rockers happy . Next is another classic metal track \" For Whom the Bell Tolls \" which is a superb rocker with a beat that sounds like marching off to war . The first half ends with \" Fade to Black \" which for the most part was a ballad before speeding up and was IMHO the Stairway to Heaven of the 80s as , like that song , starts soft then picks up then softens then gets harder and harder before the big finale . The album 's second half kicks off with a classic thrash number called \" Trapped Under Ice \" which is just superb . Next is another great metal number \" Escape \" . However , it 's a shame that these two great songs are overlooked by many . We then come to one of Metallica 's best pre-1991 masterworks \" Creeping Death \" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing . We end the album with the epic instrumental called \" The Call of Ktulu \" which sounds like the band had been listening to ELP , Genesis , Pink Floyd and Yes as the piece is filled with tempo changes , key changes and is just stellar , especially Hammett and Burton 's solos on guitar and wah - wah bass respectively . While Ride the Lightning scraped the Top 100 upon its release without either radio or MTV or even mainstream media support , the album today is now their third largest selling album with some five million copies sold in the US alone today . Most Metallica fans from 1991 onward probably do n't like this album but us purists who liked their speed metal sound in their early days then this album is for you . Highly recommended !","summary":"Metallica's greatest hour 23 years on","unixReviewTime":1194480000,"image":null}

I have to say that Ride the Lightning was easily their best effort , and might be one of the top 10 metal records ever made . Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10 , and every single tune is heavy as hell ( except for Call of the Katula , but it does some crunching at the end ) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again . True the Master of Puppets is great to , but I do n't think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning . Master has really been worn out since I listened to it soooo much , that it really does nt do it for me anymore . I still love Ride the Lightning as they day I bought it in 1986 .

Stutheit","reviewText":"Metallica 's second album , 1984 's \" Ride the Lightning , \" was the first real metal album I ever bought . When I bought it , I was looking for a really heavy album , so when the first track began with an acoustic intro , I was sorely disappointed . Luckily , however , I skipped to the next song , the title track , and its booming intro brought a big smile to my face . With 1983 's \" Kill ` Em All , \" Metallica helped create thrash metal ; but they followed up their debut with their sophomore album , which was released only a year later . Most metalheads have given it the credit it deserves , but I feel \" Ride the Lightning \" is still somewhat underrated , since the album that followed this one was \" Master of Puppets . \" \n\n \" Ride the Lightning \" is still fast . Most of it shoots by like ... well , lightning ; but it 's slower , darker , heavier and more mature than \" Kill ` Em All . \" James ' voice is somewhat lower than it was , and his lyrics are improved . As the above Amazon editorial review mentions , James discusses several different ways to die : Armageddon , capitol punishment , suicide , being trapped under ice , etc . \n\n \" Fight Fire with Fire \" has the aforementioned acoustic intro , but it 's just a tease - it does n't last . The power chords fade in and the song becomes a breakneck speed , with rip - roaring , almost Slayer - esque guitar work . Lyrically , this songs seems to be about the Apocalypse . \n\n \" Ride the Lightning \" is the album 's most popular single . It 's another thrashy number , with booming rhythms , fiery chug and churn riffs ( which go from fast to faster to slow to fast ) , and an awesome , lengthy Hammett solo . \" Ride the Lightning \" has good lyrics about being executed by the electric chair , and it also has a surprise ending , but most of this song is an instrumental . \" For Whom the Bell Tolls \" is slower paced , but still loud and heavy . The first two minutes of this song is an instrumental , beginning with a bell ringing , then the heavy , repetitive , churning guitars kick in . This song has another good , winding solo near the end . \" Fade to Black \" is really morbid because it has depressing , introspective lyrics about suicide . It begins with a distant guitar solo , but the acoustic strums actually make the first part of this song rather pretty . ( Pretty in a dark and depressing way , but pretty nonetheless . ) The choruses still have heavy riffs , and the end is an ascending and cascading solo . \" Trapped Under Ice \" is very fast paced with another short but sweet guitar solo near the middle . \" Escape \" has vocals which make it radio ready ( it has good vocal hooks ) . Most of the song has propulsive riffs with thunderous drumming , but the choruses are slower . \" Creeping Death \" begins with machine gun guitars and drumming , before changing to another fast beat with guitars that burn straight ahead . And , of course , there 's another stellar solo near the end . \" The Call of KTULU \" is the album 's instrumental . In my opinion , this song IS as great as \" Orion \" ( from Metallica 's next album , \" Master of Puppets , \" ) and it 's a very good way to end the album . It starts out slowly and ominously with wind wooshes , but then it suddenly becomes a lot faster . This song builds well and has superb guitar and drum work . So , this disc is another wonderful landmark album and it 's still one of the best C.D. 's of the past two decades . All of the qualities of a classic metal or thrash metal album are here : long songs ( about 6 minutes per song ) , rapid fire riffs , ripping solos , an instrumental track , and even some acoustic guitar licks . In conclusion , if you want a complete metal collection , or if you just like heavy metal , you need this album more than you need your next breath .","summary":"Another perfect Metallica album","unixReviewTime":1121558400,"image":null}

It was simply revolutionary at the time . Since \" Kill ' Em All \" , the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents , technique and their approach with this groundbreaker . Every track offers something new , and experimental . The instruments are n't the only improvement . Hetfield 's lyrics are much more personal , and conscious . The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from \" Kill ' Em All \" out of the water . Tracks such as \" Fade To Black \" and \" The Call of Ktulu \" were absolutely phenomenal works , untouched by the standards of 1984 . And although it 's up for debate , Hammett 's guitar solos are my favorite on this album . Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on \" Ride The Lightning \" , that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen , and still does to this day .

While their first album Kill ' Em All relied more on speed metal , Ride The Lightning showed the band expanding their musical horizons and their songwriting abilities , which would lead to their breakthrough in America . Every track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics . The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs , death , and the struggle within . There is much diversity to be found here whether it 's the excellent speed metal of \" Fight Fire With Fire \" and \" Trapped Under Ice \" or the longer epics \" The Call Of Ktulu \" , the title track , and the awesome \" Creeping Death . \" The menacing \" For Whom The Bell Tolls \" and \" Escape \" are also very strong tracks . Then there 's \" Fade To Black \" , the best track the band has ever recorded , and is to heavy metal what \" Stairway To Heaven \" is to classic rock . This is simply an incredible song , between its several different movements and its lyrics which tell of a man contemplating suicide . The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song 's outro is one of the best ever of the genre . Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal .

' Fight Fire With Fire ' starts off with a soft intro and it turns into a thrash metalhead 's heaven and it 's a killer song and I love the explosion at the end of the song . and it 's another Metallica classic although it is n't nearly as fast as the previous song but it 's worthy enough to enter inside a thrash metalhead 's mind . 8\/10 \n ' For Whom the Bell Tolls ' starts off with the tolling bell and although I did n't think much for this song at first but the chorus lines helped me like this song and the tolling bells is awesome . 10\/10 \n ' Fade to Black ' is a bit slower and softer than the previous songs they 've done but Metallica can do a slower song very well ( that is up until they 're Load stuff ) and the loud guitar 's somewhat reminds me of Black Sabbath 's Iron Man which is also a classic , and there are more songs to come that have the same vein as ' Fade to Black ' . 10\/10 \n ' Trapped Under Ice ' is probably my least favorite song off of this album but it 's still a good song especially compared to their post - Black Album era . 7\/10 \n ' Escape ' is probably the most underrated song off of this album and I actually like this song alot , and I wish that the same thing can be said with the other Metallica fans . 9\/10 \n ' Creeping Death ' is another standout for this album and it 's one of their heaviest songs off of this album . 10\/10 \n ' The Call of Ktulu ' is the closing track and believe it or not , I actually did n't think much for this song but I gave it a few listens and now this is my favorite song off of this album and I could listen to this song like 5 times in a row and never get tired of it , Ride the Lightning is worth it for the price of this song alone and this song is easily one of heavy metal 's best instrumentals of all time . 10\/10 \n If you never heard of anything that Metallica has done before the Black Album ?

If your name is hiphopforlife , what are you doing reviewing a Metallica album ? \n hiphopforlife : Be patient , homeboy .

I am more than qualified to \n review this album . Now on to buisness . The Lightning is the second album from the artists formerly known as Metallica . While their first album , Kill ' Em All , was raw and off the wall as you can get , the guys calmed down(somewhat calmed down ) and created one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever ; and the scary part is that the album after this one , Master Of Puppets(a legend in it 's own time ) is BETTER ! It starts off with Fight Fire With Fire , arguably Metallica 's fastest song . The Lightning is up next , which brilliantly looks into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair . For Whom The Bell Tools relaxes on the speed , but cranks up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player Cliff Burton . Fade to Black is next , which is Metallica 's attempt and sucess at a \" power ballad \" ... Average Joe : Hold on , hiphop;this has a ballad ? Do n't tell me that Metallica 's gone Barbra Striesand or worse , Bon Jovi on us ? \n hiphopforlife : To quote one of my rap idols , Ice Cube , KILL THAT NOISE ! They have not wimped out by any means(the wimping out will be in 7 years).This is the second best metal ballad of all time(Sanitarium on Master Of Puppets is of course , number one . It is excellently written and sung by James Hetfield(the greatest metal vocalist of all time ; sorry Ozzy).Trapped Under Ice and Escape are next ; and to be honest , these two songs are just okay , in my opinion , which is why most people rank Master Of Puppets higher than Ride The Lightning ; they are n't horrible , just okay . But the pace definitely picks up with the next two songs ; DO NOT SKIP THEM ! Creeping Death expounds on James ' Christian scientist upbringing with a story on how Moses frees the Isrealites ; it has a great middle part which makes the whole song worthwhile . Now it all comes down to the final song ; the Call OF Ktulu , a superbly constructed instrumental which showcases all four members of the band 's talents , especially the aforementioned Cliff Burton , who wraps up his title of the greatest bass player of all time . The Lightning , one of the most influential records from metal 's most influential band . I would advise you to pick this up YESTERDAY , if not sooner . Average Joe : Thanks hiphop ; you sold me . You are the greatest reviewer ever . And you , dear reader , will be sold as well on the past greatness of the band once known as Metallica . The Lightning , as well as their whole 80 's catalog(and the Black album , if you must ) .","summary":"Part two in the Metallica miniseries; organized noise","unixReviewTime":1042243200,"image":null}

The album starts off with \" Fight Fire With Fire \" , a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield , and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare . The title track deals with what s on the cover , awaiting execution in the electric chair . The track also showcases Lars Ulrich 's double bass drums . \" For Whom the Bell Tolls \" , one of Metallica 's most recognized songs , showcases every band member 's talents , especially Cliff Burton 's sonic bass assault . Up next is \" Fade to Black \" , a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide , and this as well has become one of Metallica 's most popular songs . The song has a special meaning to me personally , it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard , and it helped me through some bad times . \" Trapped Under Ice \" is about , of all things , being frozen suffocating under ice . The lyrics give a chilling ( no pun intended ) feel to it , and the song has a great chorus . \" Escape \" is hte only song that could be classified as \" filler material \" , but it is a solid track in itself . Next up is \" Creeping Death \" , which is a concert staple to this day , and contains biblical references as lyrics . This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents . The final track , the instrumental \" Call of Ktulu \" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff 's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar . The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more , but that 's not really much of a complaint .

Here it is almost 20 years after its release and I still believe it is the best metal album ever made , even though I fell out of the Metallica camp by the early 90s and a lot of great metal albums have been released since .","summary":"Has it really been 18 years?","unixReviewTime":1023408000,"image":null}

With Kill ' Em All , they proved that they could play hard , fast , and with reams of energy . However , the subsequent release of Ride The Lightning proved to be a more thought - out collection of songs . Hetfield 's peerless riffing is more refined , and his growling vocals are coming along ( he still was n't too great , though ) . Hammett 's solos are mostly exciting , and he became one of the most copied lead guitarists around ( in metal ) . Even Ulrich , whose drumming was always relatively simple , fits well with the music is gives it a crushing edge . Metallica has never been too focused on bass , so I feel sorry for Cliff Burton he does n't really get too much attention . He still plays an important role in adding extra punch to the riffs , but one thing that 's nice about Metallica 's newer work is that the production is more accommodating to the different instruments . ( Just a small gripe . ) Anyway , this album tells you what Metallica was all about . The highlight of Ride the Lighting one of my favorite Metallica songs , \" Fade to Black . \" It 's a great anti - suicide song , that starts with slow , lugubrious guitar that builds up into heavy , powerful riffs . It concludes with exhilarating , punchy riffs and a glistening solo . Fans have written to Metallica saying that this song deterred them from taking the course of suicide ... that 's how good it is ! \" Call of Ktulu \" , the big instrumental , is almost symphonic in its interplay ( which is why it works so well with the orchestra on S&M ) . \" Creeping Death \" and \" For Whom the Bell Tolls \" are heavy , clomping thrash songs with interesting progressions and killer riffs . \" Fire Fire with Fire \" is mindless thrash with lots of kick . \" Trapped under Ice \" is tight speed metal . Ride the Lightning is n't as ambitious or complex as Metallica 's follow - ups , Master of Puppets or ... And Justice For All . However , most of the songs are great one way or another . Here , Metallica driven by pure intensity and delivers a great , great metal album .","summary":"Oh yeah.","unixReviewTime":970531200,"image":null}

THE DISC : ( 1984 ) 8 songs clocking in at approximately 47 minutes . Included with the disc is a 6 - page booklet with black & white band pictures , song credits \/ lyrics and thank you 's . Recorded at Sweet Silence Studios , in Copenhagen , Denmark . Played the vinyl record in college so many times I wore it out ( thank God for compact discs ) . This is still a classic Metallica album . However , decades later , I go back and forth with \" Ride The Lightning \" . Thinking it totally shreds one week , and then the next week thinking it 's so hard to get into . This album takes an acquired taste , and perhaps ' mood ' is the better word . Sure 6 of the 8 tracks are fragments of brilliance ; atom splitting ; rapid - fire assaults on the senses . The lightning quick songs are important in the band 's library of songs . They had to go through these early stages to get to where they are today - so many years later . The title track is perhaps my favorite fast track on the album . The two slower songs - \" For Whom The Bells Toll \" and \" Fade To Black \" - are perhaps two of the best songs in the entire Metallica catalog . I can still listen to these songs anywhere , any time , any day . Both feature some amazing guitar work ( both electric and acoustic ) . \" Call Of Ktulu \" is a 9 minute instrumental slugfest that I fell in love again with after their ' live ' version on \" S&M \" simply blew me away . Decades after this release , it 's still a classic in my book , but I have to be in the mood for it . Just a notch below \" Master Of Puppets \" .

That in turn was followed by Justice , Black , Load , Reload , S&M , Puppets , and now , Ride . And   believe me , I really enjoyed the spectacular concert the guys performed ,   particularly , \" Creeping Death \" ( probably the best song on the   DVD ) , \" For Whom The Bell Tolls \" , and especially \" Kill \/ Ride   Medley \" . I was especially interested in hearing the   original versions of \" Fight Fire With Fire \" and \" Ride The   Lightning \" from the Medley . And let me tell you , they are definitely   killer ! The machine - gun guitar and drum riffs were probably what made this   CD popular in the first place . IMHO , Metallica help create speed \/ thrash   metal in the early \/ mid-80 's . Not only do you get the killer riffs , but you   also get the popular \" Fade To Black \" which is similar to   \" One \" in that it starts out really slow , then gradually picks up   speed before peaking at a fast guitar solo . And then you have \" The   Call Of Ktulu \" which is an excellent instrumental by itself ( however ,   I prefer the S&M version ; it sounds SO much better with the   orchestra ! ) . Being a new Metallica fan , so to speak , I can start to see   why many of the longtime fans out there do n't prefer the newer stuff   they 've put out ( I personally like both of the Loads ) . Ride ( along with   Puppets and Justice ) was unique in the sense that Jaymz and company had the   guts to put out something that would stand the test of time to this day .

Well , not necessarily . The fact that this is boring . Just because it is dark does not make it really intelligent . I respect the fact that they did what they wanted rather than lap up the commercial success like Metallica did at the same time . But that does n't mean that everything they do is automatically brilliant because of it . The fact is that this has hardly any decent songs to mention . It lacks the energy of Warning and Queensryche EP , the accessiblity of Empire and the brilliance of Operation Mindcrime . It does have the wierdness of Rage For Order but in a bad way since it is resorts to uninspired sluggishness rather than the sinister almost industrial feel of Rage For Order . For an album that took 2 years to write and record , Queensryche do n't have a lot to show for it .

The music is a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beats , seductive male and female vocals , and a diverse mix of samples from bands like The Cure . What I love about \" Mezzanine \" so much is that the music is dark and sinister . All the death \/ black metal bands in the world can not create music as richly dense and heavy as \" Mezzanine \" is . There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller . The first two songs \" Angel \" and \" Risingon \" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares . I can never get tired of listening to \" Teardrop \" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals . The production is neither too slick or too gritty . \" Mezzanine \" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless .

Sometimes relaxing , sometimes haunting , and always groovy , \" Mezzanine \" delivers a worthwhile follow - up to \" Blue Lines \" that \" Protection \" failed to be .

The sound , with its low beats and ( in a first for Massive Attack ) thrashing guitars , succeeds in actually oppressing the listener .... and that 's very   much a good thing , because the music in this album is just so very novel   and smooth you want to feel every part of it . As usual with Massive   releases , \" Mezzanine \" features the vocals of two female vocalists   on several songs , Liz Fraser ( formerly of Cocteau Twins ) and newcomer Sara   Jay . Liz 's contributions are some of the higher points of the album , and   \" Teardrop \" is just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998 . Sara Jay 's one song is the insidious and sneaky \" Dissolved Girl , \"   which has Massive Attack doing some new tricks with electronica . Horace   Andy , the reggae singer who is a mainstay of Massive Attack 's albums , has   three songs here , the industrial \" Angel , \" and the almost - retro   Massive Attack \" Man Next Door \" and \" ( Exchange ) \" . The   songs featuring the vocals of Massive 's members 3D and Daddy G are also   well - done , and 3D 's threatening whispers on \" Risingson \" do a lot   to make it one of my favourite songs .

I loved their music and got everything they ever put out EXCEPT ONE , Imaginos . I was overseas in the Navy when it came and the 2 albums prior to this were a bit of a disappointment , SO when it came out I was busy and just did n't get around to getting it . Pulled from the shelves everywhere for what I do n't know but nowhere to be found . No big deal right ? I mean tha last 2 releases were rather dull so I figured BOC were tapped out ,   becoming Nostalgic and Nundane . Many years before I even expressed interest in it again after I heard from others that it was actually very good . Some of the best BOC has ever done many say . better get it . NOT , everybody wanted like mega bucks for a copy . Anyway when I saw it here re - released I jumped all over it . Damn glad I did . When I first listened to this and keep in mind , for 30 years I have never heard even one track from this CD , it was like hearing the latest release form one of my favorite bands and it rocks . As a whole I give it an 8 on a 10 scale but there are about 5 songs on this that are the best BOC has ever done . Those songs get a solid 10 . Buck is blazingly fast and imaginitive . These are Blockbuster , Genious Level Guitar Riffs that prove once again that Buck Dharma is one of the greatest guitarists alive and way too many people have never heard of him . A shame really . BOC has a Dark Inteligent perspective that always kept them to , well , cult following status . I like just hearing this now because it truly feels new and fresh to me . I know it came out in 1978 or 79 , and it is now 2008 . But you can'yt tell that from hearing this for the first time . It sounds like so much of BOC 's greates work . Classic and Timeless . If like me you are a BOC fan and you do n't have this . You already know from the years that you got ta have it . If you are a new BOC fan or wondering if this is Vinatge BOC or just mediocrity from BOC , let me assure you this will top your collection as some of BOC 's finest and without a doubt Buck Dharma soundly places himself in the Guitar God Status like he was n't there already . \n\n Kev .","summary":"I Finally Got It","unixReviewTime":1201305600,"image":null}

For the casual listener , or sometime BOC fan , stick with \" Agents of Fortune \" or \" Fire of Unknown Origin \" . \" Imaginos \" is a heavy album and features a great remake of \" Astronomy \" , the best song on the CD . But unless you are prepared to invest some time , deciphering the story , and songs you wo n't get much out of the album . I picked up \" Imaginos \" on CD after hearing \" Astronomy \" late at night ( the best time to play the CD ) , and there was a narrative about the \" Imaginos \" myth read by Stephen King as the song opened . I heard this only two times on the radio , and picked up the CD because I was a huge Stephen King fan , and enjoyed some of BOC 's earlier albums . Needless to say , the Stephen King narrative is not on the album . I was disappointed , but played the disk a few times . I enjoyed \" I Am The One You Warned Me Of \" , a pretty straight ahead rocker , and \" In The Presence of Another World \" which is a more down - tempo song . Actually most of the songs are good , and you will find yourself humming the chorus for hours after listening . The only track that I found lacking , was the title track \" Imaginos \" . For some reason , most likely the background singers : \" Oooohhhh Imaginos , Ooooohhh Imaginos , Oooooohhhh , ooooohhh , ooohhhh Imaginos \" the song sounds like fanfare for a two bit magician about to perform in Vegas or something . Once I got that image stuck in my head , I just kept picturing Imaginos The Great performing card tricks and turning newspaper into doves . If you see a copy of this disk used for under $ 10 pick it up , but I do n't think it 's worth the $ 20 used price I see here .","summary":"Great Album for BOC Fans","unixReviewTime":1089763200,"image":null}

Pretty much looked at as a \" two hit wonder \" , they were much more than that(as One and Two Hit Wonders tend to be sometimes ) . What the hell is that , you ask ? Oddly , it sounds exactly like it 's description . The band members of The Left Banke were n't the most technically savvy of musicians , so the sound of the band revolved around youngest member , Michael Brown . Brown was trained in classical music and played piano and harpsichord , both of which are very prominent in The Left Banke 's sound . Add to that , the smooth Beach Boys - esque vocal harmonies , and you have ..... One song , Evening Gown , almost sounds like a harpsichord driven punk song ! I 'm surprised I like this album as much as I do . Though I 'm big on vintage rock music , this seemed a little too different than what I normally listen to , which is rockabilly and surf . I initially bought it because I 've always had a soft spot for Pretty Ballerina , but much to my surprise I found this whole album to be great ! I am very glad I picked this one up ! If you like the late 60s stuff , The Left Banke deserves a resurrection . If you like Justin Bieber , you 're a schmuck !","summary":"A Pleasant Surprise!","unixReviewTime":1344643200,"image":null}

And Debby Boone is singing the same songs as her special tribute to her mother - in - law . This album promises the listeners an unforgettably , wholesomely beautiful listening experience . There is something to captivate the ears of every listener as she is backed by some of the best musicians we have in the music world today : Rosemary Clooney 's arranger \/ pianist for twenty years , John Oddo , arranger Earl Brown , guitarists John Pizzarelli and Jim Fox , bassist Chuck Berghofer , drummer Gregg Field , percussionist Daniel Greco , saxophonists Gary Foster , Dan Higgins and Scott Hamilton , trumpeter Warren Luening and cellist Armen Ksajikian . I have enjoyed the music of Debby Boone since she recorded an album of great inspirational songs in the seventies and eighties most notably \" Sweet Adoration , \" \" Can You Reach My Friend ? \" \" Sincerely Yours \" and \" You Light Up My Life . \" Her father 's music , Pat Boone , has been part of my very musical family when I was growing up . He was one of my late parents ' favorite singers and mine , too and I was especially fond of his hit song , \" Love Letters In The Sand . \" \n\n On this elegantly charming tribute album recorded with love and dedication ,   Debby Boone sings sixteen classic standards starting off with an uplifting   Irving Berlin classic , \" Blue Skies , \" which Rosemary Clooney used to sing to her first grandson Jordan , whenever he was \" sad , when he took a fall and was crying , or anytime he needed his spirits lifted . \" It 's a surprised added track - Ms. Clooney 's A Capella version . Ms. Boone stated that , like her son Jordan , she would always find comfort in this beautiful song , which highlights Scott Hamilton on tenor sax solo . While all the tracks are so enjoyable , I really love the way she sang \" Mood Indigo , \" which features a vocal quartet - herself and her sisters Cheryl , Lindy and Laury with vocal chart arrangement written by Earl Brown . With its vintage - sounding arrangement and its nostalgic rendition , this classic from Duke Ellington \/ Barney Bigard \/ Irving Mills evokes a sentimental feeling that will flood your eyes with an ocean of tears as the sisters sing ... \n\n Little sister , you ai n't been blue \n No , no , no \n You ai n't been blue \n Not till you 've had that mood indigo \n That feelin ' goes stealin ' down to your shoes Then you cry , you just sit there and cry \n Go long , so long blues ... \n\n Always get that mood indigo \n Since my baby said goodbye In the evenin ' when lights are low \n I 'm so lonesome I could cry \n\n The wonderful tone of John Pizzarrelli 's guitar as well as his soft and mellow scat can be heard in \" I 've Grown Accustomed To His Face \" while Dan Higgin 's flute plays beautifully in \" It Might As Well Be Spring \" complementing Ms. Boone 's gorgeous vocals . The Van Heusen \/ Burke medley is also surprisingly stunning \" But Beautiful , \" \" Moonlight Becomes You \" and \" Like Someone In Love . \" One of my all - time favorites \" The Music That Makes Me Dance \" by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill was rendered so beautiful and heartfelt making it one of the best interpretations ever recorded . And she dedicated it to her hubby , Gabri . The delicate medley of \" It Never Entered My Mind \" and \" In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning \" was selected as a tribute to Frank Sinatra , whom Ms. Boone had worked with on several occasions in the past . The enchanting Bossa Nova arrangement on \" The Best Is Yet To Come \" is so pleasing to the ears . An all - time top favorite , Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne 's \" Time After Time \" is also a highlight and one of the singer 's favorite songs that Chet Baker recorded in an album called \" Chet Baker Sings . \" According to her , \" she fell in love with that album in 1996 and developed a real school girl 's crush on Chet . She spent summer tirelessly delighting in his trumpet playing and melting at the sound of his voice , not to mention his picture . \" She then sent a copy of the record to Rosemary knowing that she would absolutely \" love the way this guy sang . \" And to her surprise , Rosemary told her ; \" Do you know I carry around a picture of Chet Baker in my wallet to this day ? \" In other words , they had a crush on the same guy ! Co - incidentally ,   \" Chet Baker Sings \" is also my very first Chet Baker CD from my collection and I have written a review on this outstanding album about a year ago . It 's a very nice album that focuses on Chet Baker not as a trumpet player but as a singer with a soft and mellow vocal style . Listen to Debby Boone at her utmost best as she pays homage to one of the best female singers of all - time , Rosemary Clooney . You 'll also be delighted with the Liner Notes , which include in great detail Ms. Boone 's heartfelt sentiments for each and every song she selected for this great tribute album . An album of sheer beauty , elegance and perfection .","summary":"\"You Ain't Been Blue . . . Till You've Had That Mood Indigo\"","unixReviewTime":1169337600,"image":null}

While that effort shows promise , its slight disarray is sometimes jarring . Now forward to 2006 , the golden boy of music returns with first single Sexyback off FutureSex \/ LoveSounds . The single is an incredible piece of sweet funk , combining the sensuality of yesteryear 's Prince and the deft execution of pre - scandal Michael jackson . With a hot salacious video to boot , the song is sure pop ecstasy . At the helm of things is once again hip master Timbaland whose collaborations always bear edible fruits . Remixes of the song range from mediocre to superb , beginning with the lackadaisical Pokerface Club Mix which sounds like a piece of early 90 's recycled house mix . The slightly more varied Linus Loves Remix ups the ante with a more danceable electro beat . The best mix has to be the cool Tom Novy Ibiza Mix that cleverly uses a verse of Timberlake 's sung vocals wrapped around some hypnotic and lackbaid grooves .","summary":"For The Floor","unixReviewTime":1157760000,"image":null}

Despite this deficiency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print . Fast forward to 2013 , Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5 , released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue \/ rerecording of the debut became a reality . As Smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds . These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm . Bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal . And while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking , he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music . Reissues rarely add much to the original   especially when the original was near perfect   but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded , transforming a classic of epic Christ - centric power metal into a masterpiece .","summary":"Epic metal classic now with acoustic drums","unixReviewTime":1386288000,"image":null}

A varied album of different styles , all produced & performed so amazingly , it holds up well today . There is funk , Motown oldies , acoustic tracks , & a great orchestrated ballad . The music , the musicianship , and the vocals are all very creative and of the highest calibre . Side One has 2 Motown oldies WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU that are both done in the old Motown style . They even have legendary Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON playing on them . This version of HEAVEN is five minutes and features scat singing by Bonnie in the middle . This is a different version from the disco hit single that went to # 11 on the charts . Bonnie redid it as a single , and I much prefer the album version , with it 's homage to classic Motown . The other 2 tracks are both stellar , with inventive arrangements , singing & playing . The single FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM \/ TIE ME TO A TREE [ HANDCUFF ME ] is amazing . That 's what I mean about the creativity and work that Bonnie , the musicians and producer Jeffrey Bowen [ who previously produced The Temptations ] put into this album . And you have not heard a funk track as hot and funky as AH SHOOT , I guarantee you since Sly & The Family Stone 's THANK YOU . This song is 5 minutes of pure funk nastiness with an organ that drives it , blazingly funky horns a \/ la James Brown , Bonnie 's muti - faceted   vocals & just sheer musical genius at it 's height . It 's just waiting to be sampled . The musicians on this album are of top calibre with Family Stone member TRUMAN THOMAS arranging , playing & co - writing , Funkadelic guitarist EDDIE HAZEL , Rolling Stones sideman OLLIE BROWN , original Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON , NIGEL OLSSON of Elton John 's band on one track , and string arrangements by noted arrangers LEE HOLDRIDGE and PAUL RISER . And Side Two illustrates another side to Bonnie Pointer , with 4 acoustic rhythmically driven & played songs MORE AND MORE , I LOVE TO SING TO YOU , I WANNA MAKE [ IN YOUR WORLD ] , and the beautiful ballad MY EVERYTHING that closes this unique , diverse album of sheer musical pleasure . These 4 numbers all co - written by DONALD BALDWIN are amazing - filled with hooks , catchy choruses , and pure musicianship . That is just a taste of what Bonnie can do with a ballad . Also of note is that this self - titled album is the one with a RED COVER . For some unknown reason , Motown released Bonnie 's 2nd album with the same self - titled name , and that has a purple cover . Also it 's not as great as this one . Released in Dec. 1978 , the same time as The Pointer Sisters equally excellent ENERGY album , this is a classic that has to be heard . It is by far the best of Bonnie 's 3 solo albums . Catalog number is MOTOWN M7 - 911R1 . Tracks : WHEN I'M GONE , FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM \/ TIE ME TO A TREE [ HANDCUFF ME ] , HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU , AH SHOOT , MORE AND MORE , I LOVE TO SING TO YOU , I WANNA MAKE IT","summary":"Red Cover LP.

The original LP did not contain the disco version that eventually became a # 11 pop and Top Ten Disco hit , but this reissue cures that by including both the 7 \" and 12 \" versions of it . The other three bonus tracks are all versions of the record 's first single , \" Free Me From My Freedom \/ Tie Me To a Tree ( Handcuff Me ) \" . The latter , which is not a medley by the way , has a very interesting lyric that seems to have caused the single to stall at mid - chart , at least on the pop side . Some programmers & listeners felt it was either an S&M reference , or as the liner notes say , \" a step back for the feminist movement . \" It is open to either that interpretation or Bonnie's -- that she meant to be tied and handcuffed with love , not literally , after finding independence to be disappointing . \" Put love 's chains back on me ... \" \n\n The rest of the record covers a wide range of styles . I think Bonnie sounds a lot like Carole King on \" More And More \" and I 'm hearing some Billie Holliday in \" My Everything \" . Another Motown remake ( besides \" Heaven Must Have Sent You \" , originally a hit for the Elgins ) begins the album :   \" When I 'm Gone \" is a ( literally ) snappy version of the Brenda Holloway classic . I would n't say the sound is \" muddy \" as another reviewer put it , but I ca n't say it leaps out of the speakers either . I 'd be curious to hear \/ read what other buyers think about this . On the plus side , the packaging is excellent , with great photos and an extensive essay by Christian John Wikane . The notes give a brief history of the Pointer Sisters before ( thoroughly ) discussing the making of this album . More about \" Heaven \" :   it opens with a machine gun drum blast , has the guitar jangling all the way through , features a 2 - minute wild string - and - drum break , and ends with Ms. Pointer channeling Louis Armstrong .

All that means is the original , while sounding dated , still holds both a unique and familiar feel to it . The song has two different parts to it . These parts are completely different from each other in just about all things . The feel , groove and even time signature are different . The first part is very much a forward moving and brooding feel to it reminiscent of the old western films . The other part switches to a 3\/4 time signature with Nancy Sinatra singing softly about nature . Both sides seem to switch back in forth in either a dance or a duo between each other . Kind of a one side masculine and one feminine . Much has been said about the meaning of the song and lyrics . The obvious is one part is a man who was influenced by somebody named Phaedra , and the other is Phaedra herself speaking of what she is all about . Is it all about romance ? Is it about evolving to a higher sense of being ? Is it just about sex ? I found no definitive answers out there . I like to think it 's about redemption given to somebody hardened by life by one who is at one with her surroundings . It 's such a simple song yet it is filled with complexity not just in lyrics but musically as well . It 's been covered many times , but I find going back to the original keeps me in touch with just how beautiful the song is in both its darker and warmer tones . If you like 60 's psychedelic music they do n't get much better than this .","summary":"A bit schizophrenic, but way cool nonetheless","unixReviewTime":1387756800,"image":null}

This underrated song was all but lost to the radio time vaults till Napoleon Dynamite made it its credits song , perfectly going along with the movie . The result was the rediscovering of this classic , and amazingly , it still held up . Covers quickly ensued . Musically , the song has a lite poppy feel , that is distinctively 80 's . No . Nope , it is unmistakably 80 's . It 's a nice feel to the song , and it really adds an extra flavor to it . Vocally , while the verses lag , and fail to deliver a great punch , making for the only complaint of the song , the main chorus is perfect . Well , almost , that \" I promise you , \" does drag it down . However , the lyrics are really the crown jewel and highlight of the song . They 're as great now as they were then , if not more so . They 're well written , emotional in unexpected ways , and it really speaks about the aspect of love that 's rarely touched upon : Us guys who ca n't think of the perfect words to say to our perfect and lovely ladies . The lyrics really hit home for us poor guys , and really make it an even better song than it already was . Overall , one of the most underrated and forgotten about songs from the 80 's that was lost for so many years , but is finally making a comeback . Why iTunes does n't have it is beyond me , and is really a musical travesty . So many fans are getting jibbed of great music . In other arenas , the song went perfect with Napoleon Dynamite , and the song seemed better because of it . It 's like they completed each other to make one another more emotional in their own little way . Anberlin 's cover of the song was n't that great . It was a straight up cover , with some acoustic elements added to it , that really did n't add to the song . Plus , they are so alike on vocals , you still had the same problem . New Found Glory also covered the song , but they made it more upbeat than the original , giving it more of a pop \/ rock influence , but it still kept the emotion of the original song , and added another layer to it .","summary":"The Forgotten Classic","unixReviewTime":1209340800,"image":null}

He honestly was one of the greatest singers of all time , who knew how to belt out remarkable songs on his own , and doing renditions of other artists songs . He had his ups and downs with his life , but always kept music in tune . When he did another artist in song , he took it into another place like his cover of the classic Ray Charles song Un - Chain My Heart , which came out in the 1987 . The song just remains a classic , and showcases his bluesy voice and a soulful heart kept alive in song and in real heart . It is truly a blessing at soul , and what he put out with great music . Joe Cocker will definitely be missed in song , and in spirit . His heart has been un - chained .","summary":"R.I.P. Joe Cocker","unixReviewTime":1419292800,"image":null}

The guy was honestly one of the most amazing singers that had ever came out of the Woodstock . He honestly was amazing with each and every song he had recorded and performed live . The guy was absolutely a remarkable singer But this past year had showed a sad and tragic end to his brilliant end , losing his life to lung cancer , as a result from his twenty years plus of drug and alcohol addiction . But he left behind a cavalcade of great songs from With A Little Help From My Friends , and especially Up Where We Belong . His collaboration with Jennifer Warnes which won a academy award for Best Song and a Grammy Award in 1983 . It is a lovely romantic ballad that still captures the soul of the heart . Joe & Jennifer had a connection that many of today 's artists could n't even come close to at heart .

Their album Liberty had proved a commercial failure , its two singles failing to make a significant showing on British or American charts . https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dDLiVwpv89s \n\n It was not until Capitol leaked \" Ordinary World \" to a radio station in Florida in the autumn of 1992 that it looked like Duran Duran mania might yet hit again . The single proved so popular that Capitol had to push the US release date up , ultimately releasing it in December . The drums were played by Steve Ferrone at Maison Rouge . The guitar solo that characterizes this song was arranged and performed by Warren Cuccurullo , former player with Frank Zappa . His instrumental rock trio version became a staple of his solo shows and was included on one of his solo albums \" Roadrage \" . The music video was filmed by director Nick Egan at Huntington Gardens in San Marino , California and the song later featured in the soundtrack to the film Layer Cake in 2005 .

Still , they had crossed over nicely in the 90 's with the music from The Wedding Album , and some of the songs still ignite today like they did back in the 90 's . Ordinary World is absolutely no exception . The song is definitely one of their better songs that the group had came out with . I love the rhythm of the song from start to finish . It is definitely one of their better songs they had came out with .

Grand Funk was never very popular with the critics , largely , I think , because their music was fairly simple and they were real crowd - pleasers , and showed no greater ambitions than that . But these qualities made them vastly popular with the general public who gave them six million - selling albums at a time when AM radio would n't play their songs . This song would be heard at rock concerts all over , especially the outdoor concerts . If it was a big concert Grand Funk themselves might be playing it as they toured a lot . But many outdoor summer concerts had good regional or local bands and all of them played this song too . It really captures the feeling of a rock concert circa 1970 - 71 .","summary":"The Sound of An Early 70's Rock Concert","unixReviewTime":1375747200,"image":null}

I would say _ Stabbing the Drama _ is a big improvement over _ Natural Born Chaos _ and _ Figure Number Five _ , and it 's sort of a medium between the two . Just for reference , _ A Predator 's Portrait _ is one of my all time favorite metal discs , simply perfect . _ Steelbath Suicide _ and _ Chainheart Machine _ are also fantastic . all three of those are brutal and furious . That said , I even liked FNF for the most part , because of the vocals and catchy songs , but the guitars and drums and METALNESS of it seemed more half - hearted IMO , a downgrade from _ Natural Born Chaos _ but that album had its own shortcomings like sounding pretty homogeneous . Stabbing the Drama _ has the same catchy aspect as these previous albums ( NBC \/ FNF ) but the writing on the whole seems stronger . Heck , this band 's songwriting is downright outstanding in my opinion , they write GREAT catchy metal songs , their melodic acumen is outstanding and Speed is an extremely empathetic vocalist . The album shows a tremendous refinement of the band 's main direction for the last while , and if you take the last three albums as a class , this is the most well - rounded and best - written accomplishment of those . but here the songs have more variety and better quality from beginning to end ( i have n't heard the newest one , _ Sworn to a Great Divide _ ) I would honestly think of this has heavy pop music , which to me is n't a bad thing although such a description is probably a major turn - off to most people . like pop music , the main focus is the vocals and the hooks . The general form of structure and arrangement is pretty straightforward , and by now Speed 's approach to vocals is pretty predictable . Speed 's voice is amazing though , whether the harsh voice or clean voice , and he 's gotten much better with each album . That said , the music is much more ... i dunno , fleshed out than the last few . Fat , chunky - choppy riffs and absolutely AMAZING drumming ( forget Ranta , the new drummer is a fiend , did i mention that ? ) , and very tasteful synths all drive the hooks home with amazing force behind the vocalist in the spotlight . pop music , even really good pop music , does n't really show this kind of deadly chops . I 'd say if you really _ disliked _ everything since APP , STD wo n't change your mind -- BUT if you liked the general approach of the previous two albums but thought they could be a little better SOMEHOW , then you should pick this up if you have n't because it rules , although i wager the fan likes or would like NBC more than this one . I think this is just as addictive as those , but more well written so it has much better lasting power . i personally have deep regrets about not getting it until very recently .","summary":"outstanding craftsmanship and kickazzery","unixReviewTime":1219276800,"image":null}

Gore","reviewText":"If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums , was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one , and make it work . When I heard the first few works by this band , I had thought they were the most unique band since \" Hypocrisy \" . Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork , I still enjoyed what they had to offer , and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then . As the albums and time went on , it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style . They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound , and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound . That is fine . Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy , that is a really broad statement . There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic . True , some are generic and sound like every other , but some try their best to create that sound , while still creating thier own \" Bells and Whistles \" to stand out from the rest . So on to \" Stabbing the Drama \" When I first heard it , I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound . Gone was everything they had built , only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core , almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio , and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest . True , there are fans and people that will love this album , but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent , and then release an album of this calibur . Korn , Metallica , Machine Head , Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts , or some of the bands early works . Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound , and in my opinion , this was done not because of a want to make something different ( most of us know that as we get older , we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses . Some of those bands recovered , some did nt , but the damage was still done . So the conclusion is , what will you think of \" Stabbing the Drama \" It depends on what you are looking for . New to Soilwork ? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal ? Yes , you might like it . Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here . I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic . I also found myself not liking one single track . Not a ONE ! Change can be good , but here , change is n't good .

Stutheit","reviewText":"There has been a lot of competition among metal bands these past few years , and so many of the bands offer nothing at all new to the metal scene . Plus , it does n't necessarily make it easier if your band is from Sweden , because there are also several Swedish metal bands ( i.e. Arch Enemy , Meshuggah , In Flames , etc . ) Before I heard their music , I had Soilwork pegged as just another metalcore band ; but then , on an impulse buy , I gave \" Stabbing the Drama \" a listen . And when I did , I was very pleasantly surprised . This C.D. is n't 100 % new or innovative , but it 's melodic , and that 's quite refreshing in this day and age . The guitars are fiery and crunchy , but the vocals are what make these songs pleasing to the ears . Singer Bjorn Strid does n't quite have a soulful voice , but it is tuneful and quite impressive . He switches back and forth between angry and aggressive to harmonic and clean . Sometimes , as is the case with tracks five and six , he can sing melodically even when the backing music is heavy . The title track is a personal favorite because it has rapid stop - start riffs and drumming which is vaguely reminiscent of a jackhammer . \" One With the Flies \" is a punching rhythm with cascading riffs , and a nice , melodic guitar solo . \" Weapon of Vanity \" has scorching , blowtorch riffs , and \" Nerve \" begins with thunderous guitar noise and dreary vocals . \" Stalemate \" has a sprinting rhythm with running riffs and fast , thumping drums . \" Observation Slave \" has a lot of clean singing ( some of the vocals sound distant ) , alongside riffs which are extra crunchy . \" Blind Eye Halo \" features grooving riffs , fast snare drumming , and back - to - back guitar solos . Finally , \" If Possible , \" has more fast , surging , stop - start , punching riffs , but it ends with some light guitar plucking . There 's one thing that drags this C.D. down , which is that most of the songs follow the same structure : raging vocals in the verses and singing clearly for the chorus . This structure becomes quite repetitive and predictable , but all in all , I 'm very glad I decided to give this C.D. a shot , because it is much more than typical metalcore . Soilwork deserve to have much success with it , because \" Stabbing the Drama \" makes the band stand out among other modern metal bands . So , if you 've given up on In Flames , and you 're not sure which other metal bands to listen to ( since there are so many ) , I definitely recommend you give \" Stabbing the Drama \" a shot .","summary":"Give \"Stabbing\" a shot!","unixReviewTime":1126137600,"image":null}

I 've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork ( this was before this particular album 's release ) , and I knew they were ( supposedly ) melodic death metal , and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I 've give them a shot , but I waited for the release of this album , which I had seen advertised , before I actually purchased anything , as I wanted to get this first . That worked with Dark Tranquillity ( \" Character \" is a jaw - dropping album ) , but maybe I should 've started with an older release with Soilwork . After all the rave reviews I 've seen of their past albums , and simply their label of melodic death , I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album . I really did n't get it . While I 'm not saying that Soilwork does n't have talent , I 'm just saying that if they do have it , they 're not showing it as much as they should be on this record . The songwriting is bland as can be , like a pop rock record : most , if not all , of the songs are in intro riff , verse , chorus , verse , chorus , bridge , chorus formula ( with a few exceptions ) , and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired , not at all melodic death - like . Well , at this point I realize Soilwork , at least on this record , is n't really a melodic death band anymore . While In Flames abandoned their classic melo - death sound long ago , I still believe that they make great , though less complicated and though - provoking , music , \" Soundtrack to Your Escape \" being one of my favorite albums of 2004 . But it just does n't work with Soilwork . I honestly ca n't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else . Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice , but it bores me , it just seems too much like something you 'd hear on a commercial radio rock album . And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal , but Speed 's voice really just does n't do anything for me . He sings on the majority of the album , but he 'll also scream every now and then , but I do n't see anything special in that either . The main problem with this album is it 's just too predictable , too dull , too uninspired , too generic , and way too simple . The album has some catchy tracks ( the choruses to \" Weapon of Vanity \" and \" Nerve \" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them ) , they just do n't stand out too much . If you 're gon na be a metal band , you got ta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you 've got , and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with , you 've really got ta give it all you got . Maybe I 'm just judging too hard , but I 've given this album time to see if it grew on me , and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it . But since I 've heard so many good things about their past releases , I 'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future , because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the ` Fest .","summary":"Bad First Impression From Soilwork","unixReviewTime":1116374400,"image":null}

Having a limited budget , I have owned an MP3 player for fifteen months now . One of the drawbacks has been figuring out a way to load my I - Tunes to my favorite personal music device . With C.D. 's it 's a breeze , but what about those times when you do n't want to commit to an entire album , but go for the single essentials ? Amazon offers a solution with downloaded music that can be formatted for I - Pods AND MP3 players . Happily , I 've been in pop music bliss as I hear some of my favorite songs come in MP3 player clarity from their downloads . Enticed by a Metamorpho review , I decided to head down memory lane and pick up a jazzy and formidable piece of rock music . \" The Wanderer \" gets my vote as the best Dion song , and , as I refuse to contradict the merits of Meta 's illuminating review , I can still wait for tomorrow to pick up the other nuggets I 've sampled of his on Amazon when I get extra greenbacks . Not to date myself , but it is quite a blessing to discover the glory of music in different phases :   a clock radio ( childhood ) , a radio tape - recorder ( puberty ) to stereo and Walkman ( college ) , and now the splendor and clarity of MP3 player resonance and selection . ( For the uninitiated , TAKE NOTE :   Write down the directions as you initiate your downloading capabilities from Amazon . Download the complimentary starter song they offer ( You may say , \" I did n't order that ! \" Notice it says \" Free Download \" to start your format . Then , play the song from its selected option . ( See if your Windows Media Player   plays it and capture it in your library . ) Then , you can download songs off Amazon . ( I would also advise you to listen to the songs before you download them . Make sure you hear the version of the song you want . [ I almost downloaded a new version of The Crystals ' \" He 's a Rebel , \" a no - no in my book . ) Being somewhere between a newbie and computer whiz kid , I admit it 's a little hard to start on Amazon . ( I had to pay twice for Cyndi Lauper 's \" All Through the Night \" before I got the hang of it . ) If you write down the directions , it is easy after your first download and capture .

Though the Kings of Convenience 's first album is not \" electronic \" in the strictest sense ( or in any sense ) , there 's still no denying the utter beauty of this album . The first track on the album , \" Winning a Battle , Losing the War , \" is my favorite , full of shimmering guitars and pensive lyrics ; the track does n't explodes as much as it blossoms right at the end . \" Singing Softly to Me \" throws in some trumpet to emphasize the call - and - response of the song , while \" I Do n't Know What I Can Save You From \" adds a mournful cello towards the end , as if underlining the futility of the situation . The haunting melodies and the powerful lyrics get under your skin and stick in your head . An underlying melancholy lies at the heart of some of the outstanding tracks like \" The Weight of My Words , \" \" Little Kids , \" and the powerful closing tracks , \" The Passenger \" and \" Parallel Lines . \" The album titles says it all : QUIET IS THE NEW LOUD .","summary":"Kings Of Convenience - Quiet Is The New Loud","unixReviewTime":1298505600,"image":null}

Cross","reviewText":"Though \" Quiet Is The New Loud \" lacks a hit like \" I 'd Rather Dance With You \" from their newest album \" Riot On An Empty Street \" , every song here is wonderfully mellow and good enough to make it a better album overall ( that one had some bad tracks ) . Erlend Oye was clearly blessed with one of the most soothing voices in the music business . Not only are the vocals great , but the lyrics are also very interesting , even if they lack catchiness . That 's not really what this album 's about anyway ; it 's about relaxing . The instrumentation is also pretty simple - it 's basically just acoustic guitars and drums , but they 're wonderful here - they perfectly encapsulate the mood . \" Failure \" and \" I Do n't Know What I Can Save You From \" may be the standout tracks , but , really , they 're all wonderful . They may not be breaking any new ground here , but they do n't really have to - you 're going to love it anyway . Practically any music fan will love this , and for that it definitely earns \" 5 \" stars . You 'll never get tired of listening to this ! This is highly recommended !

Natalie Cole knew that dear feeling , not just with the death of her beloved father , the great Nat King Cole , but also in herself , with her saddened passing New Year 's Eve in 2015 . She had showcased a brilliant and beautiful bravado of songs that really have with stood the test of time , on her own and healing through the soul of jazz and R&B soul overall . When I have thought of Natalie Cole , I think of her deepest songs that really showed all sides from pop and R&B like Snowfall In The Sahara , Live For Your Love and the dearest ballad of them all , Unforgettable . The song which Nat King Cole recorded on his own was one thing , but when Natalie did it in 1991 , it really became timeless beyond what words could ever expect . It is just one of those duets that really drives you at the heartstrings so deep , you 'll forget what cheap music of today really is .

I suspect many , many , many men know it only as one of the best songs from Gran Turismo 3 . That 's where I heard it and it brings back such happy memories of the last good Gran Turismo game . That aside this is a fast , guitar and drum heavy song with a cracking music video to go with it and one of the cooles tdrummers ever . Definitely a song to keep . So , why the four stars ? Well the version I downloaded from AMazon was so quiet it could barely be heard played over my computer speakers and when played on my X7 \/ Sennheiser portable music set up I thought I 'd missed it .

As per the songfacts website , \" Rebel Yell \" is basically about a one night stand that is very pleasurable that the lover ends up expressing that they want more . This is also made clear with the following lyrics : In the midnight hour she cried- \" more , more , more \" \n With a rebel yell she cried- \" more , more , more \" \n In the midniight hour babe- \" more , more , more \" \n With a rebel yell- \" more , more , more \" \n More , more , more . Obviously , there is more to this gem of a song . Billy Idol really puts alot of his spirit into the song in such an excellent fashion that it is almost like he is telling a very entertaining story that he is simultaneously singing . I admit that I first heard this song when I was a teenager , and I currently still love listening to this song . The guitar riffs and his fantastic singing blend well together with this song to make it a musical track that is fun to listen to multiple times in a row . \" Rebel Yell \" is also another song to put in a love \/ lust playlist and\/or 80 's classic song playlist","summary":"Steamy Yell","unixReviewTime":1297814400,"image":null}

The 90 's showed he had a really good tune with knowing how to craft good songs like Fly Away and Thinking Of You for his mother Roxie whom died of cancer in 1995 . But he also showed that he was able to do well with cover songs as well . The song feels just as driven today as when Lenny recorded it over a decade ago . While he has n't reclaimed his 90 's glory , Lenny still is making music out there . Hopefully , when his next work comes out , he can do another cover song like this one .","summary":"Kravitz's Woman","unixReviewTime":1336694400,"image":null}

It is also one of a dozen of Bing 's first STEREO Christmas songs , and it sounds great . I enjoy Bing 's version of this song better than any other artist , and this song even more than his signature song , \" White Christmas \" . Bing was one of the first two artists to present this song to the public , and he left a great lasting impression of \" Do You Hear What I Hear \" . A couple of other not as popular Bing Crosby Christmas songs to look - up are : \" I Sing Noel \" , \" The Littlest Angel \" , \" And the Bells Rang \" , \" Round and Round the Christmas Tree \" and a duet with Frank Sinatra called \" We Wish You the Merriest \" . Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all .

But i will deny him on this album because he really does not show it to the best of his abilitys on this album . He has a great voice , and he has a nag for writing really good songs . Not to mention he can play the guitar really well , which is very rare amongest most R&B singers these days . But even despite all of his positives this album lands right on the mediocre line . Its not a bad album , but he could have done alot better . The problem i had with this album is that it all sounds the same . I mean there are a few big shining spots like the single \" Crazy \" and the mid tempo track \" Biggest Mistake \" which tell the tale of how Javier lost his woman . But other than those two standout spots and a few select other tracks this album is boring . He stuck with the accoustic guitar to much on this album . All the songs sound like they were made by low end producers and none of the songs really have a groove to them . He is lacking that song that makes you wanna get up and dance . There is none of that here . Its all that neo soul accoustic guitar type of music , which by the way i love , but not when it all sounds the same . To sum it up real short , Javier has the potential to make phenominal music , he could be amongest the Ushers and R. Kellys with a little help and ALOT more promotion . This album debuted at number 86 on the top 200 albums . That s horrible for a R&B artist on a big name recorod label ( Capitol Records ) .

A bunch of the songs did stand out as good or great , but not everyone impressed me like they now do . I had a review up here previously that was pretty harsh on the songs that did n't tickle my fancy upon repeated listening . However , my whole outlook on this CD has changed and the only throwaway thing about this disc is n't even really a track ( see interlude # 1 ) ! Anyway , my favorite songs in order are BIGGEST MISTAKE , OCTOBER SKY , SHE'LL NEVER KNOW , CAN'T HAVE MY HEART and IN YOUR HANDS . The other tracks are just fine but they do n't score between a 4.5 and a 5 . Excellent debut by a perfectly gifted singer - songwriter . There is enough depth and umph here to satisfy the average R&B enthusiast .

If you 're looking for more original songwriting on this album , you wo n't find it but you will find some wonderfully sung tracks like \" Song for Your Tears \" and \" Hey Little Sister \" . Javier also does a good rendition of the jazz standard , \" October Sky \" . Vocally , he is a cross between Eric Benet and Slim from 112 . He has a good chance of staying long in the business if he is promoted right . Actually , this album came out last August , I only saw one video from him ( \" Crazy \" ) , and I 'm sure this album is n't platinum yet , so the future does n't look too good .

I went to pick up Javier 's album to see if there were any more songs like that on there . And the answer is yes . Javier appears to be caught in the group of overlooked singers , as his self - titled debut is a great album full of light soul songs , with a little bit of blues thrown in here and there . If you want to enjoy some other snap - your - fingers style jams like \" Crazy \" , try throwing on \" She Spoke To Me \" or \" Slow Motion \" ( the latter kind of reminds me of \" Do n't You Forget It \" by Glenn Lewis [ another overlooked singer ] ) . Slow songs are also good , as evidenced by my favorite track , \" Biggest Mistake \" , which is what you 'll do if you do n't play this song . The songwriting is a highlight as well . Never before have I heard such well - crafted stories like the bluesy \" October Sky \" and , although slighty sappy , \" If I Never Get To Heaven \" . The former talks about how his girl suddenly changed her ways , while the latter explains what his woman 's love means to him . The fact that Javier had written or co - written all the songs himself especially makes these tracks stand out . Some of the lyrics in \" Beautful U R \" come off a little trite , and \" She 'll Never Know \" is kind of confusing , but those aspects ca n't ruin a great album like this .

I remember reading a review of \" live \" in Kerrang or Metal Hammer , in which the reviewer who gave \" Live \" 5 out of 5 , stated that this was the only time now in AC \/ DC 's career , that he could for see giving the band top marks . How times have changed , with \" Ball Breaker \" , \" Stiff upper lip \" & \" Black Ice \" ( admittedly this album is a little hit & miss , but it will do ) , AC \/ DC 's credibility has gone through the roof , being named checked by everybody as a major influence . Which is why \" River Plate \" is much more than just a nostalgia concert , which is what you would get if it was The Stones or The Who releasing a new live record . The new songs slot in well with the classic tracks(although no songs from \" Ball Breaker \" , or \" Stiff upper .. \" , which is a shame ) & the crowd are on fire , even doing harmonics , which I 've never heard before at an AC \/ DC gig . The band still gives an energetic performance considering their ripe old age . Live albums always work better , when there recorded from one venue , instead of a whole tour , constantly fading in & out after each song , losing momentum . But \" River Plate \" feels like a one off special event , which always makes a live more appearing to listen to . It is interesting that back in the 70 's & 80 's , rock bands would regularly release a live album every 3 - 4 - studio albums , but \" AC \/ DC Live \" was one of the last big selling live albums ( Thanks Kirk Cobain ) . Nowadays it only really Iron Maiden that do live albums , so it a little difficult to judge \" River Plate \" by contemporary standards , but then again AC \/ DC have never concerned themselves with shifting musical fashions . The only nit - pick I have , is that it 's a shame AC \/ DC did n't record the gig in a small club , like The Stones have been doing in 2012 , perhaps that could be the band   next live venture .","summary":"Capturing Master Young in a Bottle","unixReviewTime":1353369600,"image":null}

Like many AC \/ DC fans who collect bootlegs from the band , or have rare live tracks in our collections , it 's going to be hard for AC \/ DC to top a lot of the # 1 fav live versions between 1974 and present . But this album is still great for us collectors , even those who have heard these same set - lists a million times before , with a few of the new songs thrown in the mix , but this album has a lively crowed that may not speak English too well , but they do know how to scream and humm along to the tunes , making them unique crowed interaction versions of AC \/ DC 's classics preformed at River Plate in 2009\/10 ? I wo n't bore you and compare things like \" TNT \" just does n't sound as good as the live version from 198somethign that was eventually included on \" Backtracks \" etc .. but I will say AC \/ DC have still got what it takes to rock your socks off as much as they did a 100 years ago . Kicking off with a great live recording of the new track \" Rock N Roll Train \" and into a classic blazing version of \" Hell ai nt a bad place to be \" and then onto what is possibly there biggest hit to date , \" Back In Black \" and so forth . Some reviewers here said if you have heard AC \/ DC 's previous set lists before , then you have heard it all and they are boring . Well , you will miss out on great new live tracks such as \" Rock N Roll Train \" , \" Big Jack \" , \" War Machine \" and \" Black Ice \" , even tho most of us fans really wished they had preformed other tracks from the Black Ice album like ' spoilin ' for a fight ' and \" she likes rock n roll \" ... and then there is the typical songs of coarse ... but what those guys saying it 's all been the same , it surprises me AC \/ DC did n't take the chance to finally get an official live album version of \" Rock N Roll ai nt Noise Pollution \" down . What really would have been nice would have been a bonus track of \" High Voltage \" included that AC \/ DC subbed in during the Australian and New Zealand tour by popular demand . Just like they included \" Hell ai nt a bad place to be \" only on the Japan special edition of Live ( 1991 ) . Oh well , what can you do ? \n\n Something else that makes this album different to other ones is that this whole tour , AC \/ DC tuned the guitars downwards a step , giving the songs a new spark of life in a same old song , but with a slightly different sound to what you have always heard . It also seems like Brian Johnson speaks his words more clearly , not sure what , maybe he was schooled on it or the effect of living in American now has rubbed off , but you can clearly understand every word he says and is singing , and there is no question by anyone like \" WTF is he saying ? \" not that I ever had trouble understanding him . A few songs spark a little new life to by the way Johnsons sings them , it seems he speaks the words clear and propperlly , and does n't sing them in a slang term cutting off the g from ' ing ' words etc .. I dunno if you care about this or not , but I found it pretty interesting to compare what Brian is doing with the songs now compared to 20 - 30 years ago . Never diss the man , he is the silent rock n roll god at the top that some people slam as not being Bon Scott , but get over it guys , Bon is gone , and Brian has done a great job keeping AC \/ DC at # 1 for all these years ... compare him to Bon if you want , but Brian had been in the band longer , has not disgraced himself , kept Bons memory alive , and despite what you say , he 's a rock n roll god who even on those so called \" bad ac \/ dc albums \" ( not that I think they 're bad at all ) those songs are still better than most other groups greatest hits , so lay off Brian , understand he is the singer now , and STOP comparing him to Bon Scott . Bon was great , sure , Brian is different , but he is too great in other ways and deserves more respect then people always showing up on AC \/ DC 's latest releases and saying \" Bon this , Bon that , Bon would 've \" ... do n't you think Bon is looking down on Brian and smiling at what a fantastic job Brian has done since Bon passed away ? If there is an afterlife , both Bon and Brian will remain with the band , because I am convinced Bon would not say \" thanks for takin over , but i 'll take it from here \" no , you would have two legends in the drivers seats ! Keep on rockin ' \\ .. \/ ,","summary":"Moocharse Gratisiarse AC\/DC","unixReviewTime":1356825600,"image":null}

I love it when he sings the lyrics \" she is anything but typical \" , and the lyrics \" she 's a craze you 'd endorse , she 's a powerful force \" . I personally have learned ways to increase my self - love , and listening to this song is one of the ways I love to do this . I say this because listening to this song helps serve as a fun reminder on why it is important to see the beauty inside of yourself regardless of what is reflected in the outside world . Hearing this song serves as a playful reminder to always work on feeling good from within . \" Simply Irresistible \" is a great song that is like fine wine that gets better with time ( just like his other track \" Addicted to Love \" ) .

It sounds great . This is one of Cher 's signature albums as an artist , as opposed to entertainer . Believe me , I make no hierarchal distinctions between artist and entertainer -- both are needed in society . Cher , the entertainer , has brought me so much pleasure since I was a kid . Cher , the artist , when singing a song like \" These Days , \" or \" Love Hurts , \" bares her soul . What I find curious , still , is that even after Cher returned to Warner Brothers in the late ' 90s for the biggest album of her career , that her four Warner Brothers albums from the 1970s ( including \" Two The Hard Way \" with Gregg Allman ) remained unavailable . In my \" man on the street \" opinion , these albums would have sold quite well if released after \" Believe \" became a blockbuster . Also , let 's not forget the two songs Cher recorded with Phil Spector after her split with Sonny , and her duet with Nilsson , released on Spector \/ WB Records . \" Please do n't confront me with my failures , I 've not forgotten them ... \"","summary":"Enough Already...Release this on CD","unixReviewTime":1307145600,"image":null}

Back in the 70 's she was trying to expell her character gypsy songs - and forage a serious career . She was in somewhat of a dilemma considering her loss of a private life - a public life paired with a clothes horse reputation . It was a long shot to imagine musical crtics to come to her side . This 1975 lp showcases her voice with Jimmy Webbs ' lush orchestrations . The best song here is the wailing \" Just this one time\",an under - rated gem , \n that shows Cher at her most expressive . The last sentence in the song soars to a heighth never heard from the vocalist previously . \" Love Enough \" comes in 2nd with it 's similar fully sung treatment . The lp has several rockers , covers of the rock roster of the day - Clapton , Jackson Brown , Neil Young . .Cher is best on the unfamilliar songs . But like all her 70 's warner cuts this lp is lost to those without a record player . It 's an interesting and curious effort from the pop icon of her generation . She is one shot away from a home run . \"Stars \" is a bit short on being completely an artistic statement . Cher is a wiser singer today , and would probably sing this material even better 30 years later ! Cher has a unique voice , and all her lps have some merit,(though Prisoner and Cherished have very little credibility)this one more than most because of her emotional commitment to the music .","summary":"Stars from the star of them all","unixReviewTime":1193443200,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41MTqaMbbAL._SY88.jpg"]}

I think the problem why this CD \n was not successful was because Cher was coming off her TV show and her MCA recordings . For this CD   Cher sings 9 songs   penned by 9 \n male songwriter 's and 1 by   female songwriter Janis Ian ( Stars )   the   album was   produced by Jimmy Webb . This album is   recorded , produced , \n and sung by Cher   just   beautifully . Her version of \" These   Days \" by Jackson Browne is amazing . Every song on this CD fits perfectly . This is Cher as a mature , serious singer with   the ability to do these songs as they should be . \" Just this one time \" is the best thing \n Cher has ever recorded the range of her singing this song is down right perfection . We all   know   Cher   is a great actress and i think \n  this comes out in her singing this songs with such emotion and feeling . If you read the reviews you will see all Cher 's fans love this \n CD . We need Cher to do a complete album with songs recorded where great song   writer 's give her the chance to sing the songs \n her way . The   dance able   releases by Cher were great for it 's time but now Cher let 's get back to a great rock , ballad release .   .","summary":"CHER'S BEST ALBUM RELEASED  IN CD","unixReviewTime":1504396800,"image":null}

The tradional Christmas music is fun , heart warming . A couple of weeks ago I heard the song A Baby Changes Everything by Faith Hill , introduced by a friend . That song put a whole sense of feeling about life . Though it is about baby Jesus , but it touched my life about a baby that was born 23 years ago to me . When I first heard it I was crying . Tonight Jamie who sings at the Hard Rock Lobby Bar in Tampa sang a song called   Grown -up Christmas List- I honestly have never heard this song before and I simply started crying , tears were flowing . Though it has been recorded by such very talented artist as Amy Grant , Kelly Clarkson , Natalie Cole- David Foster , Clay Aiken and Michael Buble . I have always had people in my life , a friend , my family , people who I meet . As I was crying the shock of reality came over me when I realized their are people in this world who do not have family , a friend , neighbor to talk to . These are the people who are HOMELESS . I am a person who loves to give than   recieve , but when its time to see Santa you bet that I will wish for a new friend for Christmas and it will be on the top of my list . This world is scary these days with everyone fighting , struggling during these hard times , jobless , finacial difficulty and no peace in the world .

Sherwin","reviewText":"This 1963 album is one of the best examples of flawless bossa nova music to date . Stan Getz playing the saxophone , Joao Gilberto on guitar and Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano blend simultaneously into a uniquely talented trio of musicians as their hearts and minds create one exquisite song after another . As another reviewer correctly notes , most of the songs on this CD were written by Antonio Carlos Jobim . He remains one of the most gifted musicians and composers to this day . I also especially liked Astrud Gilberto 's singing in \" The Girl From Ipanema \" and \" Corcovado ( Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars ) . \" Yes , Astrud sometimes sang flat ; but it is no matter here . It works beautifully to have her singing along with the music . Another plus about this CD is the addition of two tracks that were not available on the original LP release : the 45 rpm issues of \" The Girl From Ipanema \" and \" Corcovado ( Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars . ) I really liked comparing the shorter 45 rpm versions to the original , longer versions of both songs . The sound quality was very good but not quite perfect . There is a slight hissing in the background especially when I hear the saxophone being played solo by Getz . I looked in the liner notes and they do mention that there was some \" tape delamination \" on track five ( \" Corcovado \" ) and that \" some of the master takes have been faded longer or later than they were on the original LP issue . \" I wonder if this had anything to do with what I heard . In addition , the liner notes also offer a great essay by Doug Ramsey as well as the original liner notes for the LP . There are beautiful photos of Getz , Gilberto and Astrud . This is a wonderful album to relax with or to play while you entertain company for dinner . The experience is sophisticated stylishness ! The fact that most of the lyrics are in Portuguese is not a concern for those who do not understand the language ; the music is so beautiful and the lyrics are so poetic anyway that the overall listening experience is memorable . Not only is this music timeless , it is so well performed with each and every subtle nuance that it possesses a universal appeal decades after its ' release . Highly recommended for bossa nova fans , fans of great Latin music and people who crave international music .","summary":"Timeless chic !!!","unixReviewTime":1160179200,"image":null}

The remastering job is quite good and so the sound quality is decent . We also get both the English and Japanese lyrics thrown in as an insert . The cardboard packaging which is a replica of the original vinyl sleeve is also a work of art . While the strength of \" Girl From Ipanema \" alone would carry this album , we also get \" So Danco Samba \" and a version of \" Desafinado \" here which is good but not as great as the brilliant version with that unforgetable Getz solo on the \" Jazz Samba \" album which although not as commercially successful as this album , is still overall the stronger album . Still , there is no denying the great impact this album has had on jazz and on bringing the whole samba genre onto the world map that this is still essential listening for fans of jazz and indeed for any fan of music in general .

They do n't capture all the sound that was in the original vinyl recordings . 44k and 2 to the 14th power was NOT enough samples ( bits ) . Like looking at an old newspaper picture made out of large dots , it 's not like a photo . Like a primitive digital print without enough pixels . Poor resolution . With 4 times as many time slices ( increments ) in the x direction and 2 to the 8th power , 256 more bits ( increments ) in the Y direction , this SACD is the only format which really captures the sound of the original LP or master tape . You can not hear the difference between this and the LP . It 's the real thing . If you thought CD 's sound harsh , or bass - thin , not like a concert , well , you were right ! Beyond that , this album is the second best selling Jazz album of all time , behind Miles Davis \" Kind of Blue \" . A timeless classic of the early sixties . \" The Girl From Ipanema \" was in the top ten songs on the Rock , Pop and Jazz Billboard charts for over a year in the ' 63-'64 time frame . Yeah it 's really that good ! Hear Stan the Man effortlessly pour out his soul in the bridge of \" Corcovado \" , for example . As a personal note , this was the first Jazz LP I ever bought , as a clarinet and sax player myself , I could n't believe how good Stan Getz tone was .

Hamlow","reviewText":"The 1964 winner for Best Album was this mellow but spright cool jazz album that pushed Latin bossa nova and samba rhythms on the map . With a lineup that included Joao Gilberto on guitar and vocals , Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano , Tommy Williams on bass , Milton Banana on drums , and on the two most memorable songs , Joao 's wife Astrud . However , the driving force behind this was tenor saxophonist Stan Getz , and his straight - tone , controlled - vibrato sound . The album starts appropriately enough with the Grammy winner for best song , \" The Girl From Ipanema \" . This is the full 5:22 version that begins with Joao Gilberto singing in Portuguese . Then comes that soft voice and those familiar lyrics :   \" Tall and tan and young and lonely \/ The girl from Ipanema goes walking \/ Well , the thing that makes me go \" haaa \" here is Astrud Gilberto 's voice . There is a 45 rpm version of this classic , the 2:46 single edit of just Astrud singing , included later . I must confess that I first heard a parody of this song , Bob River 's \" The Girl With Emphysema \" , and then sought hard to find out the original version , which led me to this album . \" Corcovado ( Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars ) \" is the other song featuring Astrud Gilberto . In the full 4:14 version , we have Joao doing Portuguese lyrics , as he did in the full version of \" Ipanema . \" There is a dreamy quality about this song , particularly when Astrud sings \" Quiet nights and quiet dreams \/ Quiet walks by quiet streams \/ And the window lookin ' on the mountains and the sea how lovely . \" And Getz 's sax really enhances that exoticness as does Jobim 's piano . There is a 2:21 45 rpm issue included here as well . As for the rest of the songs , Getz 's rich saxophone provides the rich qualities that make this a winner , particularly his solo on \" So Danso Samba \" with its \" vai vai vai vai vai \" refrain by Joao Gilberto . The song title means \" I Only Dance Samba \" , as opposed to calypso , the twist , and the cha - cha that were sweeping the country 's dance floors in the 1960 's . And Joao Gilberto 's soft vocals complement the soft qualities of the other instrumentalists . Only complaint :   Astrud should 've been featured on more songs .","summary":"Tall and tan and young and lonely...","unixReviewTime":1063843200,"image":null}

But actually , in Brazil , the Bossa Nova fever never did quite cool off and in ' 72 , when I was visiting family there , this album was still trotted out proudly at every gathering . Not only is this album a great party CD for \" retro \" parties , relaxed evenings or just sitting at home and relaxing , but it introduces you to the greats of Brazilian music . Oh , there is a whole lot more great Brazilian music than just this , but this album is surely the place to start . ( By the way , if you have insomnia , this can be quite soothing .

Add to that the rythmn section of Jobim on piano , Milton Banana on drums and Tommy Williams on bass , and you have an album that will go down in history , and will never wear thin .

An Irish band formed in Dublin and fronted by an Irish black man in \n shiny leather pants . The members of the band also spanned the Irish Catholic and Protestant \n communities . Quite something for 1969 . The song \" Jailbreak \" , was an international hit , along with \" The Boys Are Back In Town \" . These \n songs are rotated regularly on hard rock and classic radio stations today and for good reason . \" Jailbreak \" , features , like a lot of other of Thin Lizzy 's songs , twin lead guitars . Superb guitar \n work from both guitarists and a signature of the band giving Thin Lizzy a distinctive edge over \n other bands . \" Jailbreak \" was on the album by the same name , and was their sixth release . Working class sentimentality and total brazenness is \n how this song will speak to you . There \n is no doubt that when you hear that opening chord and subsequent riff you are hearing some \n cool rockin ' and rollin ' . The lyric riff is rather staccato and helps provide an immediate tension \n within the song . The release comes from the repetitive refrain , \" The boys are back in town \" , as it is more fluid \n and harmonic . There is a nice back and forth motion between the lyrics and the refrain each \n time . The guitar fills and single leads are done perfectly as they accent each set of lyrics and \n help transition from the refrain back to the lyric . This is a nicely written song . Listening to this song always makes me want to learn it . It is also the kind of song that inspires \n people to pick up the guitar or at the least play air guitar . Great tone . Twin leads . Cool lyrics . All make for a classic song that belongs on your turntable , or CD player , or whatever . Go ahead , break out now ...","summary":"Break Out!:  Jailbreak by Thin Lizzy","unixReviewTime":1385942400,"image":null}

A cigarette , a cup of coffee , maybe some fries with brown gravy , and \" She 's Got You . \" It 's something you ca n't recreate .

Many have attempted to copy Patsy   Cline 's vocal range or stylistic ticks ; Reba McEntire , k.d . lang and Mandy   Barnett being only among the more successful . But something about ballads   brought out the pain and emotional desolation in Cline 's voice that few   C&W singers then or now could match . Listen to her sing the rather   trite line \" I 've been so wrong for so long , \" and hear the sorrow ,   anger and regret scribbled into her delivery . Hear her line , \" You   do n't love me , it 's plain , \" and tears nearly well up as if you 're   hearing this with her for the first time . Compare her reading of the line ,   \" I 've got your memory , or has it got me ? \" with Jimmy Buffett 's   sloppy , careless version on \" Fruitcakes , \" and you 'll see who is   the better musical caretaker . Nearly every song on the LP fits that   model , as Cline and her stellar support keep the spirit , if not letter , of   what country music is and should be to its fans . Everyone who enjoys   country music or female singers in general should own a copy of this album .","summary":"Crown Jewels of Country Music","unixReviewTime":956016000,"image":null}

There 's sooooo ... much to like in this album it 's amazing . The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy -- making you want to ( & will if no one 's around ) sing along . The lyrics are fine , meaningful , & personally touching -- about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world , while people are still people with hopes , feelings , needs , desires , & all the rest of what makes people human . The lead singer , Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice ( though a bit twangy in style ) . She grabs you quickly for a wild ride -- immersing the listener in the musical story she 's telling . I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More ( on the TV show Vegas of all place ) . Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show -- winning awards as they so deserve . The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too -- from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring . Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles . Yes , the style is their own mixture of influences -- the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds , which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive . And , the trio wrote all the songs on the CD -- with Hall the primary author ( solo writer on one of them ) . How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man ? I wonder if they are unique ? Well , they are unique even if not in that respect -- how many bands include a mandolin ? . Of course , country purists may not be happy with them , but the vast majority of listeners ARE . This has become one of my favorite albums , at the speed of sound . IMHO , it 's terrific .","summary":"Breaking the sound barrier","unixReviewTime":1148774400,"image":null}

Grindle","reviewText":"During the mid to late 70 's Robert Palmer was far from the household name he became during the mid 80 's . At the same time at this point in the 70 's one of the more fasionable things for a lot of white rock musicians was to record in the Crescent City with many of the local musicians from Dr. John , Allen Toussaint , Little Feat and The Meters . None of these projects were bad at all but strangly enough many of them were one or two off genre excersises that the said artist(s ) never again returned to . This was not one of those efforts . Throughout even the 80 's the core of Robert Palmers music was always soul and funk so it was only fitting he would make his first solo album in New Orleans with of course all the best people in town on board . Two of the most remarkable things about this are related to Palmer himself . He wrote or co - wrote almost all the music on this album and had a very keen understanding of how to create great funk music , from the honeyed nuances ( as opposed to loud bellowing ) of his vocal style . Now he does a great job for sure in interpreting Big Easy styled funk here from the rolling clavinets on Allen Toussaint 's title track and \" From A Whisper To A Scream \" which Palmer also delivers with his great soulful understatement . There 's more of an obvious Mardi Gras - style hump to the grooves of Lowell George 's \" Sailin ' Shoes \" and \" Blackmail \" but some of the most impressive songs on the album are the ones Palmer wrote himself . \" Hey Julia \" is an excellent song - a great rhythm box percussion led have jive \/ funk sort of groove with a really deep Carribean rhythm under the service;not so obvious it 's emmediately detectable but it 's there if you recognize it . \" Get Close \" and \" How Much Fun \" both illustrate an understanding of the elegance of funk and elegance is a quality that Palmer himself always possessed very strong . Of course for a SERIOUS represenation of that there 's the twelve minute closer \" Through It All There 's You \" where Palmer really works a hardcore jam to death with his wonderfully jazzily phrased licks and how the song builds up and down from a full band sound back to it 's lower key tones from the beginning . It was only fitting that his 70 's sound was built very strongly on the type of music presented on this album and it 's a credit to his integrity that maintained a strong connection to this particular element of his sound throughout his career as opposed to totally disgarding them when they were no longer trendy in mass culture .","summary":"The Very Funky Beginnings Of Robert Palmer","unixReviewTime":1267833600,"image":null}

The keyboard parts stand out very much and the drumming is very funky . The best song by far is the title track . What a cool groove . Outside is another strong track . Whereas I like Sailing Shoes , it just does not compare to the Little Feat version . Robert Palmer just can not compare to Lowell George on this track . AS a matter of fact , Robert Palmers vocals are erratic on this CD . He 's very good on the title track , Outside and decent on a couple of others . However , that last song , Throught It All With You , Mr. Palmer just sounds like he is grunting and does not rise above the solid backing unit . Also many of the songs do not have solid hooks . Robert Palmer would go on to record more solid hook driven songs later in his career . On this CD , it is very hit and miss . Basically the style is good but the substance is not there full time yet .","summary":"Finding His Voice","unixReviewTime":1213488000,"image":null}

With members of The Meters and Little Feat backing him , this album is really tight . It would have been quite something to see these guys live . The material is a mixture of originals and two classics by the great New Orleans musician and producer Allen Toussaint . These are the title track and \" From a Whisper to a Scream \" . Palmers vocals are as smooth as you would expect and unlike much material from the early 70 's this does n't date . This album and Pressure Drop ( Palmers 2nd I believe ) are both well worth getting . Robert Palmer changed styles throughout his career but never matched these two early classics .","summary":"Fabulous funk","unixReviewTime":1191024000,"image":null}

With that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this , or . I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool , but make little sense when it comes to music . Music is a personal thing . It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself . Granted it is only a 30 second sample , but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music , or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version . If you want to listen to a sample , simply hover over the track you are interested in , and press the play button . While a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon 's free songs , I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one . That s right ... Amazon has a FREEBIE \/ CHEAP section with both songs AND albums . A great way to construct an entire music library , and admittedly , the way I obtained most of my own music . But quite honestly , a wonderful way to explore new music , too . In fact , some of the songs that I ve obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band , and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a ( more substantial ) price tag . Anyway ... enough of my rambling . This album is great ! At the very least , give it a 30 - second listen ? \n\n And do n't forget , if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals ( 69 cent songs , $ 5 albums ! ) , you can always check here \n\n FREE MUSIC : \n From Amazon Home page -- > Departments ( drop down menu ) -- > Digital and Prime Music -->Deals -- > Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price ( on left side of screen )","summary":"i <3 Skynyrd","unixReviewTime":1474243200,"image":null}

I do not mean any disrespect AT ALL . This is NOT sarcasm : People that are in one of the greatest bands ever , should NOT get near a plane ! Seeing them in the sky is as close as you should get ... ever . The older VanZandt brother and a couple of other band members and crew died in a crash . It seems very odd to me that so many great musicians lost their lives jetting around . These guys lived they 're lives just like the moral of this song . They did not play for fame and fortune . They never let themselves be changed one bit when all the other bands were going \" hair band . \" They were good ol' boys from Alabama that played songs that had a certain timeless and profound pride in being just that : good folks . Skynyrd touched so many of us ( now middle aged ) people when WE were the future . It was our turn to run the world , and being humble , respectful , and doing the right thing was important . Now that we 've retired , the world is way too small , and common courtesy seems but a distant memory . Their first song , to the last , was straight up American . The whole Rock Music world mourned when that plane went down . The other members went back home and would have never played again . Those guys knew that the older brother , Johnny , I believe ( God forgive me if I 've got the two mixed up ) would want them to try to show the world what was being lost and try to get people to just slow down , realise what is truly important in life ; forget greed , be kind and respectful , and just live , simple . Because , \" if you do , you will be satisfied . \" Fans of all different kind of music came to see a band that was not really a band any more . All these people came to listen and give their respects . Skynyrd toured one more time . The younger VanZandt brother finally put his grief away for long enough to tour one more time . The whole venue was packed . The younger brother wore a flat brimmed hat just like his older brother used to . He stepped up to the mic and did something he swore not to do ... it just hurt too bad : He sang his brothers songs . They played , I swear it was like Jonny was there . Freebird was last song of course ....","summary":"FIRST, LET ME BE COMPLETELY CLEAR...","unixReviewTime":1471305600,"image":null}

Catch A Fire and this , Burnin ' are sort of like a ying , and yang thing , not to sound too cliche . Catch A Fire seems to be more about peace and togetherness while Burnin ' is the opposite spectrum , more empowering , and more about overcoming and getting yours . Marley was always an activist through his lyrics , you could say he was to reggae what Johnny Cash was to country as far as civil justice and spirituality is concerned . Containing two of the groups biggest hits , the great opener ' Get Up , Stand Up ' and the immortal ' I Shot The Sheriff ' which is far better then the Clapton cover , and also shows the vicious side of Marleys lyrics . But it 's ' Rasta Man Chant ' ' Small Axe ' ' Pass It On ' and the vehement ' Burnin And Lootin ' that make this album a classic . The new release of the album contains three bonus tracks . ' Reincarnated Souls ' being the best , and one that would have perfectly complimented the original album . The other two being less impressive but still great , ' No Symphony ' and the chilling ' The Oppressed Song . ' After Burin ' Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh would both leave to form solo projects , Tosh being the most successful of the two . His album Legalize It is another classic . The departure of those two members would forever change the sound of the band . They would aim for a more commercial appeal while that is n't a bad thing it did seem to loose something . Though I did enjoy the later background vocals they were not as good as the first two albums , and neither was the musicianship which is something Burnin ' has an amazing amount of . Burnin ' is an album which I would recommend to anyone who is interested in more then Bob Marley & The Wailers hits .","summary":"Burnin'","unixReviewTime":1206748800,"image":null}

The song made # 12 on the American charts and # 8 on the \n British charts . Rolling Stone Magazine , in 2004 , put this song at # 499 in the top   500 greatest songs \n of all time . In 2005 , Q magazine place it at # 38 on its list of 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks . Yes , it should \n be . Great almost - poetic lyrics by Phil Lynott , hitting his peak , and dynamite intertwined guitar \n leads , all done with a working man 's sensibility . The twin guitar leads were essentially a trademark of \n Thin Lizzy , after 1975 , and helped the band stand apart from the rest of the rock ' n ' roll pack . The lead \n and rhythm guitar   playing uses very sharp crisp chords that pulsate and propel the song . Wait for the \n sparse twin guitar lead as the rest of the band lays back ; then the singer comes back in as the twin \n leads repeat their riff underscoring the lyrics and subsequently the Boys bravado . The song was released in 1976 and featured a black Irish lead singer \/ bass player and a mixed band of \n Protestant and Catholic musicians . Talk about cross cultural influences , this band was it . Amazingly \n the song was used at the 2012 Republican Convention to introduce the Vice - Presidential candidate to \n the stage . Again , the Republicans used a song unauthorized ( Reagan and \" Born In The USA \" ) and was \n criticized for its use . This was objected to by the Lynott family citing that Lynott would have objected \n to the anti - gay policies of the party and never let them use it for political purposes . Nonetheless , this song sounds immediate no matter how many times it is played . This is why it has been \n used in countless movies , television commercials and sporting events .

So I have no idea how Reba McEntire 's version compares to Lawrence 's . Normally I prefer the original version of a song over a remake ( unless it 's a Weird Al \" remake \" ) , and I suppose one of these days I should look up the Lawrence version as a comparison \/ contrast to McEntire 's . But as of now , this version of \" The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia \" is one of my favorite songs of all time . It 's a dark ballad with a complex but compelling storyline , and a surprisingly shocking ending . The song is played in an eerie , almost menacing key , quite befitting the building dread of the story as a man tries to track down his unfaithful wife 's lover and gets far more trouble than he bargained for in the process . The piano and electric guitar track mesh well , and the drum track is appropriately intense without overpowering the song . well -- she does n't scream or holler , but lets the lyrics convey the song 's emotions on their own . This song could easily have played out as melodramatic in the hands of another singer , but Reba does n't overdo it , and so the song hits the right balance . By now I 'm sure the song 's twist ending is well - known , but it can still be shocking to first - time listeners . I wo n't spoil it further . One of Reba 's best songs , and one of the best country songs I 've heard . If you do n't mind your music dark and with a complex storyline , give this a listen .","summary":"Dark and complex ballad is still a great and emotional listen","unixReviewTime":1410912000,"image":null}

Those of you in the know , know what i 'm talking about ..... trying to explain that Janet did have two albums prior to Control . For some reason people [ among them Janet ] have been trying to avoid this album 's existence and i for the life of me do n't know why , sure it does n't have all the \" attitude \" of a Control or a Rhythm Nation but this was 1982 four years before Control and music was different then . To compare this to Control or \" rhythm \" is unfair , first off as i stated before music WAS different then , secondly , even tho the \" Minneapolis Sound \" was in full swing , it was done by grown folks like Prince , The Time , Vanity 6 among others , Janet was a 16 year old girl still living under the jackson 's Compound and it was not until 1984 's Dream Street that she started showing signs of rebel . I 'm giving this album five stars because the music is good on here and Janet was in her purest form , just an r&b \/ pop teen singer doing her thing . For those of you who care ... there 's a longer version of \" say you do \" on this album and it 's better than the one that appeared on the original release , in my opinion also i have a new found fondness for the song \" forever yours \" and i always loved \" young love ' that was my jam !

Very early 80s R&B , disco , Jacksons , Off the Wall sounds .

I 'd never even heard the word used before . It was n't in any of my dictionaries and my computer refused to recognise it as a proper word . Maybe Michael Brecker made the word up ? I love the idea though . Brecker basically does big band and playing with his fourteen cohorts here gives him the opportunity to paint a canvas of very complex textures upon which to play his beautiful tenor sax solos . The whole ensemble works well but , apart from the bandleader of course , I have a personal fondness on here for Alex Sasha Sipiagin on trumpet , Adam Rogers on guitar and the drummer , Antonio Sanchez ( now of The Pat Metheny Group ) . My favourite songs include \" Broadband \" ( which is the opener on my CD and not \" Loxodrome \" as mentioned in the product overview soundclips ) , \" Night Jasmine \" , \" Scylla \" and \" Never Alone \" . Gil Goldstein does a great job co - arranging with Brecker and doing the overall orchestration . I 'll always wonder though , if I 'd have liked the album more if Vince Mendoza had done it ? Still . Great stuff . Anyone who likes this will probably also like some of the big band stuff Bob Mintzer ( the horn man with Yellowjackets ) did back in the 90s .

I was used to hearing Brecker in your average funk - fusion ( a bit smoother than I like sometimes ) , and straight - ahead blowing sessions , so this one really took me by surprise . Here he assembled a unique combination of instruments - among them strings , guitar and a somewhat unique ( including French horn and Baritone ) brass section - which gives the music a kind of heft and richness that is just a joy to hear . The arrangements are great - interesting horn \/ string lines underneath Brecker 's usual masterful and fiery soloing . My faves are \" Night Jessamine \" , and \" Modus Operandi \" which are two of the grooviest and funkinest jazz songs I 've heard in quite a while . The only tiny complaint I have is that Brecker is virtually the only soloist . He gives bassist Pattituci a few spots , as well as a couple for the guitarist and trumpeter , but most of the time it is him wailing on and on . Mind you , he is an awesome soloist , I love his playing , but sometimes you need to break it up a bit and let the other guys shine for a while , too - that is what Jazz is about , individual expression , while still serving the collective . Not even the great Coltrane had a problem letting Eric Dolphy , Don Cherry , or his own McCoy Tyner shine for a while . But , aside from that , this is a superb effort from one of the most important saxophonists since Coltrane .","summary":"A Delightful Surprise from the Great Brecker","unixReviewTime":1088380800,"image":null}

The 2003 rap song of the year \" In Da Club \" was overrated to me , but it was a decent track at best . The second single \" 21 ? 's \" I hated because of it 's pop style and lack luster beat that it carries . The third single \" Many Men \" was one of my favorite tracks that was dedicated to more violence . The fourth single \" P.I.M.P. \" was a medicore song about pimping on the origonal version , although the remix that features Snoop Dogg and G - Unit that does n't appear on here is better . The rest of the tracks range from decent to good that will make your head nod , some I enjoyed and some that I hated . \" Patiently Waiting \" featuring Eminem is possibly one of the best songs on the album , as both of them have above average verses . The track \" If I Ca n't \" has a fast paced piano beat , that makes the song gangsta and listenable . \" What Up Gangsta \" will have little kids thinking they 're hardcore repeating that song , because of it 's catchy hook . 50 Cent 's slurred vocals could get a liitle annoying at some parts of the CD , because he was shot in the jaw when he took those nine bullets . Production is done by Dr. Dre , Eminem , and more . It sold about 9 million copies , so I 'm pretty sure that most rap and alternative listener has at least taken a listen .

I thought since he was working with Dr. Dre that maybe Dre had picked up on someone that had some talent and could give us a solid hip - hop artist . I was dead wrong . WHen this CD was first released , I did n't think it was terrible , but the more it got overplayed , and the more nosense I heard about 50 , the less appealing the CD became to me . It is apparent that 50 was a creation of some money hungry record label that probely got ahold of Dre ( thank Interscope Records ) and asked him if he could sign on with him and be part of his Aftermath label . What a joke , not only is 50 probely the least think from a ganster , he is a total sell out . I love how he hangs in Beverly Hills Spa 's and Star Magazine parties . Sure he is a ganasta alright . Does anyone really believe that this guy was shot 9 times . I bet you his real name is Erkel and he proebely grew up some posh suburban community and got stuffed into lockers in high - school . Shame on you Dre for putting this dope on your record label , and shame on Interscope for pressuring you into signing him . NO , but I am more then 99.9 % sure that this is how it went down . Everyone do 50 and favor and boycott his next CD , then maybe his can Get Poor and Die Penniless .","summary":"wasnt that bad until.......","unixReviewTime":1138924800,"image":null}

Highsmith","reviewText":"When I originally heard \" How To Rob \" from the \" In Too Deep \" soundtrack , I liked the song and the clever wordplay involved , but I wondered if 50 Cent had enough to carry a whole album . Rappers like Jay Z , Ghostface Killah , Sticky Fingaz from Onyx and others were n't too pleased with what 50 had to say and they came out with their own things to say about the song . Just as 50 was about to record his 1st single from \" Power Of The Dollar \" , \" Thug Love \" w \/ Destiny 's Child , 50 was shot multiple times . After he recovered , 50 called his label and they acted as if 50 had never even existed . To reestablish himelf , 50 hit the mixtape circuit and would appear on various mixtapes freestyling or with songs that were supposed to appear on \" Power Of The Dollar \" . In early 2002 , Full Clip Records released \" Guess Who 's Back \" which included underground songs and freestyles that included 50 , G Unit , Nas , Nature , The Bravehearts and Bun B of UGK on different tracks . Shortly after that , 50 Cent & G Unit released several mixed Cds and the buzz definitely had been recreated . Eminem heard \" Guess Who 's Back \" after he completed \" The Eminem Show \" and that was the beginning of 50 Cent being signed to Eminem 's Shady Records . 50 Cent 's popular mix tape track , \" Wanksta \" appeared on Eminem 's \" 8 Mile \" soundtrack , as well as ,   \" Places To Go \" and \" Love Me \" which was   a collaboration with Eminem , 50 Cent and Obie Trice . These songs and the mixed CDs were enough to keep 50 out in the streets until his highly anticipated CD , \" Get Rich Or Die Trying \" , was released . When \" In Da Club \" was released to radio and started appearing on MTV and BET , 50 's CD was definitely going to be in demand . The song would propel \" Get Rich Or Die Trying \" with over 800,000 units sold in the first four days of its release . The CD gets off a nice start with \" What 's Up Gangsta \" . Fans of 50 's street releases will definitely like this track . Next up is \" Patiently Waiting \" as Eminem and 50 collaborate on the Eminem produced track . 50 and Eminem rip the track to shreds . On \" Many Men ( Wish Death ) \" , 50 speaks about how after being shot multiple times , how he reflects on things and how your enemies and people that are jealous of you are always plotting behind your back . This is one of \" Get Rich Or Die Trying 's \" best tracks . Dr. Dre shows up again to produce the passion filled \" Heat \" . 50 is back in street mode once again and has an anthem for anyone that wants to come at him and his G Unit crew . \" If I Ca n't \" is more of a radio friendly Dre song but you will forget the commercial appeal of the song once you hear 50 rhyming to the track . \" Back Down \" has 50 speaking on his long term beef with Ja Rule . This is the CD 's best track , in my opinion , as 50 says , \" You 're a pop tart , sweetheart , you 're soft in the middle ... \" . Since then there have been several back and forth disses with the latest being \" Hail Mary 2003 \" with Eminem , 50 Cent & Busta Rhymes . The 2nd single , \" 21 Questions \" with Nate Dogg is an ode for the ladies that will definitely continue to keep \" Get Rich Or Die Trying \" on the charts for awhile . \" Do n't Push Me \" w \/ Lloyd Banks of G Unit and Eminem , has 50 Cent rapping a little too much like 2 Pac for some people . I like the song as the rappers flow lovely to the Eminem 's beat . \" Poor Lil Rich \" is a Sha Money XL track that plans keep 50 in heavy club rotation along with the aforementioned \" In Da Club \" and \" P.I.M.P \" . The only song that you will have to fast forward , in my opinion , is \" Blood Hound \" with Young Buck as it sounds like DMX is barking throughout the whole song . \" Get Rich Or Die Trying \" also includes \" Wanksta \" , \" U Not Like Me \" , and \" Life 's On The Line \" as bonus tracks , but loyal 50 fans have heard these tracks already . 50 recently released a DVD , \" The New Breed \" that included a bonus CD with 3 tracks :   \" True Loyalty \" with G Unit , \" 8 Mile Road \" ( G Unit Remix)with G Unit , and the Dr. Dre produced \" In Da Hood \" with Brooklyn . To anyone who does n't know G Unit is 50 Cent , Lloyd Banks , Tony Yayo , Young Buck , Bang ' Em Smurf and a cast of other characters . G Unit recently signed with Interscope Records , so a G Unit CD and a Lloyd Banks solo CD should be out by the end of the year and expect a new 50 Cent CD by February 2004 . For 50 Cent the sky is the limit . If you judge \" Get Rich Or Die Trying \" by just \" In Da Club \" and \" 21 Questions \" then you will be saddenly mistakened . This CD has more than club friendly songs on it . Fans of 50 's street anthems will enjoy this CD as well . I wonder how Columbia feels now that 50 Cent has sold more than 4 million records in 10 weeks ? I would advise you to get \" Get Rich Or Die Trying \" and \" Guess Who 's Back \" to start your 50 library . FREE YAYO ! ! ! !

A COMPLETE DEEBO of the Industry . A little of both . His controversial How To Rob garnered much attention . Then consequently he was shot multiple times and survived through it all . By this time , the bootleg of his supposes debut ' Power Of The Dollar ' was hot on the streets and the internet . Quickly following that , 50 gets dropped from a deal . Later on he releases Who 's Back and again has the streets talking . By this time his beef with Ja Rule & Murder Inc. is in full effect . Somehow Eminem gets tapes of 50 Cent and they begin chitter chatter . Then in an almost assassin like fashion 50 releases THREE mixtapes to the street featuring his crew G - Unit ( 50 Cent Is The Future , No Mercy No Fear , God 's Plan ) . Uh oh ... now he has the streets on lock ... only one more step . 50 Cent signs to Shady Records , features on the biggest hip hop movie soundtrack at the time ( 8 Mile ) and releases his first single entitled \" Wanksta \" and grabs the media by the throat . By the time everyones singing on Wanksta , Dr. Dre produces the hit \" IN Tha Club \" , an instant club anthem , and has everybody EAGERLY anticipating the album . The album soon follows and sells nearly 900 , 000 copies the first week ... topping Snoop Dogg 's debut album record for most copies sold in the first week . Now about a month after the initial hype I have come to see this album as a modern classic . It does n't hold a candle to universal hip hop classics such as Doggystyle , Illmatic , or SouthernPlayalisticCadillacMuzik . But the reason it 's a classic is because 50 Cent 's Get Rich Or Die Tryin has\/ will change the game . And any album that can do that has to be considered a classic . There are so many standouts on this album .... \"Back Down \" , What Up Gangsta , Many Men , In Da Club , Heat , High All The Time , 21 Questions .... the whole album is bumpin . There 's no filler and I can definitely play this joint over and over straight through .   Hotness . The beats are top notch , the lyrics are tight , the flows are on point ( even with the slur ; but keep in mind he was shot in the jaw \/ mouth area ) , the guests do n't bog down the album ...

Rupert","reviewText":"50 Cent has surprisingly went from \" Most Hated \" to \" Most Anticipated \" to \" Most Celebrated \" . You may remember him from 1999 's single , \" How to Rob an Industry N \" , where he jokingly talked about robbing many famous artists like Mariah Carey ( who was on his label , Columbia ) while ribbing them at the same time . Not many artists found that funny , the song turned into a gimmick and soon he was dropped from Columbia ( maybe it was n't a good idea to sing about robbing your labelmates ? ? ? ) . During his downtime , he made many foes , including Jay - Z ( in 1999 's \" It 's Hot \" , Jigga rapped , \" I 'm about the dollar \/ WTF is 50 Cent ? \" ) , and I think that he 's even been shot more times than 2Pac . But after Eminem picked 50 up and signed him to his Shady Records label , and 50 dropping \" Wanksta \" and a few underground albums with his crew , the \" GGGgggg - uuuUnit ! \" , the streets embraced him and anticipation was at an all - time high . Get Rich or Die Tryin ' is one of those debut albums that actually lives up to its hype . In fact , if you 're in your car playing it to the end , you may just feel like playing the whole album again . While the lyrical content may not break any new ground , 50 Cent , whose flow sounds like a mixture of Jay - Z , 2Pac , and Mase , knows how to deliver it WELL . See \" Got ta Make it to Heaven \" ( an otherwise played - out subject matter with gangsta rappers ) , where he gives the topic an interesting twist , and \" In the Club \" , where he takes topics like cars , drinks , and women and make them sound original . Fans may say that song sounds radio - friendly , but he did n't go to mainstream , mainstream went to him . The production on here is also stellar ; not one track sounds similar to another , a problem on most rap albums today . Check out the dark beat on \" Patiently Waiting \" with Eminem and \" 21 Questions \" and notice the difference in production . And what would a rap album be without a diss record ? ( See \" Wanksta \" and the funnier \" Back Down \" , both aimed at Ja Rule . ) Even though \" P.I.M.P. \" is embarrasingly old - school and lazy on 50 's part , Get Rich ... is one of those rarities in hip - hop : a highly anticipated album that truly delivers , by a rapper who disregarded gimmicks to let people know why Slim Shady signed him .","summary":"Get rich to this","unixReviewTime":1045008000,"image":null}

John , Paul and George would certainly go on to have hits songs and chart toppers but it always seemed to me that Ringo was over looked a bit in what he accomplished in the years after going out on his own . Yeah he maybe did n't have as big an impact as his former bandmates on the charts but that does n't mean he was n't putting out some great music . He most definitely was . The album \" Photograph : The Very Best Of Ringo \" ( a greatest hit compilation ) is good proof of that . His music maybe did n't have the depth and social message to it as the other former lads were but Ringo 's music I always thought was great good times , party kind of music sure to please and entertain anyone looking for some uplifting music . My favorite Ringo song of all time one of his earliest hits , \" It Do n't Come Easy \" . Not necessarily one of his \" party \" songs but with a good beat , strong lyrics and Ringo in fine voice makes for an enjoyable piece of music .

And Ringo Starr released   \" It Do n't Come Easy \" , ( a George Harrison Song ) in 1971 . There are the original versions of George Harrison doing this song earlier as a \" guide \" for Ringo . . Being a Beatle Freak , I heard the song on the radio , then George Harrisons guitar break ( CLASSIC ) and was hooked . Ringo 's second single ( Beaucoups of Blues being the regrettable first ) it was a top 5 hit here in the US . How many groups after splitting up can say all the members had a top 5 hit the following year ? The song itself had an all star band , ( Klaus Voormann on bass guitar , Stephen Stills on piano , Badfinger members on background vocals ) , This song is a classic , hard driving , and has a \" spectorish \" production but George Martin the prime influence , at Abbey Road Studios . A great song .","summary":"Ringo's Signature Song","unixReviewTime":1411776000,"image":null}

More pop sounding than her 1974 version \" I Will Always Love You \" was produced by her band leader Gregg Perry . Many have said this version is a bit inferior than 1974 's , but Dolly 's voice here is pure , heartfelt and filled with emotion . Dolly herself was going through a breakdown in her own personal life at the time of this recording in early 1982 as she battled weight problems , family issues , an attempt by people to blackmail her and a personal heartache that she refuses to talk about . This all led to the amazing vocal range on this track .

Recorded in June , 1973 at RCA Record 's Nashville Sound Studios and released the following year Dolly Parton introduced the world to the greatest song ever written . She had written the tune in honor of her duet partner and mentor Porter Wagoner . By 1973 after being the biggest duet team in country music history for 6 years Dolly wanted to go off on her own , conquer the pop music market and star in films . Porter was totally against this as he thought Dolly could never make it in popular music or in motion pictures and he felt Dolly owed him a great deal of gratitude for helping her be so big in the country field . The fighting got worse and the arguing ever worser as Porter refused to reason with Dolly , so Dolly thought to herself , \" You ca n't talk to this man , so do what you so best : go home and write a song and perhaps he will somehow understand what I need to do \" . So , one night in the late spring of 1973 with only her guitar in her music room at her Nashville mansion Dolly wrote \" I Will Always Love You \" in less than an hour . He sat at his desk and cried all the way through it and told her that was the greatest song she ever wrote . When Dolly went into the recording studio to cut \" I Will Always Love You \" a few weeks later she herself cried through the entire song . To this very day it remains one of her greatest recordings . \" I Will Always Love You \" came out on Dolly 's breathough album \" Jolene \" as the second single , hit # 1 and quickly became Dolly 's signature song . The following year Linda Ronstadt covered the track on her \" Prisoner in Disguise \" album , although it omitted the last verse . Also in 1975 \" I Will Always Love You \" ( Dolly 's original version ) made its first ever appearance on film in Martin Scorsese 's \" Alice Does n't Live Here Anymore \" when the character of Alice takes a break from singing in the bar she works at and is having a talk with her soon - to - be boyfriend . Unfortunately , Dolly nor the song did not receive screen credit .","summary":"\"The Very First Version!\"","unixReviewTime":1329609600,"image":null}

Ironically , the two are doing a duet , which is like Rosie O ' Donnell doing a duet with Leona Lewis . Totally mismatched . All sarcasm aside , the song has more cheese than Wisconsin , more horrid sounds than a Chinese takeout kitchen , and more annoyingness than Rosanne . Really , whenever I 'm forced to listen to this song at the gas station , I want to light a match , and drop it . Boyce Avenue 's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for , but it 's still a 4 - star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history . What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it 's sort of catchy . It 's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity . So in summarizing , do n't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds , because you 'll choke , and do n't listen while you 're depressed , because you 'll kill yourself . Like drugs , JUST SAY NO !","summary":"Warning! Don't Listen To This Song When Eating Watermelons With Seeds!","unixReviewTime":1224374400,"image":null}

This is * phenomenal * instrumental playing . It 's not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination . These band members had a unique ability to really make you open your mind and appreciate instrumental chops played tastefully and creatively , and chops that are constantly full of passion and energy . You feel like you 're getting a complete experience when you hear albums like this one . This is perhaps one of the finest recordings from the mid 70 's you will ever hear , right next to the Mahavishnu Orchestra 's Visions of the Emerald Beyond . I seriously mean that . Yes , I 've heard quite a bit of albums around the same time Where Have I Known You Before was released , and despite the fact this album was n't exactly popular does n't really MEAN anything when it comes down to it . What matters is that I 've heard the album , and I 'm trying my best to convince YOU why you need to hear it . The fact that instrumental skills of THIS caliber actually exist , and have been laid down on tape for this recording , really proves to me Return to Forever were more than just a talented group of fellows . This is a band that really gave listeners a challenging and lasting experience . The keyboard playing is a constant feature of the album . Tastefully played , engaging , and always being displayed in a way that proves the keyboard player is giving everything he has and then some . The guitar playing is the same way . More passion than most guitar players would be able to lay down , that 's for sure . Again I have to ask the magic question- The lengthy and intense keyboard and guitar jams that come and go are considered jazzy ? Are you sure this kind of music does n't belong in the rock camp ? Perhaps rock fusion is the appropriate choice of words . The album cover shows a sun appearing in a hazy red sky . The only thing hazy about these compositions are the images you get in your head . The music is certainly nothing hazy , or unorganized , or played lazily , or ANYTHING like that- this is just a straight up perfect example of jazz that at one point in time was n't afraid to be as experimental as possible . Does Where Have I Known You Before leave a lasting impression ? A positive one at that . I 'm more than happy giving an album with such brilliant instrumental playing a perfect 5 stars . Replay value is important to me as well , and this album most certainly delivers in that respect . If you 're someone just getting into jazz and would like to hear a fantastic piece of music , check out THIS album . You will be blown away by many moments among all the instrumental jams , I guarantee it . You simply must check out the Mahavishnu Orchestra , Jade Warrior , Camel and Santana as well because these bands have their fair share of music focusing on jazzy and tasteful instrumental chops as well .","summary":"what a band these guys were","unixReviewTime":1259884800,"image":null}

The style of music on Where Have I Known You Before ( 1974 ) is somewhat similar to Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy ( 1973 ) although there is a bit more in the way of softer textures , making for a very balanced listening experience . The lineup at this point included Chick Corea ( Fender Rhodes electric piano , acoustic piano , clavinet , Yamaha organ , ARP Odyssey synthesizer , and percussion ) ; bassist extraordinaire Stanley Clarke ( Alembic electric bass guitar , Yamaha organ , bell tree , chimes ; excellent drummer Lenny White ( drums , percussion ) ; and newcomer Al Di Meola ( electric and acoustic guitars ; acoustic 12 string guitar ) . These guys are all unbelievably talented , with Stanley Clarke setting new standards for performance on the bass that would be equaled by few - this guy is mind - blowingly fast . For his first time playing with RTF ( Al was 19 at the time ) , Al does an incredible job , although his playing is not as dominant in the mix as it would become on later albums . With this album , Chick had started weaving synthesizers into the RTF sound and he gets some great tone colors out of the ARP Odyssey on this album , which is plastered everywhere . As a huge fan of progressive rock and electronica , I do not mind the analog synthesizer use at all , although some jazz fans might be turned off . In terms of the music , it is an incredible amalgamation of jazz ; jazz rock ; progressive rock ; space rock ; funk and even a tiny bit of classical - more like a proggy jazz rock actually . In fact , as a progger , I really appreciate the dense arrangements and virtuosity . Speaking of which , just about every odd time signature under the sun is used on Where Have I Known You Before and there is some incredibly complex ensemble work . Sandwiched in - between the highly electric rave - ups are three of Chick 's acoustic piano improvisations including Where Have I Loved You Before ; Where Have I Danced With You Before ; and Where Have I Known You Before . This is the closest this album comes to sounding like traditional jazz and showcases Chick 's considerable talents on the acoustic piano . The softer acoustic tracks provide a nice contrast with the highly charged electric tracks . Earth Juice is the \" funkiest \" piece on the album , although this funk is pretty far removed from Sly and the Family Stone . Of course , Chick 's work on the clavinet here and there on the album really lends to the funkiness . The suite that closes the album out is a high point for me and opens with a great synthesizer arrangement , which then launches into some extremely complicated ensemble work that sounds very similar to some of the music that was coming out of the English progressive rock scene at the time . Although there are solos on this lengthy track , they are really very interesting and are seamlessly integrated with the arrangement - in fact , they sound pre - composed . Although it may not appear to be the case , this Verve release was remastered ( albeit a low budget remaster ) , and the sound quality is very good . There are a few photos of the band and a lengthy bit of \" cosmic \" verse from Neville Potter . The imagery of the words is both colorful and evocative . All in all this is an excellent RTF album ( my \" new \" personal favorite ) and is very highly recommended along with Romantic Warrior ( 1976 ) . Proggers should definitely check this album out .","summary":"Incredible proggy jazz rock","unixReviewTime":1181088000,"image":null}

One group that undoubtedly ruled the ' 90s scene -- Green Day , in October of 2000 , would issue a nearly - all - acoustic record ( \" Warning \" ) , which , while being okay , seemed to signal a change in direction , that could have been seen as a death - knell for the genre . Were it not , that is , for a new crop of young bands , all of whom were just pre - teens in 1994 when Green Day released \" Dookie , \" that emerged around this time to save the day and inject some much - needed youthful vitriol to the sound . Perhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto , Ontario 's Sum 41 , who began recording their second release and the album being reviewed , \" All Killer , No Filler \" , in October of Y2 K , just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew . Wow ! Talk about this record being a return to form for punk ! After a mood - setting intro , on track number two \" Nothing On My Back , \" the listener is introduced to the band 's striking , distinctive , and razor - sharp guitar sound , which was equal parts traditional punk - rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude . It is a guitar tone that is truly raw , inspired , and decidedly \" old school \" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow . Often imitated , but never duplicated , because no one ever did it again like Sum did . And yet , on this same opener , it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up , and then some ! From vocalist \/ co - guitarist Deryck Whibley 's ultra - memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone 's well - placed and twanging mid - song interlude , these guys prove they 're the real deal , and it does n't let up from there . This cut segues into the 50 - second \" Never Wake Up , \" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I 've heard . The two best songs , though , lie in the disc 's second half . One is \" Summer , \" a rerecording from the group 's debut \" Half Hour of Power , \" and boy , is it a masterpiece ! The main driving force in it is a simple , three - chord progression , but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective . And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days ! No doubt , one of Sum 's signature tunes . Perhaps my all - time favorite , though , is track number ten , \" Crazy Amanda Bunkface . \" This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss , and Deryck 's raging guitar solo , which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day 's earlier \" Haushinka , \" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria . Again , a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk . And there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music , with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found , that will surely have you putting \" All Killer , No Filler \" on repeat . I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily , and almost exactly 15 years on from its release , it has n't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you . I want to add that I 'm 41 ( incidentally ) and have been listening to underground punk rock ( Dead Kennedys , Government Issue , the F.U. 's , et al ) for decades , and I still think that \" All Killer , No Filler \" is among the best - crafted punk LPs in my collection , with perhaps the highest replay value of them all . A masterpiece that started a wave of imitators ...

It was clear that the public had finally come around to listening to the punk group 's music . The public had good reason . Sum-41 has a great sense of when and how much distortion to use in their very interesting and fast paced rhythm changes . The guitars have a great taste in creating simple but very unique melodies . The bass gives the extra fill in creating the band 's harmonies , and the drums keep everything together . The lyrics to ALL KILLER NO FILLER are amusing and can even be considered to be slightly contraversial for the track \" Fat Lip \" . The lyricist makes honest and \" in your ears \" remarks about society and its expectations of its citizens .

Slayer , duh ) like \" Introduction to Destruction \" , if you can even call that a real song . The only problem with this CD ? I only like 5 songs . \" Fat Lip \" , \" Rhythems \" , \" Motivation \" , \" In Too Deep \" , and \" Summer \" . Oh , well . Despite that , this is a really good CD .","summary":"Good punk rock.","unixReviewTime":1025308800,"image":null}

If all the nu - metal garbage around now was n't making me mad allready , this new corporate punk is ticking me off even more . The same old three cord progression on every song , stupid uninspired lyrics , and packaged for MTV wanna be rebellion is what makes up this drink coaster in the making a complete package . And what makes me laugh even more is how kids think that Sum 41 , Blink 182 , and Green Day are supposed punk bands because they 're on MTV , well kids , this ai n't real punk . Real punk is Dead Kennedys , old Misfits , Bad Religion , Suicidal Tendencies , Suicide Machines , Black Flag , and dare I say it , even NoFX . Then again , there are kids scratching their heads wondering \" who are they , they 're not on MTV , they 're no good \" .

This is music to explore , like a boy explores the cliff in the woods outside his house , delighted to find so many things to do and see . Much has been made of the resemblance between Luke 's voice and that of the lead singer of Coldplay . Indeed , his voice is eerily similar ; fortunately , this is not necessarily a bad thing . Chris 's voice is emotive and anguished , and Luke 's is much the same , which suits this lovely music perfectly . Some might persuasively argue that it would better serve Blue Merle to have a vocalist with a voice more uniquely his own . While a voice less reminiscent of that of Coldplay might be desirable for some , ultimately , no one can deny the power and maturity with which Luke uses his voice . Probably . There is no crime in that . Could Luke have chosen to sing in a different style ? Perhaps . But would that have suited the music as well ? Probably not . I think that he was blessed with a voice that performs well in the style in which he has chosen to use it , and we should be grateful . Maturity and further listening will probably help to separate the two in our minds as the bands grow in different directions . Musically , the two bands are not that similar , although there is much to admire in Blue Merle for fanatics of Coldplay . At the risk of sounding trite , the   guitars really do shimmer , the banjos sparkle in a setting of solid drumming and inventive bass . The lyrics are excellent , and reveal more on repeated listening , which is a benchmark which I use to decide who gets my 5th star or not . The entire album is excellent , no weak tracks , and the more I hear it , the more glad I am to listen to it . Some might consider it a flaw that there is no one \" stand out \" track -- no one track that is so instantly memorable or catchy as to be the obvious single . But this is not music for singles , a treat to be digested quickly and best given with insulin -- it is music for sustenance . For fans of Coldplay , John Mayer , Dave Matthews , Counting Crows and Jeff Buckley , this is likely a band to watch and an album to love instantly , suitable to for enthusiastic recommendation to friends . For fans of the well crafted pop song , this album is reason for excitement as well , especially if you like your pop drenched in complicated guitar work and gilded with a newgrass sensibility . For everyone else , find out what you are missing . Blue Merle are worth the ride .","summary":"Marvelous, and hints of so much to come","unixReviewTime":1111363200,"image":null}

We take in her message to unfaithful boyfriends , how they line up in her perception of romance , and how she deals with their galavanting all over town - thinking she would stay home and stitch their socks . More couples danced way into the night in wild excitement with this one song - than anyone could imagine - from Moscow to Manhattan - from Paris to Omaha .

Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title . Christmas does n't have to extravagant but it should be happy , nice , peaceful , comfortable , and enjoyable . If it were n't for Frank Sinatra we would n't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today . Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I 'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging . The original version had somewhat different lyrics . The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung . \" In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow . Until then we 'll just have to muddle through somehow . \" Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him \" I like your Christmas song \" but that he needed that line \" jollied up \" to include the piece on his Christmas album . Sinatra said \" The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas . Do you think you could jolly that line up for me ? \" And , of course , as Martin put it \" You do n't say no to Frank Sinatra . \" The new lyrics in this line became \" Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow . Hang a shining star upon the highest bough . \" Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics . Frank Sinatra 's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is THE original version of Have Yourself a Merry Christmas and gets 5 out 5 stars hands down . :)","summary":"The original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas as we know it.","unixReviewTime":1380153600,"image":null}

The lyrics are so beautiful as well as meaningful that they can bring tears to your eyes , if you are in the right frame of mind . The music too matches the lyrics , in that , it too is beautiful . It far outstrips Candle in the Wind , for beauty . It is a song about giving God Thanks , for certain people in his life , that have changed the person 's life for the better , no matter what happened to the contrary . It is truly a work of art . Elton was definitely inspired when he wrote this . It will be forever on the top of my all time favorite songs of all time list . At least , give a good listen . Maybe a second and a third , until you can hear all the words clearly . He sings things like \" I know why roses do n't grow in New York \" and other things like that you probably are n't expecting . Just buy the song and let it enrich your life . The words alone could be a poem to people we love ; who make a difference in our lives . A complete and utter dedication to them - those loved ones .

I 'm going to pick this song apart and explain why each and every part of it is so irresistibly awesome . \" Reflections \" might just be the greatest song Diana Ross & the Supremes ever released . This song must have come on the radio a million times throughout the country over the years , and I would n't mind listening to it a million times myself . Here we go ! It starts off on an unusual note for the first few seconds with swirling machinery - type sounds that seems totally out of place at first but now that I 've heard the song so many times , I believe these chaotic sounds are supposed to represent the confusion and emotional distraught that Diana Ross feels through her rollercoaster emotional state of mind . Then Diana Ross begins to sing ... and her voice * alone * is brilliant . It sounds so tender with * just * the right hoarse sound . Like a young woman who 's finally had enough of having someone hold her down , so she 's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels . Like she 's on stage and it 's her turn to speak , or sing in this case , what 's on her mind . I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it 's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger . I LOVE it ! Then we have the Supremes providing the really somber and suspense - building \" ooooo , oo - oo - oo \" behind Diana 's powerful vocals . Listen to the perfectly executed way the \" oooo \" dreamily soothes and creates tension during the way Diana sings the line \" Through the mirrors of my mind , through these tears I am crying \" . With the Supremes providing back - up , now this song takes on a whole new meaning . Without the Supremes Diana 's vocals would have been great as it is , but WITH the Supremes ? Now it 's just insanely good ! What proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line \" I 'm all alone now , no love to shield me , trapped in a world of distorted reality \" . Suddenly , during this particular line , the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone . What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who 's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past , they feel cold and angry . If my words are n't clear , this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it 's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is . It took me a LONG time to notice there 's a speedy bass section playing in the background , and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change . It 's brief and easy to not notice unless you 're playing REALLY close attention . It 's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana 's emotions all coming to a head and she 's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible . This is ANOTHER really powerful moment . Granted , my interpretation probably is n't the same as Diana 's , but that 's okay- we all interpret music differently . The song finishes on a more optimistic note with dramatically more promising vibes the way Diana Ross demandingly sings \" Reflections of , the way life used to be \" with a pounding rhythm illustrating a brighter future . The tone of the song right here at this point seems to paint a picture of someone who 's learned to move on from a troubled relationship and wo n't dare repeat the same mistakes again . And just to throw in some humor , it 's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- No Diana is actually saying \" In the you and I \" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here . If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions ( in the beginning and when Diana sings the line \" happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories \" and the line near the end \" I see a dream that 's lost from the hurt you have caused \" ) you could actually be led to believe she 's singing about UFO 's , haha . So what is it about \" Reflections \" that is so magnificent ? It 's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned . Sadness , optimism , worry , fear , deserted ... these are just some of the feelings I experience . If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do , you should be able to detect all these emotions and more ! Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3 - minute song , and that my friends is downright amazing .","summary":"what a song!","unixReviewTime":1399075200,"image":null}

It justed missed the top 20 ( in the US ) upon its release in May , 1981 . It also marked a transitional period in his career , coming off the sometimes successful but ultimately unfocused albums like 21 at 33 to the more straight ahead pop smarts of Too Low for Zero . Although The Fox leans much more toward the unfocusedness of 21 at 33 , due to the mishmash of writing partners and use of outside musicians in places , it is a much more interesting and satisfying experience than anything he had turned out in years . I find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit , prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory . As a few reviewers have noted previously , this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas ( who would also produce his next 3 albums ) . Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement . This ambition shows up in songs like \" Fascist Faces \" , the beautiful instrumental trio \" Carla \/ Etude \/ Fanfare \" and the more traditional love ballad \" Chloe . \" The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir , a full string orchestra , and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this is n't meant to be a cohesive statement , but meant to try to satisfy trends and make \" the cutting edge \" for 1981 . Most of the time , it acheives this due to Elton 's tunefulness and ultra - competent instrumentation . Highlights of the album are many and scattered throughout . It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit . While \" Just Like Belgium \" is fun and lively , it really does n't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks , and \" Heels of the Wind \" seems unneccessary , almost like an afterthought . Big departures from his previous work are the tracks \" Heart in the Right Place \" with its forceful , blues - rock tone and \" Fascist Faces \" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir . Both tracks are propelled by the biting , metalish guitar play of Richie Zito , which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton 's canon . In the end , The Fox is far from a masterpiece along the lines of Honky Chateau or Yellow Brick Road , but it is one of the most interesting in Elton 's now 35 + year solo career . I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the more arty side of what would become \" I 'm Still Standing \" and \" Sad Songs \" just a few years down the road .","summary":"The Lost 80s Elton Album","unixReviewTime":1121472000,"image":null}

Nice melodies , mot so much passion , but a lyrics sheet that , no matter how one tried , could not find a single reference to his sexuality , except Big Dipper . And so ' The Fox ' goes , his usual servings of pop , still using self - serving metaphors ( But ' The Fox ' is a long way to plummet from ' Captain Fantastic ' do n't ya think ? ) ( And who 's fault is this anyway , It 's not as if Elton writes the lyrics , or does he ? ? Did Bernie Taupin really bestowe the crown of ' Captain Fantastic ' on Elton , while relegating himself to role of ' Brown dirt cowboy ' ? ) But The Fox is a surprise . Although it is not an experimental album , fairly straight - forward , it is still a very inspired album . From the sleazy - journo ode ' Heart 's in the right p;ace ' to classical music ' Carla Etude ' and the all - our rocking opener ' Breaking down barriers ' , the songs on ' The Fox ' are very solid and enjoyable . There is also a lot of diversity here too . Rating 3 1\/2 or 3 3\/4 or something like that , worth rounding up . But if you are hoping for a return to his country - rock days ; you 'll be disappointed , you 'll have to wait for the last song and even then you wo n't get any humility : \" And for mile after mile you 'll never see me tire You 'll never see me slow down , for a while \n 'Cause I am the fox , like it or not \" . But who wants humility in their rock music anyway ? We 're a vocal minority but we 're growing , yes you 'd better be scared ! !","summary":"Surpasses mediocrity.

It is filled with great uptempo , complex arrangments like , \" Breaking Down Barriers \" and\"Fascist Faces \" . \" Just Like Belgium \" is one of Elton 's most upbeat romantic songs since the mid - seventies and \" Carla \/ Etude \/ Fanfare \" ( which runs into ) \" Chloe \" is a testament to Elton John 's creativity .

It 's the same sound you hear when a cassette tape gets caught up in the rollers . After you untangle the tape and fix it right on the reel , it 's still playable but there 's one section that got mangled and does n't quite sound right .

This song is basically about someone wanting to have sex with you in a very passionate and aggressive way . Like many others , I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager . I honestly found the music video very eccentric ( in a positive way ) , but creative at the same time , and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more . I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video . The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it , and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song ( there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative :( Through every forest , above the trees Within my stomach , scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive ) . Obviously , many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means . I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting .

On the other hand it 's both historic and great music . The historic aspect is this is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come . Listen to the sound samples on this page and even those short snippets will reveal the magic of this album . I am not going to try to dissect the music or impose my personal taste on you , but if you love swinging and tight quartets with a piano and vibraphone in front you will be more than pleased with this album . While I promised to not dissect the music I will say that the intensity that Jackson brings to the performances match the backing trio - Peterson and bassist Ray Brown in particular were renown for intensity even on ballads , and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well . So the chemistry among the four is natural and one of the reasons why this album appeals to me . Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions , two of which are logged as ' untitled Peterson originals ' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue . Regardless , the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile .","summary":"Short,  but great","unixReviewTime":1437523200,"image":null}

Musically , it does n't disappoint . From the very first track , \" On Green Dolphin Street , \" Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint , drawing the listener in as on few other recordings ( he 's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis ) . And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes , he 's neither intrusive nor overwhelming . In fact , he 's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session . And Bags is , as usual , the master of bop and blues , a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets ( Gary Burton would cut the rotators , add two more mallets , and take the instrument in a different direction ) . As recently as 5 years earlier , Milt was still playing with fast - spinning rotators , but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place . ( To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ , if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis , check out \" Bags and Trane . \" ) One caveat : the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment . Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of \" stereophonic sound \" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms . Oscar 's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted ; Ed Thigpen 's drums lack dispersion and upper - register presence . In fact , there 's a slightly \" canned \" quality to the overall sound , making you want to take the lid off . I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording , they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound . ( Sometimes it 's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import . Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money . )","summary":"Comes up short sonically","unixReviewTime":1206057600,"image":null}

This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing . Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson 's very restrained and delicate Piano solo . Even when the solo reaches the swing section there are n't the torrents of notes that you might expect . This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent . Of course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers . In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell . Milt Jackson plays with a fire that , to me , was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ . Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming . He really hits some great accents when you really do n't expect them - and they work ! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good . Sadly only Oscar Peterson survives from this marvellous quartet at the time of writing . This disc captures them all at the height of their abilities and is an essential purchase .","summary":"Brilliant","unixReviewTime":1177113600,"image":null}

While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD , Brown and Thigpen were great players , and add a lot to the success of this effort . The opener , \" Green Dolphin Street \" is relaxed , but \" Heartstrings \" and \" Work Song \" jump . Then comes the wonderful , almost eight - minute take on \" John Brown 's Body \" that soars . The final two cuts , \" A Wonderful Guy \" and \" Reunion Blues \" are also superb . Milt and Oscar , of course , went on to do great work up to the mid-90 's , but they were already old pros 41 years ago . If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz , play this for him or her .

This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can , and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life . I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think ( also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would ) . Last , but not least , this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong ( thick - skinned ) , and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine . My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner : \n\n It just takes some time \n Little Girl You 're in the middle of the ride \n Everything , everything will be just fine \n Everything , everything will be alright , alright \n\n   \" The Middle \" is a brilliant track that applies to both men and women from all walks of life even with taking the \" little girl \" metaphor into account . I suggest this song ( with absolute self - confidence ) if you know that events in your life are going to unfold perfectly and in a joyful manner , but you also crave listening to a song that powerfully gives this reminder ( in addition to sending the message to always see your personal beauty and unlimited power regardless of how others may treat you )","summary":"The Powerful Middle","unixReviewTime":1299110400,"image":null}

I heard this song a few years back , it was playing in the background of a car commercial and everyone in the room wanted to know the name and who sang it . Since then , I 've heard it on 3 more commercials and it was on Lincoln Lawyer soundtrack , and featured in the movie The Italian Job . From the time the music starts playing , you know you 're in for a treat and you get it . The music is upbeat and the melody is sweet . Marlena 's voice is on point ; it 's uniquely powerful and full of soul . She has great control of her instrument and you get swept up in the soulful way she delivers each and every note . This song is still going strong and this is a testament to how great of a singer she is . It 's no wonder - California Soul has been sampled over and over by rappers ( Gang Starr , The Game , etc . ) , beer manufacturers , Dockers , countless television commercials and a driving game - Driver : San Frisco . I like the album , but I LOVE THIS SONG . You ca n't listen to it once , you have to play it over and over because it 's so good . It 's a timeless classic .

Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends . But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul . That is the case with some of Soundgarden 's masterpieces , and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to .

Soft Cell , which has been labeled a one - hit wonder from the 80 's , still has not been able to master having another smash song . But still which is a big surprise , their biggest song is actually a cover song from another artist . Tainted Love still sounds great today from the rhythm of the heart , to the mood that many songs do n't ignite today . The song which is a cover of a old Gloria Jones song , still is a one of a kind joy to listen to . While it was cheaply sampled by Rihanna for her song S.O.S. in 2006 , the song that Soft Cell made years ago , is still more than anything tainted , it is real love .","summary":"Still Tainted","unixReviewTime":1398988800,"image":null}

Fighting the Urge to Look Up The Meaning to the Song , Dreams is about coming to terms with multiple changes happening in someones life while appreciating a person who occupies a large place in your heart ( metaphorically ) . I recently enjoyed hearing Dreams by The Cranberries on iheartradio because it is not played as often on the radio where I currently live   I completely understand that this song could mean something completely different from what I m guessing it is but for me the song reminds me of my husband in a benevolent way . This is because he has helped me add even more brighter colors ( metaphorically speaking ) to my life and has helped me appreciate life even more just by his example of how he sees the positive benefits in certain things that would test even the strongest of souls . Hence , when the lead singer of Cranberries sings you 're a dream to me it reminds me of how I have told this to my husband before ( just in slightly different words ) . Overall , Dreams by Cranberry is both an elevating and novelty type of rock song .","summary":"Vintage and Classic Alternative Rock","unixReviewTime":1444867200,"image":null}

However , this song has worn on me , and not by radio mind you , but just the song itself .

A lot of people thought she would fall off or come back weak on this but she came from left field with some of these tracks . This time she brought a lot of reggae , dancehall , some soca and even indian music to the plate . Some of the tightest tracks on this is where she raps with dancehall beats . Hearing foxy chant in jamacian puts her on a whole different level now and no other female mc right now can do it better . The way that she flows from rap to reggae makes it look a lot easier than it is . There is one song call \" so Hot \" where she shows her trini roots with a calypso style beat that sounds different to anything out now . Bk Anthem has one of the hardest and tightest beats that you can play on the set . On songs the leter she apologizes to her family and different people she hurt . On broken silence she lets you knwo what she has been goign through all this time . Fallin and 730 pust some rumors to an end liek jay - z writing some of her rhymes . She admits it saying \" Yeah I did , but I blew um up the same \" . \" Tables will turn \" is anotehr tight song that I think is on of the tightest on the cd ... produced by regage producer Dave kelly . so she could n't get any better with him . The songs I like the most are : Oh Yeah , Bk Anthem , The letter , 730 , tables will turn , hood scriptures , run dem , na na be like , so hot , and teh saddest day .

This album establishes the fact that the more a REAL MCee raps , the better the lyric becomes and when you add emotion and confidence you will become unstoppable . This is the best Cd that has ever come from her . The first single \" Bk Anthem \" jumped it off but in actuality it jumped off with that \" Bang , Bang \" flow . Then she drops \" Oh Yeah \" with Spragga Benz which is a hype track . It just keeps flowing on and on with this album from \" 730 \" to \" Hood Scriptures \" ( which has the most creative sound I have heard in a while ) to Table will turn and so on . So all you Lil kim fans you heard the answers to kim 's weak flow on   notorious kim . Now realize this cd is so close to a classic that it is sick . This is one of the best of the year so far .

Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself , and everyone said he was coming off too cocky . Well , Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition 's Home Again came out , so was n't he being a little cocky himself ? Yeah , everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo , but to be honest , this was n't his best album . The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus : \" Let 's get the mood right \/ Turn on your heart light . \" That 's too cheesy , even for Babyface . And \" Love In An Elevator \" is full of corny lyrics like \" They say there 's no luck on the thirteenth floor \/ But I found love and so much more \" and \" Like The Staples , I wanna take you there . \" \" Simply Say I Love You \" is okay , but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song . Maybe it 's just me , but I do n't remember hearing Stevie in that song . The only songs that really stand out are \" Maybe \" and \" It 's Your Body \" . The latter features Roger Troutman , and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible . The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing : sex , sex , and more sex . The sleepy production does n't make things better , either . Another problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs , especially the very last track , \" So Gentle \" . It features a rap from Ron DeVoe , so you know what the main problem is . But the thing is that the preceding song \" I Know You Want Me \" features uninspired rapping from some other guy , and his rapping is actually worse than Ron 's . I still like Johnny Gill , but this album seems like it was rushed . And the strong adlibs he 's known for usually adds feeling to the songs , but here it seems like they 're trying to hide the questionable material . You 're better off getting the solo albums he made before this .","summary":"As much as I love Johnny Gill...","unixReviewTime":1045958400,"image":null}

Wheras the sound of the debut generally emphasized the artists \" naturalness \" this blends India 's \" acoustic soul \" sound with a array of soundscapes , many of which are as equally funky and soulful . \"Little Things \" is an excellent example . It 's groove , the heavy - on - easy style and unique chord changes could only come from the guy who produced her debut : Stevie Wonder . Just about all of the music here maintains his signiture writing style as well , even though India is more fully in charge of the production here . The lyrics are typically \" power of positive thinking \" but the wonderful thing about them is that India 's great attitude and the sincerity and brilliance of her poetry really forgive any possibility for a clishe . Needless the say the moments when this album really catches fire are when the tempo goes up a little such as on the excellent \" Slow Down\",\"Can I Walk With You \" and the bonus cut \" Interested\"-all rollicking soul tunes then endow her formula with a lot of rhythmic strengh . Of course that does n't dismiss the respectful tone of \" Talk To You\",\"Complicated Melody \" and \" Headed In The Right Direction \" . The only song that confuses me a little here , where I love the lush music is \" God Is Real \" . I realize the connection in the black community to Christianity runs deep and is significant but for the life of me I can not tell if this song is advertising India 's obvious Christian faith or if her intention is to point out that nature in itself is godly . Not being religious myself these kinds of ambiguous lyrics are always mildly curious to me . So while this album really serves mostly to establish that her huge success with the debut was n't some kind of post millenium fluke this was really the last time , musically anyway India .","summary":"An India.

Arie delivers a brilliant sophomore album entitled , \" Voyage to India \" . In fact , if this album was really a \" voyage \" to somewhere , many would probably pay top dollar to be there ! This is such a positive album . The lyrics just make any listener smile . Anyone who knows anything about India knows she loves to play the guitar , and it is evident that she loves the guitar when listening to her album . Although I think she 's a bit indulgent with the guitar , she does n't bore the listener with it . It actually sounds right nice and adds something distinctive to her album . \" Good Man \" is definitely an album highlight . The lyrics are meaningful and real . The song is about a man who has children and if anything ever happens to him , he wants his children to know he loved them and that he was a good man . Many parents can relate to this song because it 's the same way they feel about their children . Aside from the laid back beat , the song offers a very relevant message in today 's world ; talk to women with respect ( men ) . This song has simple lyrics , but they say so much . I love it ! \" God is Real \" is another one of the many beautiful songs on \" Voyage to India \" . This song has a very noticeable guitar in the background . India 's vocals are really good on this track , they help the song to be more believable . The song is about questioning the existence of God . India does an excellent job of stating her claim of why she thinks or as she says \" knows \" that God is real . \" Can I Walk With You \" and \" The One \" are just nice love songs . India 's vocals are , again , on point for these tracks . The album contains no fillers , just brilliant work by a great artist of today . If debating on whether or not to cop this one , GET IT NOW ! India will take you by surprise , like she did men . I am very impressed with the talent of this woman . MiKeisha 's Top 5 \n\n 1 . Good Man \n\n 2 .

That is why artists like India . Arie manage to survive and succeed in an industry of overproduction and glitz . She is now ready to take us on a \" Voyage To India \" and it 's worth taking . Although the first track'\"Growth , \" is an interlude opening up the second chapter in Arie 's anthology , this record , in many senses , is more of a continuation of the previous rather than an evolution of the artist . The only difference is the first single \" Little Things \" which is a track that , surprisingly , does not have any guitars on it , but its lyrics capture the same granola down - to - earth essence as her debut single \" Video . But Arie 's way with melodies is best depicted by the mood jam \" Slow Down \" and the uplifting folk ditty \" Beautiful Surprise . Arie 's diverse influences play a role in her distinct sound . As she has stated in her previous album , her influences range from Stevie Wonder to Karen Carpenter . \" Get It Together \" , a song about maintaining strength when times are rough , captures that with her warm vocals and guitar - lead melody . Then , \" Headed In The Right Direction \" starts out like an ' 80 's Luther Vandross anthem and then wanes towards the end . All songs aside , Arie shines most on \" Can I Walk With You \" - a song about the need to belong . Arie 's vocals on this song depict a yearning like no other . This is definitely a gem , if Motown Records had any sense this would be the next single . \" Voyage To India \" then meanders into sharp beats on \" The One \" and \" Complicated Melody , \" which is exactly what it says - it does n't go anywhere . But the fall is cushioned by \" Good Man \" and the bonus track \" Interested , \" which keeps Arie 's soulful tradition alive . This album is bound to be a coffee shop favorite . It contains slow jams , simple , yet deep folk numbers and sultry vocals . Although it is a well - rounded album , it sounds more like \" Acoustic Soul 2 \" rather than a record with its own unique taste .","summary":"Pleasing Voyage","unixReviewTime":1074729600,"image":null}

Sure , she gets preachy at times on here , but that 's only on two or three songs , and even those are good . And every time I listen to this album , I love it even more . \" Little Things \" is an okay song for a first single , but there are better songs than that on here . Check out the two highlights , \" Good Man \" , where India tells a story about a man who tells his wife to remember him if he dies someday , and \" Talk to Her \" ( which is still very preachy ) , where India tells men to respect their women . The latter , as well as a few other songs , features Laurnea , who 's been M.I.A. from the industry for a while . Even as a backup singer , she shines like she always did . \" Can I Walk With You \" has that ready - for - VH1 feel to it , as does \" Interested \" , but that does n't make these songs any less engaging . Also , I noticed that \" Slow Down \" has the same melody as last year 's \" Back to the Middle \" . But this album is still solid . Do n't buy it expecting some kind of growth in songwriting or spiritual evolution ( it 's only been a year since her Acoustic Soul album ) .

Johnson","reviewText":"After the multiplatinum success of \" Acoustic Soul \" , India . Arie comes back ( mighty fast , I must add ) with her followup \" Voyage To India \" . The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on \" Voyage \" as this album is severely so - so . First off the production is weaker than on \" Acoustic \" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique ( written in a pseduo - boho\/ I - love - my - self stance).The songs do n't do much for the listener either . Tired duds like \" Little Things \" and the predictably titled \" God Is Love \" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for \" deep \" when they come off like Hallmark card messages . Bland \" folk\"-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead \" Voyage \" on it 's meandering direction . It would n't too bad , I suppose , if the songs did n't come off so pre - programmed for an audience . \" Good Man \" is a ' free - spirited ' urban radio morsel with second - rate Inyala Vanzant - esque writing . Fortunately , \" Voyage \" does n't completely make you fall asleep with dribble . \" The Truth \" wins with some simple - yet - airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it 's second - rate lyrics just make our girl stumble . \" Headed In The Right Direction \" is a wee - bit corny but has a slight Latin - influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired \" love yourself \" retreads . Look , \" Voyage To India \" makes India to be more of a \" Black - girl \" version of bland , \" folk \" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill . And it 's need to be said that just because a Black woman 's not talking about being \" bootylicious \" or partying or \" her man \" and plays an instrument that does n't make her deep . India 's image is way too formatted and manufactured . Her songs on \" Voyage \" are n't   as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time . Not \" deep \" . \n India . Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her ' audience ' . She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the   bland R&B that dominates this album does n't do much for both the listener or her .","summary":"VOYAGE TO MEDIOCRITY","unixReviewTime":1032998400,"image":null}

The grooves swing , the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great . The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record . But you know how an artist 's intentions can be TOO clear ? The messages too in - your - face ? How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you 're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away ? That 's what 's wrong here . The problem I have is with the lyrics : they 're WAY too preachy . I thought that the music was so well - done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio , but that 's turned out to not be the case . A song will come in with a great beat , great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you 're inundated with Sunday School - level lessons for three minutes . Where 's the risk - taking of \" Brown Skin \" or the gutsy self - confidence of \" Video \" ? Where 's the humanity of \" Ready for Love \" or the philisophical punch of \" I See God In You \" ? It 's just not there this time around . It 's almost as if she 's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it 's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages . This album is cursed with the kind of \" We Are the World \" heavy - handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year . Great playing mired in WAY heavy - handed and too - simple lyrics . The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar , which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much - needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity . This , however , is too far at the other end of the love \/ hate spectrum . She 's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well , which is fine , but because of that there 's a lot of not - great sap here too . Not even racy , midnight - mood , slow - jammy sap ... it 's just simplistic I'm - in - love type stuff that , lyrically , you could get anywhere . The shining track here is \" The One \" but it 's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record . This is all a terrible shame ; I wanted to like this one , especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of ( groan ) Alicia Keyes , but this record falls short in the most important department : the message .","summary":"Too preachy, even for fans","unixReviewTime":1032998400,"image":null}

After dabbling with country on the \" Riddles In The Sand \" album , Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on \" Mango \" . \" Please Bypass This Heart \" is nothing spectacular , but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it 's best with \" If The Phone Does n't Ring , It 's Me \" . I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song ( this is coming from a guy who does not like country music ) . Other highlights on the album include \" Frank And Lola \" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re - kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida . \" Desperation Samba \" is another great Buffett \" south of the border \" tune . The title track \" Last Mango In Paris \" is classic Buffett . The album closer \" Beyond The End \" is a song a lot of Buffett fans do n't seem to care for , but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc . The album also includes several of Buffett 's popular concert favorites \" Jolly Mon \" and \" Gypsies In The Palace \" . Some of the production on this album is very 80 's oriented which dates it a bit , but overall this is another good album from Jimmy .","summary":"Nice Mid-80's Album","unixReviewTime":1163030400,"image":null}

After the fairly putrid Riddles In The Sand , he comes back strong with the perfect mix of satire and Caribbean rhythms . He is at his storytelling best in songs like \" Frank & Lola \" , \" Desperation Samba \" , the hilariously heartbreaking \" If The Phone Does n't Ring , It 's Me \" , the superb title track and the adventurous \" Gypsies In The Palace \" ( which has Harrison Ford on the bullwhip ) . \" Jolly Mon Sing \" has taken a life of it 's own becoming the basis for children 's book he wrote with his daughter . It may well be the pinnacle of his calypso songs . Last Mango In Paris is often forgotten , but essential Jimmy Buffett album .","summary":"In The Buffet Line","unixReviewTime":979084800,"image":null}

The prime example of Johnny 's musical intimacy came nearly at the end of his life when he did a cover of Nice Inch Nails song Hurt . The song is definitely something still worth listening too . Not just from Johnny 's voice , but also because of his simplicity of the guitar and piano .

And after the solemnities of \" Ys , \" apparently Newsom has decided to go a bit more lighthearted . \" Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band \" is an unpretentious little EP , with some new songs and new takes on older songs -- a fun little treat . It opens with the strong folky chords of \" Colleen , \" a slice of Celtic - flavoured balladry that trickles through an oddball melody . \" I tell it as I best know how , \" croons Newsom in her crazy - fairy voice . \" Pick me up and toss me round \/ I lost my shoes and tore my best gown ... \" \n\n She then follows it up with new versions of two older songs : the gentle haunting reimagining of \" Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie , \" and a full - band version of \" Cosmia , \" which seems nicely fleshed - out and polished . After to the legendary grandeur of \" Ys , \" this little EP seems relaxed and laid - back , as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set . They 're done with an ear for fun , but that does n't take the delicate , appealing edge from the music . Her twangly , delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes , and what sounds like some soft drums , all mingled together . In \" Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie , \" we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp . And over it all is Newsom 's creaky , meandering vocals , wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy .

There is not one up - tempo song   in sight , just slow jams and mid - tempos . Everyone does n't always like fast music anyway ; I 'm one of them . I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music . I get so tired of it , I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays . \" Love Calls \" was the first single from \" Kemistry \" and what a fantastic song it is ! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about . This song is very laid back and mellow ; it 's sure to put one in a romantic mindset . Also , the lyrics are really good . He 's letting the listening know that when love calls , there is no where to hide . \" Inside \" and \" Cherish this Moment \" are fine moments on the album . These tracks actually bring Sade to mind . I love the hook on \" Inside \" simply because it 's catchy . This album is slightly flawed because it was boring in a few areas , but overall , I was impressed . He did a fine job . Mikeisha 's Top 5 \n\n 1 . \" Inside \" \n 2 . \" Love Calls \" \n 4 . \" I 'm Missin ' Your Love \" \n 5 . \" Miss You \"","summary":"\"Kemistry\"","unixReviewTime":1244332800,"image":null}

Now on to the music - initially when I heard his first single , LOVE CALLS , I thought it was Al Jarreau but as the song went on I realized that it was a new artist named Kem . The rest of the songs are totally and unmistakably , KEM ! ! I love the vibe of this entire album and had a hard time not pressing repeat on a few songs , namely : LOVE CALLS , MATTER OF TIME , SAY & YOU ARE . Yes , it is more of a \" chill out \" album but certainly not one that bored me - I found myself paying attention to the adult lyrics and the beautiful music production . I 'd highly recommend this disc to lovers of r&b mixed with subtle jazz notes - it 's a great debut from a real artist who I hope to hear much more from in the future ( despite his sorry label and lack of promotion ) .","summary":"Kemistry","unixReviewTime":1190592000,"image":null}

I did not have a boyfriend back in the days because I valued music more than most of the boys I knew and they were too shy to want to dance . This song came on and one of my high school crushes came and asked me to dance . It did not matter that he could not dance very well , I was just on top of the world that I was dancing to one of my favorite groups singing my favorite song at the time . LTD was not the same for me once Jeffrey Osborne left the group but I still listen to his music . It was and is still soothing , I play it when I am studying or when I am having trouble falling asleep or when I want to go back to sweet memories .

After listening to each song on this album the soothing vocals , music and lyrics he has establish a following with me along with other fans because is breath of Fresh Air from the   Music Mainstream . If you like new comer John Legend , Kem is Several notch better than John Legend .

Sure , the ' 90s have all but stomped it out due to the ubiquitous presence of hip - hop 's \" dark \" side ( heavily - programmed instruments , blatant sampling , offensive lyrics , bad singing ) . However , thanks to budding artists like Kem Owens , soul music has finally come around full - circle after 20 + years of musical diarrhea . Kem 's sparkling debut should truly set the standard in terms of what to look for in good soul music : REAL INSTRUMENTS ( played by REAL MUSICIANS , of course ) , REAL SONGS ( inspired , meaningful lyrics and solid composition skills ) , and REAL SINGING ABILITY ( knowing HOW to sing in addition to having vocal talent ) . If more and more artists today would just adhere to these relatively simple guidelines , then there would n't be so much bad music out there to begin with . An album containing a few hit singles and a load of filler does n't do it for me . That 's why I 'm recommending ' Kemistry ' to ANYONE who honestly craves good music without the hype to go with it . It 's no wonder why most reviewers on here keep giving this album 5 stars . So do I.

Maybe the DJ did n't know , because nobody else did either . When I finally found out the song was from a newcomer named Kem and that his album Kemistry was out , my brother and sister told me to pick the album up . And boy , talk about good advice . Since \" Love Calls \" is the first single , it 's probably also the most recognizable song on the album - but I do n't know if I would necessarily say it 's the best song . Not to say it is n't a great song , but there are other great tracks too , like \" Inside \" ( no , it 's not about sex ) and the gospel - flavored \" This Place \" . And \" Brotha Man \" is a great storytelling track . With ten tracks at around 47 minutes , it 's clear that Kem is n't a debut artist who 's trying to overprove himself . And he does n't need to , because every song on this album is great . So why is n't he getting the recognition he deserves ? Probably because he 's on Motown , the label that seems to only promote artists when they feel like it ( see also Remy Shand ) . But hopefully Kem will soon sell several copies of this great release .","summary":"There ain't a thing wrong with this album","unixReviewTime":1052179200,"image":null}

Well not new just different from most contemporary music today . Essentially he 's a jazz singer when you break it down . Listening to his CD is like an extended set of the \" Oasis After Dark \" . He released this CD on his own a year ago and after sellin 10,000 copies he managed to get the attention of Motown . Listening to this CD is difficult because while the tone is great and his vocals are good there seems to be something missing . I often found myself asleep before the CD was finished . Kinda like listening to one of those \" Sounds of The Earth \" CD 's ... or something to help you go to sleep . 10 distinct songs about love and life . He goes from an Al Jarreau sound on Track 7 \" Brotha Man \" till a Simply Redd feel on Track 3 \" Say \" , my favorite track on the CD by the way . Soothing is the best thing I guess you can say about this CD . A nice CD to go to sleep to . Now whether that 's a compliment or not I 'm not sure . This is definitely not for everyone , but the Jazz Enthusiast will probably be more likely to find use for this CD . \" Is it like Floetry \" ? No . They are more hip than this CD . \" Is It like SADE \" ? No . She invokes more soul in her music . No . Jarreau is more livelier than this cat . This one still kind puzzles me .

At first listen , I could hear the purity and the many dimensions of that VOICE , which is soothing , smooth like 18 year old Appleton , seductive , and playful . Kem is not your ordinary run of the mill singer but an extraordinary song stylist . His voice dips and dives , rounds syllables ( much like Al , Anita , & Phyllis ) , scats , and just downright croons . After getting ahold of Kemistry I was not dissappointed , rather joyous of the fact that I owned a solid musical experience . This is adult music at its finest . The ambience is intimate and jazzy . The instrumentation is also complimentary to Kem 's vocal prowess . There are also nice percussive elements that add to the vibe of the cd .

First , on the Hank Williams tribute album , \" Timeless \" , where she did a cover of his classic tale of love 's trials and tribulations \" Cold , Cold Heart \" . I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself . I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of \" Cold , Cold Heart \" . I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt 's \" Beulah Land \" on his tribute album . Finally , I noted the fine job that she did on a duet with John Prine on \" Wedding Bells \" on his \" In Spite Of Ourselves \" cover album of country classics . That said , although I have high , very high regard for Ms. Williams ' cover work I am more ambivalent about her own albums . I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs . She , obviously , can write thoughtfully of love , lost , the cruel nature of the world , her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above - mentioned efforts is missing here . A few do , however , stand out . \" Mama You Sweet \" , \" Words \" , \" West \" and \" Rescue \" clearly rise to the occasion .

That album was so influential that it seems that all of her albums after that point will be compared to it , which might account for all the negative reviews for her latest album , West . Actually , now that I think about it , this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one - star reviews and now I 'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options . But if this is your first Lucinda Williams album , I suggest you get educated on some of her earlier material first . She does n't sound different or anything , but , well , Lucinda is another one of those singers that makes great songs yet she does n't have a great voice , so if you 're not a fan of hers , this album might put you to sleep . But it really IS very accessible . Lucinda composed this album following the death of her mother , which is probably why most of the songs are mellow . They do n't drown into each other though , as I can easily pick up highlights like \" Are You Alright \" , \" Learning How to Live \" and the title track . And the songs about her mother are poignant yet exceptional , as shown in \" Mama You Sweet \" and especially \" Fancy Funeral \" . But my favorite song would probably have to be \" Words \" . It might not be her best album , but it 's far above - average , so if you want to find exceptional music , go west .","summary":"Continuing in the right direction","unixReviewTime":1181088000,"image":null}

A moody collection of life , love and Americana , the record testifies to her ever - evolving talent and drive for musical perfection . Williams is a tough chick -- the kind you would n't want to get on the wrong side of -- but her sensitivity comes to the forefront once again . \" Are You Alright ? , \" the lead single and opening track , is beautiful in its stark vulnerability . Asking questions such as , \" Do you have someone to hug and kiss you ? \" and \" Is there anything I can do ? , \" Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would - be lover . She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored , unyielding honesty . This upfront quality permeates the collection . \" Everything Has Changed , \" for instance , underscores the monotony of life , whereas the richly melodic \" What If \" has Williams questioning many so - called facts of life . \" Where Is My Love ? \" is passionate and pleading in its quest for the ultimate affirmation , appropriately going hand in hand with the autobiographical song \" Learning How to Live . \" A particular standout , the latter finds Williams picking up the pieces of her life and moving on after a difficult breakup : \n\n \" ' All I have left is this dime store ring \/ But I would n't trade it for anything \/ The days ahead will never be the same \/ For you I might have even changed my name \/ I'm learning how to live . \" \n\n The melancholy edge of the disc can also be attributed to the recent death of her mother , whom she pays tribute to in the desperate yet understated \" Mama You Sweet . \" This experience surely played a part in the composition of another standout track , \" Fancy Funeral . \" : \n\n \" So do n't buy a fancy funeral \/ It 's not worth it in the end \/ Goodbyes can still be beautiful \/ With all the money that you 'll spend \/ There 's no amount of riches \/ Can bring back what you lost . \" \n\n Her search for love continues on the haunting , lyrically intense \" Unsuffer Me . Alternately , \" Rescue \" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress . Different melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album . \" Wrap My Head Around That \" has funky , organic grooves with clean - cut lyrics that do n't mess around with pretense or metaphors , and the surprisingly upbeat \" Come On \" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame . \" Words \" attests to the life - affirming power of language , whether uttered or harbored within , providing the most seductive melody of the disc , while the title track closes the album with her most evocative lyrics yet : \n\n \" I sleep out in the desert \/ Under the stars above \/ And keep making an effort \/ To wander into love \/ Who knows what the future holds \/ Or where the cards may fall \/ But if you do n't come out west and see \/ You'll never know at all . \" \n\n Williams will likely never be able to replicate the cultural impact of her already classic 1998 album \" Car Wheels On a Gravel Road , \" but \" West \" proves that her talents as a musician continue to mature . With her compelling abilities to connect with listeners on such an intricate , personal level , it is no surprise that more than 20 years into her career , her fanbase only continues to expand . iTunes and Best Buy are among a myriad of music retailers that sell slightly different versions of \" West , \" offering various bonus demos of the album 's selections .","summary":"Go West Young Man","unixReviewTime":1174262400,"image":null}

The current decade has found Williams to be very productive , with 2001 's \" Essence \" and 2003 's \" World Without Tears \" studio albums and one live album . Now comes the new studio album . On \" West \" ( 13 tracks , 69 min . ) , Lucinda Williams sings about her usual topics of relationships , loss , loneliness , heartache . She also confronts the death of her mother ( \" Mama You Sweet \" and \" Fancy Funeral \" ) . The opener \" Are You Alright \" sets the tone for the album : a slow - tempo , aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame . There are not many up - tempo songs on here , which may bother some people , but it does n't bother me as in the end this is a mood album . Highlights for me include \" Unsuffer Me \" , which is the best song on this album ; the bitter yet funny \" Come On \" ; the epic 9 + Min . \" Wrap My Head Around That \" ; the sweet \" Words \" ; and the title track , which closes the album . The CD I bought came also with a 2 song ( 11 min . ) bonus CD , which brings demo versions of \" Where Is My Love \" and \" Rescue \" . Nice , but not really essential . In all , I have come to like this album more with every listen . This is certainly not the most accessible Lucinda Williams , nor her best ( that would still be \" Car Wheels \" ) , but this is a rich album in every sense . But it 's not for anyone in a hurry . I saw Lucinda Williams live on her \" World Without Tears \" tour , and was blown away by her stage presence .

With many dope recognizable singles such as \" Music Makes Me High \" , \" Renee \" , and \" Lex , Coups ... \" ( there is a remix floating out there I strongly recommend you hear ) . But what separates this crew from other groups is personalty . Mr. Cheeks is very charismatic on the microphone , and Freaky Tah plays the background vocals ( those unfamiliar , think of him being what Flava Flav is to Chuck D in Public Enemy , only more serious ) . One reason that makes this album great is their creative hooks , some of them will have you remembering for a while . \" Music Makes Me High \" , and \" The Yearn \" are both entertaining ( although I believe \" Da Game \" is very similar to the latter song ) . \" 1,2,3 \" is another great song too with the late Freaky Tah on the solo . \" Get Up \" is another song to easily remember , and slightly changes the atmosphere on the album . Other dope tracks to check out are the title song , and \" Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless \" . This album is great for the ' 95\/'96 era and can easily stack up to the many east coast hip hop albums that came out around that time .

This album had an impact in that was summed up well by one reviewer that said : \" When this album dropped in ' 96 , everybody 's ears perked up a bit and heads turned . \" This was one of those albums that you could turn on and just zone out to . Tracks like \" The Yearn \" , \" Music Makes Me High \" , and \" Get Up \" were sure to get any party started while cuts like \" Legal Drug Money \" , \" All Right \" , \" Straight From The Ghetto \" , and \" 1,2,3 \" were equally effective tales of ghetto life . Then you throw in classics tracks like \" Jeeps , Lex Coups , Bimaz , & Benz \" , \" Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless \" , and \" Renee \" and you have as good a rap album as you 're gon na find on the east coast . Even the intro is hot without taking all day to get to the point . This is easily the best album released by the Lost Boyz . It seems that Mr Cheeks leads the charge while Freaky Tah picks up the slack . Tah does n't rhyme much , but he does manage to spit a few bars on \" Legal Drug Money \" , \" The Yearn \" , \" All Right \" , and \" 1,2,3 \" . And when he 's not rhyming , he 's ad libbing in the background on most songs ( do n't front like I was the only one that was singing along with Tah in most of those songs ) . There are a few shortcomings that keep this album from achieving classic status . Freaky Tah has a very simplistic flow that can come off as boring from time to time ( but not often ) . Then there are tracks like \" Da Game \" and \" Is This The Part \" that could 've been left off the album and no one would 've missed it . Aside from those mishaps , the rest of the album is flawless . It 's been 8 years since this album came out ( damn , that was 8 years ago ? ! ) and you can still zone out to it in 2004 .

As I recall , she played a new song she said she 'd recently written , \" Everything Has Changed . \" I preordered Lucinda 's \" West \" set while my wife was still here . Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe . Lucinda lost her mother ; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me , they punctuate every breath I take . I spin the CD & Lucinda 's gentle aching voice comes on , \" Are you alight ? \" When people ask me that , I want to say , \" He*l no ! \" But when she sings , \" All of a sudden you went away ; I hope you come back around someday ; I have n't seen you in a real long time ; Could you give me some kind of sign ? Are you alright ? Cause I 've been feeling a little scared , \" it sounds like she 's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love . What an amazing song , \" Just tell me that you 're okay . \" If this were the only song on the CD , it 'd be worth it . \" Unsuffer Me \" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss . Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it . \" Anoint my head with your sweet kiss , my joy is dead ; I long for bliss , \" she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone 's electric guitar churns mercilessly . Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity . During my wife 's last weeks , my daughter said to me , \" It 's like watching a train wreck ; you ca n't look away . \" There something of that strength that comes through in Williams ' music . Other cuts are also amazing . \" Learning How to Live \" is a breakup song , adjusting to loss . \" Fancy Funeral \" may sound a bit bizarre , but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed . The sheer force of Lucinda 's anger in \" Come On \" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed - breakup song , \" Dude , you 're so fired ; shut up , I 'm not inspired . \" \" Words \" has Lucinda 's voice , weathered , worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best , writing a good song .

It 's darker than some of Lucinda 's other releases . It may not be for all Williams fans ; it certainly is very different and more experimental than her last three albums . If you 're uncertain about it the first time , give it a couple of other spins -- it'll grow on you . The depth of emotion and Lucinda 's raw vocals ( meaning they were n't re - recorded -- producer Hal Wilner used the demo vocal tracks as he loved the emotion in the performances ) give this album an extra kick . I 've seen some mixed reviews from fans here -- I suspect this is an album that fans will probably come back to later and realize how good it is . Clearly under the influence of later Dylan ( perhaps \" Time Out of Mind \" ) , the album features a nice mixture of midtempo numbers and killer ballads . Williams ' voice which aches with longing and bitterness in many of these songs continues to be one of her strengths in addition to her top notch songwriting . She strikes reminds me somewhat of John Hiatt . \" Words \" has one of the sweetest melodies Williams has come up with the opening line sums up much of this album--\"I would rather suffer in sweet silent solitude \" . She may feel like she 's in solitude but these moving , observant songs open up a world to music fans everywhere . The music clips might be a bit deceptive . This is a moody , atmospheric album ( even more so than her previous efforts ) . It also sounds even more personal than usual . The musicians that provide backing on the album including vets such as Jim Keltner give the album a distinctive sound . Producer Hal Willner does a great job of capturing the rich , distinctive qualities of Williams ' voice . This is one of Williams ' finest albums holding its own with \" Lucinda Williams \" , \" Sweet Old World \" and \" Car Wheels on a Gravel Road \" . Be aware , however , if you are a Williams fan that this is probably one of her more experimental albums and one of her most moody , atmospheric productions yet . Kudos to Hal Willner who convinced Williams to keep many of her raw , demo vocals for the album . What they may lack in polish they make up for in emotion . BestBuy is currently offering an edition with a second disc featuring two demos for tracks on the main album . \" Where Is My Love \" and \" Rescue \" ( both terrific songs ) . Personally , I 'd love to hear some acoustic demos or performances of some of these songs vs. electric demos but that 's me .","summary":"Williams' latest a gem but if you're expecting \"Car Wheels\" you'll be disappointed","unixReviewTime":1171584000,"image":null}

Finefrock","reviewText":"Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be . With the success of CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD , that relentless fight finally paid dividends as the commerce finally caught up with her art . Rather than repeating CAR WHEELS formula over and over , Lucinda left behind the Southern travel logs and delved into more emotional material . The songs on ESSENCE and WORLD WITHOUT TEARS not only dug into the deeper depths of her psyche , but also loosened up musically , mixing more rock and hard blues into her Americana palette . WEST seems like a logical extension of the two previous albums emotionally , while moving into new territory musically . Produced by veteran Hal Willner , WEST takes a quantum leap from her previous releases by taking arrangements far beyond where her previous music went . Saving the vocals and guitar from demos , the songs are built up layer by layer with strings and keyboards and various session players including Jim Keltner and Bill Frisell to create music quite different from her past efforts . The good news is that the production is not camouflage for weak material . Williams has delivered a solid set of tunes , at times harrowing , as she pokes at he emotional scabs of broken relationships and the death of her mother . I can see how this material will put some off , when they are looking for material closer to CAR WHEELS regional sketches . Still , you can not deny the solid songwriting on songs like WHERE IS MY LOVE , WORDS ( a ode to her poetic muse ) and ARE YOU ALRIGHT ? Other songs like UNSUFFER ME , RESCUE and the talking blues \/ rap of WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT move into new territory , to my ears at least , with great success . I 'm glad that there are artists like Lucinda Williams who choose to challenge themselves and their fans with each new output of work . Those that take the ride with WEST will be rewarded with a CD of solid songs and performances that rank with the best of Lucinda 's previous work . WEST seems to me to be the end of a trilogy of work that includes her post CAR WHEELS work . If you 're not a big fan of the previous two albums , you 'll more than likely be disappointed with this new one . In that case there is always the back catalog to enjoy . I 'll be interested to see what new directions she chooses in the future , and will no doubt , continue to enjoy this CD for years to come .","summary":"Go West 4 1\/2 *'s","unixReviewTime":1171324800,"image":null}

The lead singer , a man called Graham Bonnet , does an awesome job of getting the message , and ' feeling , ' behind the Title ( and lyrics ) out to the listener . The video inspired me to purchase this song , and , although my mood is not always angry , spiteful , or vengeful - I am usually able , upon ' demand , ' to ' conjure up ' the proper memories and female related pain and torment to completely , and thoroughly , enjoy this classic British rock song from the late 1970 's ! You ca n't literally give 110 % in anything that you do - the numbers will simply not allow it . But ( and you need to watch the video to fully understand appreciate where I am coming from here ) in this case , with this song , and in this video , 110 % is , in fact , given .","summary":"For every man that has ever been hurt by a 'chick!'","unixReviewTime":1431475200,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51VTwnhnRcL._SY88.jpg"]}

Longtime fans call it their poppiest , and while it 's definitely the mellowest , that does n't mean that it 's not noisy or self - indulgent for the mainstream . While the lyrics do n't mean all that much , it adds up the eccentricness of the album , making it more fun with each listen . About the only other flaw with this album is that Lee Ranaldo does n't sing on any tracks on this album . \" Bull in the Heather \" is a classic , as is its video with that Le Tigre girl cameoed in it . Kim has an excellent voice on it , as well as it being loved among the fans . The outro part sounds real cool . Opener \" Winner 's Blues \" is a real nice track , as it 's an acoustic - like track , a brilliant track on this album . I just love \" In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader \" . It 's a punk - like track here , probably the fastest one , and Thurston sounds as if he 's having a lot of fun during the recording of it . Then it goes into \" Sweet Shine \" the only song with any real length on the album . It 's a great love song . She has some pretty interesting tracks as well . Her style overall has a sexy sound to it . \" Bone \" is very awesome , I love the energy of the drums on it , then the chords are well - progressed . It 's just a real memorable one on this album . ' Experiental Jet Set , Trash and No Star ' is something that really shines on track 12 \" Tokyo Eye \" , a very noisy song . It 's very awesome to listen to either in the car or on your stereo . This one 's good for introducing people to SY . I got this January of this year , and I think it 's excellent . There are some flaws , but overall , I think it 's pretty good . The songs are very short , which helps , 'cuz it does n't really contain enough epic stuff . So yeah , I am recommending it here . if you do n't like the mainstream much and think that this sounds cool , like I do .","summary":"SY's most overlooked album","unixReviewTime":1056153600,"image":null}

Often proclaimed to be one of females rawest and toughest albums this album took me as a suprise it is nowhere near the desription I read . Dry may be perhaps PJ . Less accesible efforts along with Is This Desire however it is an aquired taste and of course what kind of music you listen to . Less heavy and hard rocking and agressive as it 's follow - up Rid Of Me . Dry has 7 fantastic songs Oh Stella , Victory , Happy And Bleeding , Sheela - Na - Gig , Hair , Plants and Rass and Water but the 4 other tracks are so forgettable . And also do to poor production the album which was obviously recorded in mono does not deliver the goods that it is supposed to deliver . It is sometimes disturbing and heavy but it does n't exactly kick your butt because it is so hidden . It also laks in great hooks and brilliant guitar riffs like her other albums . However PJ .

But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition . Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session . The song , \" I 'll Have to Let Him Go , \" which is not included in this collection , was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas . The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes , although the lineup changed over the years ; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites , Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese ) . The group 's second single \" Come and Get These Memories \" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way . Other Top 5 hits included \" Dancing in the Street , \" \" \" Nowhere to Run , \" \" Jimmy Mack , \" \" I 'm Ready for Love , \" \" ( Love Is Like A ) Heat Wave , \" and \" Honey Chile . \" These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968 , when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip . The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown , Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame , Class of 1995 . This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group 's hits , but is limited to only 11 cuts . Consequently , while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy .","summary":"The very best of Martha & the Vandellas","unixReviewTime":1043625600,"image":null}

The same guy who played organ in the Spencer Davis Group ? \" You automatically get a road map of Winwood 's new 80 's direction . It 's a direction of synthesizers dominating his sounds , and soloing with unique keyboard phrases that defines this era of his career . The instrumentations that are put together also fail to adhered some kinda of unity , but this is excused because Steve Winwood played all the instruments . Winwood also engineered and mixed the whole album . In my opinion when it comes to artists that play all their instruments on their albums I put Arc Of A Diver in the top 5 . Their are some good uptempo danceable songs like \" Second Hand Women \" , and \" Night Train . \" \" Slowdown Sundown \" is more classic Winwood ballad . You can hear the organ , but their is also a beautiful multimoog solo . Their are only seven tracks on this album , and a important album in Steve Winwoods career .

One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic \/ harmonic instincts he might 've developed during his Traffic period . Also he might 've also had the sense that , although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi , that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall . And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings . The result was this album - one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist . \" While You See A Chance \" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for . With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction ? This is essentially an electronic \/ new wave re - imagining of the uptempo gospel \/ soul he started doing from the outset . The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder - like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number . \" Second Hand Human \" is a hugely melodic , chiming synthesizer heavy pop \/ pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album . Starting off as a melodic , folksy ballad \" Slowdown Sundown \" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains . \" Spanish Dancer \" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody . \" Night Train \" is a sleekly electronic jazz \/ funk jam while the dynamic ballad \" Dust concludes the album . Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose . Winwood did n't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out . He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco \/ new wave synthesizer touches . And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive . He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them . I include Prince and Stevie Wonder in with that too . Although this album does have its detractors for that very reason among some of the less tolerant followers of the \" keeping it real \" music critic brigade ? It would be very difficult to debate how much this album successfully extended on what was started on Winwood 's commercially failed debut album and actually began an entirely new and fruitful career for him as a solo artist with a lot to say .","summary":"Steve Winwood Sees A Chance And Takes It","unixReviewTime":1399852800,"image":null}

It is said that Winwood was seriously considering giving up on his musical career and this album was his last throw of the dice ; what a throw !

Winwood 's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug - smuggling was unjustly convicted makes even disco pap like \" Second Hand Woman \" and \" Spanish Dancer \" bearable , and results in ARC OF A DIVER being an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience .","summary":"Steve Winwood's Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1118793600,"image":null}

Honestly , the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time , absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy . Sting has made some really remarkable songs , and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today , who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music . One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90 's , Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today , as you would expect from Sting himself . I have loved this song for years , and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever . It is just too sad that the stars of today , well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce ' Knowles and Rihanna , can not even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has . If you have never even heard a Sting song before , well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to .","summary":"Desert Blooms","unixReviewTime":1471046400,"image":null}

He has been doing it for 30 years on his own , and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police . I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock . But when he has a song come out , people will really listen to him , most of the time . When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999 , many people were n't very eager at listening to the album at first , after the title track was released . However when Desert Rose was released as a single , many people really flocked over to the album . Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting 's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work . I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90 's . Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold . This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan .","summary":"Blooming Rose","unixReviewTime":1453334400,"image":null}

I was in high school when these guys rocked the world with ' Buddy Holly ' . It meant nothing to me at the time though . Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90 's ( You know , the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE 's thing . I did n't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth . I was just super lame . ) Looking back on it now , after having enjoyed Weezer for the last decade or so , they really are amazing . They have a distinctive sound that 's very alternative but also very much their own . It 's also not a hard sound . I find their instrumentals to be soothing ear candy . And it 's not an accident that ' Buddy Holly ' is the song everyone remembers form the blue album . It 's the best song on the album . Yeah it 's the one with the most radio play , but that 's because it 's awesome . ' Susanne ' is a close second , mainly because it reminds me of the closing credits to Mallrats . ( Which I loved in the 90 's but had no idea it was Weezer sining . I told you I was lame . ) But ' Susanne ' is only available on the deluxe version of the Blue Album . It 's not available via the Prime streaming option . If you 're buying the album , the Deluxe version is the only way to go .

When they made their mark in 1994 , Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling , uninspiring grunge clones . Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate , they did , however , create a quite perfect debut , one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today . Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today , but Weezer remain vital , and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple . You ca n't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who , whether they realize it or not , knows a good Weezer tune . So , it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release , a Deluxe Edition made it 's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b - sides , outtakes , demos , live songs etc . The question is , is it worth buying again ? A resounding yes . For starters , I 'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it , what better time to get yourself another copy . And even if it 's still in perfect condition , the bonus material is worth it alone , for the Weezer fanatic . I do n't have to tell you how good the original album is . It 's perfect , front to back . The material on the second disc , while admittedly not as good as the album itself , is still worthy . Take , for example , Rivers ' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub , \" Mykel and Carli \" ( who passed away in a tragic car accident ) , with it 's chorus that , in typical Weezer fashion , sticks in your head for the rest of your life . \" Suzanne \" and \" Jamie \" are probably the most well - known b - sides among Weezer fans , while a trio of demos -- referred to as \" The Kitchen Tapes \" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history . There are also live songs ( \" My Name Is Jonas \" & \" Surf Wax America \" ) and acoustic versions ( \" Jamie \" and \" No One Else \" ) , and to top it all off , for the diehard fans , the original mix of \" Say It Ai n't So \" ( which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album ) . Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics ( finally ) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer . The package is very well done , and surely outshines the bare - bones nature of the original release . Overall , a good album just got even better . Despite it 's price tag , the average Weezer fan just should not be without this . It might make you love the band even more . You definitely get your money 's worth . And as I said before , the original album itself is just classic . Say what you will about Weezer 's newer material , but this stuff just ca n't be beat . They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty . I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album , an accomplishment a lot of musicians can not acheive .","summary":"A Great Way To Revisit A Great Album -- And Then Some!","unixReviewTime":1113436800,"image":null}

In the aftermath of grunge and the death of Kurt Cobain , along came four noisy geeks who made the world safe for noisy hook laden songs about loudmouthed girlfriends ( \" No One Else \" ) , the joys of high - school love ( \" Buddy Holly \" ) and a great metaphor about an unraveling relationship ( \" Undone - The Sweater Song \" ) . Along with seven other great songs , this was a first album that yielded some perennial material , and founded the cult that Rivers Coumo rides today . So why should you pony up the extra dough for the \" expanded \" edition ? Is the second disc really worth it ? For a change , the answer is yes . You get four great live tracks , complete with some funny self depreciating comments , one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer ( \" Jamie \" ) , and a handful of demos . The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled \" My Evaline \" that highlights Weezer 's uncanny harmony abilities , something occasionally lost in the din .

I take this songs meaning to symbolize the singers way of truthfully admitting that we do live in a world where many people are prejudged ( even outside of Hollywood)based on physical appearance \/ weight . This song actually creeped into my dreams as an adult after I reluctantly accepted that I must get a handle on my weight not just for health reasons but reasons having to do with getting a job and how my value as a woman may be perceived ( whether I like it or not ) . I took this song being in my dream as an intuitive warning to accept that reality that I just mentioned without feeling self - pity ( I prefer to avoid public sharing when I had that dream ) . Nonetheless , The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson is a rock song with depth that explores a persons journey to greatness without letting the physical appearance judgements consume them .","summary":"Judging A Book By Is Cover Song?","unixReviewTime":1452988800,"image":null}

I was just a little disappointed that they did not include her 1986 minor hit \" Wise Up \" . I really like that song but it is not included on here . Also \" I Will Be Your Friend \" and \" Big Yellow Taxi \" , are not included here as well . They also could of included her Christmas single \" Tennessee Christmas \" .

In Europe , an expanded 13 - track collection was released adding the other three but this version is long out of print . So this album , apart from being a high quality original album , also served as hits volume 2 until the more comprehensive Definitive Collection was released . The one track that made it onto the American hits collection is Where 've you been , which has become Kathy 's signature song . However , in this particular song it is the lyrics that people seem to love - they relate to the sentiments expressed . The other hits were all upbeat , catchy songs - Come from the heart , Burning old memories and She came from Fort Worth Texas . Of the other songs , my favorite is Hills of Alabam . No surprise , really , as this was written and originally recorded by my favorite bluegrass singer , Claire Lynch , who adds backing vocals . Claire 's own version can be found on an untitled album by the Front porch string band , of which she was lead singer . The title track is also excellent , as are Here 's hoping , True north , Love chooses you and I 'll take care of you . While I slightly prefer her two previous albums ( Walk the way the wind blows , Untasted honey ) , there is n't much to choose between the three and those two are better represented on that hits collection . So if you already have that , this should be the next Kathy Mattea album on your shopping list .","summary":"An excellent album from the eighties","unixReviewTime":1082332800,"image":null}

Boyz II Men put Philly on the map as well as laid themselves a strong foundation in R&B with that album . There was only one way they could have went after Cooleyhighharmony : up . And they did with this superb sophomore release . There are too many tracks that are vintage Boyz II Men tracks . Thank You , All Around The World , Vibin and U Know are excellent tracks the the Philly quartet . I 'll Make Love To You and On Bended Knee were on Blender(cheap knockoff of Rolling Stone ) and Vh1 as awesomely bad songs countdown but those love ballads are classics so the hell with Blender and VH1 ! These are the songs that these immature little freaks were conceived to and they have the nerve to trash it but never once do they mention any Eminem , D12 or any Shady records artists as well as Justin Timberlake . Are they trying to say that none of these artists make awesomely bad records ? Really ? I find that type of favoritism questionable . Plus forms of media like Vh1 , Blender and GQ only appeal to idiotic trendies that think that saying \" Meh \" at the beginning of every sentence and defending movies that stink to high heaven makes them hip . 50 Candles , Water Runs Dry , Trying Times and Yesterday are more smooth R&B ballads that give this album a much needed boost . There are no bad songs on this album so I 'll keep going on . Bottom Line : Boyz II Men 's II is the best sophomore album from an R&B quartet of all time . The ballads are exceptional and the fast songs are n't bad plus the group still has what most groups R&B groups now sorely lack : harmony . If you love 90s R&B in its purest form you ca nt go wrong with this sophomore effort by Boyz II Men . Standouts : THANK YOU , ALL AROUND THE WORLD , U KNOW , VIBIN , TRYING TIMES , I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU , ON BENDED KNEE , WATER RUNS DRY and YESTERDAY .","summary":"The boyz became men","unixReviewTime":1235692800,"image":null}

Over a piano solo , Boyz II Men harmonize on \" Khilil ( Interlude ) \" to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with \" Trying Times \" written and produced by Wanya Morris , Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson . Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights \" I 'll Make Love To You \" and \" Water Runs Dry \" .

They have a wonderful \" old school \" flavor reminiscent of the old doowop guy groups of 1960s . This is especially evident in the four part harmonies , the smooth and romantic lyrics and the original interpretations of old standards ( \" Yesterday \" ) . Where do I begin to describe the mood of this wonderful and innovative R&B album ? We have the funky , catchy \" Thank You \" that samples from \" La - Di - Da - Di \" performed by Doug E. Fresh . The hook is infectious ! We have \" All Around the World \" to get you up and dancing , no doubt . One of my personal favorites is \" I Sit Away , \" written by Tony Rich ( of the Tony Rich Project fame ) . It has a haunting hook and a beautiful , introspective feel . Truly an ode to solitude . There are also a couple of songs on this album that became huge hits for the fellas back in the early 1990s . They include \" I 'll Make Love to You \" ( on those songs to get you in the mood ) , and \" Water Runs Dry . \" \n\n One of the strongest points of this album is the luscious arrangements and fine tuning of production on each of the cuts . Even my least favorite of the songs--\"50 Candles\"--has a very sexy , clean and catchy arrangment . And all of you young ones out there , do n't write the Boyz as just another R&B band from the 1990s . They were truly in a class by themselves .","summary":"so sexy, soulful and thoroughly enjoyable....","unixReviewTime":1095033600,"image":null}

Oh come on , the first 3 , of course not , they are completely different , and terrific in their own genres ... but Kenny G , DOH ! I think the Boyz would give up singing if they ever heard that one . Comparing Boyz 2 Men to Kenny G is like comparing silk to polyester , prime rib to hamburger , Belgian chocolates to dog chocolates and champagne to grape juice .

' You also get some of his finest songs of the 1990s as a country chart topper , including ' Lead On ' and ' Carrying Your Love With Me . ' And , MCA did a great job remastering the songs too . The sound quality is excellent ! Overall , this is a great set to own . And if you own ' Greatest Hits Vol . 2 ' and\/or ' Greatest Hits , ' pair it with this , and you have a mighty fine George collection . Highly recommended for the new or casual Strait fan .

It shows that George 's style was evolving but still firmly rooted in traditional country music . The album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album , the first ( The best day ) being an excellent ballad . The second song ( Murder on music row ) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle , a bluegrass performer . Here , George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson . George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet , George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song . While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place , they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days . The remaining tracks are taken from just four albums , these being Lead on ( Adalida , Lead on , You ca n't make a heart love somebody ) , Blue clear sky ( the title track , Carried away , I can still make it to Cheyenne , King of the mountain ) , Carrying your love with me ( the title track , Round about way , One night at a time , Today my word slipped away ) and One step at a time ( True , We really should n't be doing this ) . Of these songs , Today my world slipped away is a cover of a Vern Gosdin country hit but the others ( as far as I know ) are original songs . Picking out highlights in such a strong collection is difficult , but I 'll nominate Murder on Music Row , Adalida , Blue clear sky and King of the mountain . If you are new to George 's music , this compilation makes a great introduction .","summary":"The mid-nineties hits","unixReviewTime":1118448000,"image":null}

George Strait and MCA have finally released a single - disc collection of hits that is n't skimpy ! Unlike Strait 's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits , Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks , of which two are new recordings . Specifically , it picks up where the multi - disc retrospective Strait Out Of   The Box leaves off , with the old hits culled from Strait 's 1994 through   1998 albums . While more extensive , this anthology is far from   perfect however . \" Lead On \" and \" King Of The Mountain \" ( the latter barely   scraped into the top 20 ) drag along unmelodically and are slower than   molasses . Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits   ( \" I Can Still Make Cheyenne \" recalling \" Amarillo By Morning \" and   \" Adalida \"   bringing to mind \" The Love Bug \" ) . With \" Carrying Your Love With Me \" and   \" Carried Away , \" Strait even repeats himself within the same collection . If you think I am getting too nit - picky about this set , you may be right . The crisp , heartfelt delivery on \" You Ca n't Make A Heart Love Somebody \" is   just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country   music . And as \" Blue Clear Sky \" and \" Round About Way \" illustrate , no one   handles a play - on - words more effectively than Strait . You 'd also be   hard - pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than \" We   Really Should n't Be Doing This . \" \n  The two new singles contribute in   mixed degrees to the Strait legacy . Recent chart - topper \" The Best Day \" is   nice , but it also seems too similar to some old hits ( \" Love Without End ,   Amen , \" \" Check Yes Or No ) . \" Here our protagonist progresses through a love   for camping , cars , and finally , his ideal woman . Much better is \" Murder On   Music Row , \" a duet with Alan Jackson . This mega - event pairing of two of   modern country 's most traditional ( and successful ) artists is an   effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today 's   country .... \n  As   noted earlier , Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is not flawless . In light of   its several strong points , however , it has to be recommended as a must buy   for all country music listeners .","summary":"Strait's latest hits set has length, depth","unixReviewTime":961459200,"image":null}

One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall \" laid - back \" feel . I like that it is n't wild or very rocking . Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me ( usually , anyway ) . Burl , with his warm , friendly voice , does n't come across as a \" celebrity \" but as more of a \" grandfatherly \" figure . The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back - up vocals . Of course , the title track and \" Rudolph \" are probably the most - known tracks on the album , but the others are good , too . The album has one of the best versions of \" Little Drummer Boy \" that I 've heard ! \" I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day \" closes the album perfectly . Right now , it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s ) from the album , but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song , and it would probably be \" Christmas Ca n't Be Far Away . \" The only thing I really dislike about this album is how short it is ( under 30 minutes ) . It would have been nice if it had included some bonus stuff , or had been paired with Burl Ives ' Christmas Album ( which contains completely different material ) .

On this album Burl sings wonderfully ; and his friendly , grandfatherly vibes go into every song he sings ! This CD is a must - have for fans of Burl ; and anyone who wants some very special holiday songs would do well to add this to their music collection . The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is very nicely done . The title track opens the album ; this catchy , infectiously happy and upbeat tune could never go out of style ; and Burl practically owns this song the way he delivers it . He puts a lot of positive energy into his version of this song ; and it shows quite clearly when I hear him perform it . Great ! \" Christmas Is a Birthday \" is very easy on the ear ; what a charming ballad -- and it 's religious , too . \" Santa Claus Is Coming To Town \" switches gears back to a more secular song ; Burl puts his own stamp on this tune by playing a bit with the tempo and a few key changes -- and it all holds its own very well . \" The Little Drummer Boy \" has another terrific arrangement ; the percussion and guitar are used very well and the music fits perfectly with Burl Ives ' singing . In addition , \" Rudolph The Red - Nosed Reindeer \" leaves nothing to be desired -- this music is all THAT good ! \" Winter Wonderland \" shines bright in Burl 's capable hands ; I really like this number . I have n't heard this number as often as I 've heard the other tunes on this CD but it 's really quite beautiful and it even leaves me wanting more . Burl Ives turned out a wonderful record album back in 1965 ; and it 's amazingly wonderful to have this on CD in our times so that we can enjoy it over and over again . I highly recommend this album ; it 's full of splendid holiday music .","summary":"a timeless Christmas album that comes from Burl's heart","unixReviewTime":1258675200,"image":null}

His first , \" Christmas Day in the Morning , \" came out in 1952 , followed by \" Christmas Eve \" in 1956 . \" Have a Holly Jolly Christmas \" came out in 1965 , with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special \" Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer \" the following year . The title song of this album was written by for the special by Johnny Marks , who also wrote the song \" Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer , \" which Ives sings on this album , and the final track , \" I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day . \" That is a pretty good trio of Christmas songs , which would make Marks one of the best writers of Christmas songs ever . How this album is different from the previous Burl Ives Christmas albums is that he has shifted to this point to more of a pop - oriented approach to singing Christmas songs that the traditional folk style that defined his earlier albums . There are still some folk songs on this album , with \" Christmas is a Birthday , \" \" Christmas Child ( Loo , Loo , Loo ) , \" \" Christmas Ca n't Be Far Away , \" and \" Snow for Johnny . \" I tend to think of \" The Little Drummer Boy \" as being more religious than it really us , but that is more because the music is more hymn - like . The net result is that you have Burl Ives singing eight recognizable Christmas songs and introducing you to four songs that you have probably not heard before that are perfectly suited to his strengths as a singer . Ives started out in the 1920s as an itinerate folk singers , moved to Broadway in the 1930s , appeared on the radio in the 1940s , and became a popular folk singer in the 1950s . But most people today probably remember him as the Snowman who narrates the story of \" Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer \" that still airs each holiday season forty years later . Because of that connection it is entirely possible that a Burl Ives Christmas album will be warmly received in your home by those who do not know about the rest of his resume . He certainly produces the requisite warm seasonal feelings .","summary":"Burl Ives sings a dozen Christmas songs on this 1965 album","unixReviewTime":1135036800,"image":null}

The bands at such events can really be pretty varied . Sometimes , a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired , though it 's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play . Anyway , with all of those bands , and at all of those dances , there 's a common moment , when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor . That 's pretty much the central ritual , I think , of all those Texas dances . The band , no matter who they are , must be able to play \" Amarillo By Morning , \" and everyone must dance to it . Goodness , I even remember that from prom , when the types of music and tastes varied widely , but everyone , even the people who hated country music , danced to \" Amarillo by Morning . So , obviously , it 's a great song . It 's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well - sung and pretty melody . The words are classic country -- both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy \/ rodeo dream . There 's no wonder that it 's as popular as it 's long been . It 's absolutely the quintessential country song , the one ( among many very good ones ) for which George Strait will always be most remembered .","summary":"The Quintessential Country Song","unixReviewTime":1309564800,"image":null}

It has ' Crazy ' , that great Willie Nelson song that has played from jukeboxes and bars throughout American for the past few decades , always sounding as good as ever . I think it 's considered to be the most played song ever , by whoever keeps track of such things . Its worth getting this album for that track alone , although if you are download friendly then you could shortcut that process and simply purchase the track all by itself . But if you did that , you 'd miss the 21 other great songs here , starting with ' Walkin ' after Midnight ' , and continuing one after another to transport us to those days in the late 1950 's and early 1960 's when Patsy Cline was at the top of her career . The only better collection for just about anyone short of Patsy Cline fanatics would be this one -&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Patsy - Cline - Gold \/ dp \/ B0007OY44M \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Patsy Cline : Gold<\/a>&nbsp;- that includes all of the 22 tracks on this ' Definitive ' disc , plus 10 more , spread over 2 CDs .

Sherwin","reviewText":"Patsy Cline ( born Virginia Patterson Hensley , September 8 , 1932 - March 5 , 1963 ) was a superbly gifted country music singer -- very few could , can or ever will match her ability to take any tune and make it sound wonderful , special , fresh and very new ! Patsy also put her heart and soul into everything she sang ; and that 's grand . Sadly , she died so young in a private plane crash ; but at least she lives on through her music . This is an excellent CD of her artistry for both fans and newcomers alike . There 's not a single dud in the lot here ; every song is just that good ! \" Walkin ' After Midnight , \" written by   Alan Block and Donn Hecht , is a fine way to start the track set -- Patsy is squarely front and center which is right where she belongs ! The music , as is the case with all the tracks here , fits in perfectly with Patsy 's vocals . \" A Poor Man 's Roses ( Or a Rich Man 's Gold ) \" is very well done and Patsy does a great job on \" Lovesick Blues \" which is a number I really like . \" I Fall to Pieces \" ( Pasty 's first # 1 hit on the country charts and her second hit on the pop charts ) and \" True Love \" from Patsy 's 1961 album entitled \" Patsy Cline Showcase \" are most poignant and Patsy sings \" San Antonio Rose \" with panache -- I love it ! \" Crazy , \" a number by Willie Nelson , shines bright in Patsy 's more than capable hands ; it 's her signature song despite the fact that she did n't like it at all initially ! \" Strange \" is very well done -- there 's some backup vocals for Patsy and while they do sound pretty good Patsy never really needed backup ; her talent carried her through every time ! Patsy 's interpretation of Hank Cochran 's \" She 's Got You \" is very impressive ; and Patsy 's \" Heartaches \" is easily the very best I 've ever heard ! \" Half As Much \" is easy on the ear even if the lyrics are n't all that happy while \" When I Get through with You ( You 'll Love Me Too ) \" is certainly more upbeat . \" Imagine That \" gets a fine treatment from Patsy and \" So Wrong \" yet again features Patsy 's beautiful contralto voice . \" Why Ca n't He Be You \" is another moving number . \" Leavin ' on Your Mind \" is an incredibly fine tune that gets the royal treatment from Patsy Cline and \" When You Need a Laugh \" is a real gem ! \" Back in Baby 's Arms \" has a great sound to it as do the other numbers here and songs like \" Faded Love \" make me wish so badly that Patsy was still with us . \" Always \" is a classic for sure and the album ends with two splendid songs , Harlan Howard 's \" He Called Me Baby \" and Don Gibson 's \" Sweet Dreams ( Of You ) . \" \n\n Patsy Cline shared so much of her gift with us that we are all better off for it . I highly recommend her exceptional music .","summary":"sweet dreams of Patsy","unixReviewTime":1371081600,"image":null}
