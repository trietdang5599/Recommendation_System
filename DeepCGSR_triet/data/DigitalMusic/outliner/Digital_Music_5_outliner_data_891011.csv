Which has always been part of the charm for me, but simultaneously when he's gone too far off a tangent, I get turned off.  Overall this album walked on that razor's edge for me from start to finish.  There are absolute moments of brilliance and some really original musical ideas, but some of those ideas went a bit too far and wandered into the ""just noise"" realm.

It wasn't nearly as easy to listen to as the ""Everything That Happens Will Happen Today"" album with Brain Eno, but I think the more I listen to this one, the more I will enjoy it.  I am thoroughly unfamiliar with St Vincent and her works, but I will be looking into them now.","Let 's face it David Byrne has never been your "" conventional "" pop artist / musician .

A14KEJHC1GLU0R,B00970FKAY,-1,1,4,"I title my review 'About Time!' for a few reasons:

1. It's about time a K-Pop song actually get US radio play.

2. It's about time we get another catchy dance-along song.

3. It's about time Amazon MP3 gets this song
As a DJ who needs to be on the edge of everything new and popular, I prefer to buy from Amazon - better service, better products, more convenient and more importantly it's NOT iTunes! However I had to hunt and settle for buying this one on iTunes in order to have it before a large 2,000+ event at a college with a large Korean student population.

As far as the song - I like it, but it won't have the lasting power of the Cupid Shuffle, Cha-Cha Slide, and the more recent Wobble unfortunately. I already see it dying. I'm happy to see a K-Pop song with a (fairly) positive message getting so much attention, and Psy really deserves it as an artist. This is a better satire than Right Said Fred's 'I'm Too Sexy', though it basically has the same message. I'm afraid Psy may suffer the same one-hit wonder fate in the States, but I'm glad this song is here for the moment.","for a few reasons :

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00970FKQ8,-1,1,4,"By all accounts, I should not like this song.  I don't know a word of Korean, so most of the lyrics went straight over my head.  I don't listen to Asian pop much, so the style is one I'm unfamiliar with.  And the fact that Psy doesn't actually sing for most of the song, instead mainly talking over the music, should have turned me off.  I should have dismissed the song as a passing fad and gone on with my life.

But I made the mistake of listening to the song on YouTube... and it lodged itself in my brain.  And I ended up liking it well enough to purchase a copy.  It's no musical masterpiece, but dang is it catchy and fun.

For those more used to American-style music, ""Gangnam Style"" is something of a departure from it.  It's heavy on the synthesizer, much like a lot of the hits of the '80s, and has a fast, almost frantic beat to it.  As stated before, Psy talks his way through most of the song, only singing at the chorus (he does do a decent job of singing, though, so it's not for lack of talent).  This gives the song almost something of a rap feel, though it sounds quite different from traditional rap.  And of course, it's an upbeat number that almost encourages the listener to get up and dance -- I find it almost physically impossible to hold still while listening to this song.

And no, I don't understand any of the lyrics aside from the titular ""Gangnam style"" (said to refer to a city) and the occasional belting out of ""Hey, sexy lady!""  No, I don't know if it fits in the context of the song or not... XD

Call me a sell-out, but I rather enjoyed this song.  It's a fun and upbeat dance number, even if you don't know how to do the signature dance that goes with it.  Good as an introductory number to K-Pop, and a fun party number.","By all accounts , I should not like this song . I do n't know a word of Korean , so most of the lyrics went straight over my head .

A3QPA2Y4CDZUAH,B0098A2Y4S,-1,1,4,"I kinda feel bad for Kreashawn because the record bombed due to the label dropping the ball.  It only came out on CD a year too late and only in the US at Hot Topic stores, and NOBODY shops at Hot Topic for music!!  Otherwise, MP3 download or an import CD which doesn't count towards US sales.  This record was not in people's sight because of this...many didn't think she even had a record out!!  No BestBuy, Target, Walmart, indie stores, nothing, so no sales above 3900 copies????  Pathetic.

In spite of this, the record is a fun listen, good party music if you can take a filthy mouth...hell, under the CD tray is a pic of Kray flipping the bird!!  Funny to some, offensive to others...I thought it was cute.  The cover is a good indication of the music inside...cartoonish, colourful, and collegiate/hipster.  It's like Nicki Minaj-esque bubblegum/hiphop hybrid pop, partly rapped, partly sung, but merged with a smart-aleck college chick who thinks she's cooler than she really is, YET she is better than you would think.  Also, remember girl college rap/female Beastie Boys Northern State??  Reminds me of them.

She talks a lot about drugs, violence, typical hiphop stuff, but with her own twist, and she's probably just bragging and is none of that stuff, so it's all just fantasy, and is probably boring & normal at home...not that that's bad, but people fantasize...and it doesn't hurt that the songs are really catchy, in the vein of Nicki.  And still, the 2011 viral hit ""Gucci Gucci"" is still fun, and somehow the volume level is higher on that song than the rest of the album, weird.  Other fun tunes are the new single ""Go Hard (La La La)"", ""Luv Haus"" is a catchy tune as well, why people hate on that is strange...I dig it...opener ""Blase Blase"" is fun and has a unique musical bed.  She can hold her own with guests like 2 Chainz and Kid Cudi as well.

But I like the record, it deserved better...and is better than the haters are making it out to be...if you like Nicki, remember Northern State, or love good catchy party girlpop with a dirty mouth, give it a try if you find a Hot Topic store near you...or download it...have low expectations, then you may be surprised by Kreashawn's debut.  Just sayin'...","I kinda feel bad for Kreashawn because the record bombed due to the label dropping the ball . It only came out on CD a year too late and only in the US at Hot Topic stores , and NOBODY shops at Hot Topic for music ! ! Otherwise , MP3 download or an import CD which does n't count towards US sales . This record was not in people 's sight because of this ... many did n't think she even had a record out ! ! No BestBuy , Target , Walmart , indie stores , nothing , so no sales above 3900 copies ? ? ? ? Pathetic . In spite of this , the record is a fun listen , good party music if you can take a filthy mouth ... hell , under the CD tray is a pic of Kray flipping the bird ! ! Funny to some , offensive to others ... I thought it was cute . The cover is a good indication of the music inside ... cartoonish , colourful , and collegiate / hipster . It 's like Nicki Minaj - esque bubblegum / hiphop hybrid pop , partly rapped , partly sung , but merged with a smart - aleck college chick who thinks she 's cooler than she really is , YET she is better than you would think . Also , remember girl college rap / female Beastie Boys Northern State ? ? She talks a lot about drugs , violence , typical hiphop stuff , but with her own twist , and she 's probably just bragging and is none of that stuff , so it 's all just fantasy , and is probably boring & normal at home ... not that that 's bad , but people fantasize ... and it does n't hurt that the songs are really catchy , in the vein of Nicki . And still , the 2011 viral hit "" Gucci Gucci "" is still fun , and somehow the volume level is higher on that song than the rest of the album , weird . Other fun tunes are the new single "" Go Hard ( La La La ) "" , "" Luv Haus "" is a catchy tune as well , why people hate on that is strange ... I dig it ... opener "" Blase Blase "" is fun and has a unique musical bed . She can hold her own with guests like 2 Chainz and Kid Cudi as well . But I like the record , it deserved better ... and is better than the haters are making it out to be ... if you like Nicki , remember Northern State , or love good catchy party girlpop with a dirty mouth , give it a try if you find a Hot Topic store near you ... or download it ... have low expectations , then you may be surprised by Kreashawn 's debut .

Country Western music is a bit like the little girl who ""had a little curl right in he middle of her forehead/And when she as good, she was very very good/ And when she was bad, she was horrid."" Two of these albums -the last album by C&W great Waylon Jennings and the double album by Alabaman Jamey Johnson, are, if not horrid, at least very very disappointing. But then there's the live album by Lyle Lovett, which, like most of his albums, is well thought out, balanced, musical and alive.

The virtues of Waylon Jennings as a Country Western singer are many but they've always been balanced by his defects: on the plus side, his take charge manner, his swagger, and that deep resonant voice of his which can, when he's on, tells stories and communicate emotion with the best of him. Waylon at his best is like Johnny Cash on steroids and that's a good thing.

Unfortunately, this album is not his best. To start with, there's not a standout song on the album. Waylon has sold many mediocre songs in the past solely on the strength of his masculine energy and voice. But he sounds tired here. He needed better songs at this point in his career, so his storytelling qualities could take over, but these songs don't provide it.  (2-1/2 * out of 5)

I was looking forward to hearing Johnson. I'd not heard him before and what I read about him made it sound like he'd be an interesting performer. He's not. His voice is adequate, pretty much generic western male vocalist, outlaw variety. The songs, many of which he wrote, are by and large mediocre. There are 25 songs on this two-disc album. Two of them grabbed me, the first one on each side. ""Lonely at the Top,"" written by Cook .Whitley and Raines, falls into a groove and the lyrics aren't the more usual (on this album) groan and moan resentment lyrics. ""By the Seat of Your Pants"" is a lesson from Papa story about how you learn Life as you go. But the rest of the songs sound generic and many of them are lugubrious, and the quality of Johnson's low moaning voice doesn't help things at all. Two hours of this music was enough to make me want to go to sleep. (2* out of 5)

The live Lyle album is Lyle with his Little Big Band. It's not his best album -his very first album is that--but it's awfully good. What a great ensemble he had assembled! Listen to the backup singers on ""Church"", for instance. There are a number of favorites on the album, including his best song ever, ""Closing Time,"" a tune I have used on CD mix after CD mix. The thing about Lovett is his range: he sings ballads as well as he odes blues, and he kicks with the best of the C&W crew. And the lyrics! They're witty, even funny. How many other Country Western giants can you say that about? (4* out of 5)","Going ' Down Rockin ' : The Last Recordings . JJ , voc , guit ; others .

A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B0098HHWUW,1,-1,3,"Three years before his untimely passing in 2002, Waylon Jennings spent a few days laying down what would be his last studio performances. Recorded in his friend (and steel guitarist) Robbie Turner's home studio, the tapes featured Jennings and his guitar working out new music and revisiting older tunes. Jennings no longer had the full vocal power of his earlier years, but his phrasing, tone and low baritone notes were intact; he sounds physically weakened in spots, but still mentally charged. Shortly after the sessions, Jennings moved back to Phoenix, and the tapes sat unfinished until last year, when Turner gathered select players to add instrumental backings to the performances. The result closely captures the flavor of Jennings' earlier recordings, skillfully weaving the players around Jennings and his guitar into a final mix that feels whole.

By utilizing players who'd worked with Jennings before, Turner was able to craft backings that are sympathetic to the singer and his sound. As with Johnny Cash's American Recordings, there's an unmistakable specter of mortality coloring the songs and performances. The title track is unapologetic, summing up Jennings' last stand with the hook line ""if I can't go down rockin', ain't gonna go down at all."" There's also a fired-up early run-through of ""Never Say Die,"" which would become the title of Jennings last live set in 2000. Earlier songs take on added poignancy, such as a version of ""I Do Believe"" that's sung wearily, as if struggling to balance the hear-and-now with a here-after that was closing in. Similarly, ""Belle of the Ball"" is rendered more wistful and nostalgic here than as originally heard on 1977's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ol-Waylon/dp/B002YXUU38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ol' Waylon</a>.

Hearing these songs as life-end reflections is partly a product of hindsight. Jennings then-new ""Friends in California"" would have been the story of a wounded spirit in 1970, but looking back at 1999 from 2012, the protagonist's troubles read more prophetic and terminal. Similarly, the romantic resignation of ""The Ways of the World"" is layered with additional meaning as Jennings contemplates ""the ways of this whole world are not always fair / most things are never what we want to find,"" and Turner dresses this latter song in steel guitar and atmospheric interludes that underscore the song's pondering. Arriving ten years after Jennings passing, this set is like a letter delayed in the mail; it's unexpected, enjoyable and bittersweet. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B0098HEK7K,1,-1,3,"Angie Stone has captivated devoted neo-soul/soul music fans for years with her music. Fighting through being underrated compared to the likes of India. Arie, Erykah Badu, and even a youthful Alicia Keys, Stone always possessed the voice where her commercial endeavors fell short of where they should've been.

While Stone has always had anachronistic tendencies, she usually pulls off this 'old with the new' extremely confidently off-setting the 'vintage' nature.  This independent release comes off too safe, too conservative, and lacks the 'excitability' and 'vivaciousness' that other Stone albums present.

Overall the material is solid, though even the best cuts are safe. ""Do What U Gotta Do"" proceeds after a pointless intro, and is more notable in the context of this album than it was as somewhat of a bland, safe single.  It is not 'the second coming' by any means, but it stands out amongst such a safe set. Similarly, single ""Backup Plan"" showcases Stone's rich alto, but never 'captivates' the way the Gladys Knight sampling ""No More Rain In This Cloud"" or even Marvin Gaye cover ""Trouble Man"" did on her debut.  A gospel drawn out cut entitled ""Guilty"" is lovely, though a bit on the long side and by no means 'hip.'

""Rich Girl,"" the title track, is the album's best track.  Well produced, intact with Stone's signature supporting vocals, ""Rich Girl"" lacks flashiness, but suits Stone the best of any cut on the effort. ""Right in Front of Me"" is safe, but lays well with a vintage soul groove.  ""U Lit My Fire"" falls a bit short on the verses (Stone could assert more and bust a sweat perhaps), but delivers on a catchy chorus (""The first time that I met you baby... you lit my fire/you lit my fire..."").  ""Sisters"" closes somewhat 'schmalzy,' but the slow-paced anthemic cuts thematic material ('we are always sisters,' etc.) should strike some relatable chords with the audience.
The other tracks are solid with none bombing, but they don't stand out in particular. Even those that do save for maybe ""Rich Girl"" would have trouble superseding Stone's greatest hits.

Overall, if you are a hardcore Stone fan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rich-Girl/dp/B008D1RD5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rich Girl</a>&nbsp;will appeal to you because Stone's voice sounds as polished as ever.  If you prefer 'old-school' R&B in the soul, retro-soul, neo-soul, or adult contemporary R&B vein, this album will suit you. If you are a more casual fan however, you may find this album safe, humdrum, and a bit underwhelming. From a critical standpoint, the judgement is this is a solid and soulful album, though not exciting.

A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0098WWEH8,-1,1,4,"When Grizzly Bear released ""Veckatimest"" in 2009, the band deserved the critical and commercial breakthrough it brought them. I personally loved that album and had it in my Top 10 of Albums of the Year then. The band took to the road with that album like never before, and then took time off for various side projects (including the ""Blue Valentine"" soundtrack). Now a long three years later comes Grizzly Bear's 4th studio album (not counting ""Blue Valentine"").

""Shields"" (10 tracks; 48 min.) starts off with the acoustic guitar-heavy ""Sleeping Ute"" and then dives into ""Speak In Rounds"", which I believe is the hardest rocking track Grizzly Bear has ever done. After a 1 min. instrumental interlude, we then get ""Yet Again"", which yet again shows the band at its hardest rocking, wow. The album's first half closes with a pensive ""The Hunt"". I rate the first half of the album 4.5 stars. The second half starts off with the gently trotting ""A Simple Answer"", which is followed buy an abstract sounding ""What's Wrong?"". The songs on Side B are all quite long, and not as immediately attention-grabbing as earlier in the album. ""Gun-Shy"" reminded me of 1970s Steely Dan, for some reason! It all leads to the closing track, a 7 min. ""Sun In Your Eyes"", which feels like it could and should go epic, and then finally does. I rate the album's second half 3.5 stars.

In all, while not as impressive as ""Veckatimest"", ""Shields"" is still a very good album, and certainly worth the long wait. I've seen the band in concert a number of times over the years, including most recently at the MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati, where they headlined and brought a fantastic 80 min. set that relied heavily on songs from ""Shields"" (I think they all-but-one from the album), confirming once again that any song Grizzly Bear plays live, rocks much harder in concert than on the studio albums.

A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B0099G7KDQ,-1,1,4,"One of my children gave me ""Babel"" to find out what I thought of this latest phenom -- and it's not bad.  Their biggest asset so far, I think, is Marcus Mumford's attractively raspy voice, which maintains its character whether he's singing loudly or softly, and he delivers his words with total commitment.

A1LBIZLET9CW1I,B0099G7KDQ,1,-1,2,"Millions of people adore Mumford & Sons, finding their sound to be much more than pleasant folksy tunes but rather something like a revelatory, deeply meaningful expression of passion.

When I first heard M&S, I, too, found them revelatory. It was intensely refreshing to hear popular music that has soul--so much soul that they couldn't help but to project it at the tops of their lungs. It was a desperately needed reply to the current ""I don't care / we do what we want"" irreverent dance-pop glitz ethos.

Many listens later, I see M&S differently. The music reliably invokes excitement but, in doing so, it finds no space for subtlety or understatement. Their roots are in Back Country bluegrass and folk -- genres that are all about stories -- but in M&S's music there are no stories. Rather, this album is a lot like U2's City of Blinding Light: Biblical imagery expressed in generic terms. A flailing attempt to capture spirituality. Or maybe just to prevent boredom. Instead of stories intended to shake and inspire, we get posturing and shouting intended to excite. After a while, all the excitement becomes exhausting and empty, not unlike the dance-pop glitz they oppose.

I believe people are starved for deeper rewards than Maroon 5 and their dance-pop contemporaries offer, and I believe that's why M&S are the top-selling musicians in the country (and by a wide margin), because they give the instant impression of heartfelt folky soulfulness. But the truth, revealed after enough listens, is that they are closer to stadium rock. To find deeper rewards, you have to look to the folk / bluegrass / celtic roots that have inspired them: Bob Dylan or Van Morrison, or even more recent acts like Ray LaMontagne or Amos Lee. Their music may not be as instantly pleasurable or exciting as M&S's, but if you give it your patience and attention, you just might find rewards that are far more precious than excitement.","Millions of people adore Mumford & Sons , finding their sound to be much more than pleasant folksy tunes but rather something like a revelatory , deeply meaningful expression of passion .

A39W3263A9HCMN,B009AQOZIS,1,-1,3,"First off, people seem to like down thumbing my reviews as of recently, because I don't immediately jump on the bandwagon and give everything in near sight a 5 star rating. First off, the purpose of a review is to state your opinion on a product and not just gush about how amazing it is, mind you this is coming from someone who will admit to being totally biased because he loves Iron Maiden and they're his favourite band. I ask you, please state why you're thumbs downing my review in the comments, and don't just down thumb it because I didn't give it 5 stars and I apparently hurt you. Do also be wary of my grammar as English is my second language.

I have listened to this album front to back several times. It was one of my most anticipated releases of the year, if the most anticipated for me. I was excited to hear it since it got announced back in July, with 8 days until the Maiden concert I was going to. I have been a huge fan of the band since 2006 and have seen them three times live, own pretty much everything with their namenon it, and regularly listen to ""Seventh Son"" and several other of their albums front to back on a regular basis. I even own every Bruce solo effort, every ASAP and Untouchables album, and H's side project ""Primal Rock Rebellion""...

...but I just can't get into this album. I really don't know what it is about it. There's very few tracks I'd consider weak, they're almost all pretty good. But, it leaves me feeling cold every time I hear it.

This Is My God: Dull track. Zero energy and super repetitive. Taylor's vocals aren't as bad as everyone says, he is just fine on this album and at times reminds me of Bono. But this track just bores me. The music video isn't much better, but at least Steve shot the music video in parts of my home province, Alberta. 2/10

Lost Worlds: Not bad. In a way, reminds me a bit of latter-day Rush. I like the lyrics and heavy feel of the tune. The chorus in particular is amazing and manages to add the kick this song needed, in a way. 7/10

Karma Killer: here's an interesting track. It reminds me of Gods of War, from Bruce's ""Balls to Picasso"" album. It has a heavy feel, and the chorus is very Maiden like. ""Karma killaaaahhh, cannot get enough..."" It's a tad on the repetitive side, but it's fun and catchy. 7/10

Us Against the World: Decent tune, I'll listen. But put it on a Maiden album and I'd hit the skip button. 6/10

The Chosen Ones: This song heavily rips off bands like The Who and Boston, but that's alright, because I just so happen to like both. It carries on for a minute longer than it should and does tend to repeat itself too much. I still like the tune. Very fun and catchy.

A World Without Heaven: this is my favourite track on the album. It wouldn't be out of place on Virtual XI (I like that album a lot, deal with it) and it has an epic feel, the chorus especially still sticks in my head long after the song is done. A great effort, 10/10

Judas: boring 2/10

Eyes of The Young: not a bad tune. Reminds me a bit of a song you'd hear off of The X Factor. It is a bit too repetitive though, 6/10

These Are The Hands: my second favourite tune. It has a nostalgic feel and takes me back to better times, for better or worse. Catchy hook and some epic bass from Steve Harris himself. 7/10

The Lesson: Gothic tinged ballad. A good way to close the album on a subdued note, I must say I really dig the strings and violins in the background. 7/10

First off, I guess we should be glad that Arry didn't do what most did when people go off on different tangents, you know how they make inexplicable dubstep music and what not. And thankfully this album is better than that unholy mess, ""Awoken Broken"" by a certain side project by H which shall remain unnamed (sorry H, I really do love you and all, but being in a nu-metal band isn't working out for you), but this album, as I stated above, leaves me feeling empty.

Part of it is because the album didn't have any staying power outside of ""A World Without Heaven"". That's a song I'd willingly put on my iPad and play over and over. After listening to the album, all but the above stated track pretty much went in one ear and out the other. It's not so much the fact that the tracks are bad. Aside from ""This is My God"" and ""Judas"", the tracks don't really stand out.

I don't own a copy of the album, but rather I listened to it 5 times during the listening party on the official Iron Maiden site. And since I own all other things with Arry's namesake, I probably will end up buying it, at least when the price comes down.

ADFXJSLJGN6EN,B009AQOZIS,-1,1,5,"Ok, so I'm not an Iron Maiden ""super fan."" I've never worn any of their t-shirts, and I haven't seen  them live (not by choice - the one time they came to town I just couldn't make it.)  I only own a couple of their albums right now, but I've heard a good share. In spite of all that, I'm a big fan, and I have HUGE respect for them, as any self-respecting metalhead should.

Now, maybe I'm biased because I'm a bass player myself, but I like this album a lot. If you were to give it a label, I'd say it's ""progg-ish, melodic modern rock.""

The bass is louder in the mix than on your average rock record. We're used to hearing the clang of Steve's bass on Maiden, but this material is very different. So it's a bit odd to have the bass so loud, but I don't think it kills it. Again, maybe I'm biased.

And the singer is clearly not the most powerful one you'll hear, but his tone and delivery fit the tamer, more brooding type of rock that this album is exploring.

I think that the fact that Steve can write in a different style, and assemble a different type of band and make it sound good is a testament to his talent, even if you don't particularly like the style. At least he's not a one trick pony.

Steve, you're the man, a legend. Thanks for all the music, including this. \m/","Ok , so I 'm not an Iron Maiden "" super fan .

But even given that, this is a decent collection of songs that, to my ears, mostly pay tribute to Harris' roots in Uriah Heep/UFO British hard rock of the early/mid 1970s. To be fair, I wouldn't have given this more than one listen if it weren't Steve Harris, but since it is him, and I did, I would say if you are a Maiden or Harris fan, and go in with realistic expectations, you'll find a decent album with some good hard rock songs on it. It's NOT great, and hopefully if Harris continues to do music outside of Maiden he'll go in different direction next time. It's basically a tribute to his earliest influences.

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B009BI8PEA,1,-1,3,"Faith Evans, combined with a team including Syleena Johnson, Nicci Gilbert, KeKe Wyatt & Monifah, present the companion soundtrack to the mini series R&B Divas. The album comes care of eOne, the independent label of which Faith Evans is currently signed. In 2011, Evans released her first solo album,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Something-About-Faith/dp/B0040T77KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Something About Faith</a>&nbsp;for the label. All in all,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/R-B-Diva/dp/B009BI8PEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">R&B Diva</a>&nbsp;is a solid album, with some fine moments and other less notable ones.

""Lovin' Me (Theme From R&B Divas)"" starts the effort of energetically, delivering capable vocal performances from the R&B singers. The production is sound and the song itself is quite enjoyable, transcending its role as a 'theme' song, much like Mary Mary's ""Go Get It"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Go-Get-It/dp/B007LCJ1RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Go Get It</a>) is solid as its own entity. Faith Evans steals the show on the classic, soulful-sounding ""Tears of Joy,"" the promo/buzz single of the set. Evans sounds in superb voice here, hearkening back to the days of her musical prime when Evans was one of the preeminent R&B females in the game. ""Tears of Joy"" is the perfect cut for Evans's robust and powerful voice.

""Mr. Supafly"" accelerates the tempo following ""Tears of Joy."" It's not bad, but ""Too High For Love"" is more powerful, showing more range. ""Too High For Love"" features Faith Evans, who sounds exceptional here.  Talk about underrated, Wyatt's career has been just that, despite possessing the voice. ""SisterFriend"" provides the obligatory 'sisters forever' styled track, but it is effective. Women will definitely relate to it, much like a similarly themed track entitled ""Sisters"" from Angie Stone's latest,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rich-Girl/dp/B008D1RD5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rich Girl</a>.

""Dumb"" possesses some of the efforts most interesting production, giving into uptempo fair. The vocal harmonies pop well here against the repetitive organ synth. ""Sometime"" follows, featuring Nicci Gilbert & her mother, Helene ""Mom"" Gilbert. It is OK, though by no means 'new' or 'the second coming. ""True Colors"" is a high point for sure, featuring Kelly Price and Fantasia.  The vocal harmonies are lovely while the production is both smoothly and soulfully executed.

""Stonewall,"" featuring Syleena Johnson (whose voice I dearly love) is a bit of miss.  While the concept of the song is excellent, the pitch is not. More often than not, the pitch rises (sharp) and instead of adding 'color' to the cut, it hinders it. Sometimes pitch imperfections are positive nuances despite their inaccuracy.

The album comes care of eOne , the independent label of which Faith Evans is currently signed . In 2011 , Evans released her first solo album,<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Something - About - Faith / dp / B0040T77KI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Something About Faith</a>&nbsp;for the label .

"" Lovin' Me ( Theme From R&B Divas ) "" starts the effort of energetically , delivering capable vocal performances from the R&B singers . The production is sound and the song itself is quite enjoyable , transcending its role as a ' theme ' song , much like Mary Mary 's "" Go Get It "" ( < a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Go - Get - It / dp / B007LCJ1RS / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Go Get It</a > ) is solid as its own entity . Faith Evans steals the show on the classic , soulful - sounding "" Tears of Joy , "" the promo / buzz single of the set . Evans sounds in superb voice here , hearkening back to the days of her musical prime when Evans was one of the preeminent R&B females in the game . "" Tears of Joy "" is the perfect cut for Evans 's robust and powerful voice . "" Mr. Supafly "" accelerates the tempo following "" Tears of Joy . "" It 's not bad , but "" Too High For Love "" is more powerful , showing more range . "" Too High For Love "" features Faith Evans , who sounds exceptional here . Talk about underrated , Wyatt 's career has been just that , despite possessing the voice . "" SisterFriend "" provides the obligatory ' sisters forever ' styled track , but it is effective . Women will definitely relate to it , much like a similarly themed track entitled "" Sisters "" from Angie Stone 's latest,<a data - hook=""product - link - linked "" class=""a - link - normal "" href=""/Rich - Girl / dp / B008D1RD5S / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8"">Rich Girl</a > . "" Dumb "" possesses some of the efforts most interesting production , giving into uptempo fair . The vocal harmonies pop well here against the repetitive organ synth . "" Sometime "" follows , featuring Nicci Gilbert & her mother , Helene "" Mom "" Gilbert . It is OK , though by no means ' new ' or ' the second coming . "" True Colors "" is a high point for sure , featuring Kelly Price and Fantasia . The vocal harmonies are lovely while the production is both smoothly and soulfully executed . "" Stonewall , "" featuring Syleena Johnson ( whose voice I dearly love ) is a bit of miss . While the concept of the song is excellent , the pitch is not . More often than not , the pitch rises ( sharp ) and instead of adding ' color ' to the cut , it hinders it . Sometimes pitch imperfections are positive nuances despite their inaccuracy . In this case , "" Stonewall "" has too many runs and is hindered by inaccuracy . "" She 's Me , "" featuring Monifah is ' standard fare ' while the preeminent diva herself ( Faith ) shines on a live take of her 1995 classic , "" Soon As I Get Home .

This album also has that element, his use of violin or string instruments accompanies and enriches his guitar solos immensely.  However, that being said, this is NOT an upbeat, happy album; it seems more intrinsic, sad, almost depressing at times.

A1IN81U71Y9RPU,B009D0Q5PM,-1,1,5,"DUDE, IT'S THE BEACH BOYS!!!!!",
AQ81L25HHHB18,B009D0Q5PM,-1,1,4,"This 2-CD compilation was released in honor of The Beach Boys' 50th Anniversary, and so it contains 50 tracks. Since there have been countless BB collections released in the past, it would be easy to dismiss this one as a grab for money. But, a lot of the previous comps were somewhat limited (some VERY much so) in terms of hit recordings or overall numbers of tracks (or both) and/or pretty lousy, at least in my opinion --- like the ones that had only ten tracks or so.  And besides, not everyone has all of the group's music or all (if any) of the other collections. The group is gaining new fans all the time! I personally bought this set partly because I'm such a big fan and something of a BB collector, and partly because the set includes some stuff that I didn't have at the time, such as the stereo mixes of ""Do You Wanna Dance,"" ""When I Grow Up (To Be A Man),"" ""Barbara Ann,"" ""Wild Honey,"" and ""Darlin'"" (the last two of which appeared here for the first time in stereo), and the single version of ""Isn't It Time."" Here's a break-down of the set:
SONG SELECTION: As you might expect, most of the songs on the set are from the '60s, the period during which the group had the vast majority of their (Top 40) hits, and did the other songs that they are probably most known for. Almost all of their hits are included, and there are also many non-hit single sides and songs that only appeared on albums. I like all of the songs here, though of course (as is the case with any artist's music) some are better than others. Also of course, probably every fan (including this one!) has certain favorite songs that weren't included. A couple of exclusions that I find particularly odd are ""Be True To Your School"" (the single version) and ""Come Go With Me,"" both of which were hits for the group. (Although the former song WAS included on this set's condensed, single-disc ""counterpart,"" The Beach Boys' Greatest Hits, and is the only song there that isn't here also.) I would also have liked it if the songs ""Break Away"" (the ""original"" stereo mix, not the one with some different vocal parts that has appeared on a couple of other collections, including the Made In California box set), ""Long Promised Road,"" ""Marcella,"" and ""California Dreamin'"" had been included, for a few other examples. (""Break Away"" and the single version of ""Cottonfields"" [which IS here] were the group's last two pre-'80s Capitol single A-sides; if *I* was going to put one but not the other on a compilation, ""Cottonfields"" is the one I would leave off.) And, there WAS room on the set for more than 50 tracks, so I think it would have been better if they hadn't gotten ""poetic"" with the 50th Anniversary thing, and had put more on it. But I also think it's probably the best 2-CD BB collection that I know of.
TRACK SEQUENCE: The track order on this set is very weird. Not only does it not go in a straight line from the earliest tracks to the latest, but certain songs are positioned around ones that it doesn't seem ""natural"" (at least not to me) for them to be around. For a few examples: the post-'60s recordings ""Getcha Back"" (from '85), ""It's OK,"" and ""Rock And Roll Music"" (both from '76), which are the only post-'60s recordings on CD 1, each appear lodged between tracks from the mid-'60s; ""In My Room"" (from '63) appears on CD 2 between tracks from '67 and '72; and CD 2 opens with ""Kokomo"" (from '88) and closes with ""Good Vibrations"" (from '66)! Probably the best example of strange track placement on this set is ""Kiss Me, Baby"" (on CD 2), a track from '65, which is sandwiched between the 2012 ""reunion"" tracks ""Isn't It Time"" and ""That's Why God Made The Radio""! The track order here really isn't a major problem, although I can't help wondering just why the songs included on BB comps are almost never in the order that they were released!
THE MIXES: Most of the tracks on this set are in stereo; the exceptions are ""Do It Again"" (although, somewhat oddly, that one is in a 2012 stereo mix on the Made In California box set), ""Surfin' Safari,"" ""I Get Around,"" 'The little Girl I Once Knew,"" ""Help Me, Rhonda,"" ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" (those last two are the single versions), and ""Good Vibrations."" The other tracks are in either their originally-released stereo mixes or in later, more recent stereo mixes. Most of the ""later"" stereo mixes are of songs that weren't originally released in True stereo. Those who may want the original mono mixes of the songs may be disappointed, but since I personally prefer stereo, I appreciate the fact that this set is mostly stereo. However, it seems to me that some of the ""later"" stereo mixes work better than others. I think the least effective one here is the one of ""Do You Wanna Dance""; it sounds to me like the volume on the lead vocal wavers up and down (or like the vocal, well, ""dances"" from front to back in the mix), and like the guitar solo has been pushed way into the background. I find this disappointing, as I was looking forward to hearing that song in stereo! I like MOST of the mixes here, though.
SOUND QUALITY: Wow, that's one subjective subject! People don't all have the same ears or the same CD players, and not everyone notices or pays attention to every nuance, so it can be hard if not impossible to really say how the sound of any particular release ""is."" As for this set, as far as I (as a non-audiophile) am  concerned, the sound quality kind of alternates between being at least acceptable and being very good if not great. I have heard other BB CDs that I think have better overall sound quality, but I still find this set to be quite listenable, or the majority of it anyway.
OVERALL: I would say that this is a good set. It isn't perfect, at least not in my opinion, but I don't regret buying it! If you're a longtime fan and already have other BB comps and aren't a collector, it may not be needed, but I think it would be a good purchase for people who are less familiar with the group's music and don't have much of it (and who aren't sticklers for great sound quality!).","This 2 - CD compilation was released in honor of The Beach Boys ' 50th Anniversary , and so it contains 50 tracks .

I have definitely loved their first song Breakeven when it came out 3 years ago. But sadly, their later songs haven't been able to thrive in regards to voice and spirit. That is the case with their latest song Hall Of Fame, the lead single from their third album, #3. The song is alright, but not absolutely anything out of the ordinary from what I have heard from The Script, and from other artists before. I definitely am appealed to The Script, because they have made better music than a lot of other acts out there right now. I just hope there is better music from them down the road soon.

Glad All Over, the first release from the band in seven years, following the two solo albums by Jacob Dylan that sailed quietly under the radar, presents The Wallflowers rebooted, kicked into high gear, full of colourful imagery, and strung out on verbal and guitar hooks that splash across the screen with the raw urgency of ""Rock The Casaba,"" and features Mick Jones on two tracks.

Glad All Over hits like this is the very first time you're hearing the band, coming at you with a power that nearly erases their past low keyed outings as little more than Blonde On Blonde meandering nods ... finally coming to grips with their own talent, one that's filled with a huge sharp engulfing sound more suitable for the big stage, and not the small clubs.  Now ... there are going to be many who don't understand why a band some twenty years into their career would adopt a neo-punk attitude, and craft songs that stand in complete juxtaposition to the etherial atmospheric visions that both defined and graced their first releases.  Considering those aspects, this is not a comfortable album, but one that certainly reflects the times and world situation, and it's all by choice and design, making this just one more pocket for the boys to draw from, even if it is a bit out of their and our comfort zone.

A2I2A7N3OCPNW4,B009FRDF2Y,-1,1,4,"Listening to A Fine Frenzy's newest album, PINES, I was somewhat bewildered.  I frequently checked the MP3 player to ensure that I was indeed listening to Alison Sudol.  While I absolutely love this album, I'm not sure how most of her fans will receive it.

ONE CELL IN THE SEA was a pretty straight-forward pop record.  Sudol's voice and piano were frequently dominating the mix, but at the core of it, the album was a solid work from a great songwriter.  Her second full-length album, BOMB IN A BIRDCAGE, was a bit different.  It didn't feel exactly like a pop record -- Sudol's willingness to try new things made the album different from its predecessor and (at least for me) a great success.  Alison Sudol's third album really comes from left field.  Because BOMB IN A BIRDCAGE dabbled in atmostpherics and electronics, I was expecting something similar, but PINES a stripped down, minimalist affair.

From the very first track, it's obvious that this album is going to be different than anything A Fine Frenzy has ever done before.  The introductory track, ""Pinesong"" is slow to begin, and it leads with a wonderful acoustic guitar riff.  The only thing recognizable here is Alison Sudol's wonderful voice -- these songs do have hints of her songwriting, but for the most part, it feels dramatically different.  I honestly don't know if I have seen such a leap in songwriting: PINES is mature, confident, and vulnerable.  ""Riversong"" feels like a reverent prayer to nature, and ""Dream in the Dark"" barely contains more than just Sudol's vocals.  This song sets the pace for most of the songs to come, and mostly, the spare, lonely atmospheres that are created here having a huge beating heart at the core of them.  The tone is so consistent that when ""It's Alive"" comes in with its electronics and percussion, it's a bit jarring, even though his song sounds like something we would have expected from A Fine Frenzy.

While I have to say that this is my favorite A Fine Frenzy record to date, it's not without its few problems.  The album isn't always consistent: ""It's Alive,"" and ""Now is the Start"" sound like songs that would have been prepared for BOMB IN A BIRDCAGE.  The melodies aren't as strong here either: there's no ""Almost Lover"" or ""Electric Twist"" that are immediately accessible.  I don't know if I would blindly recommend this to other A Fine Frenzy -- I would strongly recommend fans to sample this album before diving in.  Fans of Sara Bareilles and Norah Jones should find a good bit here to love.  The minimal instrumentation might not be everyone's cup of tea.  Essential tracks to sample/download: ""Pinesong,"" ""Winds of Wander,"" and ""It's Alive.""","Listening to A Fine Frenzy 's newest album , PINES , I was somewhat bewildered .

  The next step is with Seattle-based rapper, Macklemore, taking shots at stereotypes and preconceived notions.  He doesn't have space in his world for the intolerance that leads to the discrimination of LGBT people.  So, this sweet ballad reaches out and tries to help people see the light of tolerance.

  Sadly, in the end, it's slightly more B than A. It's not that SONGS FOR THE END OF THE WORLD is a bad album...quite the contrary. Parts of the disc really do grow on you with repeated listens. It's just that it doesn't have the focus/sharpness/ease that graced VENUS.
  In addition, there are times when the album is just downright noisy. This growing need that many aging rockers seem to have to prove that they can still ROCK is some what frustrating...we KNOW you can do it, so just DO it! After all these years, there's nothing to prove...rock is as much attitude as it is loudness, and attitude equals heart. (This quirky syndrome affected, among others, parts of the new Heart album as well).
  A prime example of this trend is the opening track, ""Wide Awake."" There's so much going on in this bloated, over-the-top mess that nothing sticks. The frantic arrangement just seems chaotic, while the lyrics come across as shallow and amateurish. The lead vocal is decent enough, but it just gets lost under the weight of the rest of the track.
  Far better is ""Our Ship's Sinking."" Everything is turned up to 11 here, but there's still a strong sense of melody and structure. Things ebb and flow, building and receding. Springfield's lead vocal is as full of heart as it is attitude, making this a TRUE rocker. This track should have opened the album.
  ""I Hate Myself"" is my favorite cut for one reason...on this infectious rave-up, Springfield brilliantly blends the strongest moments of his poppier past with gutsy rock, resulting in an absolute gem. Toss in a killer lead vocal ~ how can you NOT love the high note in ""Soooon!""? ~ and you have one of Springfield's best songs to date.
  ""You And Me"" is a mid-tempo rocker that's delivered from the heart....and the soul. Springfield's honest, sincere lead vocal dances over the simple, yet powerful, arrangement, resulting in a romantic masterpiece. (When he sings ""And all the world will burn"", you know these two will be O.K.).
  As strong as ""Gabriel"" is, I wish they had stayed with just the acoustic guitars and keyboards that open the cut....they perfectly cushion Springfield's shimmering lead vocal. There's absolutely no reason they needed to add electric guitars and drums to this track....it would have been perfect without them, showing a very different side to Springfield. Very good...could have been great.
  ""A Sign Of Life"" isn't as bad as ""Wide Awake"" ~ it at least has a semblance of structure and a melody ~ but it still suffers from the same hollow, by-the-numbers vibe of the earlier cut. At this point in his career, Springfield can't be wasting time on songs that go nowhere, which is exactly what happens here.
  ""My Last Heartbeat"" has some strong lyrical content (""There's a hole in my soul/Where the love leaks out/A shadow in my heart/That's filled with doubt/A devil on my back/I can hear him shout/'Let me in! Let me in'""), but it all sinks under the heft of the arrangement and the strained lead vocal. Once again, too too much.
  ""Joshua"" is another wonderful example of that perfect blend of pop and rock. The track totally kicks out the jams, but it never once loses touch with it's melodic, tuneful core. Springfield's spirited lead vocal bobs and weaves between the lyrics, delivering a touching story of support, belief in someone, and, most importantly, love. Very nice.
  ""Love Screws Me Up"" is my other favorite track. A buoyant arrangement (love the Stones-flavored guitars!), an almost giddy lead vocal and the spirited ""la la"" backing vocals all come together perfectly. Toss in some great lyrics ~ ""I watch my heart/In your delicate hand/Slammed against my kitchen wall/It bursts like a bubble"" ~ and you have pop perfection!
  I'd have to call ""I Found You"" a draw...on the one hand, it sports a spot-on vocal and some strong lyrical imagry (""And then you made flowers from hurricanes""), but there's just something about the arrangement that seems....overdone. This is another one of those ""kitchen sink"" songs. (In retrospect, a lot of SFTEOTW would've benefited from the old ""Less is more"" adage). Another ""Nice, but could've been better"" cut.
  I don't want to sound like a broken record, but ""Depravity"" is another track that just doesn't go anywhere....well, no where besides backwards. This cut is like a bad 80's flashback. Another miss. (The repeated spelling of the title is particularly annoying).
  The disc ends on a strong note, chugging along with the clear-eyed, focused ""One Way Street."" The arrangement is crisp and economical, the vocal energetic and sincere. Granted, the lyrics get a little cliched (""Love is never a one way street""), but, overall, this is a pretty memorable way to close things out.
  So, the million dollar question is....where does Rick Springfield go from here? Was VENUS IN OVERDRIVE a fluke? Or is SONGS FOR THE END OF THE WORLD just the minor stumble? In either case, I will be here for the next chapter! (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).","Rick Springfield had his work cut out for him . After releasing arguably one of the best ( if not THE best ) albums of his career with 2008 's VENUS IN OVERDRIVE , he had to either A ) up his game BIG TIME , or B ) possibly suffer a latter - day sophomore slump . Sadly , in the end , it 's slightly more B than A. It 's not that SONGS FOR THE END OF THE WORLD is a bad album ... quite the contrary . Parts of the disc really do grow on you with repeated listens . It 's just that it does n't have the focus / sharpness / ease that graced VENUS .

A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B009IFYYIC,1,-1,3,"Why would someone with my musical tastes,even in rock n roll be interested in a new release by Rick Springfield? The answer is that I've always appreciate his devotion to rock song craft and survivability of well constructed guitar based pop/rock. That goes all the way back to the ""Jesse's Girl"" days of course. In the last decade or so Springfield has revived his career,making a serious of comebacks that are welcomed with a good degree of positive support. Because in terms of rock music Rick seems to adhere to an outlook that says it's more important to stick to ones own guns than follow any sort of particular trend (although in his heyday his style of pop/rock was somewhat trendy),I did have a level of excitement about the release of his new album. Felt it was even appropriate to change a few things to accommodate the modern era. Personally? There are some things about this album I feel just were not the best way for Rick to accomplish that.

  To start with there are some excellent songs here that,if the general album had stuck around that area,might've had a bit more to it.  ""Our Ship's Sinking"",""I Hate Myself"",the acoustic flavored ""Gabriel"",""Joshua"" and the closing ""One Way Street"" are five of the most captivating guitar based pop/rock songs I've heard come out of Rick-very much in his classic sound if very heavily produced to accommodate contemporary listeners. On a personal level some of these songs such as ""A Sign Of Life"",""Depravity"" and to some extent the opener ""Wide Awake"" embrace some of the guttural singing and overly loud and enraged,overly noisy guitar sound of the grunge rock era. Never much cared for how radio and critics tended to use that genre and alternative rock in general to smother over...well rock music of the kind Rick Springfield once specialized in. To me it's a cliche. And I really can't understand why Rick of all people would embrace that sound. If it's your kind of thing though,these songs will be just for you.

  On this special addition the bonus songs more than make up for anything I saw as weak on the album with another excellent guitar based pop/rocker in ""Let Me In"" as well as two demos ""Lust"" and ""Her Body Makes Vows"". With their classy production and use of echo and light electronic effects,they are full on 80's era Rick Springfield. Yes I feel that's the sound that made him and yes,I find much to value in that sound even today. There's also an excellent and like minded live rendition of Wings' classic ""Jet"". It's the type of version where it almost seems as if Paul McCartney wrote it for Rick Springfield. No contest that songs like that inspired his sound though. Though I must admit,my personal dislike of grunge and the controversially disintegrating sociological effect on the world around me did prevent me from giving this album a fully positive review,it's got a lot more going for it than not. And the best of it is,as they say,five star melodic pop/rock all the way.","Why would someone with my musical tastes , even in rock n roll be interested in a new release by Rick Springfield ?

Sometimes God speaks through some of the most unexpected people.  Ask Tiffany Arbuckle Lee aka Plumb.  Way back in the year 2000, Plumb was at the cusp of leaving her singing career after being haggard by the politics of the industry.  Just as Plumb sang her swan song at her farewell concert, a girl gave her note detailing how the song ""Damaged"" had rescued her from despair and how she had hoped that Plumb would continue to use her music as a vessel of God's healing. Taking this as an ominous sign from God, Plumb realized that her life's mission had yet to be complete.  So, she signed with the esteemed Curb Records in 2003 and has so far blessed us with three studio albums and a compilation collection.  More importantly, Plumb has a unique way of ministering God's healing to troubled souls especially teenagers suffering from abuse or shattered self-images with songs such as ""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""Nice, Nave and Beautiful,"" ""Cut,"" ""Real"" and ""God-Shaped Hole.""  ""Need You Now,"" Plumb's fourth studio album under the Curb imprint, will no doubt continue to advance such a Godly ministry with its lyrically poignant songs addressing issues of faith in the plight of our brokenness.  Hard to imagine, though is that ""Need You Now"" is Plumb's first album of all new material since 2007's ""Blink.""  While ""Blink"" was a sonic detour into heavy ballads and lullabies, ""Need You Now"" is a return to her signature form of electronic rock/pop.  Plumb again joins Jars of Clay's guitarist Matt Bronleewe in crafting most of the tunes with the occasional scribal input from Ben Glover, Joy Williams and Jars of Clay front man Dan Haseltine.

The songs of Plumb have always straddled between the fine line between human love and divine love.  Such ambiguity has certainly given her the advantageous edge of taking her songs beyond the Contemporary Christian genre.  To date, three of Plumb's songs (""In My Arms,"" ""Hang O"" and ""Drifting"") have even climbed up to the upper echelon of Billboard's Dance charts.  And her 2003 hit ""Real"" even made quite a splash in the UK secular chart.  The same is said of the majority of the tracks here on ""Need You Now.""  Though God is never mentioned, album opener ""Invisible"" could be read as a desperate cry for a lover's attention or God's redemption.  A brassy and soulful tune, ""Invisible"" calls to mind Adele's ""Skyfall"" where the majestic clamour of orchestra and the ethereal swirling of electronica meet.  ""Drifting,"" the album's debut single, is more a mainline rock ballad with Jars of Clay's Dan Haseltine helping build to the song's stratospheric climax. While songs like the cutesy ""Chocolate and Ice Cream"" and ""One Drop"" are more overtly romantic flurries with Plumb adopting some of Colbie Caillat-inspired sparkling Californian electronic bells and syncopated beats.

Months before the release of this album, Plumb has tweeted that this release was supposed to be titled ""Faster than a Bullet"" (a phrase taken from the song ""At Arm's Length"").  However, the recent tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School have rendered such a titular inappropriate.  Feeling overwhelmed by the whole catastrophe, Plumb has dedicated the album's second single ""Need You Now"" to the family and friends of the victims.  The title cut ""Need You Now"" is the nerve center of this record.  It is also one of Plumb best compositions to date:  passionately delivered over a mid-tempo string-laden ballad, this is also Plumb most explicit cry to God mentioning Him not with a mere pronoun but by name.  ""Unlovable"" is the other track that is more religiously explicit-here Plumb addresses the hypocritical nature of some churches who have tasted God's grace but yet thrifty in extending it to others.  While ""Say Your Name"" is an anthemic cry to God; it is wistfully built up by a cacophony of strings, a tremulous drum beats and a rush of synthesizers.

""At Arm's Length"" sounds like words lifted out of the book of Hosea where God is pictured as a love sick paramour desperately calling us to be reconciled to Him.  But here also lies the problem with this album:  though it is True and right to speak of God as our forlorn lover waiting for us and the Bible is replete with such examples.  But God on the other hand is holy; in an album where God is spoken of in the guise of the generic ""he,"" it's hard to convey that in such rhetoric.  Hence, what is missing from ""Need You Now"" is that the glorious ""otherness"" of God sometimes is compromised over our human longings.  Also, when Plumb does mention God by name (as in the title cut) there is such power, such sweetness, such comfort that it really behooves us why God and Jesus are not mentioned more often.  Let's just wish with the next album Plumb will let Jesus out of the closet a tad more.","Prime Cuts : Unlovable , Need You Now , Say Your Name

Somehow they've just become homogenised, bland, run-of-the-mill action films!  James Bond has become one-dimensional, minus the sex appeal, missing the playful intention of the earlier series.  Perhaps they should have stopped after Sean Connery got too old to play the part.  That aside, this song made it well worth renting the DVD just to hear Adele's beautiful voice belting out the tune.  Not that I was able to stay awake for the entire film, but the song certainly gives me a lift.  :)","I 'm probably a lone voice when I say that I do n't much care for the new James Bond movies .

Adele's in great voice, still so much like a latter-day Randy Crawford, but hearing her constant intakes of air detracts from the experience.

Lyrically... it's not so good.  It starts out in classic Bond fashion- a simple measure having almost nothing to do with the movie for the sole purpose of working 'Skyfall' into the refrain.  Then it switches into sort of an angsty love song or something, again just to work in 'Skyfall'.  Overall- I love the music, like Adele's singing but the lyrics are lacking.  But I guess that's what most Bond themes have been like, haven't they?  lol","It has a real Shirley Bassey feel to it , taking you back to the glory days of John Barry / Marvin Hamlisch , et al .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B009L5EOCU,1,-1,3,"When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the overexposed artists that has ever came out of the past several years, and really made cornball music that really has wasted away her voice. She really has not even learned that its takes time to make a good album and a good set of songs, not a rush job. Personally with her going back to Chris Brown after the physical abuse she had suffered is a very bad warning in her as a artist. Her latest song Diamonds is not really as driven as she could have made it, but honestly is at least better than the cheesy ballads she has made in her music like Unfaithful, or the collaboration with Coldplay on Priincess Of China for their Mylo Xyloto album. I think she sounded like she did strain herself in her voice a bit. But the lyrics are definitely starting to be there in her songs. Nevertheless, Rihanna should take more time to find herself as a singer, not the wasted actress in Battleship she threw herself in as a bust.

Throughout the effort, Meek Mill shows off his agile rhymes and ability to craft solid verses.  Sometimes, Meek Mill lacks the innovativeness of his most tuned in contemporaries (Drake and Kid CuDi among them). Dreams and Nightmares is a solid affair, if scattered, lacking in cohesion. Despite this, Dreams and Nightmares ends up being another strong MMG release.

""Dreams and Nightmares"" finds Meek Mill rapping in a narrative fashion. Tone The Beat Bull provides dramatic production that allows Meek Mill to rap on `autopilot.' The intensity progresses upon the 1:30 mark inciting Meek Mill's vocals to grow louder and more passionate. Perhaps somewhat clunky, it starts things solidly.  Proceeding ""In God We Trust,"" features dark, malicious production (Black Metaphor) proving to be as pointed as Meek Mill's rhymes. Meek Mill continues to tell a story and produces quite an effective, telling hook. ""In God We Trust"" is overall superb.

""Young and Gettin' It,"" features standout Kirko Bangz  serving as a `crowd pleaser.' Kirko Bangz adds a lift on the smooth vocal hook.  The cut features solid production from  Jahlil Beats and diverts away from Meek Mill's narrative approach in favor of  a topic of `making money.'  It is solid, though solid with the reservation that the cut feels like a `sellout' compared to previous cuts. ""Traumatized,"" produced by Boi-1da, returns Meek Mill to what he does best, more narrative-driven rhymes. Not the most elite cut, ""Traumatized"" is easily above average.

""Believe It"" featuring Rick Ross is predictable, but also addictive. Money and paraphernalia seem to be the agenda, with Ross referencing `Miley Cyrus' and `Justin Bieber' in relation to drugs. Quite similar to ""So Sophisticated"" from God Forgives, I Don't, ""Believe It"" is quite enjoyable. ""Maybach Curtains"" maybe stronger, playing as Meek Mill's version  ""Maybach Music,"" popularized by Rick Ross. John Legend assists on the soulful hook, while Nas and Rick Ross contribute on respective verses.' ""Maybach Curtains"" is easily one of the Dreams and Nightmares's shining moments.

""Amen"" proceeds featuring Drake sports a smart Michael McDonald sample (""Minute By Minute""). Nearly if not blasphemous,  Meek Mill thanks God ""...for all the pretty women he let into my life/all the Benjamins you let me count...and letting me ball on these..."" Meek Mill is most sinful on the hook, rapping a sermon in `hood vernacular.' Drake delivers, but Meek Mill locks down ""Amen"" easily.

""Young Kings"" features soulful production and delivers another solid track with a potent hook. ""Lay Up"" once more features Rick Ross, alongside Wale and Trey Songz, who delivers the lush and sensual hook. The cut is predictable, providing the `sensual' thriller of Dreams and Nightmares. ""Tony Story, Pt. 2 is easily a `mixtape' worthy track that continues to hone in on Meek Mill's narrative approach. Absent of hook, Meek Mill pulls of the unbroken flow of verses well.

""Who You're Around"" is more notable, featuring Mary J. Blige sounding as soulful and refined as ever on the memorable hook (""Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down/but it's okay to keep enemies close/as long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around..."")  Meek Mill `steps his game up' by slowing his usual agile flow, which helps makes his rapping much easier to discern.  On ""Polo & Shell Tops"" finds Meek Mill in top-notch form.  Arguably the best cut, Meek Mill outdoes himself over Cardiak's exceptional production. ""Polo & Shell Tops"" allows the listeners to step into Meek Mill's world via his biography.

""Rich & Famous"" features Louie V.  feels more archetypical than not; it could have been omitted. ""Real N**** Come First"" closes the standard version with superb, malicious production from Kenoe and Got Koke. The Deluxe edition sports ""Burn"" featuring Big Sean, the latest single prior to the release. ""Freak Show"" featuring Sam Sneak and 2 Chainz is nothing more than `OK,' potentially making the standard edition the best investment.

A2DJYERRIH5C8T,B009VLX8FS,1,-1,3,Before this came out.  Taylor Swift was never  straight ahead country.  But she had a fan base that any artist in any kind of music would have liked to have had.  With this cd.  She is going in more of a pop direction.  But her songs are still being played on country radio.  I don't like this cd as much as the ones before it.  The title song Red is a good song about all the different emotions of a relationship.  And I have always thought she was a great writer.  She really has a gift especially to be so young.  We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together is maybe my least favorite song of her's.  It is over the top.  22 is good.  Everything Has Changed and Begin Again are my favorite songs.  I wish she would go back to her roots.  But this cd sold about a zillion copy's then she went full fledged pop.

I can't stand the part where she is talking in the middle of it, but that's just me.  Other people love the song.  I have been listening to the deluxe version of this album for a few days now and I have to be honest, I couldn't even tell you one song that has truly stuck out to me as being a favorite.

If these guys had one ounce of melodic harmony they would rule the musical portion of earth.
Marco and guthrie will amaze and bore you to tears at the same time with their physical prowess.
Dont know whether to punch them or shake their hand ? So do both!!

With NUMEROUS pushbacks in the late 2012 you would think it was to make the product much better. But that didn't seem to be the case here.

O.N.I.F.C. (Only N**** In First Class/One Night In First Class) is the worst of all. And one would expect this to be good after the mixtape Taylor Allerdice, which was good as well.

Production heren is good. You can tell that Wiz picked the beats that have the nice long vibing sounds, which is heard all over this album. The best songs on here are the ones he colabs with other artists. ""Let It Go"" has Akon singing the chorus around Wiz' braggadocious lyrics. ""The Bluff"" has Cam'ron spitting a good verse. Even 2 Chainz sounds refreshing on ""Its Nothin"". And his Taylor Gang crew members sound better than him on ""The Plan"" and ""Medicated"". The single ""Remember You"" with The Weeknd sounds good, but having Abel lead off the song and sing the chorus and has Wiz rhyme about something totally different makes the song almost a waste. There are a small number of solo songs that Wiz has that he can hold his own, but don't expect much from those.

O.N.I.F.C. had the potential to be a good album. I for one is very dissapointed after all the pushbacks and delays, this is the best we as fans can get.

A92F571Y9MTW6,B0091LH6YM,1,-1,3,"When the quartet Slaughterhouse formed in 2008, almost all of them had a little over a decade of recording experience. Joell Ortiz got his start as a guest and co-producer on songs from Kool G. Rap's 2002 album ""The Giancana Story"". Joe Budden had a huge hit with the Just Blaze produced single ""Pump It Up"" and Crooked I was a recording artist on Death Row Records who recorded songs for a few soundtracks. Lastly, Royce Da 5'9"" was an Eminem associate who went his own way and released a few albums independently. By the time the end of the decade came, all of the formerly solo artists came together as a supergroup for one song on Budden's album ""Halfway House"". The song was well received and they moved forward with plans to record an album as a group. In 2009, they released their critically acclaimed self titled debut on E1 Music, which yielded the singles ""Microphone"" and ""The One"". In 2011, Royce and Eminem patched up their differences and recorded the long awaited collaboration album as Bad Meets Evil. That same year, Eminem signed Slaughterhouse to his Interscope distributed Shady Records and the end result is their sophomore album ""Welcome To: Our House"".

While their debut was deeply rooted in the underground scene, their new album is clearly aimed at a wider audience. A lot of that has to do with their CEO/executive producer Eminem whose heavy handed ways are prevalent throughout this recording. The album opens up with the Skylar Grey featured ""Our House"", in which they cite other hip hop artists that have influenced them. Busta Rhymes guests on the chorus on the Hit-Boy produced ""Coffin"", while they sample Korn's ""Falling Away From Me"" on the first single ""Hammer Dance"". Producer No I.D. (Jay-Z, Kanye West, Common) turns in the frantic sounding ""Get Up"", while Cee-Lo Green guests on ""My Life"". On ""Flip A Bird"", they turn a sample of Imogen Heap's ""Little Bird"" into a song about leaving the music industry to become a drug runner. They reunite with Mr. Porter on the Swizz Beatz assisted club anthem ""Throw It Away"" as well as on the song ""Die"". For the most part, Slaughterhouse's ""Welcome To: Our House"" is a decent record that could have been a lot better. While they are at the top of their game lyrically, the production is a tad bothersome and doesn't quite work with their sound. In short, if one is looking for something similar to their debut, ""Welcome To: Our House"" is the farthest thing from it.","When the quartet Slaughterhouse formed in 2008 , almost all of them had a little over a decade of recording experience .

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B0091LH6YM,1,-1,3,"Slaughterhouse is a rap group comprised of Royce Da 5'9"", Crooked I, Joe Budden, and Joel Ortiz. Signed on Eminem's Shady label, Eminem serves as executive producer, featured artist, songwriter, and producer throughout.  Overall, well crafted,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Welcome-To-Our-House-Explicit/dp/B008Y0X1MM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Welcome To: Our House [Explicit</a>] never quite reaches `valedictory.'

The album opens with the intro ""The Slaughter,"" which is produced by Eminem and features rap vocals by Marv Won; Chainsaw sound effects represent `the slaughter' while moody piano enters towards the end, foreshadowing ""Our House.""

""Our House"" features Eminem as well as frequent hip-hop collaborative go-to Skylar Grey.  Produced by Alex Da Kid. the drums are gargantuan in sound, buttressing this mysterious opener. Eminem sings one of two hooks propelling ""Our House"": ""I wanna be the best who ever did it/Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't/but if it is then God, if your listenin'/please give the strength to crush all the competition..."" Grey also has her own significant moment: ""So welcome, to our house/where no one, comes back out/ you won't find, comfort/in here, in here, in here."" Despite its lengthiness, ""Our House"" is epic.

""Coffin"" features Busta Rhymes (hook). Produced by Hit-Boy, the production is solid, particularly the drum programming.  The cut comes off clunky and less satisfying compared to ""Our House."" ""Coffin"" misses the `elite' of Welcome.

""Throw That,"" featuring/co-produced by Eminem, and produced by T-Minus, contains elements from ""Throw the D"" (2 Live Crew) and ""It Takes Two."" Eminem rips through the NSFW hook.  Royce Da 5'9 handles the first verse, followed by Crooked I, Budden, and Ortiz on respective verses.  Add a sound bridge and Slaughterhouse delivers another strong track. 
""Hammer Dance"" is more appealing here than as its was upon its promo issue.  Featuring elements of  ""Falling Away From Me,"" Royce anchors it down with his hook: ""I'm in the club, bottle in my hand doing my two step/while I got my gun in my pants, call it the hammer dance...""  The remaining members of Slaughterhouse handle verses (Ortiz, Crooked I, and Budden).

""Get Up,"" produced by NO I.D delivers a cut with a sound described as old-school in quality.  The biggest drawback of ""Get Up"" is its five minute duration.  It eclipses The Cee Lo Green assisted ""My Life,"" which feels ever so slightly generic.  Produced by STREETRUNNERS, Cee Lo's overt, somewhat brash hook that is a bit off-putting. A bridge by Green runs by, taking further away from his usual soulfulness.  All members of Slaughterhouse rap here, but none of the verses necessarily `stand out.'

""We Did It (Skit)"" precedes the captivating ""Flip A Bird,"" which contains a sample from ""Little Bird"" written and performed by Imogen Heap.  The hook is catchy by all means. All members of Slaughterhouse receive a verse, though Crooked I gets a lyrical highlight: ""Let me get it now/on Twitter, they murder my mentions, cause they heard I was served by a circle of henchmen...""

""Throw It Away"" is arguably the best cut. Produced by Mr. Porter and featuring an energized Swizz Beatz, ""Throw It Away"" has hit written all over it.  All of the verses by Slaughterhouse are solid, but it just may be Swizz Beatz's moments that steal the show: ""You know I ain't Bill Gates honey/but I'mma act like I ain't never had money and throw it away... you know I ain't Jay-Z honey/but I'mma act like I ain't never had money..."" Well produced and conceived, ""Throw It Away"" is amongst the elite.

""Rescue Me"" gives Skylar Grey another guest spot though does not eclipse her showing on ""Our House."" The rhymes aren't individually noteworthy, but the track as a whole yields some solid moments. ""Frat House"" is another B-level cut, featuring sound production work by T-Minus, though doesn't live up to the same hype lyrically.  The hook is True to the connotation given to a frat house, evidenced by its hook.  Royce handles verse 1, Crooked I verse two (""LBC, we them beach boys/we don't need your education/we Pink Floyd), while Joe Budden and Joell Ortiz duel on verse 4 (""...Bend over, take her to church now she in U-Mass..."")

""Goodbye,"" produced by Boi-1da opts for piano as opposed to the rawer sounds exhibited in cuts ""Frat House."" The hook is sung by Ming, who is only credited in the credits within the jacket. Royce fails to appear here, letting the other members hold down the cut.

""Park It Sideways,"" produced by Kane Beatz, features a catchy hook and works well over the bright production.  All four members have their say here, with the verses segued into pairs (Royce/Budden and Crooked I/Ortiz).

""Die,"" produced by Mr. Porter gives Slaughterhouse another top-notch cut. Joell Ortiz sits out, but Joe Budden wins the rap battle here: ""...New bodies on old heaters/we ain't rapped too tight/starving, they thought Jeffrey Dahmer had an appetite..."" ""Our Way (Outro)"" closes the effort.  It is not really notable unfortunately, making the top-rate ""Die"" seem the True closing cut.

A1N5FSCYN4796F,B00AO2SGHI,-1,1,5,"When it comes to ethereal adult alternative music, the two staples have been Sarah McLachlan and Dido.  The latest entry from these two is Dido's Girl Who Got Away.  Some albums I can size up quickly while others take me a while to process.  This one falls into the latter category.

Of Dido's four albums, Girl Who Got Away leans the heaviest toward R&B.  This is most evident on ""Let Us Move On"" where Kendrick Lamar makes a guest appearance.  However, ""Blackbird"", ""End Of Night"", and um, let's say track #7, also have similar qualities.  The R&B slant was not across the board, however.  Some tracks have a sparser feel to them such as ""Sitting On Top Of The World"", ""Happy New Year"", and ""Day Before We Went To War"".

While the style may have some different nuances, there is a common feel to the songs.  Some, such as ""No Freedom"", ""Let Us Move On"", ""Blackbird"", ""Happy New Year"", and ""Loveless Hearts"" deal with love gone wrong or lost.  For example, ""No Freedom"" has the line ""By the look in your eyes I can tell/You Don't think I'll be back for more."" while ""Blackbird"" has ""Why do I bring you love/When all you give me back is pain?"".The overall album leaves me with a sense of melancholy, and it is one that I listen to when I want to unwind or when I am going to sleep.

Girl Who Got Away is another great album from Dido, and I highly recommend it to old and new fans alike.

And there you have it. I am not, repeat, not a legalistic Christian BUT the smattering of cuss words I heard on here was enough to give me pause and feel a touch of embarrassment.  Sho you are so talented and gifted man, you could have stated your wisdom without the coarse language.

Do people curse/ cuss in the real world? Of course. Can this album reach a Unbeliever due to the sheer volume of Mature themes and issues? Absolutely. But you diminished the Album's greatness with the hard language.

That said, here are the words that came to me as I listened:

Eclectic, Nouveau, PG, Thought-Provoking, Conversation, Real, Deep/ Profound, Soulful, Truthful...

If you want to support Sho Baraka but are unsure what to download as Singles, (I copped the whole Album,) I suggest the following tracks:
Mahalia, Ali, Madoff, Peter Pan, Cliff and Claire, Me, King

Of all the tracks only ""Michael"" ""Mrs."" ""Denzel"" did I not feel. Not that they were bad, just not my style. They also had more than few cuss words in them to turn me off to the vibe he was going for.

Now the ""big one,""  Jim Crow.  This is no doubt the ""most controversial"" track on the whole album and with reason. It is a banger, a 5 banger, an Instant Classic, BUT the n-bomb, a garden tool, a female dog and primates are splattered all throughout.  This is a heavy song and will create much discussion.  It is NOT a bad song, just a heavy one.

This album is hardcore, and I get the feeling that Sho is still Christ-centered but he delivers the tales he spits with a venom that displays his own personal hurts and realizations.

This album is fire but for so much of the ""softer"" Christian Rap flare, it goes hard.

Sho may very well be the Tupac of Christian Rap...","And there you have it .

A2N6LVH039X81N,B00AOMZHSO,-1,1,5,"As many have noted, this set is an incredible bargain, especially for 99 cents. 15 hours of great music in good to excellent performances in pretty good sound is hard to beat, especially since these are full pieces rather than snippets. I'm especially impressed, so far, by Hungerford's sonnets for piano (which I'd always wanted to hear), Matthews performances of the piano variations, Abravanel's Creatures of Prometheus (a very interesting and hard to find piece), and the Yale Quartet's set of the late string quartets.

But, as the helpful reviews by N. Podaci and Sol L. Seigel have noted, there are a handful of glitches, the most important of which (omission of 3rd movement of SQ 15) was corrected by Customer Service, but the other ones not. Here's a quick guide to how to fix those glitches. In iTunes, you can make these changes by right clicking on a track, choosing ""Get Info"" from the pop-up menu, and then making the appropriate edit. First of all, reverse the order of the two movements of the Waldstein Sonata. Track 45 should be track 46, and vice versa.
Second, delete tracks 83 and 84. These are labeled as the last two movements of the Op. 127 String Quartet but they are really duplicates of the last two movements of the Quartet Op. 130. As you can see, track 82 is correctly labelled the ""Finale"" of Op. 127. Next, rename tracks 162-165. This piece is really Sonata No. 12, Op. 26 (""Funeral March""), not, as indicated, Sonata 26 (""Les Adieu""). You can google online for the correct tempo indicators for the four movements of Sonata No. 12. (Sonata 26 has only 3 movements!)
Once you've made these changes, you'll have a correctly labeled set of Beethoven masterpieces and all for less than a buck. I think its worth taking a couple of minutes to make it right. Enjoy!","As many have noted , this set is an incredible bargain , especially for 99 cents . 15 hours of great music in good to excellent performances in pretty good sound is hard to beat , especially since these are full pieces rather than snippets . I 'm especially impressed , so far , by Hungerford 's sonnets for piano ( which I 'd always wanted to hear ) , Matthews performances of the piano variations , Abravanel 's Creatures of Prometheus ( a very interesting and hard to find piece ) , and the Yale Quartet 's set of the late string quartets . But , as the helpful reviews by N. Podaci and Sol L. Seigel have noted , there are a handful of glitches , the most important of which ( omission of 3rd movement of SQ 15 ) was corrected by Customer Service , but the other ones not . Here 's a quick guide to how to fix those glitches . In iTunes , you can make these changes by right clicking on a track , choosing "" Get Info "" from the pop - up menu , and then making the appropriate edit . First of all , reverse the order of the two movements of the Waldstein Sonata . Track 45 should be track 46 , and vice versa . Second , delete tracks 83 and 84 . These are labeled as the last two movements of the Op . 127 String Quartet but they are really duplicates of the last two movements of the Quartet Op . As you can see , track 82 is correctly labelled the "" Finale "" of Op . Next , rename tracks 162 - 165 . This piece is really Sonata No . 12 , Op . 26 ( "" Funeral March "" ) , not , as indicated , Sonata 26 ( "" Les Adieu "" ) . You can google online for the correct tempo indicators for the four movements of Sonata No . 12 . ( Sonata 26 has only 3 movements ! ) Once you 've made these changes , you 'll have a correctly labeled set of Beethoven masterpieces and all for less than a buck . I think its worth taking a couple of minutes to make it right . Enjoy !"

One of the pleasures of reviewing music for the past year and a half has been discovering new bands - but in my case it has been less a case of discovering NEW bands, as discovering bands that are new to me.  Apparently Tegan and Sara have been around since the 90's.  Didn't know that.  I'd heard OF them but I'd never really HEARD them.

But let's dispense with the usual summary/description/analysis stuff and simply say a few words in favor of this record in the hope that you'll decide to hear it for yourself:

I was working on another review of a more serious sounding and self-important indie rock release, and although the record was pretty good, I was having trouble focusing.  I decided to take a break and try Tegan and Sara's new dancey pop record HEARTTHROB instead.  Bingo.  Suddenly listening to music was fun again and I didn't have to work so hard to like what I was hearing.  If some albums are like eating your vegetables and some albums are like eating your fruit, then I would say HEARTTHROB is a nice juicy peach.

Sincerely,

Constant Listener","Dear Music Appreciators ,

But then when I got to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, I took a break and turned up the volume to listen more closely.  Aargh!  My first impression was:  muddy sound.  Then I thought I heard more problems, so I loaded the file into an audio editing program to analyze what was going on.  The basic recording is in MONO.  Not only that, but when I paid attention, I could hear surface noise from a phonograph record playback!  Clearly, this was dubbed from an old LP.  Indeed, there seems to be a bit of stereophonic reverberation added, which probably accounts for some (if not all) of the muddiness I hear.

What's more, as another reviewer points out, this does not sound like a mere quartet (it's listed as The Griller Quartet, which was active from 1931 until about 1963)... it seems to be a much larger ensemble.

I note that there are several other tracks from the Griller Quartet; I haven't had time to analyze them all.  Hopefully some of them are better quality than this, especially because some feature William Primrose who was a notably excellent violist.

Another reviewer has noted disappointing audio in the Symphony nr. 40 and I concur.  Again, close listening and analysis shows that it's an original mono recording.  Again, there's a small amount of stereophonic ""muddiness"" which seems to be fake reverb.

(For anyone who has the means to do so, I strongly recommend you decode the relevant tracks, make a full mono (L+R) mix to get rid of the background garble, then re-encode them at 320kbps to prevent further degradation.  But even so, the result will certainly not be nearly as good as current recordings should sound.)

If I were to rate just the above mentioned selections, they would get just one star.  Part of that is because the quality could be a lot better, and part of that is because Amazon has not  warned us anywhere about how bad they sound.  Since I have not had time to analyze all 131 tracks, I will hope that most of the rest are much better, and I'll just knock the rating down to four stars, at this point in time.  Hopefully I won't find any more glaring problems like these.","I was initially happy to get such a big collection for such a low price .

Another reviewer has noted disappointing audio in the Symphony nr . Again , close listening and analysis shows that it 's an original mono recording . Again , there 's a small amount of stereophonic "" muddiness "" which seems to be fake reverb . ( For anyone who has the means to do so , I strongly recommend you decode the relevant tracks , make a full mono ( L+R ) mix to get rid of the background garble , then re - encode them at 320kbps to prevent further degradation . But even so , the result will certainly not be nearly as good as current recordings should sound . ) If I were to rate just the above mentioned selections , they would get just one star . Part of that is because the quality could be a lot better , and part of that is because Amazon has not   warned us anywhere about how bad they sound . Since I have not had time to analyze all 131 tracks , I will hope that most of the rest are much better , and I 'll just knock the rating down to four stars , at this point in time . Hopefully I wo n't find any more glaring problems like these ."

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B00BEBM9JY,1,-1,3,"For those who are unaware, Rodney Crowell used to be part of Emmylou Harris' Hot Band, way back in the mid-'70s.  Crowell went onto his own success as a songwriter and artist (and Rosanne Cash's first husband).

Fast forward 30-odd years later and Harris and Crowell have finally put out an album together, 'Old Yellow Moon'.  While it had been in the works for a while, it was finally released recently.  I was SO looking forward to this when I heard about it almost a year ago.

For all of Crowell's songwriting skills, only four of the dozen songs are his - the rest are covers from other artists, which is actually Harris' strength.

I really like both artists, so why am I not fully digging 'Old Yellow Moon'?  Was the anticipation too high?

There are some tunes are old country like, that both performed back in the day - and they can be good (""Chase the Feeling"", ""Invitation to the Blues"", ""Bluebird Wine"", ""Bull Rider"" and ""Open Season on My Heart""), but I would be hard pressed to say any were great.

Harris has some really good leads (""Spanish Dancer"").  Crowell does ok on a few.  Then there are some that should really work well and don't quite deliver (""Back When We Were Beautiful"").  And then there are one or two that just kind of drag down the disk (""Black Caffeine"" for example).

Harris still has an incredible voice and I like Crowell as a solo artist and as a songwriter and producer.  I'm not sure why he didn't produce this (or write more songs for this), as it was handled by Harris' ex-husband and the man who helmed a number of her disks in the '70s and '80s (and one or two of her last disks).

Perhaps the disk will grow on me, but I didn't get a great first or second impression.

There aren't much thought-provoking topics as featured on DISTURBED's last album ASYLUM. But, rarely does that level up to an album being terrible, and DEVICE's self titled is far from a disappointment.

That is why I was so surprised to find out that Draiman is the voice behind Device. I listened to the clips of the songs on Amazon before I read the reviews, so I was already interested in the music before the relation to Disturbed could turn me off.

If you told a fan of KMFDM that Device was industrial, they would probably laugh at you. Of course, I don't care for KMFDM or True industrial, so Device's industrial-lite metal is okay with me. I was initially drawn to the album by the album's heaviness and Draiman's voice. Without knowing who was singing, I thought the singer was topnotch. Now that I own the album and know that the singer is David Draiman of Disturbed, I am going to go back and give Disturbed's catalog another listen. I do have one issue with what I consider an otherwise great album. Sadly, Device is seriously lacking in guitar leads. In place of leads, Draiman has inserted a number of melodic bridges into the songs. I'm not sure why he chose not to include leads in his songs; they would only have added to the music, but perhaps, being a singer, he saw the parts of the songs where leads would normally be as an opportunity to highlight his vocal abilities. All in all, the album is an enjoyable listen. I would recommend it to fans of all kinds of heavy music from Sevendust and Drowning Pool to Soilwork and Scar Symmetry.","I 've never been a fan of Disturbed .

AM4X3TREMZTQZ,B00BGTS0QA,-1,1,4,"Warning - Not for the Kids!

The language in this song is vulgar (lots of f-bombs).  It's definitely not for the kids or people offended by foul language!

The music from Watsky is very good.  The melody, beat and lyrics are all good, but the language is vulgar.  The message, about a couple accepting each other as they are, baggage and all, is great.

The sexual connotation of the title, however, just seemed to be pushing artistic license too far without adequate justification. For that, I've deducted a star.

AM4X3TREMZTQZ,B00BHL4KP2,-1,1,4,"This is a soft and beautiful country song, with a great perspective on aging gracefully.

Having said that, I believe that Ashley Monroe is musically gifted.  However, after listening to this song, I felt like something was just missing.  So I listened to it a few more times, just to be sure my impression didn't change.  In my opinion, what is missing from the song is the emotional impact it could (should?) have had.

Her vocals have a bit of a nasal quality, which is not automatically a negative.  However, I think the song would have been more pleasant, and she could have conveyed more emotion, if she had more fully used her diaphragm to support her voice.  This would have allowed her to match the timbre of the music to the wisdom of the lyrics.  In other words, the song sounded like she was singing AT the microphone, rather than singing from a place deep within the core of herself.  And great artistic creations, as well as emotions, come from deep within a person.

It's nice to have the opportunity to listen to new artists through these promotions, and I'm glad I picked this one up while it is free, because I wouldn't have listened to her otherwise.  Ms. Monroe has potential, and it will be interesting to watch her voice and career develop.","This is a soft and beautiful country song , with a great perspective on aging gracefully .

He's not a great lyric writer, some are actually cheesy, but i give him credit because he hasn't had years and years of experience like most lyric writers.

ADI1AHUVOW0ZT,B00C0QHX02,-1,1,4,"Question?... (ok, not so much of a review, I know, I know. But I am curious about this.)

The description of James Friskin's recording of the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue is interesting:

""Transcription in the Light of Harpsichord Technique""...

That's not the name Busoni gave to his transcription of Bach's Chromatic Fantasy (if it is Bach's, and not misattributed, the way some other items in this... ok, _there's_ a tangent for another time :) :) ) - that's the name Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji gave to his transcription of the Chromatic Fantasy, followed by a transcription by Sorabji of a ""Bach"" fugue, BWV 948 I think (which it seems is indeed the work that follows it here??) of even less known authenticity.  Still, Friskin isn't known (well, not listed on Worldcat, not listed at that wonderful site Bach-cantatas.com, etc.) to have recorded the Sorabji transcription (they only list one commercial recording, by Habermann; if you look under Friskin, their list of Bach-and-related recordings by him doesn't include that transcription, in turn, etc.) -- meanwhile, I don't know the Sorabji version so wouldn't be able to tell it from the Busoni or other transcriptions/arrangements the Chromatic Fantasia has received.  Anyone know or have a fairly good idea what's going on here?

I am a little concerned that I downloaded a Bach Cantatas set here from the same source that cost at least as much as this and seems to have been entirely duplicated by this Bigger Bach Set (if I'd noticed, I would have downloaded this, with all the music in that more(?) expensive mp3 set, all the music (same performances) in it and much more besides) but that's on me for not being careful, that'll happen. Sort of as if I were to have downloaded 15 tracks for 99c apiece before noticing I could have downloaded all 300-odd for $3.00, a mistake I fortunately did not make... quite a few good sets here from these (and the VoxBox collection), and if I have to make some tweaks to the descriptions and accept uneven performances, that unfortunately has been True for -much- more expensive music purchases too, quite a few of them, back when I was in a position to make them. Anyway. Help identifying the Bach arrangement appreciated, of course.)

Thanks.

Edit 12-23-13: ah, ok, sorry- problem solved. Ok, based on the sample page of the Sorabji arrangement/transcription here---

[...] ---

Friskin is -not- performing Sorabji's transcription (note the lack of sustained chords in right hand, at the beginning, and left hand, a little while in. Hrm. Anyway. :) Now I wonder if it's the Busoni, or his own transcription/arrangement, or...)

Additionally, the next track is mislabeled- it's not BWV 948 at all (which contributed to my confusion) but rather the fugue that usually follows the Chromatic Fantasia (whether or not actually by Bach - whose authenticity is not quite certain, but then, neither is that of Bach's perhaps most famous work which is not, however, in this set (the Toccata and Fugue in D minor).)

In connection with which and about this set- not a complaint, unavoidable given its provenance, though I wish the tracking had been updated given more modern information- is that BWV 53 is not (probably not!) by Bach, but by the earlier composer Georg Melchior Hoffmann (died 1715), perhaps copied for a performance by Bach around 1730; similarly one of the flute sonatas here is based on a violin sonata in G minor now regarded as probably by Bach's son Carl P.E. (catalogued as H.542.5, I think.) Probably other examples. But I still would and do recommend this set (and I've noticed of course that our response to finding out that the ""Jena"" symphony is not by Beethoven or that BWV 53 is not by Bach has generally been (fortunately with some exceptions, lately) to drop both from performances rather than, say, take any active interest in other works by the composers who were able to compose something good enough to fool a generation into thinking they'd written something by Beethoven or Bach (or in Hoffmann's case, composed something Bach wished to revive, which was the reason for the confusion)...","( ok , not so much of a review , I know , I know .

A3R33KMESG0XGQ,B00CEIGYAG,-1,1,4,"This review applies solely to the radio edit.

Alright, so I think I've given this song enough tries where I believe I can give a fairly honest review. It's indeed a new move for Daft Punk, using much more vocals and natural instrumentation than before. For some, this works; for others, it may not.

I've been hearing a lot of praise about this song, but also a lot lashing, and this review's primarily directed at those people. I feel that this album, not to mention the song, has been getting much overhype, especially in the weeks and days leading up to the announced single. There's been much more advertisement for this, much more than I recall seeing for their previous albums (though, if I can remember correctly, Discovery had a lot of news too), and that may be because of the proliferation from the Internet and the fact that the musicians are now signed with a much bigger label. Indeed, DP didn't have to worry too much about the scrutiny that comes from the Internet from earlier days.

From leaks to edits to remixes, we've heard it all. And now, finally, we're given the first single from their upcoming album, first as a radio edit. This is a substantial departure from their earlier sound. And I have to say: I like it. I like it a lot.

It seems that they're trying to revive disco, and it seems to work, all the while incorporating their signature sound as well. And, for the first time, the vocals seem to be more ""natural"" this time around; that is, less ""digitized,"" if you will. I admit, I was not enjoying the sound I first heard from Pharrell (despite the extremely catchy SNL ad), though the final version did sound better than the earlier leaks. I thought his voice didn't really add to the DP aesthetic, and the lyrics were very plain.
But DP isn't known for their arousing lyrics. They are masters at making the repetitive listenable, and when they do use actual lyrics it's not the worst. But after a few more listens of ""Get Lucky,"" I couldn't help but tap my feet in sync after a while. My co-worker, a big fan of Pharrell, instructed me that Pharrell is first and foremost a producer, a singer secondly.
Okay, that makes more sense.
But still--the lyrics? Surely he could've done better. And that's why I give this review 4 stars. The chorus is fantastic, and DP blows the rest of the song away when they approach the 2:20-ish mark. It is pure DP to the core. But the lyrics could've benefited from some fine-tuning.

It is, in the end, a great hit, and I can't wait for the whole album.

Now, I won't say I'm a ""True"" Daft Punk fan, because by saying so it makes me sound snobbish, not to mention exclusive in saying DP can't be enjoyed thoroughly by the younger and newer listeners. But I am a longtime fan. I was a wee lad when I first heard ""Da Funk"" as a single on Chicago's B96, and, when I had enough cash saved up, Homework was the first CD I ever bought.
And every new album that came out after I always compared it to Homework, and always was initially disappointed. But today I can tell you with confidence that Discovery is their best album to date, and Homework is a close second. I still have to get Human After All more tries, though I admit it's probably their ""worst,"" even though it's still pretty darn good. (For the record, Alive 2007 is my favorite, purely for the ecstasy of their mixes.)

So let's all enjoy Daft Punk's brave move into the mesh of disco and electronica, the extreme talent of Nile Rodgers et al., and the album that is to come.","This review applies solely to the radio edit .

Her album Love & War has not been the best of both worlds for her sound, but had sounded mixed by almost all the songs. The One, her second single from the album actually is a fairly good rhythm, which I found very catchy and driven. Yet, my one big gripe about the song isn't about the style, the song actually was a bit short and could've been a bit longer in heart. Tamar still has a long to find herself. Her music so far has been a nice start, but hopefully we'll hear much better from her that is more than just one.

It didn't have the same kind of electronic charm as Daft Punk's usual work, far more pop-based and with Willams overtaking their signature robotic vocals.  Much like another reviewer of this song, however, the more I listened to it, the more hooked I became.  It's a catchy song, upbeat and almost impossible not to dance along to.  I would have liked a bit more of Daft Punk's presence in this song than Williams', but that's just my personal preference.

Also, this song is VERY repetitive, and so it might drive some listeners nuts.  It doesn't bother me too much, however.  And while it might not be my favorite song by the band (I still enjoy ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" and ""One More Time"" more), it's still a good listen, a nice fusion of pop and electronica.","I 'm a fan of Daft Punk , but I have to admit that the first few times I heard their collaboration with Pharrell Williams , "" Get Lucky , "" I was n't impressed .

A36AS0J5HF0IP7,B00CVHEIVW,1,-1,3,"Like many others, I became acquainted with many of Bach's organ works through Kraft's six volume Vox Box series in the 1970s. Given that those 3 LP sets sold for about $10 each in my university's student stores, no one can complain about about the price of the present digitization. Even then, the performances didn't stand up well to the likes of Helmut Walcha (DG/Archiv). Walcha's more limited survey on Schnitger and Silbermann organs was more incisively interpreted even when tempos were similarly on the slow side. Kraft comes across as a very good provincial organist who is always technically acceptable and who allows the polyphony of the music to be heard. He is helped in that regard by colorful and varied registrations of several historic instruments (Leufsta Bruks, Haarlam, Lubeck, etc.). He is also consistent in bringing out the character of the numerous chorale based compositions. It is in the ""free"" works that Kraft can become a bit stolid. If there is anythng in the set that strikes me as an out and out failure, it is Kraft's sleep inducing performance of the ""Dorian"" toccata. It comes across as a finger exercise. An organist friend characterizes that performance and the one of the great Toccata in F Major as ""cheesy,"" giving the power of the music short shrift.

For the price, it is a good introduction to the organ works, even though Walcha in the same era wins the prize. More recent traversals include the Ton Koopman originally on Telefunken (now WEA) and Hans Faguis on BIS but at a much higher price.

The recordings capture the sound of the instruments well (including the clatter of the antique tracker actions) without being the last word in fidelity. The MP3 files played through my Musical Fidelity DAC connected to my audio system sound quite well - certainly better than my 40 something year old VOX LPs that were full of ticks and pops even when new.","Like many others , I became acquainted with many of Bach 's organ works through Kraft 's six volume Vox Box series in the 1970s .

I should probably use the relevant editing-suggestion feature instead, since this isn't so much a review as a quick comment that the floating, ""BWV-less"" Prelude in G major (recorded according to Worldcat by Galling around 1965) in there is actually the Prelude and Fughetta in G major (prelude only), BWV 902 (IMSLP gives 1730(?) composition (Bach-cantatas.com gives ""before 1730?"") and 1866 publication. (It seems to have been published twice in 1866, once as part of the Ausgabe, and once by Edition Peters. ... Anyway. Nice brief piece. Good performances, that I've heard so far (though it's interesting that Martin Galling is also the pianist on the Vox Boxen of French piano concertos, one of which the local library has... will have to listen to that again. I expect I really don't agree with the generally low opinion of his playing here though I may have a- there's a joke somewhere here- tin ear...)

(Sorry, wrote ""was"", but from the Bach-cantatas.com biography Galling (*1935) was alive- and an active member of a piano duo too- as of 2003, at least...)

The set is also not quite complete (even by 1960s standards, lacking Bach non-organ keyboard works that were published in the 1840s such as some of the fugues and fughettas BWV 944-962, including BWV 948 which is claimed to be, but isn't, on the ""Bigger Bach Set""), but - I admit to a _bit_ of bias; I think this is the same set that, as LPs, is in my parents' collection and that I grew up with; which introduced me to such minor, but charming, memorable, and very worth knowing, Bach as the 4 Duets, just for example (not to mention the version I know best of the (harpsichord version of the) lovely lute Prelude, Fugue and Allegro.

Going For The One was good and Tormato wasn't, but neither was a step forward. I suppose 90125 was but was that band really Yes? No more or less than this one as far as I'm concerned. The revolving door of players has taken its toll on my patience and on my being able to give a damn. So I bought this cd and I found it enjoyable. Is it prog rock? Not if prog rock actually means progressive rock, meaning music that moves forward, is adventurous, has an aim and is engaged in elevating rock above the realm of pop commercialism and cliche. For contemporary musicians doing just that I'd recommend Deerhoof, TuneYards, Radiohead, Bat For Lashes, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Tombs, Magma, King Crimson (retired?) or Scott Walker. Maybe even Animal Collective, Ween, Enslaved or Flaming Lips, but certainly not Yes. Yes gave up breaking new ground almost 30 years ago. This album is no exception. Is it great? No. Does it sound like previous Yes records? Yes, kinda. Anderson is missed, I like his voice a lot and Benoit David is a bit stiff by comparison. Do I miss Wakeman? Nope. He's most likely a great guy to have a pint with but his musical contributions with this band have been spotty since 1973, though I liked Going For The One, the studio parts of Keys To Ascension, and even Tormato. Fly From Here is pleasant music. Its not challenging, it breaks no new ground, but I like it. Its the musical equivalent of comfort food and cinematic in its sound and feel.

A3HFPK3AMDNGBI,B0070LQJ7U,1,-1,3,"First, let me say that I am glad seeing this many reviews pop up after being released for only three days! It shows a definite interest and healthy discussion about the ""legendary"" band Yes. Keep 'em coming. After following  Yes for over 4 decades I have to weigh in.

While I so desperately wanted to dislike the CD, I must admit that I just cannot. It is a solid piece of work. Granted, it is no 5 star and will never be destined to be a Yes ""classic"". Those days are long gone for Yes, as they are for any once dominant musical group of the 70's and 80's. The reason I wanted to dislike ""Fly From Here"" was because of all the issues surrounding the departure of Jon Anderson. Can there be a Yes without Jon Anderson. I think we all need to remember here that the only consistent torch bearer in Yes is Chris Squire. He is THE ONLY member who has been on virtually every single album/CD containing the title of Yes. Dare I say Yes is Chris's group. I say Yes is Chris's group. If you read any history of Yes it was Chris who spent months, locked away, honing his signature bass sound that became the foundation of all Yes music. So...can there be a Yes without Jon Anderson, of course, there already has been. So, all personal feelings aside, this is a good release without Jon Anderson. (Personally, much better than ""Open Your Eyes"" and ""Magnification"") Different without him, but it does not deserve to be rated as ""bad"" because of it.  One can dislike it for other reasons but don't just dismiss it because Jon is not the vocalist. Let me just break it down into some pros and cons:

Pros:
You still have one of the most recognizable, and best, rhythm sections in rock music with Steve Howe, Chris Squire, and Alan White. You have solid song writing with the unmistakable Yes sound. They bring back extended pieces of music rather than the short pop style of songs found on such works ""Open Your Eyes"" and ""Big Generator"". Geoff Downes  is a suitable keyboard replacement, although a bit unimaginative. (He does what he needs to do, about the same at Patrick Moraz  did.) (Downes played on Drama.)Keyboards have always been a revolving door with Yes anyway so you get used to different sounds. (I know, I know, Wakeman was the best. But then he is ""world class"") A really nice variety of song styles and lengths. You even get a solo acoustic number by Steve, ""Solitaire"".  It has been ages since we have had one of those on a new Yes release.
Cons:
Trevor Horn as the producer. The producer is so instrumental (no pun intended) in the way a group will sound on any particular release. I have never been fond of the way he makes Yes sound. He was responsible for the ""90125"" and ""Big Generator"". If you liked the way those works sounded then you will probably not have a problem with FFH. Personally, I think he makes them sound too sterile, too 80ish if that is actually a sound. Jon Anderson is not singing. I am not saying that Benoit David does not do a fine job. I can just hear different parts where Jon's voice would be much more appropriate and his interpretations much better in fitting with the music.

So the pros and cons really cancel each other out. This is a piece of work that everyone will have a different take on, simply based on who you like and who you don't like. Bottom line to me, it is a good Yes release, regardless of the players, and I like it. I am not going to say it is a ""must buy"" but I really can't think that any fan of Yes would be totally disappointed either.  Hence the 3 stars. You may like it, or you may not, but buy it to support the band. Good luck finding it in a store. It is a small label with limited distribution. (I gave up after checking three major music sellers.)  I would just order it on line or down load it.","First , let me say that I am glad seeing this many reviews pop up after being released for only three days !

A92F571Y9MTW6,B00DUFE30U,1,-1,3,"Singer Chante Moore arrived in the music industry as a 24 year old unknown on the soundtrack to ""House Party II"". Her duet with Keith Washington ""Candlelight & You"" was put in regular rotation in the Quiet Storm format and had everyone's attention focused on her. In 1992, she delivered her debut ""Precious""- which was mostly produced by George Duke and Tricky Stewart's older brother Laney Stewart. She followed it up with her second effort- the jazz inspired ""A Love Supreme"". For all of the respect she's gotten for her music, unfortunately she was relegated to the adult contemporary market despite being the around the same age as her peers in R&B. She sought to rectify that situation after taking a five year hiatus and released ""This Moment Is Mine"" in 1999. The album was mostly produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis with additional help from Rodney Jerkins and Jermaine Dupri. The following year, she decided to take things a step further by making the dance record ""Exposed"". While it was a Chante Moore album, it sounded like she was following trends instead of staying True to herself.

She recorded two albums with her then-husband Kenny Lattimore (""Things That Lovers Do"" and ""Uncovered/Covered""), before recording another album. She resurfaced after another five years with ""Love The Woman"" in 2008 and laid low yet another five years until 2013's ""Moore Is More"". On this new album, she has a few songs that reminiscent of her earlier works. However, most of the songs are geared toward reaching a younger and wider demographic. She starts the album off with the sultry ballad ""Baby Can I Touch Your Body"". She teams up with Louis Biancaniello & Sam Watters (Best known for Jessica Simpson's song ""I Wanna Love Your Forever"") on the single about infidelity ""Talking In My Sleep"". She also works with rapper/producer Kwame on the songs ""Alone"" and ""Doctor Doctor"". The production team Midi Mafia (Known for 50 Cent's ""21 Questions"" and Fantasia's ""When I See U"") produce the techno inspired ""On And On"", which features Da Brat working with Chante for the second time. She sings of being broken on the song ""Miss Under Stood"", which could be an unofficial sequel to her controversial song ""Bitter"", and delivers a gospel song on ""Jesus I Want You"". Overall, ""Moore Is More"" is a decent effort from Chante Moore. The album suffers from her trying to appeal to a different audience- which makes her sound horribly out of place. While it's far from being her best work, it's nice to have her back after an extended hiatus.","Singer Chante Moore arrived in the music industry as a 24 year old unknown on the soundtrack to "" House Party II "" . Her duet with Keith Washington "" Candlelight & You "" was put in regular rotation in the Quiet Storm format and had everyone 's attention focused on her . In 1992 , she delivered her debut "" Precious""- which was mostly produced by George Duke and Tricky Stewart 's older brother Laney Stewart . She followed it up with her second effort- the jazz inspired "" A Love Supreme "" . For all of the respect she 's gotten for her music , unfortunately she was relegated to the adult contemporary market despite being the around the same age as her peers in R&B. She sought to rectify that situation after taking a five year hiatus and released "" This Moment Is Mine "" in 1999 . The album was mostly produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis with additional help from Rodney Jerkins and Jermaine Dupri . The following year , she decided to take things a step further by making the dance record "" Exposed "" . While it was a Chante Moore album , it sounded like she was following trends instead of staying True to herself . She recorded two albums with her then - husband Kenny Lattimore ( "" Things That Lovers Do "" and "" Uncovered / Covered "" ) , before recording another album . She resurfaced after another five years with "" Love The Woman "" in 2008 and laid low yet another five years until 2013 's "" Moore Is More "" .

It isn't a bad song, but not really anything that really is swooning about. Still Robin is definitely a better singer / songwriter than simply all the joke songs that radio has been displaying from artists like Beyonce' and Rihanna. I do hope though there will be a better ballad from Robin worth swooning to and say for the rest of our lives.

A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B00DZ9ULTS,1,-1,2,"Well if you would look at all the horrible releases that's came out of Cash Money/YMCMB like<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Not-a-Human-Being-II/dp/B00BDZV9M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Not a Human Being II</a>, and<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hotel-California/dp/B00BDZV7DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hotel California</a>, you would think that this compilation would have little to offer. If you approach this album with the mind state of knowing what you are going to get, average rhymes over some of the best beats that money can buy (seriously if you bought this album expecting to hear intelligent lyrics then I don't know what to say). Now that YMCMB is signing any and everyone becoming more than a powerhouse label, Brian Williams aka Birdman aka Baby aka B-32 (took that one way back) decided to do was to showcase what everyone can do on this compilation while playing the role of Diddy on the album (excessive talking on tracks). While there is nothing that stands out too much, he puts together something decent for the summer.

True enough, formal rival Mystikal now signed to the label starts off the album (you remember ""Drag 'Em In The River""...you and that song are probably the same age lol). Here he sounds refreshed as he was during his No Limit days. ""Million Dollar"" with Detail and Future is average. Detail sounds like a Drake wannabe. ""Tapout""  is the lead single of this album. The song is your obvious formulaic style with half decent lyrics and your R&B/rapper style person on the hook. In this case is Future. ""We Been On"" is actually kind of good. The beat and R. Kelly providing a nice hook to the song is the reason why it works. ""Dreams Come True"" has a nice beat, but no one on that track says anything work remembering, and the fact Yo Gotti was only on the hook was a waste of a guest appearance. Rick Ross gets a solo song ""50 Plates"" is nothing special either. ""Bigger Than Life"" has a nice hook by Chris Brown. Tyga spits an ok verse, but Birdman's is garbage, and Wayne's kind of good. ""100 Favors"" is the oddest colab with Detail, Birdman, and Kendrick Lamar (Note to K. Dot: If you are going to mention all those rappers name in that wonderful verse, the very least you could have done is colab with someone on a lever WAY lower than them). You can guess how that turns out. ""Everyday"" featuring Birdman, Cory Gunz, Busta Rhymes, and Mystikal is one of the good tracks here. The fact that Busta and Mystikal together on a song gives us a nostalgic feel of their colabs back in the late 90's. ""Burn This House"" featuring Detail singing is garbage. Even worse ""Panties To The Side"" is by far the worst song on here. ""Angel"" is also a bad sex song. ""Sunshine"" is completely awkward, although I do enjoy Caskey's presence on the song (he has a good mixtape that came out this year). T.I. makes a strong appearance on ""Have It Your Way"". ""Paint Tha Town"" featuring Birdman, The Game, and Lil Wayne is pretty solid surprisingly. ""Fly Rich"" ends the album.

Overall, Rich Gang is average. As said before the beats here are great. The hooks too are not bad. If you are the kind of person who listens rather than just hears lyrics in songs, avoid this album. There are some shiny spots here and there, but the album is more suited for the club style atmosphere. Like many summer compilations such as<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ryde-Or-Die-Compilation-1/dp/B00000IFNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ryde Or Die Compilation 1</a>and<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irv-Gotti-Presents-The-Inc/dp/B000068TKH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irv Gotti Presents The Inc.</a>there is room for many hit singles but no substance.

IF I had to choose between singing out loud ""I got the eye of the tiger... cause I am a Champion and you're gonna hear me Roar"" and ""I live for the applause, the way that you scream and cheer for me"" I would choose Roar hands down.  Personally I have realized both of these songs are arrogant, and boastful; it's boosting their egos, etc. However with Katy Perry's song, it is so much easier and more comfortable to sing because you could easily tie into motivating yourself to do better, and to let the world hear you Roar... Lady Gaga's song is all about getting attention, and how she lives for it... I would not feel comfortable singing that song. In fact, when I listen to it I sing ""I've given up on my career"" over the background vocal ""A P P L A U S E"" because that's kind of what I think Lady Gaga has done... BUT at the same time I can see this song being sort of a way poking fun of pop culture, and pop idols, artists, etc; that this is what most artists might as well be singing because a lot of celebrities are probably secretly arrogant. So if that is the case with Applause, then I applaud Lady Gaga for it, if she wrote it about herself to boost her ego... well I'm still not buying her single either way.  I am a huge gaga fan so that speaks on so many levels.

I actually bought Roar, and not Applause, simply because the chorus speaks to me more on a normal social level, and I could sing it more comfortably in a car, or on my bike or in a store.","I think I mostly bought this song because I heard Lady Gaga 's Applause , and it really lowered my expectations for Katy Perry .

A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B00EH49FRE,1,-1,3,"Katy Perry seems to have a knack for hit singles (see ""Hot N Cold"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"" and numerous others).

Honestly, there are some positive attributes, including that more attention seems to be spent on making Perry's voice itself 'roar' more than some of her records.

That said, ""Roar"" suffers more than anything else because it feels like nothing 'new'  in a sense.  There is no collaborator to accentuate Perry or provide more oomph or break from the monotony (Snoop Dogg added some spice to ""California Gurls"" for example).

And what I'm hearing is a lot of Autotunes and ProTools filtering, layering and remixing on every track.  And it doesn't help that nearly every track ends the same way with an extended reverberating echoed tone or note.  I'm not sure if there's even any actual instruments used on this one.

All the tracks are pretty short- only a handful make the four-minute mark- and utterly formulaic.  You can practically tell what's gonna happen when- when the bridge is gonna hit, when the reverb will kick in, etc- which starts to get boring fast.  There's kind of a flow as the later tracks sound more mature and introspective and much less glam and glitz.

Some highlights:
Roar- by now we all know this one.  Catchy, with a good hook yet still like something more along the lines of Selena Gomez' teen queen stuff.

Birthday- definitely an early 80s New Wave/R&B feel to it; more old skool yet still fully computerized.  Good cheesy fun to nod your head to.

Walking On Air- straight EDM/House with an 80s/90s club vibe, this one's like some Taylor Dane or Cece Peniston.  Even Perry's treated voice sounds similar to them on it.

Unconditionally- finally something resembling a song from a grown woman.  Lyrically it reminds me of Alanis Morrisette, and thanks to the engineering some of Perry's high notes sound a lot like her as well, which really ain't bad a thing here.

Dark Horse (feat. Juicy J)- did Kanye West produce this one?  No?  You sure?  Cause thanks to that rap they inserted in it really kinda bites.

This Is How We Do- remember Jamie Foxx's Blame It On The Alcohol?  Take it down a few notches and rework it into a teen friendly anthem of a club vamp.  The beats are alright; it kind of grows on you.

International Smile- some Daft Punk stuff going on here.  Synths and vocorder are really popping on this one and her voice is mixed well with it.  Another one that gets your head nodding.

Double Rainbow- slower, moodier pulses and beats on this one are a nice change of pace.  And I really like the lyrical sentiment of two souls in harmony on this one.

By The Grace Of God- mostly piano based at first, it morphs into another attempt at overproduced maturity, which is what drags it down.

It Takes Two- sharing responsibility when things go wrong is difficult.  But this song makes it a little easier to ask for forgiveness and shoulder your part of the blame.  Not so much techno-filtering and the more emotional lyrics in this one makes for one of the better tracks on the cd.

All in all Prism ain't bad; like Miley Cyrus' Bangerz, it's an absolute reflection of the state of popular music, but infinitely better than that thing.  But it also shows what's wrong with it: too much reliance on tricks, smoke and mirrors instead of vocals, instruments and lyrics, plus still trying to straddle the line between tween girl and club queen like Britney Spears tried to do. Which is a shame because I get the impression Perry really doesn't have to rely on either one of those if she doesn't want to.","This one 's my first Katy Perry cd , so I do n't have anything else to judge it against other than what it sounds like to my uninitiated ears .

A1NS9WO1VACAUN,B00EOKQBHS,1,-1,3,"The new Katy Perry album is another great pop production but the overall mood is significantly different from her last two albums.  Prism also doesn't have too many contenders that look like they will be immediate #1 hit singles on Billboard (like Teenage Dream did).  I would say the best options for chart hits on this album are the initially released promo track ""Dark Horse"",""Birthday"" and ""This is How We Do"" which I actually dislike due to the boring monotonous chorus but would probably be a hit on radio today.  This album has themes of redemption, strength, overcoming, inspiration and there are more than a few religious references.

My favorites tracks which all happen to have an air of feel-good anthems are:

""Double Rainbow""
""It Takes Two""
""Roar""
""By The Grace of God""

The feel-good accessible fun pop tracks are:
""Birthday""
""Walking on Air""
""This Is How We Do""
""International Smile""
""Dark Horse""

I also want to call out ""Spiritual"" - it has elements of 90's Moby, EMF's ""Unbelievable"" and U2's ""Mysterious Ways.""  It's a pretty awesome track with really airy ethereal vocals from Katy.  ""Legendary Lovers"" also has a unique middle eastern pop rock sound so definitely worth checking out.

The remaining tracks are standard pop tracks which don't standout to me and will most likely not stay on my ipod for too long.  Im somewhat confused by how they chose which tracks were going to be on the deluxe version and also confused by why ""Unconditionally"" was chosen as second single.  It's a good song but will be surprised if it even becomes a top 10 hit for Katy much less a number 1.","The new Katy Perry album is another great pop production but the overall mood is significantly different from her last two albums .

A3S9IDI1V2WQQ1,B00EWS5IO4,1,-1,3,"This is a review of ""Miami pop festival"" the Jimi Hendrix experience. I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight, before it's True release. So I have listened to it twice and here is my take: for $9.99, this is a three star purchase. There is some interesting banter and a tuning session by Jimi, which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s. This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang, of pre-Woodstock fame.

The songs on this live disc come mainly from ""Are You Experienced...?"" even though it's mid '68. The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back and forth that descends into the tuning session referenced earlier.  Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of ""hey Joe."" The solo in this song really kicks. The next song, Foxy Lady, blasts off. The intro contains a whole lotta Uni-Vibe and phasing. One nice aspect is that the mixes, which were done originally by Kramer and then later remixed for this project by Eddie Kramer are tight.

 The next song ""Tax-free"" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout. Noel Redding's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place, sonically speaking. Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah-wah guitar. The on and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining, as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early, nascent  stages of festival going.

 I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix and the whole experience Hendrix cash grab machine that so many complain about. What else can be said about this process? There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive. Most of it has already been heard many times over. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel, of course, ending up with products like ""Valleys of Neptune ""which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen. So with all of that said, this is a decent product. In fact it is rather good for a live recording. The only problem is the lack of material. The fact that two songs are repeated is troubling.

The accompanying booklet with photographs that show Jimmy with his Olympic white Fender Strat are very nice and well done. The packaging is actually quite nice as well. So for $10, this is a marginal three-star buy. Put some other records ahead of it in your musical shopping list, like Paul McCartney's new album or even some of those dreaded repackagings of prior releases that I loathe. The only one I would say to avoid at all costs is The Band at the Academy of Arts (aka ""Rock of Aged""). That one is a great example of a lame cash grab. Sad for such an amazing group. Ive heard NOTHING good about it!

PS-I would listen to this a million times before ever suffering through friggin' ARCADE FIRE and their Ambien-rock-electronic crap that Rolling Stone seems to love so much. Get over yourself DAVID FRICKE!","This is a review of "" Miami pop festival "" the Jimi Hendrix experience . I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight , before it 's True release . So I have listened to it twice and here is my take : for $ 9.99 , this is a three star purchase . There is some interesting banter and a tuning session by Jimi , which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s . This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang , of pre - Woodstock fame . The songs on this live disc come mainly from "" Are You Experienced ... ? "" even though it 's mid ' 68 . The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back and forth that descends into the tuning session referenced earlier . Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of "" hey Joe . "" The solo in this song really kicks . The next song , Foxy Lady , blasts off . The intro contains a whole lotta Uni - Vibe and phasing . One nice aspect is that the mixes , which were done originally by Kramer and then later remixed for this project by Eddie Kramer are tight . The next song "" Tax - free "" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout . Noel Redding 's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place , sonically speaking . Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah - wah guitar . The on and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining , as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early , nascent   stages of festival going . I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix and the whole experience Hendrix cash grab machine that so many complain about . What else can be said about this process ? There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive . Most of it has already been heard many times over . We are scraping the bottom of the barrel , of course , ending up with products like "" Valleys of Neptune "" which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen . So with all of that said , this is a decent product . In fact it is rather good for a live recording . The only problem is the lack of material . The fact that two songs are repeated is troubling .

Even the band/comedy group Ylvis, who wrote and performed the dang thing, call the song ""a stupid thing"" and were genuinely surprised that it became as popular as it did.  And as a satire/parody, it does its job well, playing up all the clichs of modern pop and coming up with some of the most inanely bizarre lyrics ever heard outside a ""Weird"" Al song.

Now that the song's popularity has died down somewhat, it will probably fade into relative obscurity like some of the novelty songs of the past (how many people still regularly listen to ""Party Rock Anthem?"").  And people can now appreciate this song for what it is -- an enormously catchy dance number with really stupid lyrics.

I admit, I got hooked on this song when I first heard it, despite being weirded out by the accompanying music video.  It's a lively and upbeat electronic number, full to bursting with the typical tropes of a pop music number, which is kind of the point.  The lyrics are rather silly, as the singer contemplates what sound a fox makes and what it does with its life, but given the inane subject matter of a lot of popular songs, it's not TOO out of place -- is a song about a fox really less stupid than a lot of the subject matter artists pick for their music?

All that said, however... this definitely isn't a song for all tastes.  I love the music but cringe at the lyrics, and given how overplayed this song has been in recent times it gets annoying fast.  Maybe an instrumental version of the song would be better...

Not a masterpiece, but still a catchy number that isn't meant to be taken seriously at all.  I'd wait for the hype to die down a little more before putting it on your music player, though...","I think a lot of the bad reviews of this song are missing the point -- this song was intended as a joke , a satire of pop music 's clichs and the absurdity of many popular songs .

""Diddley Diddley Daddy""(still with the glaring speed fluctuation during the intro), ""Roadrunner"", ""Baby What's Wrong"" & ""I Want to Be Loved"" have been dubbed from one of the ""Swingin' Pig"" label bootleg CD's(either ""Bright Lights, Big City:20th Anniversary Edition"" or the ""I.B.C. Demos"" CD E.P.), but for unknown reasons, ABKCO didn't like the source for ""Bright Lights, Big City"" contained on those two bootleg CD's, so the song has been dubbed from a tinny-sounding vinyl bootleg, and no attempt has been made to de-crackle it. Granted, the source used for all five songs on the original ""Trademark of Quality"" label 1970's ""Bright Lights, Big City"" vinyl bootleg L.P. was itself a tape dub from an acetate, but this was an acetate that was still in pristine condition.

  And I have always questioned whether ""I Want to Be Loved"" was actually from the ""I.B.C. Studios"" demos, or whether ""Trademark of Quality"" simply pretended that the song(which had never been heard by most Americans until the 1990's) was part of the ""I.B.C. Studios"" demos.  ""I Want to Be Loved"" DOES sound audibly identical to the version on the B-side of their first British Decca single ""Come on""

  There are many people (including me) who have wished that The Rolling Stones would finally permit ABKCO to bring us a definitive collection of 1960's Rolling Stones outtakes; to bring us a multi-disc set that would be every thing that ""Metamorphosis"" could have and should have been. But, inevitably ABKCO would find some way to totally or partly screw it up.

  As for the 5-CD ""Grrr"", it's a decent selection of Stones singles and album tracks, but 13 of the songs are edited versions, due to CD capacity limits. Disc 5 has the ""I.B.C. Studios"" demos as a 13 minute disc, but if the 80 hits and album tracks had  been evenly spread across five full length discs, there would have been no need to use edited versions. As for the song line-up, the songs are not quite in chronological order, and there are some baffling inclusions and omissions. ""That's How Strong My Love Is"" & ""Flight 505"" are puzzling inclusions, while ""Tell Me(You're Coming Back)"" and ""Around and Around"" are omitted. Go figure. As for myself, I found an ""alternative source"" for the 5-CD set, and I am left with no doubt that I made the correct decision.","If you opt to buy the 5 - CD "" Super Deluxe Edition "" for the 5 - song "" I.B.C.

A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S,B00FY3JV8A,1,-1,3,"To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, the Rolling Stones are releasing six (count 'em, six!) chronological greatest hits albums: a budget two-CD, a standard three-CD, a deluxe three-CD, a deluxe five-LP, a deluxe Blu-Ray, and a super deluxe five-CD/one-EP collection. The best-of compilations are expertly remastered, albeit selectively edited for length, so while newer listeners probably won't notice anything amiss, nostalgic fans might.

The two-disc bargain-bin set is adequate only for casual fans who just want some of their biggest hits and won't miss classic songs like ""Time Is on My Side."" The first CD takes you from the band's earliest single, a 1963 cover of Chuck Berry's ""Come On,"" to ""Wild Horses"" on the 1971 album ""Sticky Fingers."" The second CD starts with ""Brown Sugar,"" also from ""Sticky Fingers,"" and ends with their final studio album in 2005, ""A Bigger Bang,"" plus two new studio recordings, ""Doom and Gloom"" and ""One More Shot,"" both of which harken back to the rough classic sound of the Stones.

The first two discs of the standard three-CD version of ""GRRR!"" (33 out of 50 tracks) cover the Stones' early career, revisiting most of the required studio LPs and singles from the 60s up to the album ""Black and Blue"" in 1976. The third disc contains 17 recordings from the 1978 album ""Some Girls"" (though not the title track) to ""A Bigger Bang,"" plus the new songs. A 12-page booklet is enclosed. It's a big improvement on ""Forty Licks,"" the two-disc, 40-track, 40th-anniversary collection released in 2002. Of the four new tunes that appeared on that non-chronological album, only ""Don't Stop"" is recycled; 33 of the 36 remaining cuts are included on the three-CD edition (absent are ""Mother's Little Helper,"" ""Shattered,"" and ""You Got Me Rocking""). These 33 are supplemented with a couple of mid-60s covers, Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away"" and Howlin' Wolf's ""Little Red Rooster,"" and enough important songs from the Glimmer Twins to make a more satisfying package: ""Time Is on My Side,"" ""Heart of Stone,"" ""As Tears Go By,"" ""Rocks Off,"" ""Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),"" ""Respectable,"" ""Waiting on a Friend,"" ""Harlem Shuffle,"" ""Streets of Love,"" and more.

Compilations will never take the place of individual albums from the Rolling Stones' peak years, and they'll never please longtime fans like me who have no need for obvious radio fodder and want the rare stuff and the live stuff instead. There aren't a lot of surprises in the standard box, and the editing and inevitable omissions also reduce its value. Where are ""Live with Me"" and ""Let It Bleed"" and ""Dead Flowers"" and ""Hang Fire"" and a dozen more? The skimpy two-CD set earns just three stars as it drops 10 songs from the three-CD set: ""Time Is on My Side,"" ""Heart of Stone,"" ""Under My Thumb,"" ""We Love You,"" ""She's a Rainbow,"" ""Highwire,"" ""Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),"" ""She Was Hot,"" ""Streets of Love,"" and ""Rocks Off."" If you're in the market for greatest hits, something to remind you of the Stones' awesome talent and staying power over the years, I'd spend a few extra bucks for the standard edition.","To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the World 's Greatest Rock and Roll Band , the Rolling Stones are releasing six ( count 'em , six ! ) chronological greatest hits albums : a budget two - CD , a standard three - CD , a deluxe three - CD , a deluxe five - LP , a deluxe Blu - Ray , and a super deluxe five - CD / one - EP collection .

I have listened to about 25% of the tracks - there's the usual problems with Vanguard with some of the tracks distorting a bit, and with tracks that segue into other tracks being interrupted by the MP3 ""track is starting"" silence that interrupts the musical flow. Fortunately, those places are few and far between on this particular set. I wish Vanguard could do something about this, though.

The Brandenburg Concerti with Josef Suk and his chamber orchestra are very enjoyable. However, the recording of the First Concerto begins here with the first movement of the 5th Concerto. The actual first movement of the first Concerto is missing. Another glaring mistake by our friends at Vanguard.

But she has tried that well with her latest single, Human from her upcoming album. The song is absolutely a hit in the right direction in regards to her voice and spirit. It is definitely a good song, but not great in regards to her style of music, a step ahead of the cheapness of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna who've made themselves idiots in voice and song. I found the song to have a really somber and intimate mood from Christina, but more could've been added to match into the song. Still, it is a good download for your music library. But I do wish that when Christina's next record comes out, there will be just as strong music than Human.

The Canadian chaunteuse who warbled like mad honoring her french roots (Celine Dion-""Sans attendre"").

To complete the year's list of female releases, party-bimbo Ke$ha delivered her sophomore proper album. Predecessors ""Animal"" and ""Cannibal"" EP were a hybrid of party anthems, dancey riffs, cheeky lyrics and trashy attitude. Accompanied by clever videos, they produced massive hits, making Ke$ha a True sensation, an almost iconic figure among teenagers. It was only inevitable that every successful ingredient employed the first time, would be put to greater effect this third time around, too. 12 songs (16 on the deluxe edition) varying from dance electro-pop to indie hippy-chic, setting the mood even by the title, and leaving a euphoric feeling by the end of listening. Even the use of Ke$ha's trademark, the auto-tuned vocals, works in her favour on this, because it is used more discreetly. Also, on quite a few of the songs the sound is more stripped down, allowing Ke$ha's voice to come through, and she sounds rather sweet. To her credit, she co-writes the majority of the material; evidently she has got the skills, she is much more than just  the obvious glitter freak. Tracks like ""Supernatural"" and ""All that matters (The beautiful life)"" are top notch pop numbers. Fun should be mandatory, so, release your inhabitions, let the Warrior Princess lead the way, and start the party-fight!","2012 proved to be for pop music a ladies ' affair : There was the re - vamped femme fatale who seduced every haunted human soul ( Lana Del Rey-""Born to die "" ) .

A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B00I4D27JM,1,-1,3,"Oh, man, I am going to ruffle SO many feathers with this review! See, unlike pretty much everyone else who's reviewed it so far, I DON'T love Dale Watson's latest, CARYIN' ON. At times I find it repeatative, other times unoriginal and dull. There are even moments where Watson seems to have become what he's always hated most...formulistic and calculated, just cranking out the music because it's time to crank out more music.
 This doesn't mean I hate the album, though. In fact, there are a number of very nice moments, and I'm liking the disc a little more now than I did, say, after the first two or three listens, so all you die-hard D.W. fans can sheath your claws! :>) (In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this is a 3.5 star disc, but it just doesn't warrent rounding up). The fact of the matter is, Watson is in a rut, releaseing the same album year after year. Thing is, they're getting weaker with each release.
 The album's opening cut, ""Carryin' On This Way"", is a prime example...this song is more Glen Campbell than Merle Haggard or George Jones. With it's lilting gait, this is nothing more than easy-listening country, something I would never have expected from Watson six or seven years ago. Sadly, the strong lyrics about growing up are completely underminded by the weak arrangement.
 Far better is the swingin' ""Hey Brown Bottle."" Watson's lead vocal is strong and assured, with a hint of sex and sass to it, while the arrangement is clever, allowing the instrumentation to shine thru, both individually and collectively ((Yes, the backing vocals border on cheesy, but they're still kind of fun!).
 Things take another step back with ""Flower In Your Hair"", a peppy little number that's just this side of pop. However, the track is saved by it's overall romanticism and Watson's smooth vocal. Make no mistake about it....he has one of the best voices in pop music today, regardless of the genre.
 ""You're Always On My Mind"" is classic Country. In fact, if I didn't know better, I would swear this was a cover from the 60's! Relaxed and romantic, it's full of fiddle and steel guitar in just the right spots. Toss in a perfectly understated lead vocal, and...WOW!
 ""Ain't That Livin'"" is sort of like musical cotton candy...light and fluffy, with nothing to it really, but, oh, so sweet and good! Watson's lead vocal has a sort of twinkle to it that's both captivating and intriguing, resulting in a throwaway track that turns into so very much more.
 ""Heart Of Stone"" is probably the disc's best track. Not only is there a real depth to the cut, there's also a sense of growth and honesty. This is the Dale Watson I fell in love with after discovering 2001's EVERY SONG I WRITE IS FOR YOU. He's stretching again here, and that's something I want to see more of on future releases!
 I have no idea what's being said on most of ""I'll Show Ya"", but I really don't care...the song is so infectious and fun, well, you can't help but love it! Bounding along at a break-neak pace, Watson's vocal swoops and soars, anchored by a lively arrangement. Love it!
 ""How To Break Your Own Heart"" veers VERY close to retro camp, but another nice lead vocal and subdued instrumentation pull the song back from the brink. (Retro walks a very fine line between camp and flavoring your own style...Watson's always been on the right side of the fence, but he's starting to teeter more and more).
 Far stronger is ""For A Little While."" Some might think of this as nothing more than an Elvis-soundalike outtake, but I love the flamenco feel to it. Graced with gorgeous pedal steel and acoustic guitar, the song just kind of flows out of the speakers. Once again, this is a nice, new mood, and one Watson should persue again in the future.
 I'm on the fence over ""Whatever""...there's certainly nothing new or fresh to the cut ~ Watson has mined this territory before ~ but the song is still enjoyable. An upbeat arrangement (highlighted by Pig Robbins' wonderful piano runs!) just bounds along, while Watson's lead vocal is supple and spirited. Let's call this one a draw.
 ""Your Love I'm Gonna Miss?"" Not so much. Watson has developed a (bad) habit of putting older material on each of his recent new releases, but unlike, say, Joan Jett, who frequently rerecorded old Runaways songs on some of her newer solo albums, there's nothing new here....these are note-for-note the same cuts. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this was actually taken from the EVERY SONG I WRITE....masters! That's just kind of lazy and....chintzy!
 ""Don't Want To Go Home Song"" has a nice groove to it. Watson's silky lead vocals just roll over the spirited Western swing arrangement, with fiddle, piano and pedal steel all in the forefront. This, too, is nothing new for Watson, but at least it comes across as fresh and alive, vs. just...routine. Another winner!
 The disc closes with the campy ""Hello, I'm An Old Country Song."" I know Watson's heart is in the right place, but this is just trying WAY too hard! Instead of honest and heart-felt, it comes across as cliched and over-the-top, with a dash of bitteress and a dose of sour grapes tossed in for good measure. Are Emmylou Harris, Marty Stuart, George Jones and Rodney Crowell, to name just a few, being treated properly by Country radio? Heck, no. But that doesn't mean new artists like Miranda Lambert and Chris Young aren't honoring those who've come before them! Commendable concept....failed execution.
 So, what is it that I want from Dale Watson? What is it that his last few releases, but particularly CARRYIN' ON, aren't giving me? First, I'd have to say it's the ""WOW!"" factor....when I first heard EVERY SONG I WRITE IS FOR YOU and WONDERLAND, I was just blown away by the voice, the energy, the VIBE....it was new and exciting and unlike anything else out there! Now, it's like it's just time to put another album out.
 Second, I want less formula and more spontinaity....back in the day when Watson was all about jeans and tee-shirts and dirty black engineer boots, there was an edge and an unpredictability to him. Now that he's transitioned into suits and polished snakeskin boots, well, all the life and wonder has been sucked out of him. Sadly, he's become pretty much what he's fought against all these years...predictable.
 Obviously, most fans don't feel this way, as per the other reviews, but I can honestly say this may be my last Dale Watson record for a while. And that's too bad. (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).","Oh , man , I am going to ruffle SO many feathers with this review !

Fortunately, there are some good pieces, and when I deleted the ones that were the worst (in my opinion), I still had 68 tracks, which is excellent for 99 cents. I might delete more of them, and perhaps add some of my own, but as another reviewer said, this can serve as the basis for a good classical workout mix. I think more dance music and marches, and fewer opera arias and piano concerto movements would have been better.

A3H7HYC9HIQAAQ,B00IAR2DNM,1,-1,1,"Once upon a time there was a director who, along with some friends - a writer, a cameraman, some actors - made a movie. It doesn't matter what the movie was about. It could have been about aliens, or cowboys and indians, or a young couple suffering through a rocky relationship, or a bank robbery gone wrong. Whatever it was about, the director wanted to make the best movie he could make, and for the audience who saw that movie to care about the characters, and to empathize with the emotions they felt. At some point, he approached a composer, in order to give that film a musical voice. The composer - who was well-versed in musical theory and composition - was as much of a storyteller as the director was, and wanted to enhance the film with his music; to bring out subtle emotions so the audience could feel them, to highlight subtexts that acting alone could not convey, to make it a better film than it would be without the music being there.

The director and composer decided what sort of music was needed, and how much, and then the composer went away and wrote: he wrote music which was specific to that film, tailored to those scenes, and those characters. His score gave the film an identity, with an overarching structure, recurring thematic ideas and musical reference points that drew characters, concepts and locations together, so that they felt like a part of the fully realized world the movie inhabited. He poured all his knowledge and craft into the score, making it interesting and compelling from a musical point of view, while simultaneously serving the drama on-screen. He made the action more exciting. The made the horror scarier. He made the relationships more romantic. He made the tension so tense you would bite your fingernails to the quick. Of course, the composer would have a musical style of his own, and once in a while a certain way of phrasing an instrument, or the way a chord progressed, would relate back to something else that same composer wrote before, but that's inevitable when a composer writes as much personal music as a film composer does, and would not detract much from the new work. The composer then recorded that score, using the finest musicians he could find, bringing all that talent and experience to bear on the music. The resulting work was a perfect marriage of pictures and sound, with music that was memorable, musically compelling, interesting and complex, dramatically appropriate, emotionally powerful, and crafted solely to serve that film and no other. This approach was so successful that everyone decided that this should henceforth be the way films should be scored, and everyone lived happily ever after. The end.

Except that it's not the end, because brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo decided that, when it came to their film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, they would ignore all of that and ask composer Henry Jackman to write one of the most grating, themeless, emotionally barren scores I have had the misfortune of hearing in several years. The words ""clichd"" and ""generic"" could have been invented specifically for this score, which takes all the worst aspects of modern film scoring and amplifies them a hundred fold, reveling in their lack of coherent musical ideas, individual identities, and musical inventiveness. In these circumstances I would usually break out my `polar bear with a migraine' photo and leave it to speak for itself, but my friend and colleague James Southall's excellent review of this score made me want to make some points of my own.

The film itself is apparently very good; more of a political thriller than a super-hero movie, it picks up Captain America's story two years after the events of The Avengers. Now living in Washington DC and struggling to adjust to life in the 21st century, the Captain himself Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself thrust back into action when a SHIELD operative is attacked by a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier, whose exploits date back to the cold war. Teaming up with fellow super-heroes Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Captain America must uncover the mystery surrounding the Winter Soldier's identity, and stop the threat he poses to the world. The film has a fantastic supporting cast, including Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, Frank Grillo, Emily Van Camp, and Marvel Universe regulars Samuel L. Jackson, Colbie Smulders and Dominic Cooper, and looks set to be one of 2014's most successful films.

In musical terms, however, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an absolute disaster. The Marvel Universe films have always been a bit hit or miss when it comes to their scores, with little to no musical continuity between them, and a revolving roster of composers ranging from Ramin Djawadi to Patrick Doyle to Brian Tyler. Alan Silvestri's score for the first Captain America film was excellent, filled with all the things I talk about in my opening paragraphs, and - best of all - containing a rousing, memorable theme for Captain America himself. Sadly, Winter Soldier's composer Henry Jackman ignores everything Silvestri did, instead composing a more `modern' score which emphasizes sound design and electronic textures over anything resembling actual music. I hate writing paragraphs like this, because historically I have liked Henry Jackman's work a great deal. It's astonishing to me that a composer who can craft such wonderful scores as Gulliver's Travels, Puss in Boots or Wreck-It Ralph could turn around and write something as obnoxious as this.

There is a new theme for Captain America - a bit of martial heroism for brass and snare drums introduced in ""Project Insight"" - although why Jackman decided not to use Silvestri's established theme for the character is beyond me, especially when Brian Tyler even quoted it in Thor 2. There's a bit of warm Americana which appears in the brief ""The Smithsonian"". And that's about it, in terms of positive things I can say about this score. Probably the worst aspect of Jackman's score is that, for the most part, it's not even made up of his own ideas. For example the opening track, ""Lemurian Star"", is little more than a combination of Hans Zimmer's now-ubiquitous extended brass note from Inception, John Powell's synthy action rhythms from the Bourne series. Similarly, the big action set pieces which come later - ""Taking a Stand"", ""Into the Fray"" and ""Countdown: for example - have moments of power and grandeur, but have no real individual identity. Despite a couple of them containing repeat performances of the new Captain America theme from ""Project Insight"", nothing about them ever really says `this is music for Captain America'. Jackman's theme is so nondescript, it could be from any superhero or action movie from the past 20 years, and the action rhythms and percussive patterns Jackman employs sound like all the other action rhythms and percussive patterns everyone from Hans Zimmer down has used for the past decade.

At the other end of the scale cues like ""An Old Friend"", ""Alexander Pierce"", ""Frozen in Time"" and ""Natasha"" are quieter but say nothing; they just meander along for a couple of minutes, presenting muted orchestral textures, string sustains, serious timpani rumbles. Unobtrusive, understated, but completely inert in terms of anything resembling musical development.

Worst of all are cues like ""Fury"", the truly awful ""The Winter Soldier"", ""Fallen"", ""Hydra"" and ""The Causeway"", which are simply appalling: little more than exercises in repeated string rhythms and loops overlaid by various banging and clanging industrial sound effects, and groaning electronic textures. Both ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""The Causeway"" contain what sounds like a processed scream as part of the electronic sound mix, and which appears to be an attempt at a leitmotif for the Winter Soldier character himself; when I first heard it I had to stop and check that it wasn't my own screams I could hear over my headphones.

I have been around the film music industry for a long time now - almost 20 years. I have attended scoring sessions, and attended lectures and seminars on the art. I have met pretty much every major composer working in Hollywood today, and I consider many of them friends. I understand fully that the demands put upon a film composer's shoulders are enormous, ranging from ever-decreasing budgets and ever-decreasing timescales to having to deal with temp tracks, focus groups, musically illiterate directors, and boardrooms full of producers who all want to have their say about how the music should sound. Long gone are the days where one director and one composer would work together to craft their musical vision of a film, as in my rose-tinted once-upon-a-time story that opened this review. Truthfully, I'm not sure my idyllic fairytale of the film score world was ever what it was truly like. In many ways, you can't blame Henry Jackman for giving his employers exactly what they wanted: that's his job, after all. But, still, there has to be a way to write a score which fulfills all the demands set by the no-nothing money men, but doesn't strip away all the emotion, doesn't pander to the common denominator, and still manages to contain some semblance of identity, uniqueness, and inventiveness for both the composer and the film. There has to be a way.","Once upon a time there was a director who , along with some friends - a writer , a cameraman , some actors - made a movie . It does n't matter what the movie was about . It could have been about aliens , or cowboys and indians , or a young couple suffering through a rocky relationship , or a bank robbery gone wrong . Whatever it was about , the director wanted to make the best movie he could make , and for the audience who saw that movie to care about the characters , and to empathize with the emotions they felt . At some point , he approached a composer , in order to give that film a musical voice . The composer - who was well - versed in musical theory and composition - was as much of a storyteller as the director was , and wanted to enhance the film with his music ; to bring out subtle emotions so the audience could feel them , to highlight subtexts that acting alone could not convey , to make it a better film than it would be without the music being there . The director and composer decided what sort of music was needed , and how much , and then the composer went away and wrote : he wrote music which was specific to that film , tailored to those scenes , and those characters . His score gave the film an identity , with an overarching structure , recurring thematic ideas and musical reference points that drew characters , concepts and locations together , so that they felt like a part of the fully realized world the movie inhabited . He poured all his knowledge and craft into the score , making it interesting and compelling from a musical point of view , while simultaneously serving the drama on - screen . He made the action more exciting . The made the horror scarier . He made the relationships more romantic . He made the tension so tense you would bite your fingernails to the quick . Of course , the composer would have a musical style of his own , and once in a while a certain way of phrasing an instrument , or the way a chord progressed , would relate back to something else that same composer wrote before , but that 's inevitable when a composer writes as much personal music as a film composer does , and would not detract much from the new work . The composer then recorded that score , using the finest musicians he could find , bringing all that talent and experience to bear on the music . The resulting work was a perfect marriage of pictures and sound , with music that was memorable , musically compelling , interesting and complex , dramatically appropriate , emotionally powerful , and crafted solely to serve that film and no other . This approach was so successful that everyone decided that this should henceforth be the way films should be scored , and everyone lived happily ever after . Except that it 's not the end , because brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo decided that , when it came to their film Captain America : The Winter Soldier , they would ignore all of that and ask composer Henry Jackman to write one of the most grating , themeless , emotionally barren scores I have had the misfortune of hearing in several years . The words "" clichd "" and "" generic "" could have been invented specifically for this score , which takes all the worst aspects of modern film scoring and amplifies them a hundred fold , reveling in their lack of coherent musical ideas , individual identities , and musical inventiveness . In these circumstances I would usually break out my ` polar bear with a migraine ' photo and leave it to speak for itself , but my friend and colleague James Southall 's excellent review of this score made me want to make some points of my own . The film itself is apparently very good ; more of a political thriller than a super - hero movie , it picks up Captain America 's story two years after the events of The Avengers . Now living in Washington DC and struggling to adjust to life in the 21st century , the Captain himself Steve Rogers ( Chris Evans ) finds himself thrust back into action when a SHIELD operative is attacked by a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier , whose exploits date back to the cold war . Teaming up with fellow super - heroes Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson ) and Falcon ( Anthony Mackie ) , Captain America must uncover the mystery surrounding the Winter Soldier 's identity , and stop the threat he poses to the world . The film has a fantastic supporting cast , including Robert Redford , Sebastian Stan , Frank Grillo , Emily Van Camp , and Marvel Universe regulars Samuel L. Jackson , Colbie Smulders and Dominic Cooper , and looks set to be one of 2014 's most successful films . In musical terms , however , Captain America : The Winter Soldier is an absolute disaster . The Marvel Universe films have always been a bit hit or miss when it comes to their scores , with little to no musical continuity between them , and a revolving roster of composers ranging from Ramin Djawadi to Patrick Doyle to Brian Tyler . Alan Silvestri 's score for the first Captain America film was excellent , filled with all the things I talk about in my opening paragraphs , and - best of all - containing a rousing , memorable theme for Captain America himself . Sadly , Winter Soldier 's composer Henry Jackman ignores everything Silvestri did , instead composing a more ` modern ' score which emphasizes sound design and electronic textures over anything resembling actual music . I hate writing paragraphs like this , because historically I have liked Henry Jackman 's work a great deal . It 's astonishing to me that a composer who can craft such wonderful scores as Gulliver 's Travels , Puss in Boots or Wreck - It Ralph could turn around and write something as obnoxious as this . There is a new theme for Captain America - a bit of martial heroism for brass and snare drums introduced in "" Project Insight "" - although why Jackman decided not to use Silvestri 's established theme for the character is beyond me , especially when Brian Tyler even quoted it in Thor 2 . There 's a bit of warm Americana which appears in the brief "" The Smithsonian "" . And that 's about it , in terms of positive things I can say about this score . Probably the worst aspect of Jackman 's score is that , for the most part , it 's not even made up of his own ideas . For example the opening track , "" Lemurian Star "" , is little more than a combination of Hans Zimmer 's now - ubiquitous extended brass note from Inception , John Powell 's synthy action rhythms from the Bourne series . Similarly , the big action set pieces which come later - "" Taking a Stand "" , "" Into the Fray "" and "" Countdown : for example - have moments of power and grandeur , but have no real individual identity . Despite a couple of them containing repeat performances of the new Captain America theme from "" Project Insight "" , nothing about them ever really says ` this is music for Captain America ' . Jackman 's theme is so nondescript , it could be from any superhero or action movie from the past 20 years , and the action rhythms and percussive patterns Jackman employs sound like all the other action rhythms and percussive patterns everyone from Hans Zimmer down has used for the past decade . At the other end of the scale cues like "" An Old Friend "" , "" Alexander Pierce "" , "" Frozen in Time "" and "" Natasha "" are quieter but say nothing ; they just meander along for a couple of minutes , presenting muted orchestral textures , string sustains , serious timpani rumbles . Unobtrusive , understated , but completely inert in terms of anything resembling musical development . Worst of all are cues like "" Fury "" , the truly awful "" The Winter Soldier "" , "" Fallen "" , "" Hydra "" and "" The Causeway "" , which are simply appalling : little more than exercises in repeated string rhythms and loops overlaid by various banging and clanging industrial sound effects , and groaning electronic textures . Both "" The Winter Soldier "" and "" The Causeway "" contain what sounds like a processed scream as part of the electronic sound mix , and which appears to be an attempt at a leitmotif for the Winter Soldier character himself ; when I first heard it I had to stop and check that it was n't my own screams I could hear over my headphones . I have been around the film music industry for a long time now - almost 20 years . I have met pretty much every major composer working in Hollywood today , and I consider many of them friends . I understand fully that the demands put upon a film composer 's shoulders are enormous , ranging from ever - decreasing budgets and ever - decreasing timescales to having to deal with temp tracks , focus groups , musically illiterate directors , and boardrooms full of producers who all want to have their say about how the music should sound .

What these impatient types don't realize is that they'd be the first ones to bitch because the eighth, ninth and tenth albums all sounded alike while refusing to accept stylistic growth.
  The rest of us relish seeing the greatest American metal band if not the greatest band in the world grow and explore.  I was absolutely obsessed with ""The Hunter"", one of the greatest albums of this century, and damn near as good as anything Zeppelin or other giants of yesteryear put out, if not better.  Typically some people disliked the experimentation and relative accessibility but that was their problem.  Not me.  I was very interested to see what they'd do for a follow up and I was and am very pleased to report that ""Once More 'Round The Sun"" is a triumph, full of the class and musicianship we expect, and rocks mightily without a hint of compromise.
  If anything, the new album deftly mixes the more melodic vocals and guitar lines with a straight out rock and roll approach, meaning while there is not a song like ""The Creature Lives"" or one as wistful as ""The Sparrow"", we get a supercharged set that manages to move the band forward without being the weak followup to a classic, like Machine Head's failure to top the glory that was ""The Blackening"" with a decidedly weak ""Unto The Locust"".  Mastodon are simply too smart for that.
  It's still very early, having had this CD for only a couple of listens to break it down track by track, but overall it's brilliant, and will take repeated listens to really get into, a sign of a great album that has new surprises every time you listen.  Scott Kelly makes his usual appearance, although personally I don't like his voice.  That's minor though because the music rises to the occasion, even the cheering section on ""Aunt Lisa"".  If comparisons must be made, ""Once More 'Round The Sun"" reminds me a bit of ""Bloodwork"" mixed with the hooks of ""The Hunter"", if that helps.

A1QR9CS347XKFC,B00JYKU6BK,-1,1,4,"I was a slow comer to Linkin Park. When they emerged with the other nu-metal bands I didn't find them particularly distinguishable from the others. I figured they were another flash in the pan, one hit wonder. I was wrong. One thing they've proven throughout the course of their career is reliability in good song writing, and impressive chemistry as bandmates. The Hunting Party lacks gimmickry, and is probably the first album they've done that feels like it's just a band playing together. No loops, no electronica, no excessive polish.

The Hunting Party has the best of Linkin Park - Big, hooky singalong choruses, rap/singing structures, and a new innovation for them...raw, unvarnished grit. This here is straight forward, blast the stereo speakers RAWK. Perhaps the biggest letdown is the instrumental track with Tom Morello, which showcases absolutely nothing of Morello's skills. You'd never know that was Tom Morello playing if it weren't for the liner notes.

Small gripe. Everything on here is quality otherwise. Linkin Park has served up a refreshing nugget of pure rock, filling a void in a genre gasping for relevance. Hats off to them for the risky move with a big payoff.","I was a slow comer to Linkin Park .

A4Z9NHOW5LT0M,B00JYKU6BK,-1,1,5,"So people bash this album, same way they've done with the last 3 albums. Minutes to Midnight saw a band taking a turn for experimental music. A Thousand Suns saw the band mix in Electronica and other genres into one. Living Things saw once again the experiments indulge our ears.

I personally did not like Living Things, it was completely short and aside from a pair of songs, the rest of the album was unlistenable. They promised a ""Rock record"" and they released it. So why the hate? Do people prefer the electronica based albums of the last two albums or do they prefer an album that sounds like when they began? I don't get fans!

This is the album I believe I hear more of their guitarist for the first time since Minutes to Midnight. He was almost non-existent in the last two albums. From top to bottom, I believe it is a great record. By any stretch is it better than their debut or their follow up but this album shows that Linkin Park has not forgotten their rock roots. It may not be Metal but tracks like: Wastelands, War, Guilty All The Same & Mark The Graves have that feel like before.

I think fans will be divided on this again since people think LP will go back to making records like Hybrid Theory, bury that thought cause it ain't happening. The Hunting Party is an excellent turn for the better for LP and I think people should be reminded that they are almost in their 40's, they can't keep on screaming and jumping like if it was 2001.","So people bash this album , same way they 've done with the last 3 albums .

AXOO7BPM22BDO,B00JYKU6BK,-1,1,4,"I'll admit to being a very casual Linkin Park listener; not that I didn't dig their stuff, but I was never into them so much that I'd become a fan.  Back in my retail days working at Virgin Megastore, we'd get (over) exposed to tons of s*** on a daily basis; so much that you'd literally start turning it into background noise.  But some things stood out and the band was one of them.  So it'll be obvious I don't know enough to go into a complete breakdown of what's happening on their new release, The Hunting Party, but I do know that it's different than what I've previously heard from them... and I like it.

Guitarist Brad Delson joked the album was an ""alternative Hybrid Theory"" and ""maybe its prequel"", in that it was inspired by artists they all had listened to growing up.  Maybe so, but this is almost all straight up hard stuff- no chaser.  Almost every track is fueled by power riffs and distortion solos from Delson, Chester's trademark vocal range and Shinoda's breakdown raps and electronic touches with a little help from System of A Down's Daron Malakian (you'll know that one when you hear it!), as well as rap icon Rakim to keep with the traditional rap-metal vibe.  Tom Morello and Page Hamilton also make appearances, but even so, very little remains linking back to the halcyon days of Hybrid Theory and Meteora.  And that's the point; they're acknowledging their roots while moving beyond them.  Mike Shinoda stated in interviews that when working on the followup to Living Things he realized he was doing the exact same stuff all over again, and he needed to stop.  No more emo crap... well, not so much; they're all grown men now and what ticks off adults is different from what does kids.  Adding to this was most of the songs were written on the fly while in studio.  The new dynamic was so grueling that drummer Rob Bourdon physically wore himself down trying to keep pace and ended up seeing a chiropractor from throwing his back out during the long recording sessions.  Plus you get some seemingly random lo-fi recordings tacked on to the beginning and end of the first few cuts- I've no idea why.

So was it worth it all?  Yep!

Not quite a headbanger's ball, but pretty damn close!  First track is kinda disjointed and scattered, but sets the tone for what's to come.  The standouts are All for Nothing, War, Wastelands, Until It's Gone, and Rebellion- power guitars, speed drumming, heavy metal screaming and shouting... this one has it all!  The extended version comes with some live versions of some the songs, and the bonus disc is a treat with some excellent live performances of classics like Bleed it Out and In The End.  This is some good stuff and definitely not your twenty-something Linkin Park anymore.","I 'll admit to being a very casual Linkin Park listener ; not that I did n't dig their stuff , but I was never into them so much that I 'd become a fan .

Really they are ."

A1HWMU2XORHEI4,B00KB56QCA,1,-1,3,"""What would you think, if I sang out of tune, Would you stand up and walk out on me?""

Famous words sang in a famous song, sung by a famous drummer. No Ringo, wed never walk out on you. Never. Not even if theres a fire. But the same can no longer be said of the Flaming Lips and their extremely old and stale shenanigans. I think Im honestly one of the remaining few that have held on up to this point. I championed The Terror, that Peace Sword S/T, and that 7 Skies H3 album they released last RSD(I honestly thing 7 Skies H3 is some of the best stuff theyve done since Embryonic.) Man, Ive taken every bitter pill theyve sent my way and Ive loved every weird trip theyve taken me on. But this cover album of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band? Nah, I just cant do it anymore. Im through. There needs to be some sort of intervention for Mr. Coyne. Shut down his Instagram. Take away his gummy molding machine, and all of his plastic doo dads he covers himself in on stage. He needs to seriously get his head out of whatever fumes hes been inhaling and breathe in some untainted oxygen. The jig is up, you fearless freak.

Let me first say that Im not some Beatles extremist. When I first heard the Lips were covering Sgt Pepper I was thrilled. I was and still am a huge fan of their take on The Dark Side of the Moon. I felt that in their own way The Flaming Lips stayed True to that album without compromising any of their weirdness. If they were to do that with Sgt Pepper, then we were going to be in for a real treat. I mean, Sgt Pepper was a massive statement. A milestone, and an album that in many eyes can never be replicated or matched. The Lips created that for me in 1999 when they put out The Soft Bulletin. That album was pure, child-like honesty put to otherworldly and ethereal music. It encapsulated the wonder and fear of life and death, all brought together by Wayne Coynes wavering and breaking voice. I was 24 years old when that album came out and it affected me much like Sgt Pepper affected so many folks 32 years before. How could Wayne Coyne and company screw this up? I don't know, but they did.

This album really comes off as a big, noisy mess. Its as if Coyne and company weren't even there. They let special guests(and there were quite a few) in the studio, locked them in, and proceeded to pump in nitrous oxide through the vents to see what would happen. Its a real shame, too, as underneath it all theres some great performances by The Autumn Defense, Dr. Dog, Phantogram, and My Morning Jacket. Those performances are covered in clumps of audio fuzz, grime, and over blown excess. Yes, Im aware Im talking about the Flaming Lips when Im complaining about excess. Heres the thing: the Lips have always excelled at excess. They do excess beautifully. But here the excess is excessive. A beautiful vocal performance by the Autumn Defense in With A Little Help From My Friends is completely stunted by pairing them with Black Pus. Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is shat upon by a overzealous guitar solo by the wonderful J Mascis at the end. Getting Better, featuring Dr. Dog, seems like a completely incredible combination until you throw Chuck Inglish in there as well and it just kinda falls flat on its face. I wouldve loved to have heard Dr. Dogs full access on this track, with the Lips noodling on the knobs and faders a bit. Instead we get this detached Chuck Inglish vocal over top Dr. Dog with some pretty great stereo drums. Its so close to perfection. A Day In The Life, while not bad, seems to just fall a little flat. This shouldve been monstrous, explosive, and beautiful. Instead, we get the most restraint weve seen on this covers album where it shouldve been the biggest statement possible.

A lot of people have bitched and moaned about Miley Cyrus connection to the Lips and Coyne, and especially her inclusion on this album. Well Im here to say she is not to blame for the issues here. She does fine, really. She is featured on A Day In The Life, as well as one of the album highlights, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. They go big for Lucy and it works beautifully. Electric Wurms cover of Fixing A Hole is also a nice surprise. They pretty much stick to script here, with some nice, dreamy effects. Sorta like Yes covering the Beatles and it works. Shes Leaving Home is quite melancholy with Phantogram, Julianna Barwick, and Spaceface. It has an 80s electro vibe with all of the original tracks mournful feel. Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite! with Maynard James Keenan is a perfect fit, actually. It has a carnival of souls aura and Keenan makes the track his own. Within You Without You with Birdflower and Morgan Delt keeps the mystical vibe of Harrisons original, with some modern touches that aren't too overbearing. Most of the rest? Kinda just there, really.

The strangest thing is that you wouldnt even know this was a project curated by The Flaming Lips if it weren't for the production. You hear them in like two tracks. Other than that, who knows? Even with something like Heady Fwends you got the feeling Wayne, Steve, and Michael were in the room with their fwends. Not so much here.

I look at classic albums like Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Pet Sounds, and Odyssey and Oracle and I compare them to classical pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Debussy. They fall under the canon of timeless pieces of music and should be interpreted and endeared by future musicians and artists. Weve done this for hundreds of years and it is a practice that should continue for hundreds of years to come. The Flaming Lips, I felt, were a band to do such a thing with The Beatles. They did right by Pink Floyd. Theyll do right by The Beatles, right? Even for Coyne, Drozd, and Ivins this is pretty far out there. Theyve taken themselves and a bunch of great artists and covered their covers of Lennon/McCartney compositions in so much noise its hard to discern anyones original intent.

This certainly isn't a phoned-in tribute. Its ambitious, ballsy, and grand for sure. But even Pollack knew when enough was enough. Wayne, sometimes less is more. I still love you, but Im gonna have to walk away on this one.",""" What would you think , if I sang out of tune , Would you stand up and walk out on me ? ""

A3HQ4QMJ8JUDUW,B00KFC85NC,-1,1,5,"Recovered from the research notes of Doctor Nathan Farber following his suicide on June 1, 1943.

March 6, 1943
The first market tests of Bamtantrax are beginning today. As head researcher, I'm to oversee all the tests of the United States division and ensure the product is working successfully and causes no ill effects. In reality, however, I'm just sitting in my office waiting for respondents to the advertisement we put out. I hope we get some suitable subjects to test this on. We really need a success, and not just for financial reasons.

March 7, 1943
I'm impressed. We've already had about 300 applicants in New York alone, and the number is increasing every day. Anyway, we gave them some tubs of Bamtantrax, and asked them to apply the cream daily and report in weekly so we could see the results. They performed their initial application under our supervision. It absorbed into their skin just like tests indicated. Hopefully, full absorption will occur, fixing skin flaws and disfigurements. If that can happen, I have no doubt this'll be the smash hit we're looking for.

March 14, 1943
The first check-in was today, and it would appear we've got a winner on our hands this time. Everyone who tried the product out loved it. They claim it increased both their attractiveness and their love life, and one woman even claimed it healed a cut she got slicing onions. I don't know about that, but our check-up showed integration with tissue as planned. I think we just need to do this for a few more weeks, then release it to our markets. I'm relaying that opinion to the main branch immediately.

March 21, 1943
Well, it's set. The release date is ready, we're just waiting for the shipments to arrive from the main branch. Everyone in the trial swears by this stuff, and most have referred it to their friends. We're almost out of our test samples, though, and the war has tied up our shipment. We won't get it for a few more weeks. Once they run out, they'll have to do without for a few weeks. The main office still wants us to check up on them weekly, though I have no idea why. The cream works!

March 29, 1943
Another check-up day. The last subject ran out of Bamtantrax a few days ago, so we'll get to see any negative reactions. Shipment still hasn't arrived yet; my last check-up indicated it was still stuck in a British port. The subjects without the cream for the longest are reporting minor irritation and skin flaking, probably just a side effect from having used the cream so long. Other than that, they report feeling fine, so it's probably nothing.

April 5, 1943
I'm beginning to get worried. The rashes are increasing in size and severity, and are turning an ugly purple color. I'd call it a coincidence, but all of the rashes are on the areas of application. Could this be an unknown side effect? I'll send off a message to the main office immediately. If this is a side effect, we need to halt our rollout of it.

April 12, 1943
The rashes are getting worse. Not only in the test subjects, but in the other researchers and staff! They apparently were using some of the stuff as well, and had even hoarded some of it. Disgusting. I'm lodging yet another complain with headquarters, since they still haven't replied to my last one, and recommending they be disciplined posthaste. In the meantime, that shipment needs to get here NOW. I think I can figure out a way to prevent these side effects, but I need more supplies to determine just what it is doing and why these effects are happening.

April 19, 1943
My god

What have we done?

The subjects are dying. Their skin is liquifying, and there's nothing we can do.

The worst part? It was designed to be that way. I finally got my reply from the main office. It said, and I quote, ""That is what it was designed for. We wanted to guarantee that once they started using Bamtantrax, they wouldn't switch to any other cosmetics. And it's working, too. Ask any one of the test subjects! They want more. And that's what we intend to give them. And to that end, we are pushing up our big rollout to May! We would be delighted to grant your request for a transfer, but the product will be launched as planned.""

Can you believe it? Our product is killing people, liquifying their skin and they want to roll it out sooner?

I don't know what to do. I've got to do something, but what?

April 26, 1943
Oh god oh god oh god oh god OH GOD OH GOD

They're falling apart!

The secretaries, the test patients, ALL OF THEM!

They're slowly falling apart and it was because of something I did oh god how could I have thought it was a good idea WHAT HAVE I DONE

They're justfalling apart. I saw them in the hospital with my very own eyes. I did this. I helped cause this. And they're rolling out! May 1! This causes people's skin to FALL APART and we're selling it! How could we have done it. How could I have done it.

Great banks of long tree trunks would bob and sink, staining the lake. At least, that's what the boy's grandpa said. He dove off the dock, slipping into the cool water as easy as an otter, his sunburned skin drinking in the cooling water.

The lake was very deep, and quickly he was over the vast, deep edges, paddling softly with the easy grace attainable only by the happy few who know the width and depth of summer break. He turned over to his back, the murky, tea-colored haze buoying him up on billows of cool water. He flicked his hands with a careless annoyance as he skirted a patch of loosed seaweed, sending it bobbing away. He watched the clouds, listening to the empty hum of the lake in his ears.

He slowly noticed more patches floating about him, and bobbed to vertical, wincing as his feet kicked and brushed the slippery, brown strands of weed. The strands twitched and clutched with their soggy strength, and he sighed as he started to plot a course out of the muck.

Deep below, the twitching strands stirred the muck they were rooted so deeply in. The mud puffed then bulged, rising softly in a great mound. Then it opened eyes, great sludgy orbs the size of cars. It slowly rose, freeing its gnashing maw, and drifted up to see what its feelers had found.","The water was cool , if a bit murky .

After hearing the first three singles I was very excited to get this album so I could hear the rest of it. It had seemed that they had finally mixed their penmanship with the ultra pop sound that they gave us in their previous album. I didn't get what I excepted. Oh sure you now get an R&B influenced album with a little bit of 1980's new wave sound, but you don't get those deep meaningful lyrics that you got from the first three albums, just mainstream fluff. After track 3, you get such a lull full of that fluff until you get to track 9 and the last three songs (not including the bonus tracks) once again give you that good feeling from the first three tracks. So, I guess my question is why couldn't the whole album be like this?

I am not going to say that Maroon 5 is losing a fan here, I still find 'V' to be a good listen, there is nothing truly bad about it. I guess the question is, as someone who has been listening to them since 'Songs About Jane' will we ever see that band we first met back in 2003? If this is truly the future of Maroon 5, they may very well lose me after all.

A3QTSCTRZF3VGY,B00LWNW33Q,-1,1,4,"Electric Wizard like it retro.  A lot.  For a band that has gotten top billing as the world's heaviest band, they are content to settle for a muddy analog sound that nearly swallows the drums, and all but buries vocalist/guitarist Jus Oborn's singing, rendering them almost indecipherable, although you can read the lyric sheet if you want.  That's the bad news, and costs them one star.
  As far as the rest goes, ""Time To Die"" is prime EW fare, slow, druggy, Satanic and steeped in Sabbath-y goodness or badness, depending on your religious affiliation.
  The guitars are up front, the bass pretty much locked in with them, and the album is definitely heavier and more sinister than ""Black Masses"".  In fact, it's sonically the heaviest (what other term can one use for this kind of gloom and doom) since ""Dopethrone"", their highpoint and still one of the great doom metal records ever.  It's also a bit angrier, which could be traced to the lineup change frustrations and the feud with their former record label, run by Lee Dorrian of Cathedral fame.  I'm not taking sides here, but the record does have an edge other EW CD's don't.
  Of course, there's the nude girl at a Satanic ritual photo inside the sleeve, voice overs addressing Satan worship and other gimmickry Wizard have used to some success.  That may not be a good thing, but as always, someone who would use music as a catalyst for bad behavior is looking for some excuse to act that way in the first place.  For old geezers like moi, who have long lived past the gimmicks employed over decades, it comes down to music, and I ignore lyrics most of the time anyway.  ""Time To Die"" is not the top doom album of the year - that will go either to Yob or Pallbearer's new albums - but it's a worthy inclusion for lovers of the genre nonetheless.","Electric Wizard like it retro .

As far as the rest goes , "" Time To Die "" is prime EW fare , slow , druggy , Satanic and steeped in Sabbath - y goodness or badness , depending on your religious affiliation . The guitars are up front , the bass pretty much locked in with them , and the album is definitely heavier and more sinister than "" Black Masses "" . In fact , it 's sonically the heaviest ( what other term can one use for this kind of gloom and doom ) since "" Dopethrone "" , their highpoint and still one of the great doom metal records ever . It 's also a bit angrier , which could be traced to the lineup change frustrations and the feud with their former record label , run by Lee Dorrian of Cathedral fame . I 'm not taking sides here , but the record does have an edge other EW CD 's do n't . Of course , there 's the nude girl at a Satanic ritual photo inside the sleeve , voice overs addressing Satan worship and other gimmickry Wizard have used to some success . That may not be a good thing , but as always , someone who would use music as a catalyst for bad behavior is looking for some excuse to act that way in the first place . For old geezers like moi , who have long lived past the gimmicks employed over decades , it comes down to music , and I ignore lyrics most of the time anyway . "" Time To Die "" is not the top doom album of the year - that will go either to Yob or Pallbearer 's new albums - but it 's a worthy inclusion for lovers of the genre nonetheless ."

A3H7HYC9HIQAAQ,B00M0JHA0C,1,-1,3,"Lucy is a high-concept sci-fi action movie directed by Luc Besson and starring Scarlet Johansson in the eponymous role as a young woman who is tricked into being a mule for a Korean crime syndicate, carrying a highly valuable synthetic super-drug called CPH4 that can increase the users brain function capacity, and which has been sewn into a pouch in her abdomen. When the pouch begins to leak and the drug begins to enter Lucys bloodstream, she begins to manifest increasingly developed levels of consciousness and physical prowess: absorbing information instantaneously, telekinesis, mental time travel, and imperviousness to pain. So begins a race against time as Lucy tries to understand and control her new abilities, while simultaneously avoiding the drug lords private army, who have been charged with capturing Lucy and returning the drug to its intended recipient. The film also stars Morgan Freeman, Amr Waked and Choi-Min Sik, and has an original score by French composer ric Serra.

ric Serra and Luc Besson have been working together for over 30 years, having collaborated on such memorable projects as Subway (1985), The Big Blue (1988), La Femme Nikita (1990), Lon (1994), The Fifth Element (1997) and The Messenger (1999). Originally a guitarist and songwriter, Serra has always been something of a progressive composer, making use of synthesizers and electronic sound effects well before it was cool to do so, and taking the road less traveled when he could: he was the man who brought a decidedly avant-garde sound to the James Bond series in GoldenEye, after all.

To illustrate the high-technology, futuristic world the film inhabits, Serras score for Lucy is similarly futuristic, a synthetic-orchestral hybrid that occasionally veers off into some of the harshest, most aggressive pure electronica that I have heard in a mainstream movie for quite some time. This isn't the type of acoustic-electronic combo score that the Remote Control boys have been writing of late, though, and its not even in the sonic world of the John Powell Bourne scores either; Lucy seems much edgier, much more authentic, much more uncompromising than those scores, and as such it is likely to be significantly more difficult for some listeners to connect with it on an emotional level.

When the orchestra is present, the score comes up with some decent sounds and textures, especially during the engaging, more traditionally symphonic finale. After a few early snippets  the second half of Inner Fireworks, the introspective I Feel Everything, the violin solo in Disintegration  cues like the soaring Flicking Through Time, the powerful brass-heavy pair Moonbirth and Origin of the World have a real epic quality to them, while the solo female vocalist which is introduced into the score in Melt into Matter marks it as the emotional high point of the score.

In addition, some of the orchestrations and instrumental touches Serra employs are unusual and creative  the didgeridoo in Mr. Wangs Bloody Suite and Inner Fireworks, the out-of-left-field saxophone Euro-jazz of All We Have Done With It, and the acoustic guitars of Choose to Reproduce among them.

However, these cues are the exception rather than the rule, and much of the rest of the score combines rhythmic electronic patterns with some gritty industrial sound design, as well as some elements of the in-vogue EDM. The first and last cues, First Cells and I Am Everywhere, both feature the same steady metronomic core, the same heartbeat pulse, and the same sparse orchestration, while later cues such as Pleasant Drive in Paris and Sixty Percent Mess, despite being short in length, are brutal and bold, and pull no punches in presenting the harshest electronic rhythms and textures they can. Some of the cues also feature unusual electronic looping effects, sort of similar to the work Olivier Derivire did on the video game score Remember Me last year, albeit without the same level of ingenuity and panache: its especially noticeable in pieces like Crossing the Goon Sea .

Unfortunately, the one thing Lucy is not is especially memorable. The orchestral parts are appropriate, but never really stand out from the myriad of other appropriate orchestral parts in other, similar scores. The electronic elements, despite being abrasively authentic, have been done better elsewhere, and don't break any new ground. Theres no real recurring thematic content beyond the ticking of the first and last cues, and theres no identity for Lucy herself, which is the most curious thing of all: Luc Besson is so enamored with strong female characters, from Anne Parillauds La Femme Nikita to Natalie Portmans Mathilda in Lon and Milla Jovovichs Leeloo in The Fifth Element, that one would expect the conceptual centerpiece of his story to be accompanied by the musical centerpiece of the films score, but this is not the case. Instead, Lucy is a score which skirts around the edges, presenting some clever textures and orchestral flourishes, but little else. Im not saying that ric Serra only used 10% of his musical talent on this score, in the way that this film clams most of the worlds population only uses 10% of their brains, but you can perhaps see a parallel.","Lucy is a high - concept sci - fi action movie directed by Luc Besson and starring Scarlet Johansson in the eponymous role as a young woman who is tricked into being a mule for a Korean crime syndicate , carrying a highly valuable synthetic super - drug called CPH4 that can increase the users brain function capacity , and which has been sewn into a pouch in her abdomen .

A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00M0JHA0C,1,-1,3,"Luc Besson quickly became a prominent auteur director in the early 90's and had some really big success with films like Lon and The Fifth Element. In recent years he's taken more of a producer/writer role, but still helped define the action genre in his own way. He is the creative mind behind films like Taken and The Transporter. Besson has directed a few movies in the past few years such as Angel-A, The Lady and The Family. However, he hasn't really returned to the action genre as a director until now. Also, when you get a Luc Besson film you are more than likely going to have an Eric Serra score. Serra has composed almost every one of Besson's films, and his scores for Lon and The Fifth Element were an incredible display of his musical voice. Serra was also chosen to bring new life the James Bond franchise in GoldenEye. That didn't go according to plan for the producers, but his score there became an iconic modern representation of Bond that was reflected in the popular video game as well. Lucy brings Serra back to a territory where he strives in, and that's Besson directed sci-fi. Lucy may not be a perfect score, but it has enough style and flair to make it a more than entertaining experience.

The score for Lucy gains strength as it progresses along. We start as a typical sort of electronic droning suspense score, then Serra supports the action with some interesting textures. Serra's style is all over the score, and for me it was almost like a trip back to scores like GoldenEye and The Fifth Element in the best way possible. He is able to build some effective moments even if the cohesive body of the score has a hard time sticking together. There's a lacking thematic structure to whole journey. Some of the synths and sounds have a little 80's flavor to it, and it gives the score just the right amount of a sci-fi kick. In all honestly, I feel like the music could have been even more stylized. I think the weakness of the score lies in its lack of a lasting impact. I didn't feel absorbed fully until the last third or so, and if it takes that long to finally get on track then the whole experience won't be a memorable one. It's still an entertaining ride though, and it has plenty of great standout moments.

Lucy is not the full-form Serra we heard in scores like Lon and The Fifth Element, but it's still hearing a veteran auteur hitting some fun strides with a director he's been working with his entire career. There's nothing to hate about Lucy's stylistic score, but it doesn't offer anything to take with you beyond listening to it in the moment. There are some great melodic points that will pull you in, but not enough of them. This is a score that needed some more stylization to make it stand out, but it's still a fine Eric Serra score as it stands.

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B00M5J0XX8,1,-1,3,"First, I want to say The Bee Gees are part of my musical DNA. I grew up on them, defended them, always saw their talent above all else, was extremely happy to see them inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and terribly saddened along the way as Andy Gibb and Maurice Gibb died, and in May 2012, Robin, too. I can't imagine what it's like to be the eldest brother (Barry) and have lost all your brothers.

I also want to say that as a kid, I was never aware of Robin's solo works. It wouldn't be until 1990's box set ""Tales From The Brothers Gibb"" that I became aware that both Robin and Barry released solo works in the 1980's. Still, finding Robin's solo works on cd over the years has been cost prohibitive and challenging. Even now, I see I can download his first three albums for a decent price, but his last two albums are nowhere to be found, unless you buy ""Magnet"" as an import cd, and unless you want to pay out the nose for ""Walls Have Eyes"".

With that in mind, I have never listened to a solo Robin Gibb album until now. While I appreciate the efforts of his family, at 17 tracks, my warning light went off. Unless all 17 tracks are superb there is going to be a lot of filler, and that, unfortunately, tends to be the case with ""50 St. Catherine's Drive"".

To me, the best tracks here are: ""Days Of Wine And Roses"", ""Alan Freeman Days"", ""Avalanche"", ""One Way Love"", ""Broken Wings"", ""Sanctuary"", ""Solid"" and ""All We Have Is Now"", plus the demo of ""Sydney"" was decent as well. As much as I miss his voice, each brother, alone, is not equal to the whole collective, The Bee Gees. I always thought Andy Gibb should have been a part of The Bee Gees, by the way.

So, yes, I need to buy up Robin's solo works and put ""50 St. Catherine's Drive"" in perspective, but for now, three stars--good, but not exactly memorable or classic.

A2OYT6UXIH4WSS,B00FW65M32,-1,1,4,"After listening to this record, it's her  most safest work she has ever done by far. I wasn't too fascinated. In fact, I felt bored with most of the songs. Many of its uptempos didn't kept me on my feet like the ones on Bionic apart from Your Body, Shut Up, and Around The World. It felt like the fun and excitement were missing. I would say that Blank Page and Sing For Me easily outshine most of the tracks on Lotus.  I would place Lotus behind B2B, Bionic, and Stripped because I feel that it does sound a bit generic compared to the more experimental sounds on the predecessors.

Do I think that Lotus is an improvement on Bionic? Heck no..not really.  I like how Bionic was less commercialized, very artistic, and experimental. Bionic sounded at least more distinctive and more inviting in sound. Sonically, it's far more interesting and fun than Lotus. It had alot more variety in sounds while Lotus sounds like something that could easily be done by Rihanna, Katy, or Britney. People think Lotus is better than Bionic. If generic music is their kind of thing, then ok. But people who have been following her since Stripped and with REAL musical tastes knows she could have done a LOT better than this and not playing it safe. I can't really say that Lotus is more cohesive because most of the tracks left me more to be desired. I wanted to get into the songs, but the beats just didn't feel all that mind blowing to me. None of the songs truly gave me that wow factor like her older albums. None of the songs even compare to AMAZING, stellar songs like Monday Morning or Bobblehead. Bobblehead is one of those tracks that make me want to do hopscotch or double dutch. Christina needs to leave that generic mess to the younger crowd and return to the formula that made her stand APART from the rest. It feels like Christina's input and vision have been considerably absent on this one. It feels it's been greatly compromised for the sake of staying relevant and current.  it's really sad that people would rather praise her most generic work (Lotus) than the more artistic, riskier one (Bionic) that sets itself apart from the rest. Of course, commercialism always sell more and gets more rave reviews.  I find it so ridiculous that it's even got a higher score on Stripped on metacritic. The reviewers were spot on that people would like the mix and style of Stripped and Bionic won't be turning heards with this one. I couldn't believe that Lotus actually got a higher score than Stripped and Bionic. Lotus is by far her most safest, generic work and it gets more praised. I find it to be her weakest effort. It really frustrates me how Bionic never got the success it deserves and less praises. It's her most riskiest work ever and nobody wants to salute her for that. For being unique and different. Love u, Xtina. But your creativity is slipping. I want Riskytina BACK! The one who was not afraid to experiment. Show me that freak side like you did on Bionic! And I miss her interludes. It made her stand out more from the rest. Like this person said, ""Say what you want about Bionic, the album had a powerful theme and overall vision both in her artwork and music, there was a connection and overall vibe. That is really missing from Lotus. It's like her artistry has been toned down by her people to help her sell but its just made it lacking. There's no interludes on this album which is classic Christina musically, there's no REAL or strong sense of musical themes because her label must have requested she go back to a safe formulas to sell. It's a random mix that does not work for me. There's no change of genre or change of image. I expected a very sensual and spiritual album, like the cover suggests ""  Team Bionic ALL THE WAY!

I know I am being very critical and harsh, but I strongly feel that Christina is WAAAY better than this. She doesn't need to resort to this. I'm an Aquarius. I can't help it if I like something more unique and different from the rest. I know her self-worth and the wonderful, great artist that she's truly is. I am feel really disappointed with this era. It's a total setback from the True artist she had aspired to be from Stripped. Like another reviewer had mentioned, she promised her fans that would never do safe/mainstream music. My...have the tables have turned. Hopefully, she makes it up to her devoted fans that were fans of her earlier work and returns to her OLD self. Because honestly this does not feel like a Christina album. The REAL Christina wouldn't resort to generic dance music and work with used up producers.  Overall, I would give Lotus 4/5. I still think it's worth listening, just not worth remembering. Even though I haven't felt compelled to put this album on repeat like her earlier ones, I will still get Lotus though...just to support Christina and her sales. I have to admit that the cover and images in the booklet are very beautiful and subtle. It had some nice themes like self defense and keeping positive vibes, just wish the music itself live up to my expectations. I guess this is her own ""Charmbracelet"".

1. Lotus- Probably the most experimental and unique track on the entire album.  One person mentioned that her vocals on this track are soft and heavenly and, like the Lotus Flower, this song slowing grows and eventually blooms. I couldn't agree more. Best intro since Stripped!  5/5

2. Army of Me- Wasn't really that crazy about this song at first. The sound is a little bland for my taste,  but it may be a nice follow up to Your Body. She makes references from her older song Fighter. ""One of me is wiser, one of me is stronger, one of me is a fighter""  This song may grow on you.  4/5

3. Red Hot Kinda Love- Sounds like a reject from Bionic. It's good, but I would probably have put this as a bonus track. 4/5

4.  Make The World Move- I was really disappointed with this one when I heard it initially. I was ready to dismiss it as her weakest track on here, but it grew on me the more I listen to it. It can be a bit bland at times. Their other collaboration ""Nasty"" would have been a better choice for this album.  4.5/5

5. Your Body- Honestly, it starts to get better with this. Perhaps, the most strongest, catchiest one on this album.  I love her body, just not this album. The lyrics will make you want to hit that repeat button each time!  5/5

6. Let There Be Love- My mind screamed ""Girl Gone Wild"" as the song begins to start. Very generic, but it sounds radio friendly. 4/5

7. Sing For Me- The first ballad on the album.  Now she is really starting to grab my attention here. Things start to get mellow. Pretty empowering song. Love the 80s throwback.  This would make a nice single choice.  5/5

8. Blank Page- feels like You Lost Me pt. 2 with more strength. I could imagine this song being used on So You Think You Can Dance or being sung on shows like American Idol or The X Factor. 5/5

9. Cease Fire- The drum beats are the only ones that give this song its own saving grace, other than that it can feel boring at times. She sounds bored.  People say this song reminds them of Rihanna, but I don't hear it. 4/5

10. Around the World- I can picture Rihanna doing this song as well. Those were my immediate thoughts. This would also make a good single choice. If only they were more uptempos on this record that could sound this good as this one, but unfortunately only this song and Your Body caught my ears.  5/5

11. Circles-The fiestiest track of them all. It clearly goes out to her haters that won't back off.  5/5

12. Best Of Me- Have some good moments, but wish it could have been better. 4/5

13. Just A Fool-the only non-generic song on the album. Nice to see Christina dabbling into country. This will comfort any doubters who were a bit hesitant of her doing this kind of thing. I love how Christina can pull off any genre. 5/5

14. Light Up The Sky-Not my favorite, but it sounds very pleasant. 4/5

15. Empty Words- Decent song. Like it better than Light Up the Sky. 4/5

16. Shut Up-My favorite bonus track. I would add this song to the standard edition to spice things up cuz honestly this album feels boring. 5/5

I won't bother giving the remix a rating.","After listening to this record , it 's her   most safest work she has ever done by far . I was n't too fascinated . In fact , I felt bored with most of the songs . Many of its uptempos did n't kept me on my feet like the ones on Bionic apart from Your Body , Shut Up , and Around The World . It felt like the fun and excitement were missing . I would say that Blank Page and Sing For Me easily outshine most of the tracks on Lotus . I would place Lotus behind B2B , Bionic , and Stripped because I feel that it does sound a bit generic compared to the more experimental sounds on the predecessors . Do I think that Lotus is an improvement on Bionic ? Heck no .. not really . I like how Bionic was less commercialized , very artistic , and experimental . Bionic sounded at least more distinctive and more inviting in sound . Sonically , it 's far more interesting and fun than Lotus . It had alot more variety in sounds while Lotus sounds like something that could easily be done by Rihanna , Katy , or Britney . People think Lotus is better than Bionic . If generic music is their kind of thing , then ok . But people who have been following her since Stripped and with REAL musical tastes knows she could have done a LOT better than this and not playing it safe . I ca n't really say that Lotus is more cohesive because most of the tracks left me more to be desired . I wanted to get into the songs , but the beats just did n't feel all that mind blowing to me . None of the songs truly gave me that wow factor like her older albums . None of the songs even compare to AMAZING , stellar songs like Monday Morning or Bobblehead . Bobblehead is one of those tracks that make me want to do hopscotch or double dutch . Christina needs to leave that generic mess to the younger crowd and return to the formula that made her stand APART from the rest . It feels like Christina 's input and vision have been considerably absent on this one . It feels it 's been greatly compromised for the sake of staying relevant and current . it 's really sad that people would rather praise her most generic work ( Lotus ) than the more artistic , riskier one ( Bionic ) that sets itself apart from the rest . Of course , commercialism always sell more and gets more rave reviews . I find it so ridiculous that it 's even got a higher score on Stripped on metacritic . The reviewers were spot on that people would like the mix and style of Stripped and Bionic wo n't be turning heards with this one . I could n't believe that Lotus actually got a higher score than Stripped and Bionic . Lotus is by far her most safest , generic work and it gets more praised . I find it to be her weakest effort . It really frustrates me how Bionic never got the success it deserves and less praises . It 's her most riskiest work ever and nobody wants to salute her for that . For being unique and different . Love u , Xtina . But your creativity is slipping . I want Riskytina BACK ! The one who was not afraid to experiment . Show me that freak side like you did on Bionic ! And I miss her interludes . It made her stand out more from the rest . Like this person said , "" Say what you want about Bionic , the album had a powerful theme and overall vision both in her artwork and music , there was a connection and overall vibe . That is really missing from Lotus . It 's like her artistry has been toned down by her people to help her sell but its just made it lacking . There 's no interludes on this album which is classic Christina musically , there 's no REAL or strong sense of musical themes because her label must have requested she go back to a safe formulas to sell . It 's a random mix that does not work for me . There 's no change of genre or change of image . I expected a very sensual and spiritual album , like the cover suggests ""   Team Bionic ALL THE WAY ! I know I am being very critical and harsh , but I strongly feel that Christina is WAAAY better than this . She does n't need to resort to this . I ca n't help it if I like something more unique and different from the rest . I know her self - worth and the wonderful , great artist that she 's truly is . I am feel really disappointed with this era . It 's a total setback from the True artist she had aspired to be from Stripped . Like another reviewer had mentioned , she promised her fans that would never do safe / mainstream music . Hopefully , she makes it up to her devoted fans that were fans of her earlier work and returns to her OLD self . Because honestly this does not feel like a Christina album . The REAL Christina would n't resort to generic dance music and work with used up producers . Overall , I would give Lotus 4/5 . I still think it 's worth listening , just not worth remembering . Even though I have n't felt compelled to put this album on repeat like her earlier ones , I will still get Lotus though ... just to support Christina and her sales . I have to admit that the cover and images in the booklet are very beautiful and subtle .

AAQAB2HFHYQ4F,B00M7LN7SM,-1,1,5,"This is one of the best albums of Stevie Nicks career and that includes her work with Fleetwood Mac. It's excellent. However, Stevie Nicks is having several problems getting this album heard.

First. Stevie is 66 years old. She has several singles on the album but they aren't going to get played because ageism is alive and well in the music industry. MTV and VH1 do not play videos from female singer songwriters over 45 on their stations. CMT won't play her videos because they think she is a witch, even though of couple of tunes on this album sound like country hits. She has no outlet for her music. Radio will not give these songs the attention they deserve. She is guilty of growing old.

Second, some fans are upset because they have spent years listening to the demos and can't get over them. I can't tell you how many fans have said she should of just had the demos remastered or they are upset because she decided to remake some demos and not others. Hence, they are downgrading the album based on that pettiness. They are also downgrading the album because critics who don't even like Stevie Nicks reluctantly like this album, but they didn't like the albums these so called fans liked. So they are trying to downgrade it based on that. Taste is also a factor and some of these whacked out people don't have any.

Third, some critics and fans want her back with Fleetwood Mac ASAP and she has been reluctant to record a new record with them. So this record is getting downgraded for that reason, also, to teach her lesson.

There are more reasons.... However, none of them really have to do with the music.

Like I said before - this album is excellent! There is not a bad song on the album and the album flows. It's not just a collection of singles. It's a real album that covers a lot of musical ground. It's the REAL DEAL. If you like good, classic rock music, then you will like this album. This is Stevie Nicks in her Hay Day!!!!!!! And keep in mind reviews with hidden agendas.","This is one of the best albums of Stevie Nicks career and that includes her work with Fleetwood Mac . It 's excellent .

AZ0JE672Z45T7,B00M7LWQ6G,1,-1,3,"When most rappers emerge in the rap game, they do so with a level of urgency. That exigency is the foundation of hip-hop as well as the nature of life in the 'hood which propels this genre of music. After a couple of albums and artist success, most rappers tend to relax, which often affects their music. It's understandable that Ortiz would reach a point where he needs to catch his breath, hence the title and tone of this album. After all, he's been rapping like his life depends on it ever since he emerged in the game. Add that to the fact that he's made lifestyle changes (refraining from alcohol and cigarettes, working-out, weight loss), it's understandable that his music will reflect upon his personal growth. This release includes a few R&B tracks previously non-existent within his catalogue, not to mention some jazz influenced production. However, these tracks are a mixed bag of weak to solid. The Joell Ortiz that I dig is the cat who rips mics with supreme lyricism. Although he's lyrically sharp throughout this project, the initial missteps on the disc (""Cold World"" ""Dream On"" ""Brothers Keeper"") are disruptive head scratchers. Unlike his previous two albums which were ""press and play"" from front to finish, this album may have many listeners hitting next from time to time. This is a good album, but not the great album that you would expect from a great artist. 3.5/5","When most rappers emerge in the rap game , they do so with a level of urgency .

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B00M7LN7SM,1,-1,3,"My father bought 1975's ""Fleetwood Mac"" and 1977's ""Rumours"", and as a very young child (3,4,5 years old) I heard many songs over and over again from those albums (in a strange parallel, my parents divorced in 1976) so the lyrics, even at that young age, and the melodies, they all became are part of my musical DNA. Now, I hate to tell you fans, but I prefer Lindsey Buckingham's musical approach over Stevie Nicks'. That being said, during the 1980's I really enjoyed her hits, but avoided her albums. Now, of course, I have them all.

At 14 tracks, ""24 Karat"" is over-long. In repeatedly listening to the entire thing over the past weeks, it becomes apparent that 10-12 tracks would have been just fine. In fact, I can tell which two to four tracks I would have cut to make a stronger impression: ""Blue Water"", ""Lady"", ""I Don't Care"", ""All The Beautiful Worlds"", ""Belle Fleur"" and ""If You Were My Love"" and ""She Loves Him Still"". Yep, that's half the album. Well, seeing as this album is more a compilation of old songs than a brand new current album, it makes sense that there's excess and quality control issues. Now, it's all good and fine if you are a fan and think this album is the greatest. I stand apart from you.

I found there were too many ballads, too many references to secret loves and loves lost without any direct connection to the material. You know, if you're going to do a ballad, it has to mean something, like, say, ""Leather And Lace"" or ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around"" or even ""Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You?"" or even one of my favorites, ""Two Kinds Of Love"".

I like Stevie Nicks as much as the next person, but let's be straight: Aren't you looking forward to a newly reunited Fleetwood Mac album? And, wouldn't you like the same double-disc re-mastered treatment reissue of ""Mirage"", ""Tango In The Night"" and ""Behind The Mask""? Aren't those well over-due? Heck, how about re-mastering and reissuing ""Bella Donna"", ""The Wild Heart"", ""Rock A Little"" and ""The Other Side Of The Mirror""? What about Lindsey Buckingham's ""Law And Order"", ""Go Insane"" and ""Out Of The Cradle""?

Anyway, it's good to see Nicks working with Dave Stewart again. I think that's a good musical match.

Here's how ""24 Karat Gold--Songs From The Vault"" compares to Nicks other works:

I've downloaded half of the album.  The rest you can keep.  I think, and I feel this way about Frank and Tony's duet albums, what's reinforced here is that Barbra, almost without exception, sounds so much better than anyone she might pair up with.  At age 72, her voice is still matchless.  But she has to sing with those who can really hold their own with her, and fifty percent of those featured on this album just cannot.

And I was hesitant about her duet with her son, but there's something very easy about that pairing.  It's the duet with Michael Buble which had me asking, ""Why didn't she do a whole album with him?""  Their voices were made for duets!  I think the purpose of the album is for Barbra's efforts to say, ""Hey, I'm hip, I'm with it.""  But, Barbra, music today is in such a horrid state of mediocrity that your choices for partnership must be from a very small pool of men who can hold their own; half of the fellows here really come out on the short end of the stick, through no fault of your own, other than you chose to sing with them and display their shortcomings.  09/17/14 Have decided I'm not crazy about ""New York State of Mind"" either.

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00M8JD49K,1,-1,3,"There is no question that Barbra Streisand has been a one of a kind songstress that has delivered so well in music for over fifty years. While she has had some excellent duets over the years with Celine Dion on Tell Him, and Barry Gibb on Guilty. But when I had heard that she was going to make another duets album, bringing her heart into music again. The question is does she really deliver with her friends. Her duet with the legendary ""Piano Man"" Billy Joel and on his classic hit New York State Of Mind feels a bit weighed down and doesn't actually deliver as strong as what you had known from the classic Billy Joel song for over forty years. Here it feels like it is lackluster in vocals, and doesn't have as much of the class you would've known from the song. If you are looking forward to Partners from Barbra Streisand, you should look for something more than just a New York state of mind and voice.

While she has had some excellent duets over the years with Celine Dion on Tell Him , and Barry Gibb on Guilty . But when I had heard that she was going to make another duets album , bringing her heart into music again . The question is does she really deliver with her friends . Her duet with the legendary "" Piano Man "" Billy Joel and on his classic hit New York State Of Mind feels a bit weighed down and does n't actually deliver as strong as what you had known from the classic Billy Joel song for over forty years . Here it feels like it is lackluster in vocals , and does n't have as much of the class you would 've known from the song . If you are looking forward to Partners from Barbra Streisand , you should look for something more than just a New York state of mind and voice ."
ALKBO0791XOU9,B00M8JCW3E,1,-1,2,"Wow, I wonder how many times Barbra can regurgitate the same songs on an album.  ENOUGH, already.  I have those same 10 songs that she has been recycling to the point where I hate every one of them.  One can only hope Barry Gibb is sitting with pen in hand as I speak whipping up some songs to sing with her that I can stand to listen to.  I used to be such a big fan till she couldn't learn a new song.  who in the world has not heard her sing these same songs till we could cringe.  What I would like for her to do is use her massive talent on something most people are not sick of.  The public works pretty hard for their money and she keeps sending in the same old, same old all the time.  We can't recycle our work in the private sector.  In the meantime I listen to Rosalyn Kind and find her to be much better since she is so relaxed sounding.  I also discovered I like Lady Gaga.  At least she doesn't sing the same songs on every album.  What a waste of talent.  The public deserves better than she is giving for their money.  I am happy I got the mp3 download - much less money wasted and I am about ready to remove it from my mp3 player since I do not enjoy it.  What a disappointment.","Wow , I wonder how many times Barbra can regurgitate the same songs on an album . ENOUGH , already .

A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B00M8JCW3E,-1,1,4,"I really had high hopes for Barbra Streisand's new PARTNERS CD especially after seeing her on the Tonight Show w/Jimmy Fallon and hearing the first couple of songs on the CD.

Don't get me wrong the CD is good, but there's nothing new to hear people.

I LOVE her duet with Michael Buble ""It Had To Be You,"" which has that big band sound (and borders on a swinging beat but never goes full throttle) and I had hoped that the rest would be in a similar vain. Streisand is in PRIME voice for doing a full-on swinging/jazzy up-tempo CD and why this has not happened is beyond me.

Tracks 2-5 are nice re-workings of her song book including a fabulous duet with Stevie Wonder and his harmonica on a Bossa nova tinged version of ""People,"" and the guitar riffs by John Mayer on ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" are fantastic -- even though those are her ""standards"" -- they sound fresh and revamped. Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmonds puts his own stamp on ""Evergreen,"" but it doesn't stray to far from the original, and the duet with Billy Joel on his song ""New York State Of Mind"" was a long time in coming but it works.

Unfortunately tracks 6 and 7 don't work for me. ""I'd Want It To Be You,"" Streisand's duet with Blake Shelton -- though I like the song -- their voices don't blend very well together and seems out-of-place with the first five tracks. This song sounds more like something that belongs on a kid's movie or something. This song will probably grow on me, but still it just doesn't seem to fit here.

Likewise, Barbra's duet with Lionel Richie on her classic ""The Way We Were"" misses the mark altogether and sounds too 'elevator-ish' losing all the intensity of the original. It almost sounds like they were trying to combine ""The Way We Were"" with ""Endless Love."" Now if they did a medley of those two songs then this might have been stand out (maybe).

""I Still Can See Your Face"" is a nice duet with Andrea Bocelli, only because both are such talented singers, but the music is more of the same in that it's lush, quiet, and nocturnal.

The duet with her son Jason Gould ""How Deep Is The Ocean"" is nice and he can sing, but this was featured in a live performance on ""Back To Brooklyn,"" so nothing new.

Tracks 10 and 11, ""What Kind Of Fool"" with John Legend and ""Somewhere"" with Josh Groban, are great but only when they hark back to the original compositions. Sometimes you just can't top the original or original reworking of a song and that shows here.

Lastly, the duet with Elvis Presley, ""Love Me Tender"" is OK, but it's missing something and I don't know what? It lacks the intimacy(?) -immediacy(?) of other manufactured duets like Natalie Cole's duet with her father on ""Unforgettable"" or even Barbra's duet with an on-screen Marlon Brando ""I'll Know"" (maybe she just sung with his character on Guys and Dolls) and I think she did another one with Frank Sinatra ""I've Got A Crush On You,"" which was shown during her concerts, so it isn't like she hasn't done it successfully before. Maybe it's because the song itself isn't a good match? I'm not sure, but you'd think that this would be an instant classic-hit but I don't think so. It just sounds slapped together.

Anyway, the CD comes with a booklet with pictures and liner notes by Barbra on each of her singing PARTNERS. Hopefully she'll do a follow up CD with up-tempo and swinging jazz/torch songs, this time featuring other divas like Diana Ross, Patti Labelle, Lady GaGa, etc., because that would put her back at number 1!","I really had high hopes for Barbra Streisand 's new PARTNERS CD especially after seeing her on the Tonight Show w / Jimmy Fallon and hearing the first couple of songs on the CD .

A3K2J86VI3TJV3,B00M8JCW3E,1,-1,3,"Maybe the time has come to reconcile with Barbra's music. After years of refusing to listen to her albums, I thought I should give this new one a try. So, I asked a friend to burn me a copy of ""Partners"" just before its official release. After reluctantly playing the entire album once, 3 days later I am secretly enjoying it. In fact, I think that spin after spin it sounds better and better. Streisand's dominating voice is unmatched, to the point of often paying more attention to her delivery technique, instead of focusing on the actual songs. Nevermind that the material overall is a little too lacklustre, some of it is pretty good. The opening duet with the velvety-voiced Michael Buble, ""It had to be you"", is just wonderful, and so is the gorgeous reindition of ""Somewhere"" with Josh Groban. And the duets with Lionel Richie, Andrea Bocelli, and Elvis, are very enjoyable, too. Some of the other tracks are helplessly lukewarm, but, if I can develop a liking for some of this material, then dedicated fans will most probably love this record. It is a great idea to introduce old songs to a younger audience, so maybe a ""Partners"" version with female duets could follow? With such a powerful throat at 72, she sure is able to keep recording for years to come. I may have been ignoring her music, but she is a living legend. And, though she may not be my cup of tea, I am certainly enjoying a few Barbra sips!","Maybe the time has come to reconcile with Barbra 's music .

A1432KCCCZL550,B00N0419RG,1,-1,3,"In the past decade Disciple has gone from a band to the solo project of the lead singer.  And the quality in the music really has shown it.  I have to admit nothing about the previous album did anything for me, and I can't even remember one song from it.

Thankfully this album steps things up a bit.  Disciple continues the overly generic sound they've had since Horseshoes and hand grenades, but they pull it off a little better here.  While I don't love every song on here they are at least listenable, with some really good ones in there, mostly at the beginning of the album.

Radical starts the album off with an anthemic vibe.  It's kind of typical for Disciple but still enjoyable.  Attack is next and it rocks harder and has a great hook in the chorus.  This is my favorite song on the album.  Dead Militia is next and I really like this one too.  Nice verses a good chorus and an overall nice flow to the song, with a little bit of a different feel to it.  Scarlet is next and this one has a nice melody.  Some of the lyrics are a bit cheesy but the song is still enjoyable.  Unbroken is the first ballad and it has a really good chorus.  the song itself is a bit cheey but listenable.  I could do without the ""whoa"" part though.  The name is a cool rocker, but unfortunately after this point the songs become less memorable.  Kamikaze at track 10 is another solid rocker with a nice hook, but everything else feels like filler to me.  They aren't terrible songs or anything, but they aren't really songs that I connect with.

So overall this album is a bit uneven, but it has a decent enough consistency where at least there aren't any completely cringe worthy songs like in the past 2 albums.  I swore I wouldn't blindly buy another Disciple album, and then proceeded to do that again.  Fortunately I feel a lot more rewarded this time around.

I would definitely recommend this to any fan of the band.  It's a nice step up and I hope with the new lineup they stay together for a while and grow as an actual band rather than changing musicians every album.

Overall I'd give it a 75 out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10 if amazon allowed for a more specific rating.","In the past decade Disciple has gone from a band to the solo project of the lead singer .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00N1LAIWA,1,-1,3,"It has been a very long time since Prince came out with new music. But nevertheless, he wanted his work in his songs to be his way, and not the way of what the record labels wanted him to be. That honestly showed when he left Warner Brothers in the late 90's, after accusing them of slavery in his work. But what Prince has came out with after his departure from Warner Brothers, hasn't honestly been completely up to the strength of what he had before. Breakfast Can Wait, the lead single from his album Art Official Age isn't actually one of his better songs. In fact, compared to songs like Black Sweat and Musicology which he did nearly a decade ago, sound much better than, than what he has put out now. I think there can be much better from Prince down the road, and that is something that Breakfast can wait for.

A1GIIPXONCEEHP,B00N4FF66G,-1,1,5,"This RCA Legacy edition of the classic 1971 album features nine bonus tracks (including a radio promotional ad) and a DVD featuring eleven live performances. If you did not already purchase last year's Sanctuary Records deluxe edition (a pricey import), this domestic release is a welcome alternative.

Let's give this album some historical perspective. The previous year, the Kinks had their first Top 10 single (""Lola"") and their first Top 40 album (LOLA VS. POWERMAN AND THE MONEYGOROUND) since 1964. If the record company was hoping to cash in on that success with their next album, they didn't know Ray Davies very well. MUSWELL HILLBILLIES stalled at No. 100 and the single ""20th Century Man"" couldn't even break the Hot 100. But as far back as 1967 with SOMETHING ELSE and its follow-up THE VILLAGE GREEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY, Ray Davies seemed to be more concerned about releasing albums and less concerned about producing a hit.

For me, MUSWELL HILLBILLIES is one of the Kinks' greatest albums (certainly their best album of the seventies). In many ways, this album revisited many of the themes from VILLAGE GREEN--a nostalgic look at a simpler time (""Have a Cuppa Tea""), bemoaning the post-war changes (""Muswell Hillbilly"") and fear of the future (""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues""). Note Ray's repeated line from ""20th Century Man"":  ""I'm a twentieth century man, but I don't wanna be here."" And, yes, Ray can be pessimistic. Here's the couplet that opens and closes ""Oklahoma, U.S.A"":  ""All life we work, but work is a bore/If life's for livin', what's livin' for?"" Maybe it's not so much depression as it is discontent. (I like to think it's the latter.)  And stylistically, the album is all over the map--blues, country, music hall. But it all works. This is a very satisfying collection of songs.

All of the bonus tracks were recorded at the same time (September/October 1971) and the same place (Morgan Studios) as the rest of the album, presumably in contention for inclusion but for whatever reason were left off. ""Lavender Lane"" is another Ray Davies' composition that bemoans the consequences of progress:  ""Oh Lord, such a pity that the world's gotta change."" [Note: Like ""Muswell Hillbilly,"" the lyrics of both songs reference Rosie Rooke.] ""Mountain Woman"" and ""Kentucky Moon"" first showed up on the 1998 Velvel re-issue. All three of these tracks would have fit thematically, but with a running time approaching forty-five minutes on the original album there simply wasn't space. The only other ""new"" songs are a demo of ""Nobody's Fool"" and a backing track of ""Queenie."" You also get an alternate instrumental take of ""20th Century Man"" and alternate versions ""Have a Cuppa Tea"" (which pushes Dave Davies guitar to the front with a more country sound) and somewhat slower ""Uncle Son."" Closing out the CD is a 50-second radio spot promoting the new album.

The DVD presents the Kinks live. The first two tracks are from a Jan. 4, 1972 performance first aired on BBC2 TV's ""The Old Grey Whistle Test."" The next nine songs were filmed at the Rainbow Theater in London, Jan. 31, 1972, and rebroadcast on BBC1 TV the following July as ""The Kinks at the Rainbow."" The songs are interspersed with interviews from band members to Arthur Howes (the Kinks' first agent) to the guy in the red sweater on the album cover. The only issues I have with the DVD is that only four of the eleven tracks are from MUSWELL HILLBILLIES (and TWO of them are ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues) and Ray dominates the screen--very little face time for Dave (even during solos).

Knowing how quickly a lot of the Kinks' re-issues have gone out of print, I'd grab a copy of this now. It's a very reasonable price compared to the import deluxe editions, and I can't think of a better way to celebrate the Kinks' 50th anniversary.

If I seem conflicted, it's because it's a sexy, fun song...until you really listen to the words.  The singer of this song is saying, ""I've got a girl crush"" but really, what she has is incredibly low self-esteem and wishes she were another girl because she thinks she's in love with that girl's boyfriend.  I mean, really think about that.  Instead of this woman saying to herself, this guy likes ""long blond hair"" and ""[her] smile and the midnight laugh"" she might as well be saying, ""I hate my short, brown hair, I hate my crooked teeth, I hate my high-pitched voice.""  It's a song about self-hate and wanting to erase who you are to be that someone else that some guy likes.  That is a terrible message for girls, and any woman to internalize.

And then, there's the whole stalker-y aspect of the song:  ""Thinkin' about her under your bed sheets""  and ""I wanna taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you"" and then the ""I want everything she has.""  It's a little creepy - very ""Single White Female"" if you've seen that (terrible) movie.  Again, not really a message you want girls/women to have.  You shouldn't want to be another woman, and you shouldn't obsess about or try to be another woman.  You should learn to love yourself, be comfortable with who you are, and look for men (or women, or both - whatever your preference) who appreciate and WANT you for that.

So, again, I love this song, it's my favorite workout cool down song, but would I want my children to listen to it?  Hells no.  Lest we think the lyrics don't matter, I would argue that all messages (music, TV, movies, video games, books, etc.) sink in and become a part of how our kids think and see the world.","So , I both love and hate this song .

This music was meant for meditation, for checking out, for zoning out.  Only the last track, Louder Than Words which is a summary reflection of the band and its members interactions with one another, is approached as a commercial song (and its merely okay as a Floyd song goes).

A2582KMXLK2P06,B00NPZI1ZS,-1,1,4,"The Endless River is a pleasant surprise.  I anticipated a boring relaxed album based on the reviews.  There's three ways to interpret this album.  One is that it's a pretentious/overblown attempt at something important which rubs many people the wrong way.  Two is that there's not enough actual musical ideas taking place.  Fair point I suppose.  And three, where I stand, is that the worst thing this album does is occasionally repeat some of the bands previously successful ideas such as the drum solo in ""A Saucerful of Secrets"", the sax solo in ""Us and Them"" and most importantly and obviously, the guitar solo at the end of ""Comfortably Numb"".

In fact most of the guitar playing is strikingly similar to the solo in ""Comfortably Numb"" but tamer, and the music overall follows world music more so than other Floyd albums.  If you like soaring guitar solos in the same style as the bands late 70's albums but slightly quieter, you'll certainly enjoy this album.  The way the songs flow directly and cohesively into the next makes it feel like you're listening to one long track.  For the most part the Endless River is an instrumental album, and the one noticeable weak point is when the vocal melody comes in near the end, and the clunky/uninspiring 6 minutes before this vocal melody arrives.  Otherwise Pink Floyd shows why they were once the most unique rock band of the 70's and I honestly think this is the best album Pink Floyd made since A Momentary Lapse of Reason.","The Endless River is a pleasant surprise .

AZKXH0J59TK11,B00NPZI1ZS,1,-1,3,"Expectations are everything.
And you can't blame Pink Floyd for selling ""The Endless River"" as something more than what it is: a collection of instrumental pieces culled together from leftovers from ""The Division Bell"" recording sessions. That's what it is. If you are expecting ""Wish You Were Here"" or ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" or even ""Meddle"" you are going to be sorely disappointed.
I dug ""The Endless River"" alright, though. I played it while I was working and found that it sounded pleasant. There aren't a lot of melodies to keep you coming back, and the one song with vocals, ""Louder Than Words"", is pretty forgettable.
But the album does sound like Pink Floyd: all the instruments sound very much like they were played by Richard Wright, Nick Mason, and David Gilmore. And there is something nice about hearing these guys on tape together again. And it's especially nice to see Wright spotlighted as he is here (this record being essentially a eulogy to him). He was a pretty underrated musician and it's nice to hear these songs built around him.
""The Endless River"" doesn't need to be anyone's first Pink Floyd experience. But if you are a fan it serves as a nice coda to a tremendous career. Just know what yo're getting before you pay for it.","And you ca n't blame Pink Floyd for selling "" The Endless River "" as something more than what it is : a collection of instrumental pieces culled together from leftovers from "" The Division Bell "" recording sessions .

A3HFPK3AMDNGBI,B00NPZI1ZS,1,-1,3,"With an album of this magnitude (I.e. popularity) this reviewer is of the theory that the most objective reviews will be those of the three star rating. Those looking for another Dark Side of the Moon are going to give it 1 star and the Pink ""Floydiacs"" are going to give a David Gilmour fart 5 stars. I know I am guilty of enough five star ratings myself, but only when deserved.

The Endless River is definitely not worthy of a 5 star rating but it certainly is not worth of a 1 star either. For the most part, I got exactly what I expected, maybe just a little bit more. ""Leftovers"" put together to create some type of ""whole"".

TER is essentially a Pink Floyd instrumental piece. Only one song contains lyrics, the last one. Sorry, I don't count ""Talkin' Hawkin'"" as actual lyrics. As so many people will weigh in on this and try to categorize it I might as well do the same. For me, this album is quite similar to the often over looked PF album ""Obscured by Clouds"". This album actually came out between Meddle and Dark Side to little or no fanfare.  It hit only # 46 on the US charts. It was the sound track to a movie, ""The Valley"" (La Vall&eacute;e) by Barbet Schroeder, and like TER contains snippets of music that complimented segments of the film. Likewise, these too can be listened to as individual songs or as a whole piece of music. Obscured does have a few more lyrics but roughly half the segments are instrumental pieces. Personally, I really enjoy it; which is probably why I also enjoy ""Endless  River"". ER can easily be imagined as a score to any number of nature documentaries or a Stanley Kubrick space epic. (Hint, hint, hint). In comparing it to more recent works it is definitely of the same timbre as Gilmour's ""On an Island"". A smooth, almost ""elegant"" mix that conveys a mood of relaxation.

With that said, I was most pleased with David Gilmour's guitar work on ER. I was ready for it to be just a soundscape highlighting Richard Wright's keyboard work, which it does, but Gilmour's guitar work often comes to the forefront adding some punch to what otherwise might become boring pieces of music. We must also keep in mind that this is not ""new material"" per say but a glimpse back to where the group was in 1994 and then put together with the sensibility of now 68 year old men. (let's call it ""creative editing"") It ain't going to rock folks. But to me, it is really not entirely a sleeper either. The segments are short enough to rapidly move through the entire piece without any individual segment to be so long as to get outright boring. Nick Mason displays some admirable drumming on ""Skins"" and as already mentioned Gilmour's ""blues tinged"" guitar work is always a pleasure to the ears. His guitar solo at the end of the last track,""Louder Than Words"", while not a ""Comfortably Numb"", does give the band a good send off.

So...yes. I would recommend purchasing The Endless River not as some 5 star artistic achievement but simply as a worthwhile addition to round out one's PF discography.

AAI0JSTPLNV3H,B00NPZI1ZS,-1,1,5,"As Jim Morrison once wrote ""This is the end, my beautiful friend...."" (The End - The Doors).
Like a lot of you I was disappointed by several things. One being that most of the content was from the last album Pink Floyd made, The Division Bell, and it the new album in in essence is partly scrap material, stuff that didn't make the grade 20 years ago. Another complaint is that there is only one lyrical track, but at least it's new.
However most people that are truly complaining about The Endless River before the album was even released must not be aware of Pink Floyd's content on the majority of their albums is largely instrumental and then some of the songs are sparse with wording and are largely instrumental. Songs such as ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" on the Wish You Were Here album have Part 1 & Part 2. The song is so long with instrumental work that it open and closes the album. There are many more examples of pure instrumental work on their albums. So to those who write reviews and are complaining you must not know very much about Pink Floyd.
David Gilmour has announced that Pink Floyd will not be touring with The Endless River. The reason given is that it wouldn't make sense to tour without Rick Wright who passed away in 2008. Rick Wright was the keyboardist for Pink Floyd. Also many are complaining that Roger Waters isn't on the album. I am a huge Roger Waters fan, but he hasn't been with Pink Floyd since the early 1980's. Again those complaining need to do some reading on why Roger Waters is no longer with Pink Floyd and hasn't been in over 30 years. I wish that on at least one track that he could have been apart of the final chapter of Pink Floyd but he's not and his last chapter was the album, The Final Cut (which coincidently was largely made of scrap material left over from the album, The Wall).
So the story of Pink Floyd is over. The book is now finished. Or is it? One truly never knows, but I do feel that its done. I grew up fascinated by the lyrical genius of Roger Waters and the mesmerizing guitar of David Gilmour, the timing of Nick Mason on the drums and the crash symbols on Comfortably Numb will always bring out the heart wrenching lyrics that Waters had written. Richard Wright doesn't get the credit he deserves. When you mention Pink Floyd one could think of the sounds and special effects coming in. That was Richard Wright for the greater part. He is and was a huge part of Pink Floyd's signature, so I see Gilmour's feelings about not touring with The Endless River. What was once four sadly became three and then very sadly became only two official members of Pink Floyd. It would have been interesting to see the amount of money that could have been made with a final tour. I wouldn't have been surprised to see it go over the billion dollar mark.
David Gilmour has also said that he is working on a solo album and will tour with it. Roger Waters will also be making a new solo album in the next year or two. I have went to see Roger Waters three times in concert. Once in the late 1990's and I was luck enough to see him preform The Wall, twice. On a interesting side not Roger asked David if he wanted to join in on the tour but David declined.
The history of Pink Floyd is a very interesting history. I encourage those who are dismissing this new album to reflect on the bands past and their work. Justice is not being done by complaining about this and that. Lets enjoy what we have because its a lot better than I thought we would ever get,","As Jim Morrison once wrote "" This is the end , my beautiful friend .... "" Like a lot of you I was disappointed by several things . One being that most of the content was from the last album Pink Floyd made , The Division Bell , and it the new album in in essence is partly scrap material , stuff that did n't make the grade 20 years ago . Another complaint is that there is only one lyrical track , but at least it 's new . However most people that are truly complaining about The Endless River before the album was even released must not be aware of Pink Floyd 's content on the majority of their albums is largely instrumental and then some of the songs are sparse with wording and are largely instrumental . Songs such as "" Shine On You Crazy Diamond "" on the Wish You Were Here album have Part 1 & Part 2 . The song is so long with instrumental work that it open and closes the album . There are many more examples of pure instrumental work on their albums . So to those who write reviews and are complaining you must not know very much about Pink Floyd . David Gilmour has announced that Pink Floyd will not be touring with The Endless River . The reason given is that it would n't make sense to tour without Rick Wright who passed away in 2008 .

A35OZD7M5FJLTQ,B00NPZI1ZS,-1,1,4,"This is not a Pink Floyd album in the traditional sense. Rather, it is a beautiful collection of instrumental pieces that gives a deep and personal insight into the final recording sessions of the band that came to be known as one of the greatest in the history of music.

The album is filled with gorgeous and haunting instrumentals that hearken back to other times. There are moments that feel fresh from classic Floyd albums, with Gilmour's stunning guitars calling to mind Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Run Like Hell, Another Brick in the Wall, and many other Floyd classics. Other shining moments remind the listener of Us and Them, Welcome to the Machine, One of these Days, and the list goes on. Yet none of it sounds derivative. This isn't an album of the boys trying to sound like old Pink Floyd. It's a collection of songs that shows the journey from the first days to the final days. It's an epic journey indeed.

This isn't always a cohesive listen, and it certainly won't fall into the same canon of music as Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, or Wish You Were Here. But it does have its place on every Floyd fan's shelf.

Sure, they could have released this as a bonus disc with a reissue of Division Bell. But then it would've been a lost piece of music rather than the final step in a long and storied journey.

The album certainly has flaws. Having multiple songs that seem like demos of ""Keep Talking"" is a bit excessive. Of course, the biggest misstep of all is the final track, the only one with vocals. ""Louder than Words"" feels like a Division Bell b-side (the kind you are glad didn't make it onto Division Bell). It's completely unnecessary and serves as a final reminder that this isn't the real Pink Floyd.

But the rest of the album contains a lot of that old Pink Floyd magic, unleashed for a final time before we all sail off to somewhere better.","This is not a Pink Floyd album in the traditional sense .

A1Y2R2TOJJEOE3,B00NPZI1ZS,-1,1,4,"Like others have said, if you go into this album with an open mind, and not try to compare it with the Pink Floyd classics of the 70's, you will probably like it.  If you liked ""The Division Bell"", and particularly, the instrumentals on that album (""Marooned"" and ""Cluster One"") then you'll probably like this even more.  You don't get a lot of David Gilmour vocals here, but you do get a lot of his signature guitar playing, and that's where this album really shines.

This isn't a perfect album. 9 of the 18 tracks are less than 2 minutes and seem like mere sketches of something that could have been great if they had been developed into full songs with vocals.  The best songs here are the longer ones.  ""It's What We Do"", ""Sum"", and ""Talkin' Hawkin'"" are highlights, and ""Louder Than Words"" (the only song with vocals) is a nice way to end the album.

As for the bonus material on the blu-ray disc, it's not particularly interesting, or something I'd likely revisit a lot.  A lot of black and white footage of PF jamming in the studio, interspersed with old photos.  No behind the scenes documentary or interviews with Gilmour or Mason about the making of the album.  Although there is one song on the audio section called ""Nervana"" which is really good and really rocks out.  I'm not sure why this wasn't put on the album.

So overall, a very good Floyd album, though definitely not a classic.  It would have been nice to have more Gilmour vocals, but any Floyd in 2014 is better than none.","Like others have said , if you go into this album with an open mind , and not try to compare it with the Pink Floyd classics of the 70 's , you will probably like it .

A3H7DVRC2QLH6S,B00NPZI1ZS,-1,1,4,"If this is indeed the last Pink Floyd release of new (sort of) music, then Gilmour and Mason have gone out in style. It's 98% instrumental, and reminiscent of their very early work in movie soundtracks and extended instrumental breaks in classic songs such as Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Echoes. The music is leftover from the Division Bell sessions with more recent overdubs.

I hesitate to call this ambient music because ambient music doesn't hold my attention like this does. It's interesting ambient music that ebbs and flows enough to catch your ear. It's certainly not for the casual PF fan. If The Wall is all you know about Pink Floyd, you probably won't like this. But if you are familiar with PF's output between the Syd Barrett era and Dark Side Of The Moon, you will certainly understand.  Even the song titles harken back to an earlier time. The songs are titled as ""sides"" like the sides of a vinyl LP, with names for individual movements.

The only True vocals are found on the final movement, Louder Than Words. The title itself sums up the entire album. The lyrics were written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson. While it will never be regarded as an essential Floyd cut, thematically it sums up the album quite well.

Totally unexpected, but once you hear it, it's a fitting tribute to the late Richard Wright and a fitting end to Pink Floyd.","If this is indeed the last Pink Floyd release of new ( sort of ) music , then Gilmour and Mason have gone out in style .

AXOO7BPM22BDO,B00NPZI1ZS,1,-1,3,"Odd that an album said to be based upon unused Division Bell recordings sounds more like stuff from Momentary Lapse of Reason , The Final Cut and Wish You Were Here than anything.  Theres even snatches of Dark Side of the Moon in here.  Billed as a tribute to the late Richard Wright, its an ambient, almost New Age instrumental soundscape ranging from upbeat to melancholy to morose.  A lot of the cues will definitely remind you of the band in all their glory while (too many) others will leave you wondering who wrote this stuff and is this really even a Pink Floyd album.  While its undeniable that Wrights keyboard, Masons drumming and Gilmours guitar are what made their signature sound its been the lack of Waters lyrics, as well as his drive and vision, that helped shape and define them.  And now, as with the previous two albums, its that lack that still hampers them.  Its also very brief; almost half the joints clock in at under two minutes.

The cd has almost all the tracks playing continuously- another classic Floyd technique- giving them all that continuous thread weve come to know and love; easy to do on an ambient cd.  The opening strains Side Ones first track, Things Left Unsaid, invokes memories of Shine On You Crazy Diamond; the synths sounding like Wright re-visited certain themes and ideas from those sessions.  It continues on into the next cut, Its What We Do; in fact, itd be hard to argue that IWWD isn't simply a revised version of Shine On- its almost a mirror image, right down to Gilmours unmistakable stylings.  Ebb and Flow is musically as good as anything theyve done, mainly because its another throwback- this time to One of These Days.  You starting to notice a pattern yet?

Side Twos Skins does feature some pretty good stuff from Mason as a showcase for his drumming and its a pretty good listen, albeit a short one.  Unsung is hauntingly engaging but way, way too short.  Anisina can be best described as Terminal Frost meets The Great Gig in the Sky.

Side Three kicks off with The Lost Art of Conversation/On Noodle Street- the bassline of the latter bringing that New Age Jazz feel back again.  Night Light takes you right back to Signs of Life from the Momentary Lapse album.  The first single off the cd- Allons-Y Pt1, as well as Allons-Y Pt2, which is simply a reprise- can be summed in three words: Run Like Hell.  Listen to it and tell me Im wrong.  Talkin Hawkin is only notable for the soundbytes that physicist Stephen Hawking was asked to lend to the recording.

Side Four begins with Calling, a mid-tempo piece thats nice to listen to.  Eyes to Pearls is another pretty good one in the post-Waters vein.  The lone song and finale- Louder Than Words- is Gilmours attempt to capsulize the bands turbulent history to comprise their final bow, but typically the lyrics are too formulaic and measured, forced to fit into his limited, bare bones style.

The Deluxe Edition kind of gives away how lacking this effort is.  TBS9 and TBS14, the first two, flow into a 70s vibe featuring Wrights organ music.  The truly final cut, Nervana, sends the band out with a flourish as Gilmour flexes his muscles with some impressively rousing riffs, really making you feel it right up until it starts the fade out and you realize that this truly is the end.

Overall, as the coda of a legendary band, Endless River falls short of the mark.  Sorry to say that Pink Floyd has gone gently into that good night.  Roger, I wish you were there.","Odd that an album said to be based upon unused Division Bell recordings sounds more like stuff from Momentary Lapse of Reason , The Final Cut and Wish You Were Here than anything .

The rapper and part time producer, who has been buzzing since his mixtape cascade began in 2010, seems to have his mind in the right place for Under Pressure, his studio debut. Executive produced by No ID and released by Def Jam and Visionary Music Group, Under Pressure boasts busy, luscious beats and a matured Logic confronting his rough past with a bright outlook on life. Logic starts the album with this positive tone and then delves into family stories and gets ambitious in the ""Soul Food"" two-parter. He covers a variety of topics throughout (girls, crime, movies, crew love, karma, etc.), but the most prominent and reoccurring of them include Logic's transition from a troubled, aimless childhood to mind- blowing music stardom and how it affects him and his family. Under Pressure's production as a whole captures several emotions and vibes, and it definitely has No ID's ambient beat making influence. A diverse array of producers including Visionary's 6ix and Logic himself supply rich electronic instruments and quick repeating hoots on more than one song. Logic proves himself a flavorful emcee, rapping at different speeds and cadences with a varying rhyme structure and awesome energy. He demonstrates multiple dimensions of creativity on tracks like ""Nikki,"" about a specific type of chemical dependency, and the title track ""Under Pressure,"" where he raps in the first person as his sister then father. The regular version of the album contains no guests but features Childish Gambino and Big Sean on two deluxe version bonus cuts. In the 12th track, ""Till The End,"" Logic recaps his rocky experiences in the music business and life in general but stays committed to keeping an optimistic attitude going forward. It is a fitting close to the album, where Logic shares his feelings and conveys again his project's chief mood.

Once you build up a tolerance for the harshness of the sounds, a tone emerges that is compelling and entirely appropriate to the film. It manages to be simultaneously serene and deeply upsetting, and that can't be an easy thing for a composer to do. As an isolated soundtrack listen, it is thus an acquired taste that might well be worth trying to acquire for a soundtrack listener or a fan of the composers' other works.","I 've listened to some of it before , but I would not classify myself as an industrial music person .

I do not think she will be a one album wonder by any means but I think she needs to be really pushed to write some more riveting music and leave the retro sound behind.

I could not listen to the album every day but once in a while it provides a good happiness boast . I am more interested to see what Trainor does as a follow up to this album . I do not think she will be a one album wonder by any means but I think she needs to be really pushed to write some more riveting music and leave the retro sound behind . Maybe she needs to seek out KatyPerry 's management and see how , besides hard work , did she get out of under a possible career killer one hit like "" I Kissed A Girl "" to create the career she is enjoying currently ."

Second, as per what I agree with what some online commenters said, you cannot compare these two women, even though the song title is different, because certain lyrics of the song were changed to make the song acceptable for television viewing. Also, the songs are based on two completely different themes which slightly change the meanings of Gods and Monsters for each singer.

A1SQJ5YT7T7SE9,B00PAARJTA,1,-1,3,"After many delays in production, Miami native, Kat Dahlia finally releases her debut effort My Garden. After many one-off releases (Gangsta, Clocks and Firemen) over the course of two years, Dahlia seeks to impress with the likes of a stockpile of Rihanna-ish mockeries and Jill Scott knockoffs. The songs navigate through a garden of Rap, Salsa, Jazz and R&B. Unfortunately, it doesnt always make for a tasty audiophile salad. Thats not to say that My Garden is without its moments of brilliance. On the contrary, as the album opener My Garden as well as track 2 & 3 Gangsta and Crazy are worthy ear-catchers. Walk on Water is pleasing but my money is on Lava for the most memorable track on the album. Lyrically, its the most honest and passionate offering of the 11 tracks.

I feel that this album had the potential to be greater than its outcome. In a day and age where being derivative seems to be a good enough formula, I would much rather hear a unique and bold statement coming from a young artist such as this. Surely, though, this album has enough legs to infiltrate many a dorm room and hair salon throughout the summer of 2015, but Im not sure Kat Dahlia will become a household name just yet. Perhaps, provided that the powers to be don't dispose of her too hastily, she can develop into a truly fine artist with her own unique flag to plant in front of us.","After many delays in production , Miami native , Kat Dahlia finally releases her debut effort My Garden .

A1HWMU2XORHEI4,B00PXAL2AE,1,-1,3,"I'll be honest, the only reason I listened to this album was because of Kevin Parker. I think Kevin Parker is a musical genius and can do no wrong, so if he's cool with Mark Ronson I suppose I am as well. As far as albums go where there's tons of different artists playing puppet to Mr. Ronson's puppet master Uptown Special isn't too bad. But if you're here for something deep, meaningful, and precious go look elsewhere.

So how does this work, anyways? Does Mark Ronson write these songs and bring in people he likes to sing on them? Does he arrange and let the singers write lyrics? I have no idea. Up until this album I thought Ronson was just some wunderkind producer. Amy Whinehouse's Back To Black was where my ears perked up to what Ronson was doing. I loved the retro sound he made. But looking back he's put out at least two other albums under his own name. Don't ask me what's on those, as I have no idea. Anyways, Uptown Special is 37 minutes of funkified pop and dance music with a couple excursions into territory that lifts the overall project into something other than radio hits.

The songs? Well apparently ""Uptown Funk"" with Bruno Mars is a hit. It sounds like a hit. Mars is a hell of a singer with the whole package; dance moves, style, and the vocal chops to back it all up. It's a catchy tune that will surely steal the retro funk crown from Pharrell's ""Happy"". In a year grandmas and great aunts will be singing ""Uptown funk you up"" at wedding receptions across these great lands. You heard it here first.

Elsewhere Stevie Wonder even makes an appearance. He plays his world famous harmonica and sings on ""Uptown's First Finale"" and his harp reappears for closer ""Crack in the Pearl, Pt. II"". ""Feel Right"" has rapper Mystical doing his best hip hop version of Joe Tex' ""I Gotcha"". It's a fun song that you'll have to turn down when listening to it on your work computer(I learned the hard way.) ""Crack In The Pearl"" is kinda atmospheric with some great vocals. ""In Case of Fire"" has some rock guitar going on with an almost Steely Dan smoothness to it.

But to my ears the highlights on this album are the tracks that have Tame Impala's Kevin Parker on vocal duties. ""Summer Breaking"" has a 60s vibe to it with the fuzzy guitar, then when Parker's vocals come in it becomes this 70s soft rock slow burner that shouldn't work but does. ""Daffodils"" sounds as much like a Tame Impala song as it does a Ronson joint. Wiggy synths and an almost ""Billie Jean"" rhythm, it ebbs and flows with some serious stoned indifference. It has the vibe of Lonerism B-side ""Beverly Laurel"". This song alone is worth the price of admission. ""Leaving Los Feliz"" is a fun song with a great beat and another great vocal melody courtesy of Mr. Kevin Parker. A full-on collaboration LP between Ronson and Parker would be a cool thing to see and hear.

Okay, so Uptown Special isn't going to change your world or blow your mind. It is, however, a fun and funky dance album filled with top notch production and a couple great rump shakin' tunes. Plus, Kevin Parker. Can't go wrong with that.","I 'll be honest , the only reason I listened to this album was because of Kevin Parker .

There are some songs worth their effort, while there are others that could be better overall for their time and their money. When Uptown Funk came out with Bruno Mars last year, Mark Ronson who produced for others like Duran Duran, really hit the jackpot in regards to having a massive hit, and a song that really sounded better than most of the jokes in music today. But for him to try and follow-up what he did with Bruno so well, has been more of a tough challenge in his heart. His second single with Mystikal on Feel Right, doesn't actually ignite as strongly as Uptown Funk did. It does follow more of that James Brown-style beat with his rapping doesn't follow in strong strides. It isn't a bad song, just not completely over the top in regards to real rhythm. It is a decent follow-up for Mark's Uptown Special album, but just could've been better.

A366S12KCZ280V,B00Q7SKT28,1,-1,3,"In his 50+ year career Dylan has gone through many different styles of music. Of course everyone remembers Dylan starting out as a folk singer. From there his career when electric then country then religious and most recent years bluesy and even Christmas music. With the most recent release however we find Dylan as a crooner singing pop standards. Not a musical direction you would expect Bob to make but then again he had done that a few times in the past so really nothing new here. The difference is the style of music he chose this time around to sing. I don't think most of us Dylan fans expected this.

And what do I think of this album? I really don't know. I have heard ""Shadows In The Night"" a few times now and I am still not sure what I think, if I like this or not. Let me do say this is not a bad album by any means. But at the same time this album hasn't wowed me the way some of his other recent albums like ""Time Out Of Mind"" or ""Modern Times"" has. Bob is in good voice here but even so one problem I have with these songs is that his voice doesn't sound right for this kind of music. His voice was perfect for the kinds of songs he was singing on those two recent albums I previously mentioned but it sounds kind of out of place here. Still there are moments to this record where Bob, the music and the arraingments come together briefly making for a pleasant experience. He does have a feel for the songs being performed. There are moments too though where while Bob hits the notes it almost seems like a struggle for him to hit it.

This is definitely a record where I can't recommend one way or another if you should get it. You will have to get ""Shadows In The Night"" and listen for yourself and see what you think. What reviews I have read is pretty mixed between people loving it or hating it. You will have to decide for yourself on this one.","In his 50 + year career Dylan has gone through many different styles of music . Of course everyone remembers Dylan starting out as a folk singer .

In fact the only songs that I've heard of are ""Lucky old sun"" which Johnny Cash & Brian Wilson covered & ""What'll I do"" that's used for the theme tune to the British Sitcom Birds of a feather (!).
So an admirable sentiment for Dylan to try & introduce Sinatra music to a new audience, but this is slight if enjoyable collections of songs from a artist who still has to energy & appetite to continually push his self & surprise his listeners.","I always find it quite frustrating when a renowned singer / songwriter releases a covers record , because you know that it going to be a least another year before you get a proper studio album & lets face it , Dylan properly has n't many more records in him .

A35OZD7M5FJLTQ,B00QR70Q2W,-1,1,4,"After 8 years, Modest Mouse is finally back, and this album should not disappoint you, as long as you give it a fair chance. Lets start by stating the obvious: this is not Lonesome Crowded West. Nor is it The Moon and Antarctica. However, its still a solid body of work with some standout Modest Mouse tracks.

The album starts off strong, building from the slow Strangers to Ourselves into the driving Lampshades On Fire and Sh*t in Your Cut, all three of which are very good songs. Then, we have the unfortunate thing that is track 4: on first listen, Pistol might seem like one of the worst songs ever. However, it grows on you, reminiscent of My Morning Jackets Highly Suspicious, a song that seems so bad until you realize its actually embarrassingly good (but still in a bad way).

It doesnt take long for the band to recover. Track 6, The Ground Walks, with Time in a Box, is an instant classic, the type of energetic, fist-pumping, foot-pounding song that makes Modest Mouse so great.

From there, the album remains pretty solid until the complete throwaway track God is an Indian Why they decided to include this on the album is beyond me. After 8 years, I guess anything goes. But a lousy 1-minute track isn't enough to ruin a good album.

Overall, theres plenty of good stuff on this record. Yes, it feels a little bloated at times, and its by no means their best. Some of these riffs feel recycled, and it doesnt cover much new territory. But this is still one mighty mouse that packs a lot of punch.","After 8 years , Modest Mouse is finally back , and this album should not disappoint you , as long as you give it a fair chance .

A3QPA2Y4CDZUAH,B00QVZ1VXI,-1,1,4,"OK, I never saw a record get such divided reviews in the media, I swear.  Only 2 stars in Rolling Stone, People and the Daily News, a B- in Newsday, a B+ in EW.  I collect this band, so I am buying it regardless of what I read, the Target edition with nthe 4 bonus tracks, but one comment that cut through was that the title of the record is an apt description of the music inside...all fog, neon and overblown bombastic bluster but no substance in the songs themselves, and that they have no sense of humour, that they take themselves WAY too seriously, that what they try to communicate through their songs, they have a long way to go, maturity-wise....AND that they don't have a sense of identity with this record, trying on many different styles, many within the same song...for me, that comes across as experimentation...they should WANT to try different things, it's how they grow.

Do you agree with that comment??  I sorta do, but those things are not what attracts me to ID's music...for me, it's their way with cool pop hooks and tuneful vocals, mixed in with a sense of atmosphere and a unique mix of synthpop, arena rock and alt-folk, with layers upon layers of vocals and big drums...I don't know, I find the music unique and pretty cool, and maybe these writers (I write too), their taste is not along the lines of this band, and they seem to have preconceived notions on what this record is like BEFORE they put it on, and they go through each song to see if it matches what they thought it would be...and analyze it TOO closely, tearing them apart, not allowing themselves to enjoy it in any way.

Funny thing is...I am an atheist, I think all religion is bogus and mind control tactics...and these guys all come from a Mormon LDS background, like the Killers do, and for me, THAT ""religion"" is the biggest hoax of all...with Prophet Joseph Smith thinking he was born from aliens...BUT I read that this record's lyrics consists of lead singer Dan Reynolds coming to grips with these issues and starting to feel the same way, and these doubts contributed to how he met his wife, which is pretty cool...but these critical writers think Dan took himself too seriously, too grimly...nothing fun or anything to laugh about...in the vein of U2...preachy Bono...but I disagree...it's one thing to preach and impose...another to doubt and express frustration that the values and ideals he was raised with were all bullcrap...that's a reason to be angry, wasting your life on these things.

Anyhoo, ""I Bet Your Life"" is a great song...kinda Mumford & Sons'ish but with an atmospheric twist, and sampling the others, good to great, and the song they performed in the Target commercial was good too...when I buy the Target version, I will sit with it straight through and update my review...

For now, 4 stars...","OK , I never saw a record get such divided reviews in the media , I swear . Only 2 stars in Rolling Stone , People and the Daily News , a B- in Newsday , a B+ in EW .

AVV5JGLBZERCM,B00QWA82QG,1,-1,3,"Picking up where The Soul Tape 3's ""Young OG"" left off, Fabolous's sixth studio album, The Young OG Project, which is obviously named after that song, unveils a lot more of Fab's classic, punchline-driven wit and clever lyricism, as he discusses navigating life's hurdles and especially the round-about, fair-weather individuals met along the way. Fab's rap style is still very much there and intact, and much emphasis is placed on the man's personal feelings and experiences. A few moments spread positive messages, namely reaching high, moving on and healthy fathering (""Young OG II""), and even when Fabolous is critical and distrustful of ne'er-do-wells and his detractors, he has a great sense of karma, doling out just deserts, rarely sounding cruel, cold or cynical. His tried and True capo-style comes out in lines about bad b*tches, posh fashion, the ""gun shop"" and his ""shooters,"" but he has left out the dope-dealing aspects, probably for the better. Appropriate for the season, ""Ball Drop"" celebrates starting the new year afresh by severing toxic relationships. Fab's intentions for this album were ""90s inspired and themed"" and nothing exemplifies the influence more than all the famous hip hop samples, quotes, name-drops and sound bites tossed in the mix. They have a strong New York-hip hop flavor to them and pay homage to Jay-Z, Nas and the Notorious B.I.G. especially. The music production as a whole, which is supplied by a melange of great producers, is cool and chill but even Fabolous can't escape the ubiquitous drill beat of modern-age trap. Truth be told, from the right vantage point, they're actually quite tasteful. Aside from Fabolous, The Young OG Project features some talented, new rappers and singers instead of veteran artists from Fab's heyday, giving it a fresh, up to date feel (no disrespect to the rap game's vets). Young OG may not be Loso's Way 2, but it's traditional Fabolous with a contemporary twist. It has all the fabulous musical style, quality lyricism and urban, street flourishes that fans have come to expect from the Brooklyn emcee.","Picking up where The Soul Tape 3 's "" Young OG "" left off , Fabolous 's sixth studio album , The Young OG Project , which is obviously named after that song , unveils a lot more of Fab 's classic , punchline - driven wit and clever lyricism , as he discusses navigating life 's hurdles and especially the round - about , fair - weather individuals met along the way .

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B00QXY17RC,1,-1,3,"At this point you can't pretend that you bought a Roger Waters' album without knowing what to expect. You know he's going to critically examine war, politics, politicians, policies, and societal ills. This is something he has been doing in earnest since 1973's ""Dark Side of the Moon"". Same goes for making 'concept' albums, which ""Is This the Life We Really Want?"" (ITTLWRW) clearly is.

So, does 73 year old Waters have something fresh and new to say? No, but he is one of only a handful of musicians willing to continually comment on the current state of affairs, and for that, he immediately earns two stars. The trouble with Waters solo work is that it has lacked the musicianship from the rest of the Pink Floyd camp. Someone once said that Roger Waters was Pink Floyd's conscience, it's vision, it's lyrical poetry, whilst Gilmour, Wright and Mason were the architects, sound designers, and heart behind Waters' words. Nowhere is that more apparent that on ITTLWRW--the lyrics are spot on, but musically....well....the album is just so-so. Musically, there are no inspired moments, no innovative curves, no surprises sonically. So, after several listens, the music isn't all that memorable while what Waters is talking about resonates long after the music ends.

I'm not entirely certain as to why Waters felt the need after 25 years of silence to comment once more on current affairs. He pretty much addressed everything that needed addressing with 1992's ""Amused to Death"", or 1979's ""The Wall"" or 1977's ""Animals"". I want to be extremely clear here--I side with Waters' point of view, but that point of view isn't as effectively showcased with the music presented on ITTLWRW. I don't mind at all that Waters is a realist, a cynic, a pessimist, or what you will. I side with that view. He just should have brought the music to go with it this time, and he didn't. For that, I can't give this work five stars, or even four stars. It falls somewhere between three and three and a half stars for me.

That being said, I have to say that the final trilogy of songs here are some of Waters' most moving of his career--""Wait for Her"", ""Oceans Apart"", and ""A Part of Me Died"". Those, along with ""Broken Bones"" are my favorites here. They just aren't enough to push this album above three stars.

This very well could be the first and last time I write a critique on Roger Waters and/or Pink Floyd as it seems there may be nothing that follows in the future. I am not a big David Gilmour solo work fan, and so I will take this final opportunity to compare this current work with Roger Waters' and Pink Floyd's previous works.

A1Y2R2TOJJEOE3,B00QXY17RC,-1,1,4,"It goes without saying that Roger Waters is a lyrical genius, and his latest work is no exception.  This is one of those albums that you really need to sit down with the lyrics and actually pay attention to what is being said.  It doesn't really work as simple background music while you're driving to work.  Much like ""Amused to Death"", Waters has nothing positive to say about our political leaders and the military industrial machine.  He clearly despises Trump, and it comes out numerous times throughout the album, including quotes from the orange fool himself.  ""Picture That"" is particularly vitriolic, as is the title track.

Unfortunately, as great as the lyrics are, the music is rather mediocre.  Pink Floyd fans will notice that ""Deja Vu"" has elements of ""Mother.""  ""Picture That"" sounds a lot like ""Sheep"" and ""Smell the Roses"" is basically a ""Have a Cigar"" rewrite.  Those are some of the highlights here.  What's really lacking though is the guitar punch of previous albums.  ""The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking"" had Eric Clapton and ""Amused to Death"" had Jeff Beck.  Not only does this album not have a great guitar player, it doesn't feature any memorable solos.  Many of the songs are acoustic with pretty simple arrangements.

If you're a Pink Floyd fan and are expecting another ""Dark Side"" or ""Wish You Were Here,"" you're going to be disappointed.  I'd recommend you get David Gilmour's last album instead.  If you loved ""The Final Cut"", though, you'll probably dig this.","It goes without saying that Roger Waters is a lyrical genius , and his latest work is no exception .

This isn't going to blow away many fans, and it's been done before in many ways. Bjork is one of the more original artists for sure. You can put a period after that. But let's not act like she makes all the music and plays all the instruments. Her team is pretty damn good at making something from not much.

Vulnicura offers almost nothing new, but rekindles parts and pieces of the last couple albums, even going back to the Homogenic era for instrumentation. But you will still hear Vespertine-like pieces mixed in even with some of the Medulla sound that made that album so creatively diverse. It comes together fairly well on many of the songs. Others just sound like random relationship problems put to disc with quality strings, and do not excite me or enliven my spirit in the slightest.

It's treading water long since refolded into various other more interesting works. This is just not as essential as anything going backwards from Medulla to Homogenic. The strings and instrumentation are good even gorgeous at times. The catatonic beats and collage atmosphere combined with the siren-like background singing has been done before and with more cohesion.

I like the lyrics in places. I also get tired of hearing ""I"" so much in these songs, even if it is a break-up album. I'm sorry Bjork but I'm not always interested in your personal life. I don't hate the album at all. But it's simply not memorable. This is an album that was put out to satisfy emotional demands coming directly from the artist. It's definitely something to hear once or twice, but beyond that I have no idea how to recommend it when there are 8 or so other better works by the same artist, a couple of which have many of the same characteristics.","This is definitely a decent album .

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B00SI9614O,1,-1,3,"I get that Bjork is a unique, original innovator, unlike most in the business. BUT, I do believe she is an acquired taste. To me, her earlier solo work like 1993's ""Debut"", 1995's ""Post"" and 1997's ""Homogenic"" was more accessible, and more straightforward. Until now. ""Vulnicura"" chronicles the dissolution of her marriage and her nuclear family unit. She sets a tone on the album that is somber and reflective. It's some of her best writing.

But, the music...well, an acquired taste, right? There are nine tracks here, but seven of them are over six minutes, with one being ten minutes and two eight minutes. I believe that if you are going to make long songs you should make them interesting. I get that Bjork made meditative works here, but I'd rather reach for my best progressive rockers like Yes, ELP, Genesis or King Crimson. Some of the tracks here on ""Vulnicura"" over-stay their welcome such as ""Lionsong"", ""Family"", ""Atom Dance"" and ""Mouth Mantra"".

I guess, in this case, I would just like the old Bjork back. The woman who was experimental AND exciting. That seems long gone in her music now. There'll be no ""Big Time Sensuality"" any time soon, or ""I Miss You"" or ""It's Oh So Quiet"". I'd like Bjork to do an upbeat album sometime in the near future. I know she has at least one left. For the past decade she has been rather maudlin and morose, generally speaking.

I got the digipak version. The artwork is excellent, but that's to be expected, isn't?

A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B00SYTFYP0,1,-1,3,"Having read other people's reviews on this latest live album from Van Halen, I feel like putting in my 2 cents' worth as well.  I've been following all of VH's records (including the solo albums by David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, respectively) since 1997, and they have gotten better over time.  I desperately wanted to get my hands on any VH album that was available -- whether by vinyl, cassette, or CD.

With the frequent personnel changes (i.e. Roth, Hagar, Cherone, then Roth again, then Wolfgang replacing Michael Anthony), it's a wonder how VH has stayed intact for so long.  But I have to give Eddie Van Halen and brother Alex for STILL having the energy of teenagers to pull off such awe-inspiring, amazing guitar/drum solos.  It really shows on each song.

As for Roth, he's basically off-key and off-balance, ruining many of the songs that make the band famous in the first place (""Unchained"", ""Everybody Wants Some!!"", ""I'll Wait"", ""Romeo Delight""); however, I do give him an A+ for effort and still wanting to rock -- even now in his 60's.  Which is why it saddens me so much that his hot hell yelps, screaming banshee wails, and top octave range are all but GONE.  Still, it doesn't change how I feel about him as an overall individual; he deserves many accolades for the powerhouse voice that he USED to have.

Eddie, on the other hand, went through a very painful divorce with Valerie Bertinelli, dealt with hand surgery, and fired Michael Anthony because the (alleged) reason was that Michael was working with Hagar in his supergroup, Chickenfoot.  Enter, Eddie's son -- Wolfgang Van Halen.  Wolf pulls off all of the moves that Michael had, nearly note for note; you can clearly hear it when he battles it out alongside Eddie's solos and Alex's drums on ""Hot For Teacher"", ""Ice Cream Man"" and ""You Really Got Me.""  Wolf has DEFINITELY got a huge, promising musical career ahead of him.  :)

Of course, Eddie HIMSELF steals the show!!  For anyone that has loved hearing his solos for the past 4 decades, you won't be disappointed here.  The songs where he stands out the most are ""And The Cradle Will Rock..."", ""Panama"", ""Tattoo"", ""Mean Street"", and ""Jump.""  But the HUGE kicker is ""Eruption"" when he starts out with his usual wailing, ear-shattering solo (and deftly battling it out with Alex's fast and furious drumming) before he segues into 1983's ""Cathedral"" from the Diver Down album, then back to ""Eruption"" once again.  He'll definitely go down in history as one of the greatest guitar gods of the 20th/21st century, giving Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton a run for their money.  :)

So where does VH go from here??  Whom really knows, but since I am still a huge superfan of ALL 4 members (PLUS Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony), I'm still going back to hearing those early records.","Having read other people 's reviews on this latest live album from Van Halen , I feel like putting in my 2 cents ' worth as well . I 've been following all of VH 's records ( including the solo albums by David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar , respectively ) since 1997 , and they have gotten better over time . I desperately wanted to get my hands on any VH album that was available -- whether by vinyl , cassette , or CD . With the frequent personnel changes ( i.e. Roth , Hagar , Cherone , then Roth again , then Wolfgang replacing Michael Anthony ) , it 's a wonder how VH has stayed intact for so long . But I have to give Eddie Van Halen and brother Alex for STILL having the energy of teenagers to pull off such awe - inspiring , amazing guitar / drum solos . It really shows on each song . As for Roth , he 's basically off - key and off - balance , ruining many of the songs that make the band famous in the first place ( "" Unchained "" , "" Everybody Wants Some ! ! "" , "" I 'll Wait "" , "" Romeo Delight "" ) ; however , I do give him an A+ for effort and still wanting to rock -- even now in his 60 's . Which is why it saddens me so much that his hot hell yelps , screaming banshee wails , and top octave range are all but GONE . Still , it does n't change how I feel about him as an overall individual ; he deserves many accolades for the powerhouse voice that he USED to have . Eddie , on the other hand , went through a very painful divorce with Valerie Bertinelli , dealt with hand surgery , and fired Michael Anthony because the ( alleged ) reason was that Michael was working with Hagar in his supergroup , Chickenfoot .

He 'll definitely go down in history as one of the greatest guitar gods of the 20th/21st century , giving Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton a run for their money . :)

A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B00SYTFYP0,1,-1,3,"It came especially late but alas we finally have a live Van Halen album featuring David Lee Roth. Tokyo Dome ln Concert was recorded on March 22 2013 during VH's last tour. It's not the band's first live album as there has been a live Van Hagar release but it's the first with Diamond Dave which fans had been asking for decades now. This lineup features the Van Halen brothers (of course) Alex and Eddie with DLR and Wolfgang Van Halen au lieu of original bassist Michael Anthony. One has to ask why a live album at this point late in their career but it's better late than never l suppose. Van Halen's classic lineup and first six albums with DLR from 1978-84 have touched and inspired generations. It's all-time classic rock and there are plenty of masterpieces and classics to be found. The band knows this too as they perform the songs that everyone wants to hear from those six albums along with a few from the current lineup's 2012 output A Different Kind of Truth.

The setlist is incredible! I mean seriously look at it ( They open with Unchained) and tell me that it's not damn well near perfect. All the hits are there along with favourites and that's one of the album's strengths and main appeal. I don't think l would've taken anything out. I wouldn't have added much more either. Anyone who complains is just nitpicking. I would've wanted to see ""You And Your Blues"" from ADKOT instead of ""Chinatown"" but that's about as picky as l can be. Everything l could've asked for is here. Two discs and 25 songs (one is a drum solo) at this price is excellent. Those things l can't complain about.

Now let's address the elephant in the room. Yeah THAT one! Roth's singing. Sometimes he completely leaves out lines, his timing is off or at the very last second, and occasionally he'll almost talk instead of singing. To his credit he's getting up there in age and moves a lot during live performances, it's not getting any easier for him and l know criticism of his voice will be harsh towards this release. I'm trying not to be too harsh while reaming objective. Granted he doesn't sound great and there some not so good moments but Diamond Dave was never truly an amazing singer to begin with. Less so live. He was always known to be the charismatic and energetic frontman and no one could touch him. Ons of my favourite moments has Dave being Dave during the beginning of ""Pretty Woman"" where he goes : ""l know that song!  *pause* I know that song! *pause* l f****** love that song!"". People have mixed feelings to say the least about Wolfgang replacing Michael Anthony. I think it hurts them not to have Anthony around because his backing vocals were truly the band's secret weapon and they improved Dave's overall sound, something Wolfgang simply cannot do (but he does sound a little better now) but he does get the job done on the bass guitar. The back vocals are not awful and they try their best (You Really Got Me is a good effort) but they could have used Anthony's presence. Alex Van Halen has lost nothing with the years and plays incredible and the ""Me & You"" piece is amazing. Eddie does what he does best, and surprises us at times adding things here and there being the player we know he is. I can't say that they really live up to their past glory, but very few bands can and at the end of the day it's a fun performance.

The sound is very raw and bare-bones, it doesn't sound like it was overdubbed at all which is one of Tokyo Dome's best qualities. I think they were going for a bit of a bootleg sound, but not too much as clearly this exceeds a bootleg but VH wanted a real raw, gritty and heavy feel. Now the audience is essentially nowhere to be found. I own lots of live albums and this has got to be one of the quietest crowds l've heard for VH  (and a rock concert for that matter). I can only assume they turned them down during the mixing perhaps.

On a side note I think it was a missed opportunity to film the show and have it released as a CD/DVD package, l think it would have helped gather even more interest in the band and Tokyo Dome. I'm just glad we finally have some new VH out and a live one with Dave.

Is it perfect? No. Does it have it's flaws? Yes. Could it have been more? Well l think if you don't expect too much out out of Van Halen you will find much to enjoy. The guys are a little older, Dave's voice has aged and it's 3/4 of the classic lineup but they can still deliver a good performance and entertain you. Some will completely rip on Dave's voice and l get it, it's the main reason l'm giving Tokyo Dome 3 stars. It does make you long for a proper live release from the early 80's. The musicianship though, is very good and the setlist incredible.","It came especially late but alas we finally have a live Van Halen album featuring David Lee Roth .

But I digress...

Back in 2009 when Passion Pit (which is essentially 28 year old Michael Angelakos) released their debut, ""Manners"", they were a blast from my past. You see, I grew up with New Wave/Dance music from the 1980's, and Passion Pit is definitely a child born from that era (heck, Michael Angelakos was born in 1987). ""Manners"" remains the best album from Passion Pit. There has been something missing ever since then. I couldn't tell you what it is exactly, but 2012's ""Gossamer"" was just slightly less exuberant, and now 2015's ""Kindred"" is just slightly less than ""Gossamer"".

At first listen, ""Kindred"" hits you like an excited preschooler, running up to you, grabbing your attention, keeping you dazed as you try and figure out what they're saying to you. Then, as you begin to relax, and re-listen to ""Kindred"", the music starts to slightly annoy. I don't know if it's the high pitched vocals or the overzealous keyboard swaths throughout the album.

There are some good songs here like ""Lifted Up (1985)"", ""All I Want"", ""Five Foot Ten (I)"", and ""Until We Can't (Let's Go)"". There are other tracks that, after repeatedly listening, just become bothersome like ""Whole Life Story"", ""Where The Sky Hangs"" (talk about 80's sounding!), ""Dancing On The Grave"", ""Looks Like Rain"" and ""My Brother Taught Me How To Swim"". By far, the most obnoxious track here (and it really didn't need to be here) is ""Five Foot Ten (II)"". That is a quintessentially annoying track that you should just skip over.

I get the feeling that Michael Angelakos really put a large portion of himself into these songs, not just from a musician's standpoint, or a producer's standpoint, but from a writer's standpoint. One look over the lyrics and you can tell they're personal (not general). The problem with ""Kindred"" is, to make a mental health analogy, like being with someone who is in the manic state of bipolar disorder--it's all high energy and ebullience, and removed from the sobriety of reality. Like a party without end (but with semi-serious lyrics--because, let's face it, I've heard personal music, and artists such as Tori Amos, John Mellencamp, Fiona Apple, and even Madonna, write very personal songs that somehow hold up better than what you will find on ""Kindred"". There's a lot of relationship songs and mental health songs, but they don't quite reach a broader audience.

All this being said, Passion Pit is surely a band with a great deal of potential. After three albums, the focus should be on song craft, and making an album that is rock solid, with a variety of sounds. I understand Passion Pit is classified as ""Indietronica"", what ever the hell that means, but even working within the confines of that musical label you can still make a landmark recording (just look at ""The Downward Spiral"", ""Touch"", ""Boomerang"", ""Chorus"", ""Technique"", ""Dream Into Action"", ""The Flat Earth"", ""Heartbeat City"", ""Kick"", ""Man Of Colours"", ""Disintegration"" and ""Violator"". All done with a heavy use of electronics, if not entirely electronic albums.

Here's how ""Kindred"" compares to Passion Pit's previous works:

A184D2E4QAM69B,B00TKKOD72,1,-1,3,"I first saw MMJ on Austin City Limits, doing mostly stuff from ""Z"", and I thought it was just outstanding. Like many of their fans, I'm a big fan of Alt-Country, but am always looking for something new - a different twist - so I've continued to follow this group. I'm not too taken with their current direction, one that seems very commercial, void of the organic, and of little substance. Still, I like the group and have faith they're very talented folks, willing to take chances, and unwilling to get stale and predictable.

As this record starts out, I sense I'm hearing a theme song from a Disney movie, with the cheery little tune and message in ""Believe"". Still, the overall tone of this album is pleasant to listen to, and as other reviewers have noted, it is cohesive and flows nicely. I'll be listening to it despite my reservations about its' place in the MMJ catalog. I'm just hoping this is musical adventure that  is going to evolve into something more interesting. Otherwise, I think MMJ may as well resign themselves to creating soundtracks for Disney - cute and bubbly.

I'll remain a big fan of much of their previous work, and expect further evolution on the part of the band. No doubt there are many more adventures to share from a band so talented.","I first saw MMJ on Austin City Limits , doing mostly stuff from "" Z "" , and I thought it was just outstanding .

A2TX79GR278JMA,B00TKKOD72,1,-1,3,"3.5 Stars...decent but didn't knock my socks off.

My Morning Jacket's album At Dawn quickly became a favorite for me when I bought it back around 2002.  At the time I was very much enamored with the so-called alt-country sound, artists like Wilco, Old 97s, Lucinda Williams, Whiskeytown, Steve Earle, etc. (I still love all those artists).  MMJ provided a unique spin on that loose genre, with an echoey style reminiscent of Daniel Lanois's production on albums by artists like Robbie Robertson and Emmylou Harris.  The rich texture of the sound is what brought me to the table, but the strength of the songs and feelings with which they were imbued is what made me stay.  To this day At Dawn is one of my favorites, as is the follow-up album It Still Moves.  I remember seeing MMJ perform around this period, when they were making peanut butter sandwiches for the audience (or at least those in the front row) and giving away free concert tickets with album purchase at the local indie record store (wow things have changed).  They had fire and grit, clearly ready for a bigger stage than they were on.

So here I am four albums later (and quite a bit older) listening to The Waterfall.  In the interim, MMJ has branched out a lot.  First came the very modern-sounding Z, which began to shed the grain-silo-alt-countryish sound for something more slick and progressive.  I really liked that album, perhaps not as much as At Dawn but still quite a lot.  The songs were strong and anthemic, with the beautiful 10-minute sweeping epic called Dondante (at the time a concert staple) closing the album.  After that came Evil Urges, a bit of a schizophrenic effort which didn't fully cohere but nicely showcased the band's restless nature and refusal to be pigeonholed.  Again I didn't love it but I liked it quite a bit.  With the follow-up Circuital, MMJ moved away from the overt experimentalism of Evil Urges but kept searching for new sounds.  At the time it was released, I liked it about as much as Z.  However, the songs didn't really stick with me nearly as much over time.  By now we were clearly pretty far from the early days.

I had read some reviews for The Waterfall which touted the album as something of a return to the band's roots.  Given my inability to fully warm up to Circuital, I wasn't so sure.  But I gave it a chance.  To start with the positive, this one certainly has strong moments.  The catchy ""Compound Fracture"" is one of the best songs I have heard from this band, and ""Get To The Point"" is a clever song which sounds very connected to the band's roots.  ""Big Decisions"" is interesting and lyrically more challenging than much of the band's prior work as well, which opens up a new facet of their style.  I also found myself really enjoying the mystical ""Tropics (Erase Traces)"" quite a lot.  I think this is my favorite track on the album and for me successfully captures a lot of what makes MMJ great.  It's simply spellbinding.  However, the rest of the album just doesn't do it for me.  The opening track sounds like generic arena-ready anthem rock designed to appeal to the masses.  Beyond that there's just a lot of meandering mid-tempo experimentalism which to me isn't very interesting or memorable.  What's missing is the (Tennessee) fire and grit I remember from the early years.  Ultimately the whole experience didn't cohere and just fell flat for me.  I downloaded the songs I liked and left it at that.

I certainly can't fault this band for trying to keep their sound fresh and pushing in new directions.  It would have been all too easy to keep making At Dawn and It Still Moves over and over, touring with bands like Band of Horses which have pretty much built entire careers from imitating that sound.  What separates The Waterfall from the far more engaging Evil Urges and Z is the general dullness of about half of this material.  Maybe I am just missing it.  Maybe I should keep trying.  But to me, this album doesn't represent a return to roots at all.  It's another new direction, but one which doesn't fully deliver on this great band's promise.  Again, just my opinion, please give it a listen and see what YOU think!","3.5 Stars ... decent but did n't knock my socks off .

A1HWMU2XORHEI4,B00TQTGU1Y,-1,1,5,"MG is actually Martin Gore. Martin Gore is actually that guy that pretty much makes Depeche Mode Depeche Mode. Songwriter, guitarist, keys, angelic backing vocals...that's Martin Gore. MG is what he's going by this time around on a new solo LP. This solo LP is all instrumental and filled with analog synth buzzes and whizzes. There's some beats here and there, but mostly it's some seriously heavy synth stuff. If you're sniffing around this one looking for some classic Depeche Mode sound, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you like instrumental electronic music in the vein of Tangerine Dream, Cluster, and the Reznor/Ross film score noise, then you might have found that brisk fall record you didn't know you were looking for.

So right off the bat, I was never much of a fan of Depeche Mode. I was still playing with Star Wars toys when they appeared in the early 80s. In 1990 when Violator was unleashed on unsuspecting, sexually frustrated sadsacks, I was beginning a love affair with Seattle, Rush, and Queen. My loyalties didn't lie with personal Jesus' and enjoying silences. As the years rolled on I grew a fondness for DM, and in particular Martin Gore and his contribution to what became the DM sound. In 2009 the band released Sounds of the Universe, an album that relied heavily on analog synths and 808 beats. It was a throwback to their beginnings as an new wave/goth/electronic band. I really dug it. Fast forward to me falling heavy for bands like Tangerine Dream, Cluster, and modern guys like Jakob Skott and Jonas Munk. The analog synth became this tool for time travel. Childhood noises and wisps of yesterday emanated from these circuit-driven machines. Thanks to Boards of Canada's mix of nostalgia, eeriness, subtle breakbeats, and synth layers my affinity for the analog synthesizer was cemented firmly. So when I came across this MG record I was quite taken aback. Not that I didn't think Martin Gore was capable of creating such a subtle and sublime collection of songs. I just couldn't imagine he'd have any interest in such a project.

The songs on this double LP are short snippets. There's a few that hit above the four minute mark, but most are two to three minutes in length. They linger long enough that once they end you wish they were a bit longer. It feels like a score to some dystopian sci fi film, and each song is scoring some colorfully shot scene of orange and purple horizons, vast space, and crumbling humanity. You know, the fun stuff. ""Pinking"" is bright and prickly, while ""Swanning"" sounds like a slowed down version of Wire's ""I Am The Fly"". ""Exalt"" is swaths of synth light. It's the moment the ship takes flight and breaks through the atmosphere. ""Elk"" is one of the shortest pieces here and one of the most sublime. Imagine the Beatles' ""Sun King"" played entirely on a Clavinet and moog. It's spacious and illuminating in just over two minutes. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, well Martin Gore takes us through light years in just over two minutes. ""Europa Hymn"" feels and sounds like some lost Boards of Canada tune. Maybe something left off Music Has The Right To Children. Again, this feels very familiar yet alien at the same time.

Elsewhere, ""Creeper"" has the menace of a John Carpenter piece and ""Stealth"" feels like something from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' The Social Network S/T. ""Islet"" sounds like cascading digital water. It's sparse and moody, while ""Trysting"" sounds like the audio innards of some late 80s video game. ""Blade"" seems like a proper finish to this record, feeling all melancholy and dour.

I'm not sure I'd ever jump head first into another Martin Gore record like I did with this one. I don't think anything could ever hold up to my cantankerous scrutinizing. Not that I'm saying he doesn't have another quirky little album like this in him, I'm just saying I highly doubt it. Besides, I'm not sure in my strange, little interior world he could write a better imagined soundtrack. MG is dark, subtle, melancholy, moody, and quite wonderful. It's an anomaly, really. I hold anomalies quite close to the chest.","MG is actually Martin Gore . Martin Gore is actually that guy that pretty much makes Depeche Mode Depeche Mode .

A29AQW33B8ILM1,B00U370CJE,-1,1,4,"I want to begin by saying that while I understand that not everyone will enjoy this cd for various reasons, I believe a lot of the negativity is simply knee jerk reactions to the drastic change. I believe given time this cd will grow on some of the detractors. Some of the greatest music I've ever listened to was not enjoyed the first few listens. Sometimes it takes time to really absorb it and appreciate what the artist(s) were trying to accomplish.

That said, I don't feel just because a band uses similar instrumentation and takes on a similar sound as other bands makes them a poor band or their album a poor effort. There are thousands upon thousands of bands that sound similar and use similar instrumentation across many genres. I think it's an unfair assessment and strike against Mumford and Sons, when there are so many others guilty of the same offense yet still loved by millions. To me it's just a reason to dislike a band because they aren't what you want them to be, which is just unfair to the artist(s). Something most ""fans"" should understand is musicians write music to express themselves and its not written to please you. It's written to please them and is their form of expression. There is an extreme amount of self centered behavior amongst music fans that I don't like.

As for the cd itself, I enjoy it and welcome the change. I feel that they weren't gonna top Sigh No More with their previous style and didn't really enjoy the over the top vocals for any extended amount of time. This cd has a good flow to it and places the upbeat songs in the right places so it's not slow for too long. I'm a bigger fan of the more upbeat songs, but none of the songs are bad really.","I want to begin by saying that while I understand that not everyone will enjoy this cd for various reasons , I believe a lot of the negativity is simply knee jerk reactions to the drastic change .

A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00U3WJHCW,1,-1,3,"I really like Josh Groban, even if his style of music isn't one I normally listen to.  He has a gorgeous voice that's capable of bringing tears to my eyes, and his songs are beautiful.  And he has a fun and goofy personality when he's not performing -- just look at his Facebook page sometime.  And as a fan of Broadway, I was super-excited to hear about his ""Stages"" album.  Groban and musicals?  What wasn't to love?

As it turns out, Groban and Broadway might not mix as well as I thought.  This isn't a BAD album by any means... but it certainly isn't his best, nor is it the best compilation of songs from Broadway musicals.

Groban covers a nice selection of songs here, including numbers from some of the most famous musicals out there -- ""Les Miserables,"" ""Phantom of the Opera,"" ""Chorus Line,"" ""Into the Woods,"" and others.  There are also some numbers from movies (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Wizard of Oz""), which sort of goes against the title and theme of the album, but then, these songs might be present in stage adaptations of the movies, so perhaps they fit anyhow.  There are also numbers from plays that aren't quite as popular but are still worth noting, such as ""Chess"" and ""Sunday in the Park with George.""

Groban's voice is stunning as always... but I do agree with other reviewers that this album sounds overproduced.  Sometimes simplicity is best, and Groban's voice is beautiful enough to stand on its own without a lot of musical embellishment.  There are times in this album where the orchestra threatens to overwhelm Groban's voice, and that's a shame.  I know instruments are just as important to a song as vocals, but here I think the musical accompaniment should be just that -- an accompaniment, something to compliment the singer and not compete with it.

Also, some of these songs feel empty when taken out of context -- when they're sung by an actor who has immersed him or herself in a role and has a great handle on the character, we feel that emotion carry through into the song.  The songs often don't work as well when taken out of the context of the musical and are sung by someone with little appreciation for the character behind them.  A good musical has songs that fit the story instead of just being great stand-alone numbers, and sadly that's a weakness that hurts this album -- many of these songs just aren't as powerful excised from their original context.

This is still a beautiful album, and good if you're a Groban completionist.  But it's one of his weaker albums in my opinion, and the songs feel odd out of context.","I really like Josh Groban , even if his style of music is n't one I normally listen to .

A3LHQZXCE4UDCQ,B00U3WJHCW,-1,1,5,"Ill admit - Ive liked Josh Groban since I first heard him on his debut album.  However, after a few mainstream pop albums, its great to hear him back in a genre that best suits his voice!

Among the (goosebump-inducing) highlights are Bring Him Home, If I Loved You (a beautiful duet with Audra McDonald, whose voice best complements his) and Gold Can Turn to Sand (from Kristina).  Groban is in better voice than Ive heard him in a long time, and he emotes beautifully in these classic gems.

The only really weak track was All I Ask of You with Kelly Clarkson.  While Clarkson did a respectable job on her part, the piece was almost too big for her voice, and she was (understandably) drowned out by Groban on the high notes, but that still doesnt detract from the overall beauty of the album.

While I would highly recommend this album, I would hold out for the Target exclusive, which includes two bonus tracks not on this album (If I Cant Love Her from Beauty and the Beast and Dulcinea from Man of La Mancha).  Unfortunately, you would then miss out on the free mp3 download offered through Amazon.  But I guess if you're a real Grobanite it might be worth having both versions!  Either way, I guarantee you will enjoy the album!","Ill admit - I ve liked Josh Groban since I first heard him on his debut album .

A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00U7J9JDS,1,-1,3,"Niell Blomkamps career is quickly garnering criticism similar to that of M. Night Shyamalan's. That he himself is his own worst enemy. District 9 was an amazing directorial effort, but then Elysium and now Chappie seem to be landing with quite a thud. Another alarming thing is he has never quite stuck with one composer. Clinton Shorters District 9 was an obvious The Dark Knight temp mimic. And Ryan Amons effort on Elysium failed to amount to anything (with no fault to Ryan, all blame on Blomkamp). Amon was in fact supposed to be onboard Chappie, but as things happen in Hollywood, Blomkamp somehow managed to snag Hans Zimmer. Zimmer dove right in after Interstellar and crafted a score that is fresh in its own sonic identity but definitely echoes the chaotic shortcomings of another choppy Blomkamp mishap.

Blomkamp is in love with his native Johannesburg, and Zimmer had to enter that gritty and metallic sci-fi world that Blomkamp has created out of his South African hometown. Chappie is a very standard score in terms of structure. We are introduced to the setting and story, we get a theme for Chappie, we follow Chappie on his journey and it comes to an explosive and emotional climax. Very by the books narrative here, which is fine. Heres the good. The score feels as if it was built from the ground up, and it really absorbs you into the soundscape of the narrative. Chappies theme arrives in A Machine That Thinks And Feels. Its a simple theme that sounds like a music box toy or a lullaby. Its childlike only in the sense of its fragility, newness and innocence. Zimmer does a fantastic job crafting action builds later with that theme that echos most of the emotion of the score. And honestly, thats the heart of the score. Chappies theme is the emotional heart. It reminded me very much of New Orders score to the brilliant short film More from Mark Osbourne (whom Hans has scored two films for now, maybe not a coincidence?). Its all about innocence and that drive for happiness.

The bad here is the pulsing electronic dance style the music takes on. The pulsing loops at times can be abrasive and structured in a way where you want them to stop so you can breath and take in the music. I get that its meant to add a modern vibe and pulsing structure to the action, but it yanks the listener out. Thankfully those loops become a more organic part of the score as the story moves forward and don't feel so artificial. I really liked the final act, it was True to Chappies emotional journey and delivered some great Zimmer moments. While the electronic textures used feel unique, Zimmer fans will notice some Dark Knight Rises elements (including a Bane-like chant) as well as an overall throwback sound that calls back to Thelma & Louise and Black Rain. In the end, the score saves itself from its hairy beginning. This isn't top shelf Zimmer, and I attribute that to a disconnect with Blomkamp who seems to have been given carte blanche too early in his career without fine-tuning his skills as a director.

Chappie is a score that may take at least two listens before it grows on you. The pulse-pounding beginning is too abrasive at times, and the mish-mash of electronic textures can get too muddled. Luckily once Chappies theme comes into play the score finds its footing and is able to craft an engaging enough narrative that excites just a tad more than it emotionally resonates. Zimmer with additional composers Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski do craft a unique electronic soundscape for Blomkamps Chappie. Sometimes the stylistic approach drowns out the emotional core, but overall its an engaging and satisfying musical narrative by the end of it.","Niell Blomkamps career is quickly garnering criticism similar to that of M.

I would give this album 3.5 stars because when it does work, it sounds great (check out the tracks with his partner in crime Ghostface Killah) but I can't.

I give him props for trying a different approach ( going for more of a mainstream sound ) but that 's not who he is . Granted he is one of the more popular MC 's in the Wu but that does n't make him commercial material ( not a bad thing by any means ) . I would give this album 3.5 stars because when it does work , it sounds great ( check out the tracks with his partner in crime Ghostface Killah ) but I ca n't . I hate to say it but maybe he should have had RZA produce all of the tracks ( even though his track record has n't been great lately ) but hopefully next time things will align better for Rae ."

A2LHIU2DUUYHJJ,B00UA2NI0C,1,-1,3,"The Chef has been working on this album for years! His last album was 2011. This album which is probably his last, is more radio friendly. Its different from what his fans are accustomed to but its a good listen. A lot of guest appearances by recent rappers as opposed to the clan and old school cats. Ghost drops in on the first track and that's the best one on the album (4 In Da Morning). I think the direction for this album is needed. Its not raw and gritty like his previous work so I think this may appeal to more newcomers and tap into a new market. Good production, short album and a decent body of work. Its time he gets some money. Cop it I say, support some good rap and add to your collection.

I get that artists in general reinvent themselves (JEKYLL + HYDE) but man, I was not expecting this.  I was SUPER excited because my all time Favorite gal Sara Bareilles is on here and also Chris Cornell whom I enjoy.  I listened to Sara's song and thought what is this, Jazz?
Chris Cornell is rock and WAY off for me.
The majority of the album has a serious pop beat and does nothing for me.  I always thought of ZBB as one of the stead-fast modern times True country bands. I also miss a lot of the harmonies they have had in the previous albums
1) Beautiful Drug- Pop
2) Loving You Easy- more country with a pop beat
3) Remedy- more True to the ZBB sound
4) Homegrown- this is the first country single off the album and is more rock to me than country
5) Mango Tree- feat Sara Bareilles- Jazzy- starts with heavy horns in the begining
6) Heavy is the Head- feat. Chris Cornell- Rock.
7) Bittersweet- slower paced more country feel
8) Castaway- are we trying to be Jimmy Buffett and Kenny Chesney?
9) Tomorrow Never Comes- does have a country feel to it.
10) One Day- more Buffett
11) Dress Blues- more of a country pace.  This is actually a lyrically great song.
12) Young and Wild- synthetic rock beat.
13) Junkyard- I am not sure what this is but I cannot stomach more than 15 seconds of it. and its over 7 minutes long.
14) I'll be your man (Song for a Daughter)- I love the lyrics in this song, its beautiful.  Set more to an islandy beat but great ZBB harmonies
15) Wildfire- more synthetic stuff.  Good beat though.
16) Tomorrow Never Comes-Acoustic- and an acoustic version of song above.
This is just one music lovers opinion.  I don't really need much flack from my opinion, we all have one- have a great day.","On first listen , suckage .

Far Afghanistan is pretty trite, and it is a track for me to skip when I listen. I feel moderately affectionate about this album, and Taylor seems modestly engaged. Perhaps he needed someone like his old producer Peter Asher to kick things up a notch in the energy department, as Asher did for the recent Steve Martin/Edie Brickell collaboration. This album is nothing if not pleasant, with gentle humor and some real emotion. But it's certainly a long way from the kick in the seat that starts out his album ""JT,"" namely Your Smiling Face.

A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B00VYA1BP8,-1,1,4,"Adam Lambert's 3rd studio album, ""The Original High"" is a good album but I prefer ""For Your Entertainment"" and ""Trespassing"". I think the main problem I have with ""The Original High"" is the music. The music sounds generic and uninspired like it came out of a computer. The ""instruments"" are so manufactured, it's ridiculous. And I wish Adam's beautiful voice wasn't so synthesized. I don't know why the producers have chosen to ""water down"" Adam's god-given vocals. He CAN SING ANYTHING, he doesn't need studio help. Geez. Adam co-wrote 9 out of the 14 tracks. He's a good songwriter but I must admit, this album feels sort of safe and predictable. And it's a little bit uneven. Some songs are dark and intense, and some are very poppy. Adam has stated in interviews that ""The Original High"" has more of electronic sound and less of a pop sound. But for me, this album feels very much pop. Don't get me wrong - I like pop music but I was really hoping that Adam would step outside his comfort zone and make a more ""grown-up"" album. I feel like he played it safe. Sorry, but that's just my opinion. Anyway, here's my two cents about each song below:

THE GEMS:

""Ghost Town"" - Fresh and innovative. The most experimental track. Starts off acoustic and dives into a thumping dance track. Stunning.
""The Original High"" - Very melodic and has a strong hook. Has a great summertime vibe. Breezy and has good tempo changes. Awesome.
""There I Said It"" - A gorgeous and heartbreaking ballad. Adam pours his heart and soul into this song. Gives me goose bumps. Emotional.
""Evil in the Night"" - This song is just amazing. I hope it is released as his next single. Radio-friendly but not fluffy or corny. Great vocals.
""Lucy"" - The only True rock song. Superb guitar solo by Brian May of Queen. It's edgy, brooding, and unlike the rest of the album. Good stuff.
""The Light"" - Ugh. I love this song. Reminds me of early '90s house music. It's catchy and melodic. Musically, it's the strongest track.
""Heavy Fire"" - THE BEST TRACK. Also contains Adam's best vocal. I wish the rest of the album had the vibe/intensity of this amazing track. A+
""Shame"" - I'll admit it, I hated this song at first. It's so slick but I grew to love it. It's fun, silly, and flamboyant. A guilty pleasure all the way.

MIDDLE OF THE PACK:

""Another Lonely Night"" - I don't really care for the music and the profanity kind of throws me off. It's a pretty mid-tempo track but predictable.
""Underground"" - I have mixed feelings about this song. I like dark pop songs but like I stated before, Adam's vocals are manipulated. Frustrating.
""After Hours"" - This song feels more like an interlude. Way too short and never gets ""off the ground"". It's different but decent. Very laid-back.

THE MEDIOCRE:

""Rumors"" - Good chorus but the verses are awkward. Another track where Adam's voice sounds unrecognizable. In a nutshell, this track is boring.
""Things I Didn't Say"" - Another song with a good chorus but awkward verses. I'm just not feeling it. Feels more like a Kelly Clarkson reject. Next.
""These Boys"" - This song just irritates me. It's artificial and embarrassing. Juvenile. You can do better than this, Adam! Enough said.

As you can see, I do enjoy the majority of these songs but it took me a while to fully embrace it. I just wish this album had more ballads that showcased Adam's beautiful vocals. But I must admit, I'm not 100% happy with ""The Original High"" and I have a terrible feeling that Adam isn't either. I feel like Adam's charisma isn't present on some of these songs. Like he was basically going though the motions in the recording studio. I don't know. I just hope his next album will be a game-changer. When I first heard ""Ghost Town"" - I remember thinking, now this song is groundbreaking and current. But then when I heard the rest of the album, I couldn't help but be disappointed. Adam is so crazy talented but sometimes his songs don't match up with what he can truly do. I still love him and I wish him success. I just think Adam was selling himself WAY too short with ""The Original High"" and that's a crying ""shame"".","Adam Lambert 's 3rd studio album , "" The Original High "" is a good album but I prefer "" For Your Entertainment "" and "" Trespassing "" .

Rae is the only one from the Wu to feature & the only other worth mentioning is Vince Staples on ""Get the Money"". The production isn't as fitting as the first either & the run time is too short to tell the story that they are trying to convey. I don't think that Adrian Younge's realm is Hip-Hop which is obviously necessary. But at the end it's still not a bad album by any means. It just needed a certain amount of detailed attention in some areas.

Hopefully next time around ( pretty sure that there is going to be a third installation from story clues ) they will be sure to tend to certain problematic issues that slightly hindered this project ."

What a cool album cover.  Kind of a lofty suggestion though, water for MY soul?  Water, with all its refreshing, restorative, and life-sustaining qualities, for ""my soul?""  I hate to be the semantics police (I know, I know, there might be other meanings here) but unfortunately the music on this album doesnt quite do these implied concepts justice for me.

But for plenty of Joss Stones fans, perhaps this album will be sort of like water for their souls I guess, in the sense that Joss  always has a beautiful voice and a sort of a hand-holding, healing-soul-sister were all in this together kind of vibe going on, and lots of people will enjoy and identify with that regardless of what she does on her records.

Yes, there are reggae beats and a wide variety of instruments spread around on this album, and thats pretty cool and groovy and everything but where is there any sense of joy or fun or at least some good ol fashioned showing off of that big expressive voice?  Even the ""up with people type songs (such as Star or Clean Water)  seem restrained by an overly busy instrumental background and relatively understated vocals and never quite seem to take off and soar.  Star hands the big chorus off to a childrens choir for example, which gives the song a sort of plodding, creepy feeling rather than turning it into the jubilant, people-come-together kind of anthem it could have been.  And this one particular example of choosing a musical style or effect over a chance to feature Joss Stones greatest asset (her voice) might just be symbolic of the main issue that infects the entire album.

In many ways WATER FOR YOUR SOUL is too long and too serious, and it lacks the big vocal moments that have made Joss Stone a pleasure to listen to so many times in the past.

But I criticize because I care.  Funny thing is, despite all of its issues, with each succeeding listen Ive found more to like and cant deny that there are words and music and beats here that want to wear some grooves in my mind.  Okay, fine, Ill take numbers 1 through 5oh and numbers 7 and 8basically Ill take half the album and you can keep the rest.

AGGP8FKBFDHL1,B00XY86446,-1,1,4,"Rock 'n' Roll is the seventh studio album by American rock band Buckcherry, released on August 21, 2015. If I were to give my honest and objective opinion about Rock 'n' Roll, I would say that it surely is not Buckcherrys best album; I wouldnt classify this as their worst either, but it leaves quite a bit to be desired.

Buckcherry has been a favorite band of mine since their debut album dropped in 1999. I followed them intently until they disbanded after their Time Bomb album in 2001, but actually felt that they released their strongest material starting with 15 in 2005. I enjoyed most of their album up till Confessions a couple years back, and man, since then they have steadily continued to decline in my eyes. This brings me to their newest effort Rock 'n' Roll, and what I feel they did well, and maybe not so well.

The most notable thing about this record is that Buckcherry seems to make an effort  albeit a seemingly small effort- to return to their sleaze-rocking past. Songs like The Madness and Bring it Back ooze that sleazy vibe that made these guys stick out, while Sex Appeal has a classic Van Halen vibe that makes it a favorite of mine. The rest of the album is where the problems lay for me: bad songs, horrible song writing, and just too many mid-tempo filler songs. Now when I say filler, I absolutely mean songs that are there simply to take up space and time on an album. Tracks like Wood and Tight Pants seem like they could have been written by my six year old nephew, while a myriad of mellow songs reach a cheese factor that could make 80s hair bands laugh (and 80s hair metal is my favorite music).

The album is actually not all that terrible when you give it a couple listens. It most assuredly is not 15 or Black Butterfly, and thats fair, but sometimes you have to wonder if that special something that Buckcherry had at one point is now a thing of the past.","Rock ' n ' Roll is the seventh studio album by American rock band Buckcherry , released on August 21 , 2015 .

A24NMMWZ8ZTGCM,B00YHTO1HS,1,-1,2,"This album was recommended to me because I'm a fan of Zella Day and Meg Myers.

It has a very good dark pop tone to it, great grooves, easy to get into. Vocally, again, sounds good, she has that dark tonal quality. My issue with the album is the lyrical content, it just seems hollow. The lyrics just seem very generic and not very personal at all. Many of the songs, including New Americana, and Strange Love, just have really generic and overdone meanings. Forget everyone, I'm better than them, I'm going to do what I want. Well high five, good for you.
Zella Day and Meg Myers actually feel like they are writing their music from experience. It's less about conveying a idea, and more about expressing their emotions through their past, and how they've learned to move on. They are songs people can listen to, and relate to, and apply to their own situations to hopefully find some healing in whatever difficulty they face. Halsey on the other hand neglects these things. While still ""dark pop"", the majority of songs are more about being the person you want to be and giving the finger to anyone who disagrees. This would be a fine sentiment, however, it has been so overused, and the message so abused that it is really just rendered repetitive and unoriginal.","This album was recommended to me because I 'm a fan of Zella Day and Meg Myers .

A2YKU5ZJSDLREO,B00Z86W0QI,1,-1,3,"First I would like to say how I've loved Rob Zombie's music since I was a teenager. One of my first metal albums I ever bought was his first band White Zombie's 1995 album Astro Creep 2000 - songs of love destruction and other systhentic delusions of the electric head ( hope I got that album title right). So standards for metal albums were set pretty high as it was. So the latter ninties came and Rob Zombie goes solo putting out solid classics like Hellbilly Deluxe and the Sinster urge, hellbilly deluxe 2, venomous rat regeneration vendor ( which is one of my favorites) and my least favorite American Horses ( which shocked me with John 5 being his first album). So I was excited when I heard he was coming out with the follow up to venomous ratt regeneration vendor album ( which I though it was his best since the Sinster urge). The album finally comes and I  listen through the whole album all the way through and I have to say I wasn't really impressed the first time I heard it. So I listen to it on the way to work one day. All the way through again and it starts to grow on me. The songs are solid and catchy as hell. But the cool thing about the album is it's got sort of a classic rock vibe going on about it. Like some old Kiss records or old Alice Cooper records from the seventies or even Ted Nuggent. Only complaint I really have is there will be these solid songs that are awesome right next to songs to me are duds. John 5, Ginger Fish are awesome as usual. John 5 shreds and sounds amazing as always. I have had this album long so it may continue to grow on me and could become a Zombie classic one day in my mind. Still love Rob Zombie's music and movies. So glad there's a artist out there that's making original music and not making mindless drivel of pop and rap music right now. But in conclusion I think Zombie was trying to do something different and experiment a little bit with his sound. Which is totally understandable. Check it out if your a Zombie or metal or hard rock fan.","First I would like to say how I 've loved Rob Zombie 's music since I was a teenager .

AVV5JGLBZERCM,B010J2KZ5S,1,-1,3,"Old style Mello Music Group producer Apollo Brown from Grand Rapids and Detroit, MI continues to blaze flaming trails in hip-hop's underground with his Sept. 25-released LP, Grandeur, an undulating trip down the life paths of each of its emcee-guests, and Brown is up to speed again with his downbeat yet decadent beats. The rappers here provide so many bits of wisdom and anecdotal little stories about life that they could almost fill a canyon with them, and what accompany these fluid contents are Brown's rich flowing beats that have a melancholic taint and samples that stop quick but also pick up before the preceding phrase is done. In a nutshell, Grandeur is a hip-hop joyride with plenty of golden age flavor.

With emcees like Oddisee, Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P., Evidence, Ras Kass and Masta Ace (plus plenty of others), Grandeur is able to gather all these great shades and vocal styles, but the poignant, sad slowness of Apollo Brown's productions guide them onto a less than vicious platform, meaning the lounging r&b character in the music brings out a certain side of each rapper. Fortunately, this is not a bad thing if you're out to get chill, cool-out hip-hop, and plus, the words they impart will have your synapses snapping and clicking far more excitedly than any beat there is here.

Parts of Grandeur will mean different things depending on who listens, but a few connecting, lasting moments include Oddisee seeing a 'mono' plane of view stating, ""all there is around here is work,"" which basically means all he sees is people slaving for the man day in and day out (see ""What You Were Lookin' For""). Another one of course is Chino XL in ""Brass Tacks"" taking shots at puppet rapper OT Genasis in the chorus. Apollo Brown uses a few recycled samples here, which is a little questionable, but the save is that with them, he has created new unique versions different from the originals they first appeared in. A more or less typical compilation LP, Grandeur is a win, albeit not a huge one, for Brown and company, and although he hasn't evolved tremendously since the last time he dropped, he is still one of the game's most skilled young producers respectful to his forefathers.","Old style Mello Music Group producer Apollo Brown from Grand Rapids and Detroit , MI continues to blaze flaming trails in hip - hop 's underground with his Sept. 25 - released LP , Grandeur , an undulating trip down the life paths of each of its emcee - guests , and Brown is up to speed again with his downbeat yet decadent beats .

Some of this material will undoubtedly remind people of early Eagles albums, when the band was essentially more country than rock.  How much you like country music my influence how much you like this album.  For me, this one does not really rank up there with Henleys best and I find it to be a rather middle of the road release.  There is a ton of country star power to be found here, with several guest vocalists, and some of the best Nashville session players in the city appearing on the album.  There are more covers to be found here than on a typical Henley release as well.  I buy Henley albums mainly for his songwriting, so for me that is a bit of a disappointment.  This is not to say that there are not any good songs here, as there are quite a few that I really like including, Take A Picture Of This, Waiting Tables, That Old Flame, and Train In The Distance.  The final track Where I Am Now seems to sum up Henleys acceptance of his age and place in the world ending the album on a rather more upbeat note than most Henley fans are probably used too.

Every time those opening lines came on the radio, I totally rolled my eyes because it sounded like Ke$ha was sneering at me with an obnoxious party attitude.  But since my local radio station played it a million times a day, I got used to her voice and talking/singing style and eventually got past the annoyance.  The rest of the song is actually a decent dance pop song.  Auto-Tune is very noticeably used.  Naturally like many other dance pop songs, it's about partying and clubbing.  The name dropping of Mick Jagger stood out in an odd way though but that's minor.  The vibe of this song is more like dirty hard partying, and the video totally reflects that.

Kesha (not to be mispronounced as Key-shuh) is a pop artist/budding singing-songwriter who came onto the scenes in late 2009/early 2010.

At first, I was highly annoyed with this song. It had no depth, the production was very in-your-face and the song itself seemed to have no good rhythm to it whatsoever.

HOWEVER. After a few listens to it on the radio, I lightened up a little and found that the first thing to grow on me was the production. It's almost irresistable in the way its catchy way flows into you. It's extremely poppy with an electro hint.

One thing I  totally can't stand about Kesha though is that she talks in her songs instead of sings. It actually works for this song at hand, but for other songs, it gets annoying quickly.

Not that she's the type of artist I can  take seriously yet. She has a song entitled 'Dinosaur'. Anyway, this song isn't a hit out of the park, but it's listenable. At least to me.

A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B014URBVVA,-1,1,4,"I was there in 1991 when ""Crazy"" began a somewhat heavy rotation on radio. I don't remember seeing the video that often, though. I decided to pick up ""Seal"" and was impressed. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be, it was something else entirely, and better. I saw Trevor Horn was producer, which I thought was interesting as I already knew him from The Buggles and Art Of Noise, Yes and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. After listening to ""Seal"" over and over, I knew it was something special that the majority of the music listening population had overlooked.

In 1994, I was the first at the music store to pick up my copy of ""Seal"". I didn't know what to think of it right away. It was very different from his debut. I saw that Horn was still on the production, though. After repeated listening, I began to hear that it was just as classic as his debut. However, in 1995, that stupid ""Batman Forever"" soundtrack derailed everything for Seal. ""Kiss From A Rose"" was not supposed to be in a Batman movie. Was it Seal, or his record company, to blame for allowing it to be attached to that asinine film. I hate it with a passion. Now, all anyone remembers about Seal is that song from that film. They don't even know it came from his second album released a year earlier than the film.

In 1998, I was the first at the music store to pick up ""Human Being"". Again, wasn't sure what to make of it at first. It was very different from his first two albums, and judging by the cover, it was (and still is) his darkest, moodiest album. Over time, I realized it was just as classic as his first two albums, but critics and the public had either grown tired of Seal (thanks, Batman), or indifferent to his style of music (changing music business).

I had heard about ""Togetherland"" and that it was shelved, and I guess we'll never get a proper release of that one because, apparently, Seal felt it wasn't good quality--WHAT??!! You allowed ""Soul"" and ""Soul 2"" to get out the door, what crap those were! And let's not even talk about ""Seal 6: Commitment"".

In 2003, I was pleased, after such a long wait, to have ""Seal IV"", but it was his first album that I felt wasn't quite up to par. It was good, but not classic. In 2007, I felt the same about ""System"". Then all hell broke loose.

I'm sorry, but Heidi Klum was a huge red flag Seal ignored back in 2004. She was pregnant and separating from the unborn child's father before the child even had a chance. Red flag. Red flag. Red flag. And a supermodel. That's another red flag. Steer clear.

""Seal 6: Commitment"" was the nadir of Seal's career. A whole album dedicated to the hollowness and shallowness of commitment to a supermodel.

But, I digress. ""Seal 7"". Amen, hallelujah, we have Seal back. Not classic, but just as good as ""System"" or ""Seal IV"". Thank goodness Trevor Horn is back on production, too. Save us all from David Foster's dreadful production values.

The good news is that ""Seal 7"" has some brilliant moments like ""Daylight Saving"", ""Padded Cell"", ""Do You Ever"" and ""Half A Heart"". These are classic Seal moments. Any of these four could be singles and hits.

Then you have the second tier of quality songs like ""Every Time I'm With You"", ""Life On The Dancefloor"", ""The Big Love Has Died"", ""Let Yourself"" and ""Love"".

Then, you have, what could have been b-sides: ""Redzone Killer"" and ""Monascow"". And let me just add that ""Monascow"" should never have made it out the door. That groove is ripped from Roxy Music's ""Love Is The Drug"". Couldn't Seal and Horn come up with something more original?

Then, something I really hate, if you bought ""Seal 7"" at Target you got two bonus tracks that the rest of us didn't get: ""We Found Love"" and ""Whatever You Need"", which I'd love to know whether those tracks would have added or subtracted from the overall quality of the album.

So, the overall feel of ""Seal 7"" is good. There's some good songs here. ""Seal 7"" easily surpasses the last three Seal albums ""Soul 2"", ""Seal 6: Commitment"" and ""Soul"". This is at least on par with 2007's ""System"".

What I want to hear next is Seal and Trevor Horn go back to the drawing board and re-think Seal's next musical strategy. It's time for a change. It's time to really start experimenting. It's also time that Seal thought long and hard about his lyrics and music. I believe Seal is still an untapped hit machine, much like Billy Joel or Elton John. I believe he could really get his career back on track and ""Seal 7"" was just re-establishing himself while not offering something interesting, innovative or new. Horn can be very creative as evidenced by his work with The Buggles, Art of Noise, Yes, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, ABC, Grace Jones, Pet Shop Boys, Simple Minds, Paul McCartney, Mike Oldfield, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Robbie Williams and Billy Idol. I don't care if it takes another five years, let's create something classic again.

As a side note, I find it hilarious that none of the lyric website have the correct lyrics for ""Padded Cell"". Seal, as is his usual practice, did not include lyrics to his songs on ""Seal 7"".

Here's how ""Seal 7"" compares to the rest of Seal's work:

1991 Seal: Five Stars
1994 Seal: Five Stars
1998 Human Being: Five Stars
2001 Togetherland: (I guess we'll never know, will we?)

Then , something I really hate , if you bought "" Seal 7 "" at Target you got two bonus tracks that the rest of us did n't get : "" We Found Love "" and "" Whatever You Need "" , which I 'd love to know whether those tracks would have added or subtracted from the overall quality of the album . So , the overall feel of "" Seal 7 "" is good . There 's some good songs here . "" Seal 7 "" easily surpasses the last three Seal albums "" Soul 2 "" , "" Seal 6 : Commitment "" and "" Soul "" . This is at least on par with 2007 's "" System "" . What I want to hear next is Seal and Trevor Horn go back to the drawing board and re - think Seal 's next musical strategy . It 's time to really start experimenting . It 's also time that Seal thought long and hard about his lyrics and music . I believe Seal is still an untapped hit machine , much like Billy Joel or Elton John . I believe he could really get his career back on track and "" Seal 7 "" was just re - establishing himself while not offering something interesting , innovative or new . Horn can be very creative as evidenced by his work with The Buggles , Art of Noise , Yes , Frankie Goes To Hollywood , ABC , Grace Jones , Pet Shop Boys , Simple Minds , Paul McCartney , Mike Oldfield , Rod Stewart , Tina Turner , Robbie Williams and Billy Idol . I do n't care if it takes another five years , let 's create something classic again . As a side note , I find it hilarious that none of the lyric website have the correct lyrics for "" Padded Cell "" . Seal , as is his usual practice , did not include lyrics to his songs on "" Seal 7 "" . Here 's how "" Seal 7 "" compares to the rest of Seal 's work : 

 1991 Seal : Five Stars 1998 Human Being : Five Stars 2001 Togetherland : ( I guess we 'll never know , will we ? ) 2010 Commitment : Three Stars"

It's not to say this isn't a good release, but, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, it sure feels like I've been here a few times before.  Isaak is blessed with a fine voice and he can general work his way around a solid hook. Almost all of the tracks on this effort salute many of Isaak's early rock heroes (Elvis & Orbison & Jerry Lee), and a tip of the hat to contemporaries such as the Mavericks / Raul Malo / Traveling Wilburys. The ill-titled 'Insects' was really the least appealing track to these ears, but most-all the other cuts hit the mark in a familiar way. Isaak can be humorous, as he he on the name-dropping, ""Down In Flames"", where one can almost envision The King up on stage in one of those ridiculous 60's film sets when Presley would grab a guitar in the middle of a scene and rip into song. ""Baby, What You Want Me To Do"" is campy for all the reasons that made Tom Jones or even Cher songs cringe-worthy at times.
.
Among the high lights are songs where Isaak sounds the most like Isaak. The opening, title track is strong. ""Dry Your Eyes"" has some terrific guitar licks, presumably from guitarist Hershel Yatovitz? Ubiquous singer/songwriter, Michelle Branch lends her writing talents and backing vocals to ""Reverie"". The best song, IMO, was the 5:18 guitar driven gem, ""Please Don't Call"". It rumbles down the road at a nice clip, not unlike Hal Ketchum's chugging classic, ""Point of Rescue"". I found it easily the strongest track on this record and up there with early Chris classics as ""Dancin"" & ""Gone Ridin"". Brilliant and refreshing.

AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B01553ZB9G,1,-1,3,"Hard to believe (or is it?) that I've been listening to Chris Isaak for 30 years. His debut album came out in 1985, and I got it after seeing him on Friday Night Videos.  ....because I liked the music and he was dreamy.

Deep down, his music hasn't changed all that much and he is still dreamy.

He has a new disk out  - 'First Comes the Night'. For an extra $2, I got the DE-luxe model which has five more songs. I'm a marketer's dream. They see me coming a mile away.

Isaak certainly has a style, and while he's tweaked it here and there, it's never far off course from his origins. And while so many reviewers want to brand him as ""an Elvis"" and there is some of that here (""I Love the Way You Kiss Me""), but he is so much closer to ""a Roy Orbison"", yet still his own artist, his own style.

Recording in Nashville and using that cities musicians, it is hardly a ""country"" album, though Rolling Stone reviews it as such. But they are kind of idiots anyways. I will say there are other influences (""Running Down the Road""  -  Jerry Lee Lewis, but mostly the keyboards, not the vocals).

Like all Isaak albums, 'First Comes the Night' is fraught with heartache, loneliness, melancholy - everything that Isaak is known for. As always most of it works, some of it doesn't. Well, about half of it works.

I love the title track - though when he sings 'wherever you are' followed by 'you're here in my....' I always assume he'll say 'car', because it rhymes more than 'heart' does. Weeks later, and I'm still going with 'car'.

Most likely, the best song is ""Reverie"". Sure, it starts out with the piano from the Lisa Kudrow show, Web Therapy (which possibly stole it from Suzanne Vega's ""Pornographer's Dream""), but it is the song I enjoy most on the disk.

A close follow-up is ""Kiss Me Like a Stranger"", that would not be out of place if the Mavericks had covered it - with horns. But I always found Raul Malo and Isaak to be closer in style than most people probably notice.  I dog ""Dry Your Eyes"",  and ""Perfect Lover"" (really Mavericks material!),

And oddly, the ""bonus"" tracks are good. Normally, artists who don't have them on the standard album, they tend to be throwaway songs. But four of the five are better than some stuff on the normal disk.

There are things here that don't work - in my opinion: ""Baby, What Do You Want Me to Do"".  The plucking of violin strings seems out of place, but the vocal arrangement seem to compete with the musical arrangement. ""Insect"" is not bad, but it is not over the top good.

While I appreciate Isaak trying to shake things up with the Nashville routine and normally I'd say maybe working with other songwriters strays from who he is, but all the songs I like were co-writes. Maybe the need for three producers made the album less cohesive, I don't know.

Don't get me wrong - 'First Comes the Night' is by no means a bad disk, but it is not Chris Isaak's best work either.","Hard to believe ( or is it ? ) that I 've been listening to Chris Isaak for 30 years . because I liked the music and he was dreamy .

Ms. O'Donovan has one of those sweet-yet-substantial voices like Alison Krauss', the kind of singing I could just listen to forever. I loved her album Fossils ('13), and I am still happy to follow her music on those songs, even through some of its twists and turns. In the past, she toured with Punch Brothers and recorded with acclaimed jazz musicians such as Dave Douglas, so I shouldn't have been surprised at how ""out there"" some of her new songs on *In the Magic Hour* are. For every tune that has a more traditional structure (""Detour Sign,"" ""Porch Light"") there are others of a more exploratory nature, culminating in the album's closing number, ""Jupiter."" On that track, Aoife lays down a vocal that seems to have very little to do with the nebulous backing arrangement. It's as if she said to the other players, ""I'm gonna sing something, and you guys just play whatever comes to you."" Improvisatory songs like that are less appealing to me. I will always like her singing, but the loosely structured material on *Magic Hour* just drifts away from me, leaving little behind.","( 3 & 1/2 stars )

I loved her album Fossils ( ' 13 ) , and I am still happy to follow her music on those songs , even through some of its twists and turns . In the past , she toured with Punch Brothers and recorded with acclaimed jazz musicians such as Dave Douglas , so I should n't have been surprised at how "" out there "" some of her new songs on * In the Magic Hour * are . For every tune that has a more traditional structure ( "" Detour Sign , "" "" Porch Light "" ) there are others of a more exploratory nature , culminating in the album 's closing number , "" Jupiter . "" On that track , Aoife lays down a vocal that seems to have very little to do with the nebulous backing arrangement . It 's as if she said to the other players , "" I 'm gon na sing something , and you guys just play whatever comes to you . "" Improvisatory songs like that are less appealing to me . I will always like her singing , but the loosely structured material on * Magic Hour * just drifts away from me , leaving little behind ."

A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B015U2LLIW,1,-1,3,"Megadeth is one of the greatest thrash metal bands of all time. Their 15th album shows that even though Mustane is a guy who likes to think outside the box he always knows how to keep his massive fan-base happy. After another experiment with 'Supercolider' Megadeth returns after 3 years with their 15th studio album. 'Dystopia' is a return back to basic Megadeth. The heavy guitar and base rifts. Mustane's familiar growl and nothing but, a battle of words and politics. I am feeling at this point it's just 'meh'.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that bands like this still make hard and rough albums like this and even some of the guitar work shows signs of the progressive sound of the previous album. After being one of the greatest and long lasting metal bands I kinda of feel that Megadeth, along with many other bands in the industry should finally pass the torch to the new blood. The album for me is a good listen but, just falls flat because it is the same thing that I have heard so many times over. I know the political views and this time around we obviously know who Megadeth is referring to as the enemy but, this is just not making the mark as strongly as it use to.

Any Megadeth fan will be glad to own this album and I am one of them but, when you compare it to the legacy that this band has left behind...I feel that Dystopia will be the last Megadeth album I purchase because I feel they have done all that they can.","Megadeth is one of the greatest thrash metal bands of all time .

A3IC5E3OFHYAZX,B0160TES1G,-1,1,4,"Sounds like Brian's finally snapping out of that 20-year commercial ""haze"" which very nearly swallowed whatever remained of his credibility as a legit multi-talented recording artist. 'Better' (going by the audio samples here) feels like the kind of album that really should've followed his sophomore release 'I Remember You' back in the late-90's. While that particular album focused primarily on the piano-heavy ballads, 'Better' effectively showcases a more energetic, uptempo side of Brian that he struggled to master a bit earlier on in his career. The production also stands out as well (best since 2005's solid yet largely uneven 'Gemini'), with polished LIVE musicianship and arrangements galore. I think there was only ONE track total that featured any hint of programmed instrumentation (the one with guest rapper Glasses Malone?), but it really didn't deter from the overall flow of the album which tells me that Brian definitely has learned his lesson in terms of not letting ""trendy"" guest artists (rappers ESPECIALLY) overtake his studio projects. I do like his reggae-inspired collaboration with native Hawaiian singer Kimie Miner, however. Didn't see that one coming, but it was a most welcome surprise indeed! Hopefully, this newfound sense of musical versatility will continue for Brian as he takes on further projects in the not-too-distant future. From my honest perspective, the man certainly needs to make up for lost time after giving much of his core fanbase three decades worth of watered-down compromises that served him well financially yet stagnated him artistically during that stretch.","Sounds like Brian 's finally snapping out of that 20 - year commercial "" haze "" which very nearly swallowed whatever remained of his credibility as a legit multi - talented recording artist .

It's pretty good... that's really the best (and worst) I could say. Andrew Freeman has a good voice and has written some decent lyrics here - nothing cringeworthy.... BUT he isn't RJD.... and to his credit he doesn't try to be. Here's the thing Vivian Campbell has said -  that band members are not just interchangeable - that no matter how good a player is that they bring a uniqueness which is integral to band chemistry... and in that respect this makes me miss RJD more than ever because if he were in the mix this would have been so much more than just good or pretty good... in all likelihood it would have been great. This isn't a ""great"" album but it's definitely good and is definitely a quality album... just not magic. All the players do a good job and this is much better than so much of the crap that's out there... but if you are hungry for heaven and looking for Holy Diver or the Last In Line (the albums) you aren't going to get that here. I think it's a tad misleading to say this would fit in with those two albums... there are singers that could have ""filled in"" for Dio (Halford, Dickinson etc.) but a virtual unknown is always going to suffer by comparison, especially when his pedigree is Lynch Mob  and the Vegas lounge act Raiding the Rock Vault. Not disparaging him  - kudos to the guy for making a living as a rock singer in 2016 but this is not someone coming out of Rainbow and Sabbath at the height of his popularity... and this is not about his voice or his range, it's simply that he doesn't have the pedigree or the gravitas that RJD had and when you pull a star like that out of a lineup it can lead to a black hole. this isn't that bad of a situation but, again, doesn't capture the magic... if you are looking for the closest thing to those first two Dio albums pick up Dio's vastly under-appreciated Killing the Dragon which was the last Dio album to feature the late, great Jimmy Bain. If you are looking for relatively kick ass hard rock you could do worse than this. Definitely give it a shot just set your expectations accordingly....I also feel that the original Dio keyboard player is missed and that while this is VCs most guitar driven project since Dio his playing and writing here doesn't quite hit the high water mark of those first two Dio albums.","It 's hard to judge this album for what it is , which is a good , solid hard rock album - as opposed to what it 's not , which would be a classic Dio heavy metal album .

Don't expect Grammy nominations. Not just because the Grammy people wouldn't know good music if it sat on their face and passed gas. But because this is definitely not meant to be taken seriously. Think of this as Waylon Jennings meets Andrew Dice Clay meets Weird Al Yankovic.

It's the dirtiest album ever. I mean you can't find gansta rap albums that are more filthy to the core. But it's funny!!!!! Family Tree (Track 3)  LITERALLY made me laugh so hard I cried.

The music itself is actually pretty decent old school style country. It's got a real twang and everything. If you take out the lyrics you'd think you were in a 1972 honkytonk.

A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B0189YO1GC,1,-1,2,"A review in 3 parts:

Part I: Dream Theater has put out concept albums before.  Theyve put out double and triple albums.  They are a well-known and well-regarded group of gifted musicians with backing deals and monetary funds to help them put out products of excellence and ambition that lesser known bands simply cant compete against.  So then how can they put out a conceptual double album that fizzles out practically before it even gets started?  One of my favorite bands, a small little independent group called The Violet Burning, with a pittance of a following put out a conceptual triple album a few years ago (around the time that Green Day got some mild publicity for releasing three albums in three months if I recall correctly) that blew my socks off.  How could they pull that feat off but Dream Theater put out a wishy washy (dare I say wimpy) piece of fluff like this?  It boggles my mind.  I expect so so so much more from them.  Theyve got such a great catalog!  But not this.

Part II: The Astonishing is musically mild.  It is rarely heavy and hardly ever muscular.  Its melodies are underwhelming.  Youll find ambient and future-computer-code sounds, which are perhaps the most musically interesting tracks on the album, sprinkled throughout.  Youll hear a song that starts out like a Christmas tune (Im not kiddingcheck out A Savior In the Square) and I even had a moment listening to one of the tracks that made me recall The Carpenters of all bands!  What is this!?!  Dream Theater has thrown their chops around with ballads and even some close-to-standard rock songs but they usually stay close to the progressive metal sphere and love to let their collective hair down on epic tracks that take their time and take the listener on an adventure.  Theyve eschewed all of that this time around in favor of a wealth of short to average length songs that allow keyboard concepts to mostly take the leads.  Sure the guitar is there but it is almost always playing second fiddle to other elements of the song, or providing an additional melody.  If there are wild drum and bass excursions then Ive missed them amidst all of the songs trying to bewell, songs, that all add up to a story.  A hackneyed, dystopian future where a musical genius can be the savior story.  The packaging is pretty!  The interior booklet has some nice art in it!  But that cant make me like these songs.  There are a couple that pass muster but theres nothing that is anywhere near the greatness that Dream Theater can achieve.  I enjoy the feel good arena rockish anthem Our New World.  LaBrie sounds pretty good there and its rousing, but theres little else that generates serious interest.

Part III: Concepts albums may be harder to pull off than a regular release but in the end, just like regular releases, they have just as good a chance to be cool or to suck.  This one sucks.  It doesnt suck because of the production.  Productions fine, sound levels are paid attention to, arrangements while lacking the usual DT dynamic are still tight, and the musicianship is fine.  But it sucks because its boring.  And the story is linear, obvious, surface, and just boring.  Sure there are other concept albums that fail (check out, or better yet dont, P.O.D.s The Awakening) but there have been so many great ones.  DT has a few of their own with Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence being at the top of my list.  But what this album needed this time around to really help it out was different voices.  LaBrie carries the vocals and speaks for many different characters and because he cant make them distinct characters via his own voice he ends up hurting this release (it still wouldnt have been great even if they used other vocalists though).  I wonder if he remembered working on Ayreons The Human Equation and heard that fantastic end product, carried through by a variety of singers, to work out its concept exquisitely?  Did he ever think of doing the same?  Well never know.  Best to put this one behind us and move on.

When all is said and done one can listen to the album and not hate it.  You can find some different points of interest.  But I think that, as a whole, you're hard pressed to find that you enjoy the entirety.  I think most Dream Theater fans will be mightily disappointed and I don't see this making many new fans.  Not even of bands like Nightwish, Epica, Vanden Plas and others who play up offerings similar to this.  They at least do them up pretty well.  I want DT to go back and play their long songs.  2.5 stars of disappointment.","I : Dream Theater has put out concept albums before . They ve put out double and triple albums .

I think most Dream Theater fans will be mightily disappointed and I do n't see this making many new fans . Not even of bands like Nightwish , Epica , Vanden Plas and others who play up offerings similar to this . They at least do them up pretty well . I want DT to go back and play their long songs . 2.5 stars of disappointment ."

AF65C8QK9NNXP,B0189YO1GC,1,-1,3,"The most accomplished progressive rock band of all time return with their second concept album featuring over two hours of music spread across two discs. Produced by John Petrucci and engineered by Richard Chycki, the concept revolves around a story to stop evil technology overcoming the human power of music. The story was conceived and written by John Petrucci and the music is all written by Petrucci and Jordan Rudess. Unfortunately both John Myung and Mike Mangini were not involved in the songwriting process although their musical performances are front and center as always. The album is a great achievement for a band that has done it all and definitely shows a huge amount of ambition and scope but it does feel at times like we have heard this all before from Dream Theater. In addition, it's a little underwhelming having only two band members involved in the songwriting process. Despite these shortcomings, The Astonishing is an interesting concept with lots of great music and features an incredible vocal performance by James Labrie who brings each character to life with his vocal inflections. This album would probably be more satisfying when performed live as part of a theatrical performance of the story in order to bring some visual component to the musical onslaught and production values. Although there really is a lot to like about The Astonishing it's also a bloated affair and doesn't really feel like it has the same level of replay value as other Dream Theater albums - 3.5 stars.","The most accomplished progressive rock band of all time return with their second concept album featuring over two hours of music spread across two discs .

All of that being said, the songs that Ive managed to live with are brilliant, often sounding lo-fi, etherial and dreamy, out of time and out of touch ... like searching the radio dial on a road trip, picking up a distant weak station signal that strains your ears to be heard, and then as you crest the mountain or come out of a tunnel, its gone.  Leaving you to consider going back, just to hear a bit more of the magic that sent midnight shivers running through your bones on the open road.

Lucinda is one of the few people who are writing songs from the heart anymore, writing solid songs of her personal emotional experiences, writing songs that linger, writing songs from a troubled life that ride comfortably in your back pocket, because who among us has not had those moments of weakness, and needs music like this to let us know that were not out here on our own, lost on the vastness of a deserted highway.

Mind you, there are those of you who will love the songs Ive chosen not to play, and thats the best part about listening to Lucinda Williams, she has so much to offer to so many people.  So pick what you like, or take it all ... me [?], Im keeping:

Dust, Death Came, Doors Of Heaven, Ghosts Of Highway 20, Bitter Memory, If My Love Could Kill, Faith & Grace ... variations of the others Ive heard before.

AYOO12C9Y2T95,B01929H4VM,-1,1,5,"While this album can't be called their apex, the Beatles end the early years with a bang here and an album with really only 1 poorish cut on it (""It's Only Love""). The beginnings of their musical experimentation can be seen here with the confessional tone of John's lyrics flowering on the title tune and ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" which are not only classics in the Beatles lexicon but in all of rock and roll. Paul adds his own classic with ""Yesterday"" (which I believe is STILL the most covered rock song ever). Musically, there aren't a whole lot of ""breakthroughs"" here in terms of structure, but as a primer on how to write perfect 2 1/2 minute pop songs there aren't many better CDs to study.

Highlights are the somber ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" with its wonderful flute solo, the charging pop of ""Help!"" (the perfect choice to open the album), the stately orchestral grace of ""Yesterday""'s elegy to a love affair, ""Ticket to Ride"" is another melancholy ditty that's become a Beatles favourite, and underrated but fantastic ""I've Just Seen a Face"" has a  classical-ish guitar intro that gives way to a fast country shuffle. There are few hooks as infectious as the ""falling"" part of the tune, making it hard to believe it was allowed to languish as an album cut.

The bane of most of the early Beatles CDs is the cover tunes, but here Lennon turns in a jagged vocal on ""Dizzy Miss Lizzie"" and that, plus a ""Hippy Hippy Shake"" style George guitar, makes it a keeper if not a highlight.

BOTTOM LINE: Buying a ""hits"" CD for ""Help!"", ""Ticket to Ride"" and ""Yesterday"" isn't good enough. This isn't a track or two and some filler. Nearly every cut here is great.

""Help!"" is the final album of what in retrospect are the early Beatles. Next comes the short middle period of ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"" before the ""Sgt. Pepper"" period. Lennon & McCartney have 10 solid songs on this collection; their least impressive songs, ""Another Girl"" and ""Tell Me What You See,"" are still as good as anything else any other group was doing in the mid-Sixties. The title song and ""Ticket to Ride"" are biggies and ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and ""I've Just Seen a Face"" are just a step below. The album earns only four stars because George gets two tracks on this album are they are both lesser examples of his work (he does much better next time out).

Also, he sings the songs fairly straight, eschewing the oddly phrased pauses and deviations that can be quite wonderful or sometimes not so wonderful. The main problem with the album is that Willie's voice is going. Five years ago, his singing was still great. Here, it gets weak at points you want it to be strong. He's had a great run. The voice had to suffer at some point in his natural aging process. And we've arrived at that point. He waited too long to record these tunes. If you could bring back Willie's voice from 10 or 15 years ago, this would be a 4 star affair. Still, it's not that bad. But for me it isn't worth a second listen.

It is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of It 's a Sin or Can You Forgive Her - the glory days when all mixes appeared either in vinyl or then cd /cassette forms . A Cloud in a Box is a good b - side track with a techno dub feel a la 80s flavour . Say It To Me Stuart Price version is nearly identical to the album version but has been slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there . It is the second - best version of all the remixes .

A3K2J86VI3TJV3,B01B6X0QC6,1,-1,3,"""Produced, Arranged, Composed, and Performed by Prince"". This is what every album this guy released from 1978 onwards stated, indicative of his incredible talent. What a sad day April 21 was, especially for all of us, '80s kids. One of the most gifted artists in music history passed away, gone like a purple star disappearing into the deep Minneapolis night. To anyone of my generation, Prince was not just an iconic artist, but also a tremendous inspiration, having had a major effect on the shape of the contemporary music industry, not just because of his music but, also, with the way he treated and valued his recordings. 39 recording years, 39 studio albums, 5 soundtrack albums, 4 live albums, 12 EPs, 104 singles. And with over 100 million records sold worldwide, Prince has been ranked as one of the most prolific, successful, and influential acts of all time. I am happy that this final release somewhat compensates for the mostly mediocre output he released over the last decade.

Initially released exclusively on Tidal for streaming and purchase, the new album is a continuation of ""HitnRun Phase One"", but an improvement on that record's inconsistency. Pulled together over 4 years, it is equally eclectic and formulaic, but more organic and warmer than its predecessor, with nearly half of the 12 songs showcasing Prince's trademark audacious funk and lush R'n'B balladry. ""HnRPT"" reunites him with backing band The New Power Generation, contributing much to the final result, reminiscent of his early '90s albums, like ""Diamonds and pearls"" and ""Love symbol"" (incidentally my 2 favourite Prince albums). Tracks like the sexually charged ""Xtraloveable"", the accordion-tinged ballad ""When she comes"", the poppy ""Groovy potential"", and the epic, 7-minute ""Black muse"", are obvious standouts, though only a couple of tracks on here are poor. Overall, it is definitely in the good side in his discography, and a good point to reconnect with him.

As much as I am devastated by his loss, I am more than grateful for his work. And so, I would like to take this opportunity to urge everyone to purchase some of this man's music. Most would mention ""Purple rain"" and ""Sign 'o' the times"" as his greatest works. Since I was a baby back then, if I were to make a recommendation, it would have to be his 1991 ""Diamonds and pearls"", and 1992 ""Love symbol"" albums, 2 of my most loved albums by him, or by any other artists from that decade, fine examples of music that moves both body and soul. This is the kind of music Prince did. Also, to those who prefer greatest-hits albums, ""The its/The B-Sides"" (1993) is the most comprehensive collection of his work, featuring no less than 56 tracks, representing his golden era of the '80s and early '90s, an essential and unmissable listening experience of The Artist Formerly Known As Prince, and subsequently called by an unpronounceable symbol chosen as his stage name.

Prince's father said that he named his son Prince because he wanted him to do everything he wanted to do. He certainly did most than many. What he did best of all, was to demonstrate the brilliance of his Purple Highness in such a way in order to be respected for his musicianship. That immeasurable talent of this pint-sized pop giant, whose musical genius extended beyond his eccentricities, was and will always be, adamant proof that he was ahead of anyone in pop culture. Prince Rogers Nelson, ""Nothing compares 2 U"". You will be missed. You are now reunited with 3 of your '80s - and of equal to your own calibre - counterparts: Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, and David Bowie.

AGNN3F0NN9314,B01DGM4S38,1,-1,3,"Its been a long time since I found an album that is such a polar opposite of itself.  It wouldnt even be fair to call this album all over the place so much that it bounces back and forth between some very good and some very bad songs, with a couple of middle of the road songs thrown in.

The album starts off with promise with the title track, Black.  Its a good song and reminds me a bit, thematically, of Bentleys early hit, Come a Little Closer.

Pick Up, by its title alone, conjures that this song is about to be about a pickup trick.  However, a pickup truck is only mentioned in passing in the chorus (and theres no indication that its jacked up, either).  The song begs a lover to pick up the pieces, to pick up where the couple left off, to pick up the phone and to show some kind of emotion, love or hate, and not leave the singer hanging on wondering whats going on.  I actually really liked this song.

Ill Be the Moon is a duet with Maren Morris and is another strong offering.

Its after this, however when the album begins to show signs of wavering..  First, Ill admit that What The Hell Did I Say may be my guilty pleasure on the album.  Admittedly, its not a good song and I wouldnt want to see it as a single, but Bentleys charismatic and enjoyable delivery prevent me from outright hating it (much like with Drunk on a Plane).

Somewhere On a Beach is awful.  Many people hoped this song was just Bentley playing the game: releasing a radio friendly single to pave the way for an otherwise strong album.  Unfortunately, the song is not an anomaly on the album: Mardi Gras is exactly what youd expect from a song of that title,  Roses and a Time Machine takes a promising concept and some decent lyrics and wastes its potential: sonically it doesnt work.  It has aspects that could work: in fact, if done right, it should have worked as an up-tempo song, but added unnecessary pomp and circumstance turn it into a mediocre song, at best.

That doesnt end the albums different ends of the spectrum, though.  Before you know it, Bentley is back with another strong offering, Different For Girls.  The album also closes with another two strong songs: Light It Up and Cant Be Replaced.  Cant Be Replaced, along with Ill Be the Moon, is a favorite of mine on the album.  Its a very mature and relatable song.  Anyone whos ever experienced any significant changes in their life will be able to connect with this song: it took me back to college days at my fraternity house and the good times I shared with great friends: no matter how many times I go back and visit, those times cannot be recreated or replaced.

I wanted to like this album a lot more than I did.  Bentley is capable of so much better than the album he offered.  The album is far from terrible: it has some really strong moments.  It just should have had a lot more strong moments and a lot less songs readily created for country radio.  Itd be hard to accuse Bentley of completely selling out, but I did expect a lot more from him.

2.5/5 stars.","Its been a long time since I found an album that is such a polar opposite of itself .

Unfortunately , the song is not an anomaly on the album : Mardi Gras is exactly what you d expect from a song of that title ,   Roses and a Time Machine takes a promising concept and some decent lyrics and wastes its potential : sonically it does nt work . It has aspects that could work : in fact , if done right , it should have worked as an up - tempo song , but added unnecessary pomp and circumstance turn it into a mediocre song , at best . That does nt end the albums different ends of the spectrum , though . Before you know it , Bentley is back with another strong offering , Different For Girls . The album also closes with another two strong songs : Light It Up and Ca nt Be Replaced . Ca nt Be Replaced , along with Ill Be the Moon , is a favorite of mine on the album . Its a very mature and relatable song . Anyone who s ever experienced any significant changes in their life will be able to connect with this song : it took me back to college days at my fraternity house and the good times I shared with great friends : no matter how many times I go back and visit , those times can not be recreated or replaced . I wanted to like this album a lot more than I did . Bentley is capable of so much better than the album he offered . The album is far from terrible : it has some really strong moments . It just should have had a lot more strong moments and a lot less songs readily created for country radio . It d be hard to accuse Bentley of completely selling out , but I did expect a lot more from him ."

AQ81L25HHHB18,B01DKYRCEY,-1,1,4,"I think this is a great set. It contains a lot of my favorite McCartney tracks, and it also includes many that I didn't have before I got it. Paul has been the most prolific ex-Beatle by far --- of course, two of the Fab Four are sadly no longer among us --- and has put out tons of stuff over the past several decades, so even a set this size  inevitably isn't going to please everybody, as a lot of people are bound to have too many favorite tracks that weren't included (and to dislike too many of the tracks that are here).
As far as I'm concerned, this is the best McCartney comp to be put out so far. The CDs come packaged inside a book containing an opening ""note"" from Paul --- though no notes on Paul's musical history or any stories behind the songs --- as well as track credits (the names of the people who played, produced, etc.) and a lot of photos of Paul. The photos are cool (although they aren't in color), but I find it a bit odd that, despite the fact that the set spans Paul's entire career, none of the photos include any members of his group Wings --- in fact, that group name is never  mentioned anywhere, except on Paul's shirt in one of the photos. Not even Linda is pictured anywhere. Of course, though, the photos have absolutely naught to do with the music, which is what really matters!

I have to wonder whats going on with this his second album of covers, and I have my thoughts, having seen and heard this concept done time and time again by other aging artists.

There are some muted jazz arrangements here that should stand with more strength and life, yet Dylan, a huge jazz fan, has chosen to nearly hide what he appreciates most.  That Old Black Magic has been turned into a rockabilly shuffle, It Had To Be You barely holds together, as he seems to be nearly reading these songs rather than singing them.  In all honesty, this album sounds like another dreamy look back at his own youth [in much the same manner as Sinatra did] trying to figure out where he fits in during this, the first half of the 21st century, or if it even matters that he does.

Call this gathering of songs whimsical if you will, but please, do not call them great or inspirational, as they come off rather lightweight, shadows of shadows, delivered by a man who may or may not be in the moment as these tracks were recorded.  In a strange way though, the songs all do hang together, but mostly in a manner where Dylan is trying to prove that these vintage ballads are still valid, and thus, if they are, then so is Dylan.

Of course there are those who are gonna tell you that its all brilliant, but its not, and its a real shame that for all his greatness, Bob Dylan cant take his time and present his vision of his later life, or the worlds hes lived through, rather than stepping back into some long lost comfort zone where he no longer needs to gaze out of his window.

But ... you may find it all touching and romantic, so by all means celebrate with Mr. Dylan, for his times, they certainly have changed.

A2YKU5ZJSDLREO,B01DQ6ON70,-1,1,4,"Starting to love this album, it's really starting to grow on me the more I listen to it. But I do miss the heaviest of past albums like Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood, Rock the rebel/ metal the devil, and the Strenght/the sound/ the songs. But like any awesome band they new to grow with each release. They has starting to change with each release starting with Beyond hell/ above heaven and continue with Outlaw gentlemen shady ladies which I think this album sounds a lot like. The album starts off with the catchy single The Devils Bleeding Crown. Sounding like a really catchy Metallica song from load or reload with a more modern sound and Glen Danzig singing over it with more melody. Some of the rhythms almost sound like Cape Of our Hero from their previous album. The second track Marie Laveau rocks a little harder but doesn't turn into a full on thrash metal tune like you would expect. All the songs sort have the same vibe and rhythm. Most of the album just reminds a lot of Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies. Like these songs could almost be outtakes or b-sides from that album that's how similar they sound to that album. All the songs have sort of a 90s era Metallica vibe about them. Like a mixture of the Black album, Load and Reload mixed the Misfits and a dash of southern rock. Probably the heaviest song on the album is the last song track 13 The Loa's Crossroad. A sort of medium paced thrasher with a bagpipe solo in the middle. Volbeat on this release do two covers one of a band I've never heard of called Rebound by a band called Teenage Bottle Rocket. The second cover they do a song called Battleship by the Geogria Satellites. A guest appearance by Danko Jones on the song Black Rose. But all in all this is a solid album. Volbeat seem to inject more melody into their brand of Rockabilly heavy metal that seems to really work. Maybe the only downfall on this album is it sounds to similar to Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies. Maybe not for the die hard metal heads that prefer their old stuff.

AMKHSFDQDXDMS,B01EPF42AO,-1,1,4,"Actually three and a half stars but closer to 4 than 3.

 So blink 182 is back minus Tom Delonge, plus up one Matt  Skiba.  I will be honest, the vocal interplay between Mark and Tom was  One of the things that made blink 182 so great and unique. When Tom's voice started to get really annoying, Mark chimed in for some relief. When Mark started to sound a little boring after a while, Tom picked up the slack and made things interesting again.  Matt Skiba proves to be a worthy co-frontman, however his voice sounds strikingly similar to Marks, and on many occasions I cannot tell which one is singing lead vocals.  It took me a few listens to figure it out.

 There are a few songs on here that I would've liked to have seen cut from the album.  No future, teenage satellites, and the two joke songs  clutter the album and make it sound more generic.  I would even argue that the generic kings of the weekend should've been cut from the album.  Sometimes less is more!

 One of the big downfalls of the album in my opinion is the production and the overuse of  Cliche vocal harmonies layered on top of each other, the constant whoa whoa whoa's, na na na's, and gang vocals in nearly every song.  This gives the album a very one dimensional generic feel.  John Feldman is a good songwriter and producer in his own right, however I think  he did blink 182 a major disservice. It's obvious he had a little bit too much creative control over the album.

 On a positive note, there are a handful of some really great songs.  As mentioned above, Eliminating a handful of the weaker songs would have made this album much stronger. And of course, Travis Barker's drumming is amazingly killer as usual.

 Another positive thing about the album is that Tom Delonge's voice doesn't dominate nearly every song like it did in neighborhoods (and arguable the self titled as well).  This album gives Mark a chance to shine and let us hear more of his soothing baritone voice and catchy hooks.  Let's face it, Mark was always the better of the two singers when Tom was in the band.  And I would even say that Matt Skiba is a much better vocalist than Tom Delonge. But the last two albums with Tom had a little bit too much Tom on it. However, having no Tom at all isn't a good thing either. Tom's presence/influence is definitely missing on this album, and even though Matt Skiba proves to be a great musician, it's just not the same.  If only Tom didn't get abducted by aliens....

 But it is what it is, and I applaud Mark and Travis from moving forward and doing what they love, even if it's without Tom.","Actually three and a half stars but closer to 4 than 3 .

Ive really enjoyed much of their work including their last release Rise but theres something brewing that I don't like and Unleashed displays it: John Coopers singing is dominating all the songs. The band doesnt take long enough to let any of these songs breathe and develop so they all end up sounding really, really similar; really formulaic. And its sounding old. I realize that Skillet is a modern rock band who has always placed a lot of emphasis on a lot of vocals and I like Coopers voice (most of the time) but too much sometimes is just thattoo much. I think that this album is an example of that and it reminds me of Creeds last release (Full Circle) where pretty early on I wanted Scott Stapp to stop singing so I could listen to the music (mind you, I like Stapps vocals). While Unleashed doesnt sink down to quite that level it gets close and I wish the songs were more interesting, more musically developed, and that Cooper would hold back and let the music sit on its own more or that he and drummer Jen Ledger would share vocals more than they do. This at least helps change up the dynamics between songs and helps make the album as a whole more listenable. As such I Want To Live is one of the albums better songs IMO both for the male/female vocals and for the symphonic music. Stars and Lions may be my favorite songs off this release and they are more synth dance songs than rock songs. Meanwhile songs like Feel Invincible, Back From the Dead, Undefeated, and especially tracks Out of Hell and Burn It Down generate the my main criticisms. So all Im saying is that I want to see them break away from the mold (stadium anthems) and play around an album throughout its track list. Their last great album was Collide. I think they have one more great album in them. Heres hoping.","Just so you know , I really want to love Skillet .

Most of the songs are intensely fast and raw, with a distinctly black metal style and sound. Unlike every other band I've heard from Phil, I don't hear a trace of Pantera in Scour's sound. I think this band could make an outstanding vehicle for Phil's extreme side, given that the music sounds nothing like Superjoint or his solo efforts. Although you can often hear that trademark Phil screech, his style here is much more in the extreme metal style, with guttural death metal growls and scraping, acidic, black metal shrieks.

AVV5JGLBZERCM,B01FTCOKF4,1,-1,3,"Its been twelve years since the hip-hop men of De La Soul released their last LP (The Grind Date, 2004) so it makes sense that they would require a Kickstarter campaign to fund their new works. And The Anonymous Nobody (Aug 26/AOI), their eighth and latest studio album as a full posse, serves all the great De La idiosyncrasies with some diversity of music and good guests for an all around solid retro-esque rap offering.

These aging De La Soul artists (Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo) are low-key in energy and volume most of the time, but their rhyme games are still respectably sharp. Its not bad that the general tone is warm. Platitudes and wise adages are sprinkled on their verses like the occasional gray hairs you might find on the authors scalps. The majority of the album is spent just kicking it it seems, as these legends casually toss their rhymes down with ease and skill. On their minds are past loves (Memory Of Us), the trappings of the fast glamorous busy life (Greyhounds), the problem with snooty people (Nosed Up) and hopes that we the people will go out into the world and do good (Exodus).

The production is right up there with the vocals in substance, befitting of the De La Soul brand. Highfalutin horns drape Royalty Capes, a variation of electro-funk brings the Pain, and Lord Intended is drawn out with firm rock guitar lines. A couple more joints (Drawn and Here In After) also feature those semi-extended swaths of instrumental music with cool controlled jazz featured in the last example and penultimate track.

Above all though, fans need to ask themselves if in this album there is the boundary-pushing and trend-setting of De Las early 1990s past. There really isnt, but they're also probably not trying to be cutting-edge also. In some parts, they're really not talking about anything out of the ordinary in particular, but they're also not causing harm with their words so it could be much worse. Its very comforting to hear the welcome sounds of De La Soul again no question. And The Anonymous Nobody is definitely not as middling or poor as a below average rating would suggest, but its also not wildly extraordinary. Overall we have a mediocre hip-hop album for the standards of these days and times, but the effort is very much appreciated.","Its been twelve years since the hip - hop men of De La Soul released their last LP ( The Grind Date , 2004 ) so it makes sense that they would require a Kickstarter campaign to fund their new works .

A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B01FTSA9GW,1,-1,3,"Throughout the past several few decades for Disney, they have had excellent movie songs that have really stood the test of time, in regards to the warmth and brilliant heart that have grown with our children, and their children with time and deep beauty that has been magic with Disney for years. That has happened with movies and songs like The Lion King with Circle Of Life, Toy Story with You've Got A Friend In Me, and with Aladdin with A Whole New World. But I was very surprised that instead of a new song for Disney's Finding Dory, they would instead of having something newly written, they would instead choose to do a cover song for the film instead, breaking Disney Tradition overall. When I had heard that Sia would do a rendition of the classic Nat King Cole's song Unforgettable, I found it to be overdrawn, and lacked so much of the heart that was brought out on the song from Nat, and also his recently departed daughter, the great Natalie Cole whom made the song her own 25 years ago. Natalie did more justice to the song than Sia did overall. Sia brought in too much orchestration, without having a lot of the soul and charm the song had for generations already. If you're a fan of Finding Dory, than I suggest you give the song a shot, but otherwise, just stick with the one Natalie and Nat King Cole did that have stood the test of time, and still do today. Maybe she should've had more that brought out on Sia's chandelier.

Song: C","Throughout the past several few decades for Disney , they have had excellent movie songs that have really stood the test of time , in regards to the warmth and brilliant heart that have grown with our children , and their children with time and deep beauty that has been magic with Disney for years . That has happened with movies and songs like The Lion King with Circle Of Life , Toy Story with You 've Got A Friend In Me , and with Aladdin with A Whole New World . But I was very surprised that instead of a new song for Disney 's Finding Dory , they would instead of having something newly written , they would instead choose to do a cover song for the film instead , breaking Disney Tradition overall . When I had heard that Sia would do a rendition of the classic Nat King Cole 's song Unforgettable , I found it to be overdrawn , and lacked so much of the heart that was brought out on the song from Nat , and also his recently departed daughter , the great Natalie Cole whom made the song her own 25 years ago . Natalie did more justice to the song than Sia did overall . Sia brought in too much orchestration , without having a lot of the soul and charm the song had for generations already . If you 're a fan of Finding Dory , than I suggest you give the song a shot , but otherwise , just stick with the one Natalie and Nat King Cole did that have stood the test of time , and still do today . Maybe she should 've had more that brought out on Sia 's chandelier ."
A2H22I2RWE0HOV,B01G4DH4AU,-1,1,4,"My first real listen to Ghost and I gotta say that I dig it.  The dreary minor melodies.  The rich, brooding production.  The uncountable references to Satan.  Not really sure how far these guys are into the nether regions of the soul, but it comes off as way Spinal Tap.  Are they blindly allegiant to Beelzebub? Who knows?  There's an upside-down cross in their band logo, so no one should be really shocked by this.  This album is a bummer and its begging you to sell your soul to Satan...and it's pretty awesome.  I listened from beginning to end and didn't find a soft spot anywhere.  Kinda poppy in places, yet slathered over with Lucifer to keep it cohesive. I'd buy more from this band.  Not really on-board with the whole ""Satan Is Awesome"" message, but wtf, it's catchy.  The world is on fire and you are here to stay to burn with me.....","My first real listen to Ghost and I got ta say that I dig it . The dreary minor melodies . The rich , brooding production .

A1MT5ZJCBMA46O,B01G9RNZXG,-1,1,5,"Rare is the musical experience where the operative reaction is to resist paying extreme attention to detail (which here means paying a cat-and-mouse game of ""was that really a sample of ____?""), and instead make a sincere attempt to shut your brain off and just ABSORB. But that's what I believe the Avalanches intend for us to do here, as they did 16 years ago, and furthering that suggestion with some of the most downright fun music ever. Surely that's the only way we're intended to process things like the wholly misunderstood ""Frankie Sinatra"" or the extreme catchiness of ""Subways"": put our brains on sleep mode and just move.

I love this album. It is overwhelming in a way the tail end of ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" would likely have been to listeners weaned on the Monkees and Rascals and Motown in 1967, an utterly unexpected worldview, a landscape in sound that you simply can't process in one sitting. Individual tracks blur into a serial whole similar to channel-surfing or gazing out a window on a late-night drive, so long as your drive is through a place you have absolutely no knowledge about, adding the euphoric effect of wonder that can be derived just as equally from any mind-expanding experience as it is from the simplicity of a child's perspective. Is ""Colours"" a drug song or a kid's song? We don't have a standard answer, but we have our own.

There is simply no music like this out there and expecting it to retreat to the confined space of a review is sort of ludicrous. Maybe that's why the only reviews here are about the purchasing experience and not the music.

Was that really a sample of The Association's intensely euphoric cotton-candy-for-the-ears ""Everything That Touches You""?  Why yes, it was.  And you want to play it endlessly.","Rare is the musical experience where the operative reaction is to resist paying extreme attention to detail ( which here means paying a cat - and - mouse game of "" was that really a sample of _ _ _ _ ?

AZ0Q5KUSRQ06S,B01GAKJG30,1,-1,3,"I'm going to be very short and blunt -- in the first week of hearing this album I had some pretty nasty things to say (as many seem to) but upon further listens it has grown on me quite a bit. There is a most definitely Fleetwood Mac vibe to much of the album and that is NOT a bad thing and certainly is an understandable evolution of their sound. Many complain it is over-produced and to me that isn't the problem - the arrangements and production is excellent, yes, but I'm not of the opinion that it is by any means a bad thing. What does it for me is simply the lyrical content... while listening the past couple times all the way through the album, I was really really enjoying some of the songs I initially did not care for, but what kept it from working for me was the shallow songwriting, in many cases quite syrupy sweet, predictably rhymed, sentimental and melodramatic. It just becomes a bit boring and feels as if in some ways they have little to really say in these songs. Again, it's not a bad album - certainly not as bad as some make it out to be and there are elements to it I really love - but it isn't one I can imagine coming back to again and again over time. But then, of course, we'll see.","I 'm going to be very short and blunt -- in the first week of hearing this album I had some pretty nasty things to say ( as many seem to ) but upon further listens it has grown on me quite a bit .

One happy result however is showing even at that late stage in his career, he was very engaged in his repertoire , albeit not as recorded in the studio .we must surmise he was fed up with some of the choices he was forced to make through the publishing company and how his final equalizations were dismissed .
I gave away my copy to a good Elvis buddy who especially enjoys the ""deeper voice"" big ballad Presley.
