I can not stop playing this song ( especially when I feel like no one understands me ) and I can clearly see this and a few other songs on this album being the sound track to the creepiest horror movie ever . Usually I wait until an album comes out on Prime to cop it . However as soon as the full album drop I will be buying it . Listen to this song and feel how it pulls you in ....

The Ghostbusters remake \/ reboot ( featuring the all - female lead cast ) came out in theaters yesterday ( technically on Thursday , as it is the new Friday ) , and I am on the fence whether I will go see it . But also today is the release of the new movies soundtrack , and on that I can tell you that I am ALL IN . Ghostbusters   Original Motion Picture Soundtrack ( 14 tracks ; 46 min . ) opens with the 2016 remake of the original theme song , brought by none other than Walk the Moon . The remake is updated just enough that it sounds fresh and contemporary , yet is n't so far removed that it becomes unrecognizable . In other words : a great job by WTM ( plus singer Nicholas Petricca sounds uncannily like Ray Parker Jr. ) . The same ca nt be said of the interpretation called Ghostbusters ( I m Not Afraid ) , by Fall Aout Boy ( feat . I find this version just off - putting . Much better is the beautiful and light - hearted and mostly a - cappella version by Pentatonix . And just to make sure that you remember which movie soundtrack you are listening to , the album closes with the original 1985 version from Ray Parker Jr. Yes ! that makes in total 4 versions of the same song on here . As to the other songs , for me by far the best is Ghoster , a new track by up - and - coming indie UK band Wolf Alice . The song is short , but packs a wallop , courtesy of lead singer Ellie Rowsells powerful vocals . Short and sweet indeed . Another choice addition is Good Girls , a new track from Elle King , here in top ; girl empowerment form ! ( I saw her in concert last month , and she blew me awayin the best possible way . ) Another truly noteworthy contribution is Get Ghost , also new and written specifically for the movie , by Mark Ronson , Passion Pit & A$ AP Ferg , an irresistible dance - along tune . Since I have n't seen the movie , I have no idea how all these songs are used , whether they appear extensively or just in snippets , etc . But here it all sounds quite good , and this collection of mostly fun and upbeat songs is perfect for the summer . ( Please note that separately from this , Amazon also has the original motion picture score , by veteran Hollywood composer Theodore Shapiro . ) Bottom line : whether the movie remake \/ reboot is any good is almost beside the point , certainly as it relates to this soundtrack . Sure , not all the songs are masterpieces and some even misfire ( FOB ) , but there is enough new and original music on here that works great , and several of remakes ( by WTM and Pentatonix ) work very nicely . Bottom line : the jury may still be out on Ghostbusters the movie , but Ghostbusters the soundtrack is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !","summary":"Get it for Walk the Moon and for Wolf Alice!","unixReviewTime":1468627200,"image":null}

But in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the song had originally came out . Fall Out Boy has had a nice return to the industry a few years ago with Centuries and Uma Thurman . But when I had heard that they were going to do a remake of a classic movie song , I was honestly not impressed with what I had heard . In fact , it sounded much cheaper than when Ray Parker Jr. was accused of stealing from Huey Lewis & The News 's hit I Want A New Drug back in the 80 's . Fall Out Boy 's version of the Ghostbusters ( I 'm Not Afraid ) is honestly one of the cheapest remakes that sounds much worse than what I had first heard years ago . It is not only a poor remake , but definitely is one of those songs that you can easily say , \" Boy , did I waste my time on this song ! \" The guys from Fall Out Boy did better covers before , like their rendition of Michael Jackson 's Beat It several years ago . You 're better off downloading the original , or the original sample from 1984 . This version is definitely not worth the money ! !","summary":"Be Afraid Of This Ghost","unixReviewTime":1466899200,"image":null}

I call it delicious because that 's what it 's like to listen to this wonderful collection of American rags . We have virtually the whole output of Scott Joplin in very fine and graceful performances , of which perhaps the best are by William Balcom , though Virginia Eskin and John Arpin are also very fine . Then there are further offering by other leading rag composers , especially as Joseph Lamb . Another highlight is an hour 's worth of rags by women composers , of whom the standouts , on a first hearing , are May Aufderheide and Julia Niebergall . I 'm also extremely pleased to have almost two hours of pieces by the mid-19th Century Creole composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk , some of it piano solos played by Eugene List and some of it duos including list and Reid Nibley . Gottschalk was n't strictly a rag composer , in fact , he predates them by nearly half a century . But like Joplin & c , Gottschalk was a piano - centered composer who combined classical and popular styles , while encorporating flavorful regional folk elements into his music -- so to my ears , he fits right in . At the price , there 's no reason not to scoop up this delicious treat , almost like a triple - dipper ice cream cone of your favorite flavors , for 99 cents .","summary":"A Truly Delicious Offering From our Friends at Bach Guild","unixReviewTime":1466899200,"image":null}

Ragtime is not what I had seen it as and I had no idea that it could be played with such exquisite sensitivity . The music is at times soothing , at times boisterous , I could even dance or march to some of it - some of the most life affirming music that I have ever heard . It will definitely lift your spirits and enhance even wonderful moments . The ragtime is interspersed with more classical pieces , such as several by Louis Moreau Gottschalk , the result being a marvelous interplay of moods from one piece to another . BTW , this collection contains 111 ( one hundred eleven ) pieces !

Actually this is a great , eclectic collection of piano rags , most by Scott Joplin and played by the ragtime expert and composer William Bolcom , who plays them in a similar way as Joshua Rifkin : slow and easy , the way Joplin wanted . No honkytonk saloon music here ! Also , there are rags by Joseph Lamb and some others including female composers and pianists . As a bonus , several piano works of the American composer and salon pianist ( America 's Chopin ! ) These are not rags but apparently Gottschalk was a major influence on the ragtime music movement , especially Joplin . They are wonderful pre - ragtime selections from the latter half of the 19th century , and were popular in the salons of the upper crust . Salon piano music was sort of the pop instrumental music of its time , but Gottschalk was a serious composer as well . They are melodic -- like good ragtime -- and easy on the ears . Many of his songs ( like The Dying Poet ) were used as background for silent movies and became so common as to be cliche , thus the loss of popularity for Gottschalk 's music ( and other salon music ) until revivals began in the late 20th century . Eugene List , a classical pianist , performs the Gottschalk . If you like ragtime , or pop piano music in general , this is a no - brainer -- especially at 99 cents for 111 songs !","summary":"Beautifully played ragtime music with a bonus of pre-ragtime salon music!","unixReviewTime":1479168000,"image":null}

Common wisdom claims he was unrecognized , but in fact he was highly regarded among his peers and jazz enthusiasts . I wo n't go into his total discography as a sideman , but if you look it up he was definitely first call trumpet for some top musicians . Listen to the sound samples on this album at&nbsp;<a data - hook=\"product - link - linked \" class=\"a - link - normal \" href=\"\/Tommy - Turrentine \/ dp \/ B002FDKYTC \/ ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8\">Tommy Turrentine<\/a>&nbsp;for a taste of the music itself . It is certainly hard bop a la Jazz Messengers ( and I have to wonder how he escaped a stint with that group . ) He shines on each track , especially as accompanied by a strong front line comprised of his brother Stanley on tenor sax and Julian Priester on trombone . The rhythm section is especially strong too -   Horace Parlan on piano , Bobby Boswell on bass and Max Roach on drums . Part of the reason this album is so tight is the fact that Tommy had extensive collaborations with most of the ensemble . He is featured on more than a few albums ( and performances ) with his brother , Parlan and Roach . It shows here because they are all on the same page musically . One can lament the fact that this is his only album as a leader , but he is represented ( and featured ) on a number of other albums where his talent shines . On that count we are fortunate because he wo n't fall through the cracks like so many other talented musicians before and after him .","summary":"Well recorded,  but this is his only album as a leader","unixReviewTime":1438473600,"image":null}

He still produced no more than a single album and went largely unrecognized , even by the \" general \" jazz public . At least he made the most of that one shot . This album is inspired , kicking , swinging -- a mix of original tunes that somehow manage to sound accessible and familiar even if you have n't heard them . Trombonist Julian Priester and brother Stanley play with equal amounts of passion and precision , but Tommy 's no - nonsense , thoughtful and melodic , exquisitely crafted boppish lines are the main attraction . His articulations are crisp , his range impressive , his tone open and unconcealed . The tunes range from basic and bluesy ( \" Gunga Din \" ) to intricate compositions ( \" Too Clean \" ) with tight unisons as well as clearly delineated counterpoint . It does n't hurt that Max Roach and Horace Parlan are in the rhythm section , but even so the readings evidence some rehearsal time on the part of the musicians . The audio is well - balanced with none of the gratuitous boosting of the bass frequencies that marred ( sometimes ruined ) many recordings that would come in the ' 70s . I caught Tommy once -- with James Moody at Slug 's in NYC -- and he impressed me even before I knew about the family connection . If further proof were needed of his singular talent , this album provides it .","summary":"One of a Kind","unixReviewTime":1241222400,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/312FrY4YLsL._SY88.jpg"]}

In addition to single artist releases , they put out year by year volumes covering the best hits of 1940 to ( as far as I can tell ) 1969 , interspersed with theme releases such as The Unforgettable ` 50s , The Late ` 50s , and Golden Goofers ( novelty tunes of the period ) . Since there was little real competition in terms of sound quality and program notes at the time , I suppose quite a few bought into the hype , although it was quite an expensive venture since they also charged considerably more for each disc than the normal going rate . Now here we are with options like Ace Of London , Eric Records , Jasmine , Bear Family , Collectables , Collector 's Choice , Rhino , Varese - Sarabande , Razor & Tie , etc . , and suddenly these Time - Life releases are popping up for sale used all over the place , and often at prices considerably less than when they were first issued . This one presents 24 original renditions of the bigger hits from the decade of the 1950s , and in the fold - out insert are three pages of background notes written by noted music historian and author Charles K. Wolfe along with nice photos of The Weavers , Vaughn Monroe , and the inimitable Pearl Bailey . There is also a discography of the contents showing label details but no Pop chart information . Most have since been included in countless compilations , but none can claim to offer any better sound quality . Also , there are a few here that still require a bit of digging to find in a quality CD setting , and in that category I would include : The House Of Blue Lights - # 9 in June - July 1955 on Mercury 70627 ; Till We Two Are One with the Jimmy Leyden orchestra - # 7 in Feb - March 1954 on Decca 28937 ; Takes Two To Tango - Pearl Bailey with the Don Redman orchestra featuring Taft Jordan on trumpet - # 7 Oct - Nov 1952 on Coral 60817 ; Play Me Hearts And Flowers ( I Wanna Cry ) - Johnny Desmond with the Don Jacoby orchestra - # 6 April - May 1955 on Coral 61379 ; Hot Toddy - Ralph Flanagan & His Orchestra - # 7 Jan - Feb 1953 instrumental on RCA Victor 5095 ; Love Me To Pieces - Jill Corey with the Jimmy Carroll orchestrea - # 11 Aug - Sept 1957 on Columbia 40955 ; and Cara Mia - David Whitfield with Mantovani & His Orchestra & Chorus - # 10 Aug - Sept 1954 on London 1486 . The rest of the tracks and their chart performances are shown in the Comments below . Any release in this massive series is a good buy if you 're seeking certain selections to fill out your collection , or simply to enjoy some classic oldies .","summary":"A Volume In The Massive Time-Life Series \"Your Hit Parade\"","unixReviewTime":1382659200,"image":null}

In some ways it does nt seem that long ago , and in some ways it seems like a world away . Things have changed quite a bit for us in that time , growing from a solo project to a five - member touring - band . This album has long been out of print , and as more people have discovered us through Mirror of Souls and As the World Bleeds , we ve gotten more and more requests to re - release it.----Theocracy was started as a solo project out of necessityI had written a group of songs that I really liked , but I did n't know any other musicians who wanted to play this kind of music at the time . So I recorded demos of the songs with a drum machine , and those demos eventually became the debut Theocracy album . When Ulterium decided to re - release it , we had to decide if we wanted to put it out as - is , or if we wanted to rework it ( and if so , how much ) . We considered re - recording everything from scratch with the full band , but a lot of people are really attached to this album despite its flawsand as a fan myself , I generally do n't like it when bands mess with stuff from the past too much . That said , the one complaint that always followed this album was the production ( and specifically the drum machine ) , so we knew we at least wanted to have Shawn record real drums on it In the end , we decided not to re - record anything else : the drums are new , but everything else is the original recordings , just polished to sound as good as possible and given a fresh remix and remaster . So this is still the first album , its just a good - sounding version of the first albumfinally ! Credits : All lead and choir vocals , rhythm , lead , acoustic and bass guitars , keys and orchestration by Matt Smith , drums by Shawn Benson . Bonus moment : Smith shares some brief thoughts about each song . It boggles the mind that this incredible debut was created by one man . This album , which sports speed and melodic symphonic power metal that is constantly active and at times downright acrobatic , does nt just astonish me as to how good ( and tight ) it is but how much Smith got out of his multi - tracking his vocals . And his vocals are good , really really good . The guitar work is tasty and varied . He lays down a bed of power chords and then plays lines over it to delicious effect . Smith also wears his Christian faith and knowledge on his sleeve . He s not a passing pom pom cheerleader for Jesus , shouting rah Jesus , rah ! Sis boom bah ! He sings about theology , Christian history , personal struggles and redemption , and psychology from a biblical perspective . Good stuff is an understatement . I came across Theocracy with their As the World Bleeds and was blown away by the opening cut I Am off that release . And while I love that release I think that this original proffering is actual , on the whole , better . It would be a sin not to give it five stars .","summary":"Learn to grow, grow to be a flesh and blood Theocracy.","unixReviewTime":1445472000,"image":null}

When Big Break Records released this remastered deluxe CD I decided to make a blind - buy purchase since I loved what they had done with a large chunk of the Pointer Sisters catalog . At first I was n't that impressed , but this album has grown on me and so have Bonnies vocal stylings . She displays such versatility here as she tackles lite jazz on FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM , another retro Motown offering on WHEN IM GONE and some red - hot funky R&B on AH SHOOT . But my favorites on the album are the stripped - down , acoustic numbers MORE AND MORE , I LOVE TO SING TO YOU , I WANNA MAKE IT ( IN YOUR WORLD ) and the piano ballad MY EVERYTHING . These are just beautiful in their simplicity and allow Bonnies voice to shine through and really move the listener . Sound quality is terrific on this remaster and best of all is that they ve included the 12 versions and single versions of FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU . Both are better than the album versions with a hot bass - driven break in the former but the latter must be heard to be believedits an extended mix that has this mesmerizing instrumental interlude where the frantically - scrubbed guitars and screeching violins battle it out . It sounds like something out of the famous PSYCHO shower scene and will give you goosebumps . This albums a grower and is definitely the best of the solo Pointer Sisters offerings .","summary":"Best Solo Pointer Album","unixReviewTime":1465862400,"image":null}

Cale , perhaps , felt that this did n't quite live up to what he wanted it to be but , to my ears and sensibility , it remains a classic slice of Cale with blistering lyrics and his voice is , at turns , husky and deep or shrill depending on what emotion he 's trying to convey . Mind you , shrill for Cale can be a good thing -- it matches the music here in many cases . This new reissue ( and remastered ) edition of Honi Soit has a much stronger bass than the original CD -- it is n't bloated at least to my ears but adds some bite and attack to the music . There may be a small amount of digital compression used based on some of the comparisons I 've seen but , in a rare case of more is more , it adds to the music for me with this album . The original German pressing has a lighter touch to be sure . The comparison for me is a cool side walk perfectly uniform and fairly smooth while this reminds me more of a recently paved road on a hot day -- you can feel the gravel under your feed but it is n't unpleasant . This reissue ( an import from Holland ) does n't have any extensive liner notes discussing the making of the album just features credits ( no re - mastering credit though ) for the musicians with photos on a two page spread and noting who played what instrument . I realize there are albums that Cale probably is n't completely happy with but they are a part of his past and should remain in print since they were put out there in the first place . Pretending they do n't exist does n't mean they do n't and even \" Caribbean Sunset \" has its moments and should be available on CD and legit downloads . This remains a worthy reissue and essential album for Cale fans . Now let 's get the other albums that are out of print out there again . Even lesser gems and allow fans to appreciate Cale as imperfect art can sometimes be more interesting than a perfect masterpiece . Cale has always been a challenging and innovative musician . I 'd love to see him work with Brian Eno once again as they struck gold in the past with their collaboration on \" Wrong Way Up \" .","summary":"Nice reissue of Cale's album--no bonus tracks, no liner notes but strong material with a solid band.","unixReviewTime":1518825600,"image":null}

His interview was unusual as he aired his feelings about the IRS and business deals gone bad between his reminisces of career and thoughts on Jazz . There was a lot more to him than just music . When he recorded \" Honey in the Horn \" ( his his most classic album ) he was at the peak of his form . My parents played it on our old Blaupunkt stereo console that was as big as a steamer trunk . It is a classic indeed and a standard of that time . Sound quality for Java and the whole album is , of course , typical of the time and analog recording technology .

This song I could listen to on any day , especially a bad one . If it 's been a hard day I find this song and crank it up . After I hear it I know things could be worse for me . The song has an 80 's beat and great background music . If your an 80 's music fan it 's a must for you music library . If your new to retro music , your in for a treat .

Between 1965 and 1970 a five man group from Los Angeles known as The Turtles produced some of the biggest and brightest pop records of the decade . The Turtles came out of nowhere in the summer of ' 65 with their debut single \" It Ai n't Me Babe \" . The song was written by Bob Dylan who seemed to be all the rage that year and it climbed all the way to # 8 on the national charts . Most folks just presumed that The Turtles were a folk group and were a bit surprised that a number of the groups subsequent releases were pure pop . The group continued to release singles such as \" You Baby \" and \" Can I Get To Know You Better \" with varying degrees of success until early 1967 when they finally struck pay dirt with a tune called \" Happy Together \" . This would prove to be their biggest and best remembered record . But as far as I 'm concerned the Turtles finest single was the follow - up to \" Happy Together \" . The upbeat , bouncy \" She 'd Rather Be With Me \" peaked at number 3 nationally during the Summer of Love . The song was also a huge hit in Ireland , Denmark , Canada , South Africa and the United Kingdom . This is the original White Whale recording you would remember from the radio .","summary":"A fine example of 1960's \"Sunshine Pop\",","unixReviewTime":1467158400,"image":null}

Beverly has also starred in many theatrical productions , most notably , Hair and The Me Nobody Knows on Broadway , and The Rocky Horror Show and Menopause the Musical in Los Angeles . She has performed in clubs and concerts all over the world , as well as on talk \/ variety shows such as The Tonight Show , The Merv Griffin Show , The Mike Douglas Show , and American Bandstand . In May 1971 Scepter records released \" Do n't Say You Do n't Remember \" . Deliberately styled to evoke the 1960 's \" girl - group \" sound the tune peaked at # 10 on Billboard 's Easy Listening chart while just failing to cross over to the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart . In a rather unusual turn of events Scepter was about to release the follow - up single when \" Do n't Say You Do n't Remember \" belatedly became a local smash in San Jose with enough subsequent interest in other markets to debut at # 98 on the Hot 100 in December 1971 . The song would peak at # 15 nationally in February 1972 . I loved this record the very first time I heard it and it continues to be one of my favorite singles from the 1970 's . Unfortunately as other reviewers have correctly pointed out this is NOT the original recording . But as re - recordings go this one is pretty darn good .","summary":"One of my favorite singles from the 1970's.","unixReviewTime":1472256000,"image":null}

With that said , I could explain all the reasons I love this song , or . I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool , but make little sense when it comes to music . Music is a personal thing . It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself . Granted it is only a 30 second sample , but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music , or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version . If you want to listen to a sample , simply hover over the track you are interested in , and press the play button . I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon . That s right ! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums . A great way to construct an entire music library , and admittedly , the way I obtained most of my own music . But quite honestly , a wonderful way to explore new music , too . In fact , some of the songs that I ve obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band , and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag . Anyway ... enough of my rambling . This song is great ! At the very least , give it a 30 - second listen ? \n\n And do n't forget , if you are in the market for freebies , you can always check here \n\n FREE SONGS : From Amazon Home page -- > Shop by Department -- > ( Digital and Prime Music ) Deals -- > Songs by Price ( on left side of screen)--- > Free \n\n FREE ALBUMS : From Amazon Home page -- > Shop by Department -- > ( Digital and Prime Music ) Deals -- > Albums by Price ( on left side of screen)--- > Free","summary":"Good song!","unixReviewTime":1452211200,"image":null}

Their musical style is best described as New Wave and Synth Pop . It is well performed and peppy . I remember it fondly from seeing and hearing the video on MTV . I read most all of the other reviews . The album cover art is the original design . There appears to be some dispute about the originality and quality of the recording . I have to say that the MP3 sound quality leaves a bit to be desired , which is why I give this only a 4 - Star rating . Otherwise , I like the song , even though synth pop and new wave are not my favorite genres . However , this band performs their material very well . I find this song to be very interesting and entertaining .","summary":"Great Tune","unixReviewTime":1486166400,"image":null}

Joe Cocker was one of those soulful greats that had a very uncanny , sweet & somber style that not only has been so timeless , but his songs have never gotten old , no matter how much the music industry changed . Yet , it tragically has been over a year since Joe Cocker passed on from lung cancer , from the years of drug and alcohol abuse he had gone through in his personal and professional life . Still , when I do think of Joe Cocker , I definitely think of the sweet and somber songs that he had recorded for years , and You Can Leave Your Hat On , has been one of those upbeat songs that not only show Joe was still standing at a very tough time in his life , beating addiction , but also personally as Joe finally found his lifelong partner Pam . He definitely showed a lot of heart and soul in the soul , and recorded a very upbeat and soulful song , definitely worth his soul .

Musically , he was one of the underrated but beautiful vocalists I have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . There will be never another soulful giant like he was . Musically as he was going into the 1980 's , Joe really was still on the mend from years of drug and alcohol addiction , and his career was derailed for years . But he still had a lot to show from the inside with his voice . The song that really gave Joe Cocker a new generation of fans in the 80 's , Up Where We Belong from \" An Officer & A Gentleman , \" remains one of the gifted movie songs that had ever been composed . The song which earned a Oscar back in 1983 , is definitely worth listening to each and every time . Joe and Jennifer Warnes really had a lot of chemistry together in the song , and that still clicks today , as it did back in the early to mid 80 's . If you honestly had never heard a Joe Cocker song before , well this is one of those tracks that I have absolutely recommended , and I still do . Right up there with Joe in heaven , up where he belongs .","summary":"Where He Belonged","unixReviewTime":1468368000,"image":null}

But as the success had faded , so did his work and his abuse as well . But for him to really have that success after Culture Club , it has been more bittersweet than absolutely strong , in the way that others like George Michael   had shown after leaving Wham . But nevertheless , with the very least he did have one good song after Culture Club . The Crying Game still remains one of the more - driven movie songs of the 90 's that shows Boy George at heart and voice . It is a great song to listen to today , as it was back then . Now , with a possible reunion looming for Culture Club , this song is worth checking out .","summary":"His Cryng Game","unixReviewTime":1411084800,"image":null}

The immortal golden hit song , Wichita Lineman was written by the legendary composer Jimmy Webb and sung by Grammy - winning singer Glen Campbell . It is one of his biggest hits amid an awesome string of hits that crossed over genres to a wide audience of fans . It is a ballad about a hardworking , pole climbing technician keeping the lines up and working for the customers . The other musicians on the recording included Campbell , session orchestra arranger Al De Lory on piano ; Al Casey , James Burton , and Carol Kaye on guitars ; with Don Bailey on bass , Jim Gordon on drums and a string section . In the performance , Campbell uses his acclaimed distinctive voice , vocal sincerity and role - projection ability , as well as his guitar musicianship . The excellent arrangement of the strings is by pianist De Lory . Built upon a loping beat and backed primarily by guitars and ethereal strings with reeds and a piccolo imitating morse code . In the song , the linemans focus shifts between technicalities and problems of his job , amid his intruding thoughts about a woman that he wants and needs . Actually , Webb wrote the song inspired by driving alongside miles and miles of lines and telephone poles and seeing one solitary lineman technician in the middle of nowhere working on top of a pole , all by himself . Webb was reportedly also inspired by a failed romance . This is yet another great Glen Campbell performance that paints an indelible musical scene . My Highest Recommendation . Five FABULOUS Stars .","summary":"WICHITA LINEMAN: A GLEN CAMPBELL MASTERPIECE OF A JIMMY WEBB SONG.","unixReviewTime":1502668800,"image":null}

Yet , in the way Natalie was remembered at the end , was actually by so many people remembering Natalie from the problems she had endeavored back in the 70 's and early 80 's , from bankruptcy and addiction . Sadly , that is disgusting to her legacy , and the everlasting memory of her beloved father , Nat King Cole . There are so many songs she had soulfully graced our hearts with for 40 years of pop music . Natalie Cole will always be remembered so many great songs , but her debut hit , Everlasting Love , will always be the one people will go to for the first glimpse . The song is just a joyous and soulful rhythm that still shows beauty and soul from the heart .

This song actually has substance to it , as opposed to just saying , \" I love you \" , or \" I adore you \" . There is nothing inherently wrong with that , but when that 's all a worship song says , it becomes empty , in a way . This song is specifically a praise song in praise of what the Lord has done for us in dying on the cross for our sins . The chorus gives a clear , complete gospel message , from His birth to His ascension to heaven .

It also has the rare honor of becoming a hit single by public demand , not being released until September of ' 62 , while the show had been on the air since September of ' 60 . People simply wanted it . It 's a remarkable piece , flinging you right into the scene , the bass being the rhythmic feeling of the road itself , the piano the breeze in your hair , the strings your soaring emotions as you cruise down the fabled highway . The middle section suggests night , as the music gets jazzier with a muted trumpet   that echoes Bobby Troup 's song immortalized by the Nat King Cole Trio in the version on his After Midnight LP , perhaps pulling over to a local jazz club and all that could happen there at night on Route 66 . Then the main theme picks up and you 're on your way again . Another aspect of the Theme is it 's timing , being popular in the late Fifties and early Sixties , a time of great prosperity and optimism in the country . The Theme is full of confidence and brassy crescendos that seem , at least in retrospect , to sum up the feeling of a country that for a glorious moment felt it was doing everything right and on top of the world . One of the great road songs ever .","summary":"Great American Tone Poem","unixReviewTime":1393632000,"image":null}

She is more than capable of singing all manner of material from rock and roll to country to tunes from the Great American Songbook . Within a relatively short period of time the group signed a recording contract with Capitol records and in 1967 had a pretty impressive Top 20 hit with a tune called \" Different Drum \" . Linda did a terrific job singing lead on that record and Capitol decided that they had a potential star on their hands . In 1970 , Linda Ronstadt would have her very first hit as a solo artist . The song \" Long Long Time \" remains my very favorite Ronstadt tune of all time . Here is the most poignant song about the pain of unrequited love that you will ever hear . I still get chills each and every time I hear it .

Hard to believe that it has been over 15 years since Coldplay made their debut with Parachutes , and the songs that they have released have mostly been strong , uplifting and incredible . Chris Martin & company have not one group that has been tiring , they have just gotten better with age . But the past few years have been hard for the group . For Chris Martin , his marriage to Gwenyth Paltrow ended in divorce , but their music has not been as solid as what it was before . So lately , I have been going back to what made the guys from the U.K. so classy and distinctive from before . One of their bigger songs from 2005 's X & Y , Fix You actually is one of those songs that really is melodic and brilliant . I early on liked the song , while I did n't find it as strong as The Scientist , Speed Of Sound or Clocks . But still , it is definitely a great song to listen to , and one of those gems that you should hear , if you have just gotten into Coldplay for the first time .","summary":"Fixed","unixReviewTime":1472169600,"image":null}

For instance I never knew the name of it or who sang it , so it must not have been a \" mega - hit \" , even though it 's such a good song .

He began to ask himself all sorts of questions , like why were kids being sent off to Vietnam ? and why were kids being beaten at home ? Marvin Gaye was asking himself , with all the problems going on in my country , how am I supposed to keep singing love songs ? The song is a plea for people to talk with each other and explore alternatives to war and violence . ' For only love can conquer hate . ' It 's amazing to me that this song is still relevant all these years later . Will our world ever evolve to the kind of existence that everyone can enjoy ? Musically , I 've always loved the drums . Marvin Gaye played a box drum accompaniment to the regular drums , producing this oversized ping pong ball quality . The saxophone opening is a classic .

Now during the 1960 's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records . You might recall his first big hit \" Fingertips - Pt 2 \" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963 ! \" Little \" Stevie Wonder was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making . One of my favorite Stevie Wonder discs was his rollicking 1966 hit \" Uptight ( Everything 's Alright ) \" . The tune peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart in early 1966 , at the same time reaching the top of the Billboard R&B Singles chart for five big weeks . Billboard ranked it as the 59th biggest American hit of 1966 .

Between 1962 and 2006 the group amassed a staggering total of 78 hits on the Billboard R&B charts while placing more than four dozen songs on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart .

Stevie Wonder has honestly been one of those very few entertainers that has not only made excellent songs over the years , but he has shown joy and delight from every corner of the world with his gifts in song . Hard to believe that it has been over fifty years since he started his career , and his songs have never gotten tired . They have always been just as blossoming and beautiful as they were released years ago . One of my favorite songs , Overjoyed , originally released back in 1985 from his In Square Circle album , is just as sincere and absolutely beautiful as the day that it had came out . It is truthfully a noble work of art that keeps of aging strongly like a fine glass of wine . It really is one of my favorite songs of his , just as strongly as I Just Called To Say I Love You and Is n't She Lovely . If you really had never heard a Stevie Wonder song before , well I absolutely recommend you hear his love from the heart .","summary":"Overjoyed, and Never Overloved","unixReviewTime":1465084800,"image":null}

I was often in the vicinity of that house , playing with other kids , and there was always a radio on somewhere .. The Boys Are Back in Town is a straight up rock classic . It features the twin lead guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson , bass and lead vocals by the late great ultra - talented Dubliner Phil Lynott . Look him up on youtube , there are at least two pretty cool documentaries about him . Lyrically and vocally , it always felt to me like an American Bruce Springsteen New Jersey kind of song , to wit : And that time over at Johnny 's place , Well , this chick got up and she slapped Johnny 's face Man , we just fell about the place If that chick do n't want to know , forget her \n\n I just picture Miller Lite neon signs and Chevys and baseball on the tv ... down at Dino 's , ya know ?","summary":"AUG 11","unixReviewTime":1497052800,"image":null}

Grindle","reviewText":"Toni Toni Tone were a band that impressed me from the moment I heard them . As someone generally always attracted to well produced and engineered live funk , soul , pop and rock groups ? Upon first seeing the band perform on SNL in 1993 really peaked my interest to seek out the rest of their sadly all too brief recorded catalog . Their albums were always floating around . And never difficult to get a hold of . But only last year did I round out my collection with their first two albums . This is their second release , from 1990 . Hip - hop derived music , especially mixed with soul \/ R&B were the mainstream . And again ? Toni had their own way of swimming with the musical tide . \" Feels Good \" opens the album with a vocal harmony drenched , percussive funk \/ house with samples of female breathing and jazzy vocalese in the back round . \" All The Way \" is a JB style digitized new jack funk number led by an electronic slide whistle . \" The Blues \" and \" Let 's Have a Good Time \" follow a similar lead . \" Oakland Stroke \" is a rap oriented hip - hop funk tribute featuring vocal help from Vanessa Williams as well as horn samples from Kool & The Gang . \" Sky 's The Limit\",\"Don't Talk About Me \" and \" Skin Tight \" are more straight up new jack dance music . The ballads \" It Never Rains ( In Southern California)\",\"I Care \" and \" Whatever You Want \" are expansive urban contemporary slow jams . \" Jo - Jo \" is pounding mid 80 's style dance \/ funk while \" Those Were The days \" is an early 90 's re - write of Stevie Wonder 's \" I Wish \" both musically and lyrically - this time lamenting the violence and paranoia of contemporary urban life over the freedom of bygone days specifically . This album is one of the best realized album from the peak of the new jack era that I 've ever heard . The rhythmic and melodic pallet of the album is powerful and diverse . From hard funk , contemporary soul ballads , new jack dance music to hip - hop type numbers . All with that special flavor Toni Toni Tone provided . I love it !","summary":"Toni Toni Tone,Just Brothers Having A Party","unixReviewTime":1431561600,"image":null}

The verses of I Wish are memories of carefree times , harmless naughtiness , and rites of passage that kids experience . You look back on it all as an adult , having learned to follow the rules but laughing inside because , even though you got in trouble , those activities were often pretty fun at the time . The music says do n't even bother trying to remain still , you have no choice but to get down and boogie . Listen to Stevie , he is really enjoying himself . Listen to that walking bass line , the horns , the drums pounding away . Cool middle part at 1:30 , do do do do .... break it down . The extremely funky outro lasts for the final minute plus . The horn riff repeats over and over , as Stevie makes little shouts here and there , and Nathan Watts careens all over the bass with little spasms of funky joy . The horns rise up a couple times , Stevie plays a great drum roll at 4:03 . And I guess we have to fade it out so Stevie has room for his other Songs in the Key of Life .","summary":"JUL 21","unixReviewTime":1497052800,"image":null}

Over the years this dynamic artist would prove to be not only a splendid singer but a talented musician and gifted songwriter to boot . His records were a fixture on American radio through most of the 60 's , 70 's and 80 's . Yes , Stevie Wonder truly was and remains an American original . During the 1960 's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records . You might recall his first big hit \" Fingertips - Pt 2 \" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963 ! \" Little Stevie Wonder \" was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making . During the 1960 's Wonder would go on to have nearly two dozen charted singles including the rollicking \" I Was Made To Love Her \" , \" Uptight ( Everything 's Alright ) \" and the beautiful love song \" My Cherie Amour \" in 1969 . For all of the success he enjoyed in the 1960 's Stevie Wonder would go on to even bigger and better things during the 1970 's . Stevie was definitely on a roll and five of his singles would make all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart . In the fall of 1976 Stevie Wonder released his masterpiece , the 2 LP set \" Songs In The Key Of Life \" . The album was an immediate smash debuting at # 1 the week of October 16 , 1976 . It spent 14 weeks at the top of the charts and an impressive 35 weeks in the Top Ten . The project yielded a total of 4 Top 40 singles two of which went all the way to # 1 . \n\n As far as I am concerned \" I Wish \" is one of the two or three best singles Stevie Wonder ever released . The tune earned Stevie a Grammy for the Best R&B Male Vocal performance of 1976 . This song has it all :   fabulous music , a powerful vocal and a dynamic lyric . This is an artist who is clearly at the top of his game .","summary":"#1 hit from the Grammy Award winning album \"Songs In The Key Of Life\".","unixReviewTime":1491955200,"image":null}

Comes to mind that an earlier hit of his , namely ' With A Little Help From My Friends ' , was originally done by the Beatles . Now , here is another example when Joe takes on someone else 's song and raises it up to kingdom come . He left Billy Preston in the dust behind him . No one but Joe Cocker can put so much meaning , soul and emotion into a song , that is for certain . Most of us music lovers know that . There are several versions of this song , so I know . It does n't matter which version I listen to , it always grabs me . It is one of my all time favorites .

With Joe Cocker , there are just so many cover songs that have been brilliant , as well as the classic songs that he had recorded throughout his lifetime . He had left 45 years of brilliant pop music that showed he had a unique and brilliant heart that really was worth listening to overall . Any song of his like With A Little Help From My Friends or the sentimental Up Where We Belong . But it also is the classic You Are So Beautiful , which definitely is a simple heart - wrencher that really gets you each and every time you listen to the song . This version which is on Joe Cocker 's 2008 Classic Hits , highlighting Joe 's Capitol records era is just as good , as you first heard it from the A&M era . It is honestly a definitive download that really ignites at your heart . I sincerely recommend you get this song .","summary":"He Still Is So Beautiful","unixReviewTime":1455494400,"image":null}

Especially when it has came down to love ballads from the 80 's . Atlantic Starr though has been one of those groups that has made some excellent R&B songs , but they have honestly been written off as a group that has been more syrupy than a group known for substance . That has been because of numerous lineup changes , but also lagging sales and credibility . Still they have had great ballads like All In The Name Of Love , Masterpiece and Touch A Four Leaf Clover . But out of all the ballads they have cranked out as a whole , the one song that has really stood simply out of the horizon , Always has been one of those timeless songs that has really spoke from the heart . The intimacy of the ballad still is one of those love songs that I never get tired of .

However the chutzpah takes it to the four star territory . The band kicks things off with one of their more potent statements in Lit Up , a serpentine track where the band and especially vocalist Joshua Todd channels their inner elegantly wasted Scott Weiland . In a rather inelegant way ( as befits the Scott Weiland reference ) . The album punches along with similar blasts of punk ethos infused bluntness with tunes such as Crushed and especially Dead Again threatening to implode from their own raucous weight . The band is on less sure footing when they try to be either profound or introspective on numbers such as Check Your Head . Restraint ill becomes them , it must be said However the tracks that do n't stridently careen towards alcohol fuelled drug - tastic destinations do at least break the album up . At 12 tracks you could make the argument that they could have pared the thing down by one , perhaps two tracks . Then again given the short running time of most of them perhaps they would have felt like being short - changed . Musically everyone does their allotted job . Were not likely to get a Bohemian Rhapsody from this crew and certainly attitude and conviction of attack is just as much a part of music of this type . Production qualities are fine for this sort of music , pretty much everything is mixed up front and centre and Todd is given plenty of focus which is a good thing since its his selling of a lot of these numbers that comprise some of their strength . A few albums of such ( mostly ) head down hard rock n roll debauchery should be on every rockers shelf . There are a heck of a lot of ones that are probably better than this around but it certainly serves the purpose for all that .","summary":"Pretty darn serviceable.

Rock WitCha is a song with a tremendously catchy beat and melody that persists with the listener ALL DAY LONG ( In my best Bobby Brown voice ) . The catchiness of the song distracts the listener from the somewhat disturbing implications of the song lyrics .

With its sparkling mixture \n   of high - rocking melodies , captivating songwriting , memorable moments and even \n   jubilant virtuosity , A Single Man is a personal and time - honoured classic that truly \n   deserves even greater recognition and equal billing in just the same way his best \n   albums do . Highlighted by a sophisticated track set , the songs are showcased in \n   an array of creative merit and lyrical charm , which begin with the uplifting opening \n   track Shine On Through , which is proceeded by chart - topping hits such as I Do nt \n   Care , Part - Time Love , the totally electrifying Shooting Star , Madness and the ins- \n   trumental Song For Guy , as well as other well - known hits including the jolly music \n   hall favourite Big Dipper , Return To Paradise and even Revere . With lyricist Gary \n   Osborne sitting in for Bernie Taupin ( who briefly left and returned two years later ) , \n   A Single Man provided Elton a change of pace and another shining achievement , \n   and despite the mixed reviews during that time , the albums success have gotten \n   better over the years . Digitally - remastered in its complete expanded edition with \n   stunning grace and honour , you will also get five bonus tracks like Ego , Flinstone \n   Boy , Lovesick and Strangers , where they contribute to the albums classic status \n   that makes it sound 100 % better and a timeless must ! Truly hailed as one of his \n   best and most beloved masterworks , you will definitely have yourself such a jolly \n   good time with this dashing tour de force from the keyboard maestro himself .","summary":"A World Class Masterwork!","unixReviewTime":1398211200,"image":null}

The difference is that the breakup in question was not a romantic one ( or at least I do n't think so ) , but an artistic one - this is the first Elton John album without Bernie Taupin adding lyrics ! Gary Osbourne provides them instead , and where Taupin is blindingly misogynistic , Osbourne is sickeningly obvious - honestly , if I hear one more song that contains the lyric \" Playin ' with my heart ! \" ( i.e. \" It Ai n't Gon na be Easy \" ) , I will get a bunch of other people who are sick of that lyric together and file a class - action suit against every songwriter who ever used the term , which means a lot of money would exchange hands . The good news is that , musically speaking it 's still Elton , and Elton melodies and arrangements were always spot - on - indeed , the strings , guitar , and vibes on \" It Ai n't Gon na be Easy \" are no exception to this rule . All it needs is better lyrics . Sadly , a lot of the \" rockers \" are bitter pills to swallow : \" I Do n't Care \" is drenched in \" good - time \" synths ; \" Part Time Love \" seems forced and has a dated guitar tone ; \" Big Dipper \" sounds too much like \" Suzie ( Dramas ) \" ; \" Madness \" is the closest Elton 's come to arena - rock , and I 'm glad he never came anywhere near again . Elton 's better off when he sticks with balladeering , on gospel - influenced tracks such as \" Shine on Through \" and \" Georgia \" ( with the famed Brit referring to it as \" his home \" - ha ! Stupid Gary Osbourne . And , well ... wait a sec ? What was I doing praising the ballads ? \" Shooting Star \" is a flaming bag of crap left on Taupin 's doorstep ! But the synth - drenched beauty of the instrumental \" Song for Guy \" sure is n't a bag of crap ! It 's a bit long , but still all right . Unlike most the rest , which is not all right at all .","summary":"Untitled Review (Admire my artsiness!)","unixReviewTime":1195689600,"image":null}

Prolific as ever Elton produced 16 tracks 11 of which ended up on this album . The best tracks \" Part Time Love \" , the moving instrumental \" Song for Guy \" and \" Georgia \" ( which sounds like a outtake from \" Honky Chateau \" or \" Tumbleweed Connection\")were catchy with solid melodies and lyrics that if they were somewhat uninspired at times also lacked the excess that dominated Bernie 's lyrics towards the end of their collaborations in the late 70 's and even early 80 's . ) \n\n  Elton severed his relationship with Taupin because of the distance between them ( Taupin lived in the US , Elton the UK and while it was a physical distance it could also be seen as a metaphorical one for their relationship as well ) after the failure of the single \" Ego\"\/\"Flintstone Boy \" in the charts . That failure more had to do with the lack of merit of the songs themselves . While they are n't bad they are second tier Elton John songs and even Bernie 's lyrics fall short . The generic production of John and long time engineer Clive Franks along with the generic arrangements \/ orchestral backing make \" A Single Man \" less than a classic but still worthy of a listen for long time fans . In many respects EJ should have been given a fresh start as he was working with a brand new collaborator ( lyricst Gary Osborne)who had n't had the chance to develop the depth that Taupin 's lyrics had at their best . Osborne 's lyrics are n't horrible -- they're just generic and uninspired for many of the tracks and reflect his work as a jingle writer ( Osborne also was a member of the rock band Vigrass & Osborne and produced two fine albums during the early 70 's before turning to jingle writing neither one of which is currently inprint ) . Elton would further stumble with the dreadful \" Victim of Love \" ( which he did not write and , in fact , was contractually obligatated to provide only lead vocals for)one of the worst albums recorded by a major rock act ( along with John Lennon 's \" Two Virgins \" , \" Life with the Lions \" & \" Sometime in New York City \" and Mick Jagger 's first two solo albums ) . \" A Single Man \" is n't a dreadful or horrible album and has some nice tracks that make pleasant listening . EJ was trying to reestablish himself after his star began falling in the late 70 's . This was the first step and we 'd see a nice return to form on some of the tracks for \" 21 at 33 \" , \" Jump Up\",\"The Fox \" ( many of the tracks for this album were leftovers from \" 21 at 33 \" ) before a full return to form with \" Too Low for Zero \" in 1983 .","summary":"Solid Elton John album has its share of filler","unixReviewTime":1149292800,"image":null}

His work has honestly withstood the test of time , and his songs have honestly gotten much better with age , unlike many of today 's singers . He has honestly written some of the most timeless love songs that have ever been made , with Bernie Taupin with lyrics at hand at heart . But , throughout the 80 's , Elton has not been the dynamite singer \/ songwriter that had came out the decade before . But nevertheless , he has had some excellent songs that really have made their mark . Sacrifice has honestly been one of those songs that not only withstands the test of time , it is truthfully his best love song that came out that decade . The song definitely is a joy to listen to through the simplicity of the heart , each and every time it is heard .

Hard to believe he and Bernie Taupin will be soon celebration 50 years of remarkable songwriting at the soul . But very rarely Elton John has done songwriting away from Bernie Taupin and worked with others . That has been the case with Tim Rice & The Lion King , or Gary Osbourne , whom had written a few classic gems with Elton that have been with his status . Blue Eyes is absolutely one of those classic songs . The song shows a midnight contemporary soul that swoons at the heart . From Elton , it not only came a hit , but from Elton it came out at a time when his music was n't being fashionable in the 80 's . Elton was still under heartbreak from when he came out in the 70 's as a gay musician , and he was finding himself again in a era where MTV was beginning . This is a great download for any die hard Elton John fan . \n\n Song : B+","summary":"Blue Soul","unixReviewTime":1456963200,"image":null}

But back in the 80 's , when the industry was starting to second guess Elton , he had some songs that were away from what he did best with Bernie Taupin , that showed well in some tracks like Mama Ca n't Buy Me Love and Blue Eyes . Blue Eyes which he wrote with Gary Osbourne is one of those forgotten gems of Elton 's that definitely is a pleasure to listen to . It is a simplistic song that shows Elton 's character at heart well in songs .

At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease . One of the nice things about this album is it has some of the restraint Jackson used with the Modern Jazz Quartet . However , Peterson 's piano is a major contrast to John Lewis ' of the MJQ and that contrast makes this album interesting . For one thing , Peterson and bassist Ray Brown were renown for intensity even on ballads , and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well . Despite my alluding to intensity , the music comes across as relaxed and laid back . They made it sound so easy ! When you closely listen the intensity is there under a layer of virtuosity and musicality . This is Jackson and Peterson 's trio at their finest in my opinion . Since there is no track list ( as I write this ) I am providing one for reference : Work Song 7:35 A Wonderful Guy 4:57 \n  6 . Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions , two of which are logged as ' untitled Peterson originals ' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue . Regardless , the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile .","summary":"Wonderful pairing","unixReviewTime":1443657600,"image":null}

But I actually have some memories with this song ( some good , some not so good ) . I was working as a cashier at the now closed - down grocery store and every weekend I 'd go to one of the local bars to just converse and people watch with my aunt and a friend just so we could get out the house . Also , before that , I had moved out of the house temporarily ( for like a week or two ) because me and my mom were at each other 's necks and this CD among many accompanied me . The album version is not butchered for I have the CD so I expect this version to be the same as on the CD . Lil ' Kim 's verse is in full effect . The beat is fun , in a few ways sounds dated , but still good . The little twinkle effect to it is pretty tight even 2 years later . I ca n't believe it 's been that long ! In the song , Keyshia is talking about how if a man is no longer acting right , and making you cry , let him go , set him free and be a better person for it . This song features Missy Elliot and Lil ' Kim on the guest spots with Missy 's occasional take over of the song with her \" shout out 's \" . But if you have n't heard it or even seen the video , I strongly , strongly suggest you do . It 's a song to add to the party playlist if you do n't mind going back 2 years .","summary":"Was my party jam of late 2007\/early 2008.

I do n't get it - how do you get on MTV Unplugged and belt out this beautiful ballad but major radio stations do n't know your song ?

I enjoy this song as it seems to have an encouraging message of seeing the glass half full in life and because of the creative metaphor of describing rock n roll being given to everyone metaphorically speaking .

It is my most favorite track among their many great songs . It also stands up to the passage of time very well .. This remix sounds a bit brighter that I recall but that may be some electronic wizardry reducing or eliminating the hiss , hum and noise inherent in the analog audio technology of that time . It retains the original feel for me and I think this remix is a success ( and not all are ! ) . Coming of age and playing guitar in a local rock band in the late 60 's through early 70 's made Traffic 's music an important part of my soundtrack for those days . No question I 'm predisposed to love this music and it   brings back memories and feelings from some of the best times of my life . Because it 's such a great song with a successful remastering , brings back good feelings from my youth and it holds up so well over decades I 'm giving Glad a solid 5 stars . I think is one of several great intros to Traffic for someone unfamiliar with the band .","summary":"Perhaps The Best Rock Insturmental Eveer, Important Part Of The Soundtrack Of My Youth, Holds Up Over Time","unixReviewTime":1473552000,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81WKGySZZmL._SY88.jpg"]}

When I had heard about the devastating death of Dolores O ' Riordan , whom had fronted the cranberries throughout the 90 's , I was shocked . It is so sad that she would die in the same way that we had lost George Michael a little over a year ago . She had a unique gift , but sadly , she let it go to waste , just as much with the same demons that plagued other divas whom had died young like Amy Winehouse and Whitney Houston . When I do think of their music , I think of it as a ladies ' alternative to the success that U2 had garnered throughout the decades in hard rock . There have been some of The Cranberries songs that still do stand out today , but Linger was the first hit that still remains as stark and haunting , as the day it had came out . It truly is a song worth noticing from the soul , especially if you have never heard a Cranberries song before . This is the song that I sincerely recommend that you do go to first , as a everlasting memory to Dolores .","summary":"Forever Lingered","unixReviewTime":1515974400,"image":null}

My two favorite tracks were of course her magnum opus Poetry Man which gave her star status out of the starting gate with her first album ; and secondly her fantastic take on The Beatles Do n't Let Me Down . I wanted these two replaced so badly , I purchased them as digital downloads for my phone music player as soon I saw the 2001 release of the VERY BEST OF CD which expands on the original by 6 more tracks . Ms Snow 's first and foremost talent is that four - octave bluesy contralto that was unique in the 70 's and still is today ( sadly she passed 6 years ago last month ) ; then there is her unique finger play on \" lead \" acoustic guitar , a velvety touch with lilting grace that hammers at just the right accent spots for making her music style all her own . Poetry Man is also a one - of - a - kind piece of musical art , it seems to occupy a space somewhere between jazz , folk , and the blues , a space where there seems to be no competition and was simply way ahead of its time . The closest in musical style you can come to it is Dave Matthews ' work , his own being an artistic spot where the three genre experiment with each other , close but not quite like Phoebe Snow . Her Calypso inflected Beatles cover is also highly unique and Snow just owns it . One of my favorite songs by my favorite artist , she took it from them and bent it slightly around the middle , making a blues rock composition into a Caribbean gospel folk ballad . The Gospel Choir never overwhelms Snow 's perfect - pitched delivery and her soft - scat coda . If you download either of these two gems , and you seriously love them ( how can you not ? ) then I urge you with all sincerity to grab hold of the VERY BEST OF PHOEBE SNOW CD .","summary":"Phoebe Snow at her Absolute Best","unixReviewTime":1494288000,"image":null}

This re - mastered MCA CD is enjoyable from first bar to last . Jamal lays back in the groove with Israel Crosby on bass and drummer Vernel Fournier , and gives the obviously appreciative audience a rollicking good time . Jamal is one of the greatest ever jazz pianists . His virtuoso playing is surprisingly accessible and easy to listen to . This is not just Ahmed and his rhythm section but a tight trio who obviously loved playing together , with space given to the other musicians to shine . The trio work through 16 great numbers ; a couple of the band 's own compositions ( the opening title track and ` Seleritus ' ) and improvisation around some well - known icons from the canon - ` Autumn Leaves ' , ` Stompin at the Savoy ' ( listen out for a subtle and witty reference to the French National Anthem ) and ` Cheek to Cheek ' stand out , but there is nothing less than very good here , and much which is truly outstanding . This is the kind of very high quality , relaxing and almost chill - out CD you can ( and probably will ) play again and again at home , as background to many activities , in the car and anywhere you care to be accompanied by good music which is not too insistent , does n't mind if you ca n't give it your full attention but rewards you if you can . It 's in the same general groove as ` Kind of Blue ' and Cannonball Adderley 's ` Something Else ' . Miles was a great fan of Jamal 's playing , which comes as no surprise .","summary":"Jamal gets in the groove in Chicago","unixReviewTime":1299715200,"image":null}

As the early days of Rock n Roll were unfolding , starring such scorching uptempo rockers as Chuck Berry , Bill Haley and the Comets , Little Richard , and Jerry Lee Lewis , there were also groups who were very successful singing ballads . One such group was The Platters , who could go uptempo , but sold millions of records singing songs that were mostly from the Great American Songbook . Thus they created great hits which reverberate to this day : \" Twilight Time \" , \" Smoke Gets In Your Eyes \" , and \" Red Sails In The Sunset \" . They also sang ballads unique to them like \" Only You \" , \" The Great Pretender \" , and \" I 'm Sorry \" . One of their hits was a unique version of \" Harbor Lights \" with the captivating 20 second introduction and ending which includes the sounds of ocean tides , a fog horn , ship 's bell , seagull 's , swirling violins , and a french horn \/ oboe before The Platters enter . And when they do , the marvelous , emotional voice of lead singer Tony Williams states the lyrics with the soothing background group of Zola Taylor , David Lynch , Paul Robi , and Herb Reed backed by strings , flutes , and ukulele . A memorable , hit performance . My Highest Recommendation . Five LOVELY Stars !","summary":"BLAST FROM THE PAST: THE PLATTERS SING ''HARBOR LIGHTS\"","unixReviewTime":1454025600,"image":null}

What I love about this one is his rhythm section ( especially Roy Haynes on drums ) and the spontaneity of each track . Bassist Richard Davis is also spot on in the rhythm section . Run through the sound samples to get a sense of the flow and how telepathically connected the trio is . Haynes sometimes seems a little busy , but it somehow fits . Davis lays a solid foundation and Burrell just seems to float over the whole thing . I have an instructional video from Burrell that explains his approach to music and guitar and this album epitomizes the advice . Clearly he emphasizes the music using his guitar as a conduit for his deep knowledge of how music should fit together . Of course , he is a master of the instrument as well as a musical genius . This album is possibly from the September 16 , 1959 performance . There is an extended version that is called ' Complete Edition ' that contains four additional tracks that I believe are from the September 17 performance causing confusion as to whether the original release covered both days . Frankly I do not think it matters , but I am always trying to be as accurate as possible regarding discographies and related information . If you know for certain please comment . One final note : the album captures audience interaction , but not mid song . This adds to the ambiance without detracting from enjoying each note . Plus the recording quality is excellent in my opinion .","summary":"An essential Kenny Burrell album","unixReviewTime":1452297600,"image":null}

I loved the glossiness of the sleeve , the glossy smell ... hey , it still has it ! And the cover , with all the moving pictures meanings : men moving the pictures , people weeping due to being emotionally moved by the pictures and , on the back , the realization that this is a movie , aka a moving picture . Pretty clever , eh ? \n\n Lady crying because they are taking away her favorite painting : Naked Man in Pentagram . Hey Lou , how much we gettin paid to carry around the painting of the woman on fire ? Do n't touch the painting , kid . I would sit there studying the entire cover and sleeve as the record played ... transfixed and mystified . Tom Sawyer challenged my 13 year old brain , first because the name of the song was a children 's book character I knew about , but the lyrics were esoteric and spoke of \" today 's Tom Sawyer \" , a different one , a warrior , with ' mean mean pride . Fantastic opening synthesizer and drums . The heavy crunch of guitar . The singer with the high - pitched shriek . \n\n Catch the mystery ... \n\n Today 's Tom Sawyer he gets high on you and the space he invades he gets by on you .... 1:33 the trippy modulated synth of Geddy Lee . 2:00 the radical angular guitar solo of Alex Lifeson . 2:32 and 2:36 Neil Peart 's amazing drum fills that are my favorite moments of the song . He knows changes are n't permanent - but change is . ( he put a twist on it there , you see ) . catch the spirit catch the spit .

As Martha recalls \" As part of my job I had to audition other artists , schedule musicians , maintain studio logs and be ' girl - friday ' to all the writers and producers . If I clapped or sang background on sessions that was an additional $ 5.00 each . \" Like so many other artists who came to work at Motown in the early days , Martha Reeves just wanted to get her foot in the door . You see in her spare time she was the lead singer of a local Detroit group known as the Del - Fi 's . Her ultimate goal was to get an audition and get a recording contract for her group . Soon the Del - Fi 's were hired to sing background on several of Marvin Gaye 's early records . Berry Gordy quickly realized that these girls were something special . The group changed its name to Martha and the Vandellas and within just a few months the group was riding high on the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single \" Come And Get These Memories \" . It was the beginning of a fabulous run for this extremely talented and highly energetic group . Motown wasted little time in issuing the follow - up single . Released in early August 1963 \" ( Love Is Like A ) Heat Wave \" would become one of the biggest records of that summer peaking at # 4 . To me the pulsating sounds of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were the personification of Motown 's moniker \" The Sound of Young America \" and this is one of the finest examples .","summary":"The original 1964 hit recording!","unixReviewTime":1468800000,"image":null}

I had even heard 2112 , so I still wonder why it took me so long to hear Working Man . Perhaps because the internet was n't around yet ? The opening guitar riff is like poured concrete , reinforced by industrial strength bass and drums . Similar to Light My Fire in that it follows the vocals - long instrumental - vocals pattern . Geddy Lee sings about the day to day pattern of a guy doing the typical 9 - 5 job . At 2:05 , Geddy plays a descending bass line and the tempo kicks up into Alex Lifeson 's guitar solo that lasts just long enough to enjoy a nice cold beer . When a Cleveland radio station began playing it , many listeners thought it was a new Led Zeppelin song . Rush 's first album is definitely in that vein , since Neil Peart had n't yet joined to apply his PhD in Science Fiction lyrics . Man , I feel like Homer Simpson talking about Grand Funk Railroad and Mountain in the Homerpalooza episode . Stupid Millhouse asking to change the station . Those smug little brats are the ones with no taste . Lame . Classic rock rules .","summary":"NOV 12","unixReviewTime":1498176000,"image":null}

But I think Rush 's The Spirit of Radio is the best of the bunch . The guitar riff is like my dog suddenly jumping on me in the morning , wake up and play and be happy ! A big slobbery kiss at 0:04 , I try to roll over but she just jumps over to that side as well , bounding all about . Finally at 0:17 I have surrendered to her will and I am up . Look out the window , turn on the coffee , eat some breakfast , get dressed , grab the leash and treats and baggies , and then at 0:42 we hit the open road for a walk . Begin the day with a friendly voice , a companion unobtrusive ... well , I ca n't continue with the dog analogy because at 5 in the morning her voice is loud and obnoxious , and when we are out walking in the neighborhood she can occasionally be quite obtrusive . However , she is a very friendly companion . The Spirit of Radio is about ... drum roll ... radio ! The joy and beauty of music coming through the speakers , dancing around you on the airwaves , undemanding contact in your happy solitude . At 1:24 , bass drum pounds and the first guitar riff returns , and another lyrical section about ... the radio ! Is n't it amazing ! A gift beyond price . We ca n't see the airwaves , but we pick up on the sounds entering our ears , our bright antennae bristle with the energy , and the translation through our minds produces emotional feedback . Of course , although one likes to believe in the freedom of music , radio is a business , and there are glittering prizes and endless compromises going on behind the scenes that shatter the illusion of integrity , yeah . Check out that tumbling down moment at 3:36 , it 's the exasperation of dealing with the radio executive , the schmoozing DJ , the Biz . But Rush pick themselves up for an introspective moment : For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall . They record the music and radio helps sell their albums , and the band members makes their livings this way , so buck up and deal with it . Did they think adding a reggae groove would help ? Well , it did n't . This whole discussion of radio has made them bitter and reflective , so they decide to release their emotions with a sizzling guitar solo that extends out into their listeners ' brains and by the end everyone is happy . And now , a thousand words from our sponsors , followed by a 90 minute classic rock music marathon , and we will only play songs you 've already heard a zillion times because if you hear anything unfamiliar it might be considered obtrusive and we 'd get in trouble with the FCC .","summary":"SEP 17","unixReviewTime":1497225600,"image":null}

The Billboard charts were filled with so many new and exciting sounds . When one thinks of 60 's music the British Invasion and Motown immediately come to mind . But there were a number of other sounds that made an impact in the 1960 's as well . Sergio Mendes brought his unique blend of Brazilian , jazz and American pop styles to America for the first time in 1966 . His music was an instant sensation . Although Sergio Mendes himself did not sing , he was the pianist , arranger , producer and musical director of this unique group . Led by vocalist Lani Hall , Sergio Mendes and Brasil ' 66 would produce some of the most innovative sounds of the late 60 's . The group 's second major hit in the USA was a remake of a Lennon - McCartney tune from The Beatles \" Magical Mystery Tour \" album released less than six months earlier . Sergio Mendes re - imagined \" The Fool On the Hill \" and recorded it in his own inimitable style . The record buying public loved it as it spent 12 weeks on the charts and peaked at # 6 . Yet another great record for the group from South America .","summary":"One of the big hits from the summer of '68.","unixReviewTime":1466208000,"image":null}

From the album The Best of Spanky & Our Gang , 20th Century Masters , The Millennium Collection , this is the short - lived , so - called sunshine pop vocal and instrumental group , Spanky & Our Gang performing their lovely , swinging performance of their classic hit song , Like To Get To Know You that continues to get lots of airplay by the oldies but goodies radio stations . The group was led by Elaine Spanky McFarlane whose sultry , attractive , distinctive voice gave the group its unique vocal sound . The Our Gang septet members were : Malcolm Hale , Nigel Pickering , Paul Oz Bach , John Seiter , Kenny Hodges , and Lefty Baker , all on vocals , plus Max Bennett on bass , Larry Knechtel on piano , Mike Deasy on guitar , and Hal Blaine on drums , and an 11 piece string section . Unfortunately , arranger \/ guitarist Malcolm Hale died in an accident and the group chose to not go on without him in 1969 . But their marvelous music , which transcends musical genres , has been re - packaged several time in re - issues and is thankfully available in the digital MP3 era . This one song alone shows they were already talented artists who could mix genres in creating highly - attractive vocal and instrumentally rhythmic music \n\n The song Like To Get To Know You was written by producer Stuart Scharf and is about the search for love . Arranger Hale creates a marvelous shifting musical setting combining rock , latin , jazz , and classical musical devices . It is actually built on a subtle latin beat and uses an advanced musical pedal point that can be repeated endlessly if desired : a form that jazz men Ahmad Jamal , Miles Davis , and John Coltrane used to great advantage as modal music . Legendary drummer Blaine , the most recorded drummer in recording history , whips up a subtle storm behind the group throughout the performance . The song Like To Get To Know You is a favorite that is begins with an attractive buoyant drum beat , violins , and a comping piano over drum rimshots . The song is build on the infectious repetition of call - response lyrics like I d like to get to know you ' , ( \" yes I would \" ): \" I d like to get to know you \" , ( \" if I could ) and so on . The male members and Spanky trade lyrics until Spanky enters alone on the bridge with a sassy delivery which continues on with the main lyric and the refrain . Then suddenly comes a lovely , idyllic interlude with ethereal echoes , strings , and guitars which sets the stage for a pretty vocal coda that includes the male voices and Spankys voice in another call - response phase that vamps to the fadeout . What a marvelous performance and a feat of studio engineering ! My Highest Recommendation . Five APPEALING Stars .","summary":"SPANKY AND OUR GANG IN A FABULOUS CROSS-GENRE SONG - LIKE TO GET TO KNOW YOU","unixReviewTime":1512259200,"image":null}

A great many people despised the so - called \" bubblegum \" music in those days . But this music was better than that . I never knew anyone who disliked The Grass Roots . Lead singer Rob Grilli and the gang simply made outstanding pop singles . In August of 1968 Dunhill \/ ABC released \" Midnight Confessions \" . Peaking at # 5 it would prove to be the group 's biggest hit and best selling single .

But honestly , there are some singers from years ago that really have not been able to be ageless , and their songs have shown that they are never sounding tired or annoying as products , but soulful people . Sting is one of those singers that has shown to be completely ageless . When he was a part of The Police , he had some great songs with the group . But since he started his solo career on his own in the 80 's , he has still shown brilliant growth in his songwriting . I think that is why his songs have never gotten out of date , they have instead been better with age like a fine glass of wine . One of my favorite songs of his from Nothing Like The Sun is fragile . The song is so intimate from the soul and sincerely cathartic at the guitar chords . It is one of those songs that has not been beautiful , but sincerely deep at the heart . I love how simple and beautiful the song is , and all this time never gotten old .

His solo songs away from The Police have made him more of a brilliant songwriter , and just timeless with each and every note . One of Sting 's deepest songs , Fragile from his second album , Nothing Like The Sun has remained brilliant and vividly deep from the soul he has sung it with every time you listen to him .

The LP 's back cover has the memorial service eulogy given by Cardinal Richard Cushing of Massachusetts , and the lying in state remarks of House Speaker John McCormack ( of Boston ) , Chief Justice Earl Warren ( former Gov. of CA . ) and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield ( of MT . ) . Mansfield 's comments were briefest , but also the most moving : \n\n \" There was a sound of laughter ; in a moment , it was no more . And so she took a ring from her finger There was a husband who asked much and gave much , and out of the giving and the asking wove with a woman what could not be broken in life , and in a moment it was no more . And so she took a ring from her finger and placed it in his hands , and kissed him A piece of each of us died at that moment . death he gave of himself to us . He gave us of a good heart from which the laughter came . profound wit , from which a great leadership emerged .

MILLER 'S GREATEST HITS , WILL SUCCESS SPOIL MRS . MILLER , and THE COUNTRY SOUL OF MRS . MILLER . As any of you fellow Millerites know , there was another album , MRS . MILLER DOES HER THING on Amaret just after Capitol , and a smattering of non - Lp sides on a few obscure 45s . ' Twould be nice for a complete set of her recordings , if , oh , say , Rhino Hand Made is listening \/ reading this . I give this set , ( in)glorious though it may be , three stars because , well , the cover art does n't do justice to the package in place of whatever photographs that Capitol has buried away , and this set chops up what should have been a killer Capitol small box for not very much money . To get most ( not quite all , but most ) of her output , you needs have this set and a needle - drop boot which was lovingly put together , THE TURNED - ON WORLD OF MRS . MILLER . It 's simply time to put out a definitive set while CDs are still being made as the geezer format of choice . The only artist comparable to Mrs. Miller to generate yowls of \" Turn it down ! \" , \" What is that @#$ & ? \" , and \" Ca n't you play something else ! ? ! \" whenever I play this on the speakers is Nico . I seriously , seriously doubt , however , that the greatest of all inspiration , The Inimitable Sam Sacks ( Arliss 3301 ) , will ever see loving restoration .

The songs , music and sound are all excellent . In a collection such as this there are great variations . The songs are almost impossible to pin down as to dates , and there are instances where one set of lyrics may have several melodies , or where a melody may have any number of different lyrics . Me Not on the Lone Prairie\",for example , is one of these . The basics has been traced to South Dakota in the early 1900's , but the song spread from there throughout the west . ,and had many tunes and lyrics . \" The Old Chisolm Trail \" has many variations . These hard of the trail working cowboys all knew there were wild times in the end that made up for the drudgery they went through on the trail . The beautiful \" Streets of Larado\",also known as \" The Cowboy 's Lament \" was sung throughout the American and Canadian west . It is believed this song is of Irish origin , and has many different tunes and lyrics . The song \" Home on the Range \" is one of the best kpown and loved songs of the west . All the songs included make this one of the best collections one can find that represent the best songs that were so much of the west , and even after the days when they were sung at campsites along the trail;they became an intregal part of all western movies . For a list of all the songs check out   and even sample the MP3 version . There are several Reviewers who feel the re mastered versions are not as good as they hoped for . My original vinyl album has a cover showing cowboys alongside the herd . There are two very similar photographs shown here.with a cowboy in the forground . One has the rider facing the herd , in mine that same rider is facing leftward ..","summary":"These are some of the best western songs ,and played as well as you'll find anywhere.","unixReviewTime":1451174400,"image":null}

Most folks will be familiar with the songs he wrote that became hits by other artists ( \" Crazy \" , Patsy Cline ; \" Night Life \" , Ray Price , etc . ) , and he has re - recorded many of these since on other albums . But these are all the originals , remastered in outstanding sound quality ! This double CD package has 50 songs in all and is a MUST HAVE for not only Willie fans , but also those who love the old - style country songs . There is a brief but synopsis of Willie 's life & recording career right up to the 2013 release date .

Billy Stewart was discovered by the legendary Bo Diddley who was so impressed by his ability to play the piano that he asked Billy to join his band back in 1956 . Diddley even got Stewart a recording contract with his record label Chess in the late 1950s . Nothing much came of it for a couple of years but beginning in 1962 he made several outstanding and really unique records . Most oldies fans will probably recall a couple of Billy 's earliest hits including \" I Do Love You \" and the magnificent \" Sitting In the Park \" from the golden year 1964 . But Billy wanted to appeal to a wider audience and was willing to take chances to achieve that goal . In 1966 he recorded the LP \" Billy Stewart Teaches Old Standards New Tricks \" . The first single released from that album was Billy 's rollicking interpretation of the George Gershwin classic \" Summertime \" . I think Ol' George would have approved . That tune would go on to become one of the surprise hits of 1966 . Billys amazing vocal performance on this record will simply blow you away !","summary":"An unforgettable vocal performance!","unixReviewTime":1465257600,"image":null}

It 's so energetic that you just want to get up and dance . It 's a shame Stewart died in a car accident at the age of 32 in 1970 . I suggest downloading Carmen McRae 's more standard version of Summertime as well , because it really sets off how wonderful this song is and how it can be interpreted so wonderfully in two different ways and still be incredible .","summary":"High-energy scat singing that's soulful and energetic","unixReviewTime":1456012800,"image":null}

Diddley even got Stewart a recording contract with his record label Chess in the late 1950s . Nothing much came of it for a couple of years but beginning in 1962 he made several outstanding and really unique records . Billy finally struck pay dirt in the summer of 1965 with a beautiful song called \" Sitting In The Park \" .

He recorded \" bubblegum \" music before the term was even coined . After his wildly successful debut single , 1962 's \" Sheila \" , Tommy Roe went on to make 21 more appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart over the next decade . A strong argument can be made that his 1966 Top Ten smash \" Sweet Pea \" was really the very first \" bubblegum \" hit . Recall that the term \" bubblegum \" did not appear until the heyday of Buddah records in 1968 - 1969 with groups like Ohio Express and the 1910 Fruitgum Co. At least one reviewer has complained that this is NOT the original recording . I think he is correct but it really does not vary all that much from the original . More likely than not this was an alternate take from the same recording session .","summary":"Top Ten hit from the summer of 1966.","unixReviewTime":1468368000,"image":null}

Elton John though has one of those musicians that has made the most brilliant and striking music for nearly 50 years . What he and Bernie Taupin have made musically , has been so dynamic all of this time , it has been 10x much better than a lot of the joke artists that have been on radio today . Still , it is so surprising that many artists that are out there now , do n't really have the sincerity that he has had , even when Elton John was still battling his demons . Some of Elton 's songs today are so strong , he just does n't perform them so much . Empty Garden ( Hey , Hey Johnny ) is one of them that really is so intimate it speaks louder than words . It was written for the loving memory of John Lennon , whom sadly was murdered outside of his home back in 1980 . I still love this song today , because it speaks louder than words at the heart , and is very intimate from the soul of the ivories . This is a lovely song Elton John made , and this is worth downloading to your music library .","summary":"Garden Bloom","unixReviewTime":1456358400,"image":null}

What he had done with Bernie Taupin 's lyrics , he has shown with the test of time that great songwriting can sincerely come from the heart . But it can also be a sincere memory of someone very important in life . That was the case with John Lennon , who was a close friend of his , which he trusted Elton as being the godfather to Sean Lennon , his only child with Yoko Ono . The song Empty Garden is very beautiful , and a dear poignant memory to the sadness of the day that John Lennon was tragically murdered in 1980 . The song still is a portrait of the sadness we all still feel , with the death still a vivid sadness of a artist taken too soon .

Elton John , as did Eric Clapton came back from the DrugDead as few entertainers did in the day . This song always does it for me deep inside as I did fully appreciate Elton John , seeing him many times but I never did see Lennon . It makes me feel that John also was my friend who has gone .

As Anvil often does , this album has a heavy Motrhead vibe going on , imo .

Stutheit","reviewText":"Sure , Toronto , Ontario 's Anvil may have formed like a million years ago -- all the way back in the late Seventies . But they sure as heck still have plenty of life and spark left in them . There 's plenty of hiss and vinegar involved in their music ( and albums like their thirteenth full - length studio release , 2009 's aptly - entitled \" This Is Thirteen . \" ) Plus , this also means that their sound may sound a little bit dated to the uneducated metalhead . But even if it is a familiar thrash \/ speed metal mash - up , bare in mind that Anvil came before -- and , thus , were a big influence on -- bands like Metallica , Testament , Anthrax , Voivod , etc . So even if every stooge that has formed since 1978 sounds like them , it does n't friggin ' matter because these guys were the original ! And man , oh man , can Anvil still shred as mightily as ever -- their riffing remains rock solid and musclebound , their leads tight and precise , and their solos positively excellent throughout these thirteen cuts . \" This Is Thirteen \" gets underway with the ominously crunching , churning guitar licks and Bruce Dickinson - influenced vocals of the title track before eventually morphing into an epic , unorthodox solo section . The album really gets its ball moving , though , with the ensuing \" Bombs Away , \" as it is a truly blistering thrash - fest with propulsive chainsaw riffing and shredding solos . ( So when frontman \" Lips \" proudly proclaims the titular phrase -- \" bombs away ! \" -- in this song , it seems ever - so fitting . ) \" Burning Bridges \" returns the record to its Iron Maiden - worshipping roots , though , as it boasts a catchy , galloping beat threaded by a strong bass line and really deft and thumping drum fills . Some more excellent and fairly wailing solo work goes along with it , too . \" Ready To Fight \" also wears its influences on its sleeve , but is clearly looks to other , different bands for inspiration . Indeed , with its steady bass lines , undeniable speed punk tinges , brisk double bass thudding , and memorable vocals , plays like a vintage Motorhead classic . And it also has some more exceptional soloing , to boot . And skipping ahead a few tracks , \" Feed The Greed \" is another very catchy and Motorhead - esque number , and one whose excellence is furthered by its fiery , twiddly guitar solo runs . Other highlights include the epically anthemic , soaring vocals in \" Flying Blind \" ; \" Big Business , \" which is an insanely hooky , mid - tempo chugger that reminds of Megadeth 's \" Sweating Bullets \" ; \" American Refugee , \" another chunky , chug - happy number with still more ripping solos ; and \" Should ' a Would ' a Could ` a \" and \" Game Over , \" both of which are positively blistering inclusions , are both backed by fiery , chunked - up , belligerent riffing , and more unforgettably catchy choruses . Anvil might not exactly be set out to engrave a piece of thrash \/ speed metal wheel reinvention into the minds of listeners . But as far as being a very enjoyable , original , frills - free blast of pure energy with musical chops galore , they do not at all disappoint . Sure , there might be a couple of tracks too many on \" This Is Thirteen , \" a thirteen - track , and nearly - hour - long set . Um ... I'll leave that up to you to figure out .","summary":"Anvil prove that they are an oldie but goodie","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"image":null}

Please read accordingly . Another extremely expensive soundtrack remastering from the Star Trek film franchise , this one is actually two albums sailing under one flag . The first disc has the original film score as it is in the movie , remastered , with the cues at full length . The second has the remastered original soundtrack , which featured ( and still features ) alternate versions of some of the cues which Horner actually preferred to the ones used in the film itself . All this is explained in the lavish booklet , which is a very nice affair , many pages long , with a potted history of the recordings and detailed sections on each cue on the film soundtrack . The music itself borrows heavily the themes first heard on \" Wrath of Khan \" while tweaking them to give them a new character . It 's early days yet , but I think this is going to end up being a contender for my favorite ST soundtrack ( currently set to \" Kahn \" ) . The recording is exquisite , everything a remastering should be . The pieces are restored without heating them so much they drown out details . And right at the end of the film soundtrack disc is a medley heard   while McCoy is trying to scare up a ride to Genesis . It is a very amusing little piece with deliberately en - blanded muzak versions of classics like \" That Old Black Magic \" , \" Tangerine \" and \" I Remember You \" . Expensive , as I said , but worth the cost for me ( and a much better experience on first encounter than the movie itself ) .","summary":"Horner Masterpiece Remastered Beautifully","unixReviewTime":1494806400,"image":null}

While I enjoyed much of his work as lead guitarist with The Beatles I was really not too sure that he could make it as a solo artist . My doubts were quickly dispelled in the late fall of 1970 when Harrison released his epic 3 LP set \" All Things Must Pass \" . George Harrison 's debut LP as a solo act was an immediate smash . In the years that followed I found that much to my surprise George 's work as a solo artist was by far the most interesting to me of all of the Fab Four . One of my very favorite Harrison tunes was his 1987 cover version of James Ray 's 1962 hit \" I 've Got My Mind Set On You \" . Much to everyone 's surprise the release would become George Harrison 's last # 1 record . I think it is fair to say that in this case the re - make is much better than the original .","summary":"Voted one of the 10 best George Harrison songs ever.","unixReviewTime":1465862400,"image":null}

This cd has everything you can ask for :   Great lyrics , amazing guitar solos , amazing vocals , and the drums and bass add that extra kick to the music . This cd shows what this band is capable of doing when the big record companies are n't controlling the songs , the sound , and the length of the album . I know Ashes Remain had to sign with a big label to make it in the music business , but the talking heads at record companies usually ruin the sound of the band . Now the new \" What I 've Become \" is not a bad cd , but all the songs are only two and a half to three minutes long and no guitar solos and the overall sound of the album is a lot like fifteen more Christian rock bands .. \" Last Day Breathing \" is totally original from the first note of the album to the last . The more you listen to this cd , the more you will like it . IT IS SIMPLY AWESOME ! ! ! ! ! You can get the mp3 from amazon , but if you want the physical cd , you can get it from the Ashes Remain website for only ten dollars . This will be the best ten bucks you ever spent if you love great rock with a positive message and fantastic guitar .

Guitarist Johannes Luley sounds so much like Steve Howe in spots on this disc that you could almost swear it was Howe doing the playing . The vocals are high pitched and though not exactly like Jon Anderson there certainly are similarities . For a debut album this is very very good . The compositions range in length from just over 5 minutes to the 13 minute epic \" Salvo \" . The music here is top notch progressive rock of the highest caliber . The vocals are unique and varied . The lyrics get slightly clichd here and there , but overall they are very good as well .

But Rivers has taken this to an entirely new level by digging into his musical treasure chest and sharing a bunch of demos , of old and previously unheard songs alike . \" Alone : The Home Recording of Rivers Cuomo \" ( 18 tracks ; 47 min . ) is not only a fascinating look into the writing process of Rivers , but on top of that brings some pretty good music too . Most interesting are the demos of songs intended for the eventually shelved second album \" Songs from the Black Hole \" ( instead \" Pinkerton \" was released ) , which as they are heard here almost play like a musical ( \" Blast Off \" , \" Dude , We 're Finally Landing \" , \" Superfriend \" and \" Lover in the Snow \" ) . In spirit they certainly are closer to Pinkerton than the Blue Album . Other interesting items : the 1995 track \" Wanda ( You 're My Only Love ) \" , a rejected song for the \" Angus \" movie soundtrack ( instead \" You Gave Your Love \" made it on the soundtrack ) ; \" This Is the Way \" , cut from the \" Make Believe \" album ; the cover \" Little Diane \" ( recorded in 2003 ) ; and the closing track \" I Was Made for You \" ( from 2004 \" ) . In all , this album plays surprisingly well , even if obviously the recording quality is not optimal . But a contributing factor to making this album so enjoyable are the lines notes from Rivers . And no , they are not just a line or two pre song , they fill pages and pages as Rivers explains in detail the background of each song ( and the lyrics are also printed ) . In all , while of course this does not break any new musical ground as such , this set is essential for any serious Weezer fan .","summary":"Essential for any serious Weezer fan","unixReviewTime":1207008000,"image":null}

Krieger wrote most of the song , including the first verse and chorus . Jim Morrison wrote the verse that contained wallow in the mire and love become a funeral pyre . The song opens with the crack of a drum followed by some baroque - esque keyboard from Ray Manzarek . The lyrics are bookends for the vast instrumental middle section that begins at 1:07 and lasts until 5:42 ( about 65 % of the song ) . I like the little chord twist that happens after the second Come on baby light my fire , at 0:32 . As far as the instrumental section goes , I enjoy the keyboard stuff but I am really into Robby 's guitar . It comes in at 3:18 and has all kinds of cascading lines up and down the neck and interesting modal sequences . John Densmore 's drums have some great moments of their own , little fills here and there , keeping it all grooving along . It 's a classic song , covered by many artists including Jose Feliciano , Shirley Bassey and Stevie Wonder .","summary":"NOV 11","unixReviewTime":1498176000,"image":null}

Having the CD means this song can surprise you if you are n't paying attention . ' In My Time of Dying ' has a few moments of quiet talk before it completely finishes . Then , bam , the metallic ' Houses of the Holy ' guitar jumps right out of your speakers , and if you 're playing the album loudly , which of course you should be doing , the effect can be even more dramatic . It has happened to me many times , and I am always amazed . Surprisingly , Led Zeppelin never played this song in concert . Perhaps the opening riff would have shocked the audience .

It has that ' getting darker earlier ' feel to it - leaves blanket the ground , the sunlight slants create strange hues , and there 's a chill in the air . Robert Plant tells of a woman he was in love with ten years ago ( so 1965 - ish ? ) , a few years before Led Zeppelin formed . She gave him an ultimatum : her or the music . Jimmy Page patched the musical ideas together . The song goes through a number of variations . After the first 0:30 , a second part comes in with a descending chord sequence , like A - G - D - Dm . The intro sequence then comes back in at 1:01 and Robert waxes nostalgic starting at 1:16 : Then as it was , then again it will be And though the course may change sometimes Rivers always reach the sea \n\n John Bonham thunders in at 1:34 ... building on to the repeated second part of the intro , and we continue along into the next verse . At 2:30 we head into the middle section . Jimmy 's guitar rises up out of the mist and it 's like the sun has come out and everything sparkles and shines . Robert gains strength from this and expresses his bitter feelings of regret : \n\n Did you ever really need somebody And really need 'em bad \n\n At 3:47 Jimmy leads us across a field and we head back in among the trees at 4:10 . Now , though , the sun filters down through the branches and Robert remarks that even though much time has passed \n\n We are eagles of one nest The nest is in our soul \n\n There will always be a special bond that they shared . At 5:03 , Robert turns reflective again ; the face of his lost love still appears in his dreams . He cries out at the end that the memories are still there . He still cherishes them , holdin ' on , ten years gone . The music surrounds and comforts him like protective spirits .","summary":"OCT 27","unixReviewTime":1497312000,"image":null}

Its a great song to play when you are running low on energy and need to keep going . Yeah , the lyrics are kind of dirty , but they are just words . Based on the amount of music they sell , it 's obvious that 90 % of the people who say they do n't buy their songs , actually do . Its a great song , with a great sound and I play it a lot .

The singer eloquently expresses how a persons words can greatly hurt based on how much they meant to you . I can relate to this song all too well due to my reluctant acceptance to come to terms with being the black sheep \/ oddball of my family ( I only finally accepted being the family black sheep a month ago instead of perpetually fighting against it ) . Fortunately , some family members do accept me , however I now embrace that others may never get me or like me regardless of what I do or say ( such as my adoptive father ) . However , instead of feeling sorry for myself , I take it as a positive lesson why I must continue to live independently and reside in the location I feel is best for my husband and I ( regardless of what both family members and strangers to me may say ) . For You by Staind brilliantly professes the heavy emotion that one can feel around the heavy task of not letting frequent and continual verbal attacks and\/or social exclusion penetrate ones emotional \/ psychological armor . For You by Staind is also a meaningful rock song .","summary":"The  Impact of A Persons Words and Treatment Towards Others","unixReviewTime":1408665600,"image":null}

Like so many other kids who grew up in the 1960 's I was completely captivated by the Motown sound while the real afficianados of soul music were groovin ' to the sounds of James Brown and Wilson Pickett . Wilson Pickett was a consummate pro who put his heart and soul into every song he ever recorded . Most observers would agree that it was Cropper who was largely responsible for launching Wilson 's highly successful solo career at Atlantic . Over the next couple of years they would collaborate on memorable tunes like \" 634 - 5789 \" and \" Ninety Nine and One Half \" . Another fabulous tune from this period was the 1965 hit \" In the Midnight Hour ' which was a monster R&B hit and peaked at # 21 on the pop charts . This was the \" Wicked Pickett \" at his absolute best .","summary":"One of the most memorable recordings from this Rock & Roll Hall of Famer.","unixReviewTime":1467158400,"image":null}

It seems that more and more record labels are choosing NOT to include digital downloads with vinyl purchases which I think is absolutely unacceptable given that the cost of the album on vinyl is usually more than * double * that of a CD or straight digital download , and because recording a vinyl to digital format is a bit of a pain when compared to ripping a CD . I was happy years ago when more and more labels began offering digital downloads with the purchase of a record , but that seems to have changed with the popularity of vinyl again increasing steadily . When you factor in that the cost of vinyl has been increasing right along with that popularity with no added benefits other than the label receiving more money then I get angry . Of the past 4 albums I 've purchased , 3 have not included a digital tracks from lables Shanachie Entertainment , Not Now Music , and even freaking RCA . Not Now Music should offer a digital download and I\"ll revise my review to reflect the album rather than what I did not receive . I 'm just tired of this and will simply resort to streaming or pirating album releases that do n't provide what has become expected and standard in the past decade , simple as that . If hosting and bandwidth resources are at the crux of these cutbacks then just include a simple paper - sleeved CD instead as some labels have done for quite a while . And , if that is still too much cost , forgo the \" fashionable \" heavy weight , double LP release for a simple , more cost - effective single LP release . Double LP , 120 g albums are almost always unnecessary anyway and take up too much space on my shelf let alone having to flip the record twice as often . Here ends my rant . I 'm not going to buy albums at these prices any longer if this is the direction we 're heading . At double or TRIPLE the price of a CD , digital tracks are nothing but a courtesy . ORIGINAL REVIEW : Near Perfection - One of my favorite collections in any genre , from any artist . The 3 LP vinyl is gorgeous and masterfully done . Whoever rated this one star for not being a ' live ' album should be banned from Amazon .","summary":"Excellent Album but NO DIGITAL DOWNLOAD WITH NEW VINYL IS UNACCEPTABLE","unixReviewTime":1471132800,"image":null}

It plumb eluded me for decades , having the single version on various artist records and CD 's and recently replacing my few vinyl albums with the ESSENTIALS collection from Rhino , very well remastered . But I still missed the long album version and finally , easy as pie ! Download the version digitally and you have a remastered terrific sounding copy to take you back to 1968 ! Now I 'm considering buying the rest of the album just for nostalgia , you can burn your own CD this way ( I 've done it with quite a few hard to find items now and Amazon gets total kudos from me in that department ) . This song and this version is a national treasure of the psychedelic 60 's and if you are only familiar with the single version from radio days , try this out , it 's a buck and a quarter well spent . The relaxing almost Hawaiian guitar instrumentals that caress you up to the wah - wah'd processed vocals at the end are a beautiful side trip from the cut and edited single version .","summary":"THE Crimson & Clover","unixReviewTime":1506470400,"image":null}

I have never cared for the singles so much as the album versions of their songs , so this is the best way to do that . Yes I had quite a few LP 's from DM but for the most part I ended up recording audio cassettes of my favorite tracks in the order I liked them , save the Violator album . Amazon makes doing this easy and the quality of these digital tracks are perfection . Usually album - oriented , this is somewhat against my usual grain , but in the cases such as this , where a handful of songs will suffice , you ca n't argue with the price !","summary":"YOUR OWN Personal Jesus","unixReviewTime":1506470400,"image":null}
